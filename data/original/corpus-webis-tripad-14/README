The json-files in this corpus follow the following key-value scheme. 
Please note that if information was not available for a review, it has been omitted instead of initialized to a default value.  This has to be considered when parsing the files.
Please also note, that we do not ensure the order in which information is presented other than semantic coherence. 
Elements surrounded by [] can repeat for a file.
