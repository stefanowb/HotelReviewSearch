It is located just off the I8 Freeway and you can get into Sea World, San Diego City and Balboa Park very easily and quickly. The room itself was slightly small but had a separate bedroom. The condition of the room was good with clean bathroom and small kitchen. Also included is Continental Breakfast comprising fruits, cereals, toast, bagels and pastries. Good start to the day. Hotel also has heated pool and spa which kids enjoyed. Across the road is a shopping centre which you can walk to. Heaps of restaurants on the immediate area. Recommended and would stay again.", "title": "Great Hotel for Families", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Biddleonia", "date": "April 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7285916}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 36, "average": 56, "very good": 105, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 103}, "aka": "La Quinta Inn San Diego - Mission Valley Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.42962962963}
