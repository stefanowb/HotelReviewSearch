I can go on and on about the all the x-tras they have--nice plasma tv, BBQ, a leather couch, but none of that compares to the warm and inviting owner and staff. We arrived a little on the late side, but they were waiting for us (they told us our cabin ahead of time and said it would be open just in case our flight was delayed) and quickly checked us in. Both Jon (the owner) and Dave were very friendly from the start. Our second night there, we saw both men by the bonfire and decided to head down and hear some stories. What a great night.
