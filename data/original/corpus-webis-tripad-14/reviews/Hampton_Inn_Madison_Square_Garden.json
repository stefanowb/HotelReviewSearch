The subway is located at Penn Station as well for easy access to downtown and South Street Seaport. Continental breakfast was more than adequate. Plenty of seating, even a small outside patio which we couldn't use because it was raining. While the room was small, this is pretty standard for NYC hotels. Beds were very comfortable for us. Bathroom very clean. We asked for a room on an upper floor, towards the back for quietness. Had a fabulous view as well.
