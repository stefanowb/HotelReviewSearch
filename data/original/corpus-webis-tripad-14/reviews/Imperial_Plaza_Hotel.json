I shared a room with my 2 daughters, and my cousin had a room by himself. Within hours our aircon had stopped working, I reported to reception and they seems uninterested with the problem then said they would send someone up to look at it, they sent up the guy that carried out cases up (as they say jack of all trades master of none) he did everything we had done and told me to give it 15mins - we decided to pop out to shop which was not open... came back and air con was still not working and went back to reception and told them it still was not working and demanded another room, which I eventually got and it was bigger. As you can imagine we were now all very hungry and was told food was being served in the roof restaurant but that was limited but filled the gap - we were told the dinner was from 8-10pm so was looking forward to that. We got ready for the great meal walked towards the large dinning room which was totally dark and then went back to reception and they instructed us to door next to dinning room very small with about 6 tables. There was another couple just about to finish their evening meal. The waiter showed us to our table then placed cutlery as we sat down then disappeared (I was eagerly waiting for a menu) he appeared 15mins later with a starter of salad eg boiled eggs/carrots/lettuce/anchovies etc which was smothered with a type of 'Daddy's sauce/balsamic vinegar. My eldest daughter (23yrs) and cousin ate but myself and my 11yr old daughter could not eat. I was totally disgusted that we had not even been given a menu - then came out the main meal, chicken (similar to chicken kebab) served with uncooked oversalted rice, we all sat there amazed at the sheer down right BAD service and food, the waiter came in and saw we had not eaten alot and asked 'what is your problem' we told him that the rice is raw and salty and they we should be told in advance what is on offer at dinner timesat and I also told him that there should not be cats walking around us whilst we eat, he 'chased the cat out, he replied he is sorry but its up to the chef and they are never informed either before dinner, he came back with dessert of melon which was refreshing and our only real food of the night. He came out and seems quite embarrassed and said had asked the chef and they would be serving 'Moroccan Tagine' the next night , I asked if they could serve chips for my daughter and he said that will be fine. The next day we visited the 'soukes' and Jardin botantical gardens which was nice in the 41 degree heat.As it was Ramadam no restaurants served food till after 8:30pm (Mc Donalds and KFC were opened) again got ready for evening meal went down at 8:30pm to find the small dining room closed went to reception they said because of Ramadam food will not be served till 9:30pm and they seemed totally uninterested at our disgust. We started walking (half hour to nearest shops) to look for somewhere to eat we found a great Italian/Moroccan restaurant which was great the owner used to own a restaurant in Brighton. We had our evening meal there for the reminder of our stay. On our last day thought we'd just hang out round the pool and have our snack there like we did on our 1st day, the pool and our room was the best thing about the hotel. We decided to order chips for 12'ish the waiter said he was sorry but we would have to wait until 1pm - no worries thought.... went back to order at 1pm to be told that they could not serve chips on their own, only with a burger, I said ok then he came back and said that they had ran out of Chips and could only serve 'crisps'. We ended up going to shop next to Hotel and buying pringles and a bottle of coke and chocolate to keep us going till our Italian/Moroccan restaurant opened at 6.30pm.", "title": "Please AVOID this HOTEL at ALL costs", "user": "Jazifizzle", "date": "July 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 135727618}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012", "text": "We also had problems with our phone ringing at random times and up to 11pm at night- we unplugged it, on one occassion the phone rang and the person on the other end said they were engineers I assumed it had something to do with our aircon not working so had a conversation the the engineer asked me to meet him at the reception, I went down leaving my 2 daughters in our room and asked the lady on the reception were the engineer was who had called me down she said there was no engineer and no one had called me she checked our room and obviously my daughter answered she said it was most likely a wrong number but I actually think there could be some sort of Scam going on there so be careful as you go to reception someone could be on their way to your room ....... ~Breakfast was disgusting ............ never again my worst nightmare would be to be stuck there .........", "title": "Only with a deal & never again", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "str_etch2012", "date": "July 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 135675147}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I booked this hotel through Groupon & thought my research was good enough however forgot to check tripadvisor!", "title": "Poorest Hotel I have ever stayed in", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Ken C", "date": "July 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 135597407}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Arriving into the country I had organised a pick up through the hotel for \u20ac20 but the hotel had to be called by a helpful man at the airport as they hadn't appeared after nearly an hour. (On our way back to the airport we got a taxi from outside for 60 Dirhams, nearly \u00a35 instead of \u00a315 through the hotel.). Booking in took a while as the young male who did it seemed uninterested & unhelpful. The hotel seemed to want to add extra money at every opportunity including paying for the safe which had never been mentioned. Our room phone didn't work and we only had one light in the bathroom and even after we reported the issues they were never solved. Breakfast was ok although the flies & cats were still there, as mentioned in other reviews. The last, highly amusing point is about the spa facilities ... never have I visited such a poor spa; a sauna for one which didn't heat up enough, a cold hydro massage (think cold Jacuzzi) and a DIY hamman (luckily I've had a proper one in Turkey to realise it's not the norm).", "title": "Women are 2nd class!", "user": "badluck3", "date": "July 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 135041788}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The food was overpriced at the pool bar & there was little choice but did taste good and was quick to arrive.

I spent 4 nights at this hotel during the first week of September. It wasn't a good start with the hotel driver being almost 1hr late but we were well received at the hotel and the room was decent. the staff are friendly in their own way and the relationship manager nadia gave some very good advice about Marrakesh, although she was slightly aggressive. The breakfast was OK, not of 4 star standard, but the pastries were good. Wifi was disappointing as the signal only worked properly in the reception. The hotel also had some spa facilities but these were in desperate need of a clean, especially the Jacuzzi, but the views from the roof were great.

Given that a lot of people had rated this hotel as reasonable/good on here (admittedly some bad reviews also) I thought it might be ok, but how anyone could give this hotel a good review ill never know. It was the worst place ive ever stayed! Despite emailing (and receiving confirmation) to say we wanted an extra night/person this had not been communicated. Reception were abrupt, not welcoming and disinterested. Each day there were insufficient towels and we had to walk downstairs (we darent take the lift due to the worrying noises it made) three times on one occasion before we received more- on one occasion we simply got our own as we located the store. We were asked on one occasion to wait twenty minutes for someone to bring a towel (we refused). The food was disgusting- the milk was off, bread stale, eggs black. Hideous. The hairdryer in our bathroom had bare wires showing and was right next to the shower- at one point I could smell burning. The breakfast room was dark and stuffy. The air conditioning in the room was terrible which made it difficult to sleep as it was 36 degrees.", "title": "Truly awful food and service", "user": "jolizpreston", "date": "September 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 140841092}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled solo", "text": "The only good thing about this place was the pool on the rooftop.", "title": "WORST Hotel I've EVER stayed in - DREADFUL", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jenw83s", "date": "September 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 140165207}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I would never stay here again and advise nobody to go.", "title": "Mixed bag", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WolfyP", "date": "August 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137608104}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Having visited over 200 cities around the world - some big, some small, first world and third world, and stayed in Hotels and hostels - this was the WORST.", "title": "what's the fuss all about?", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "John A", "date": "July 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 135834436}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "First impression of the hotel - shabby !", "title": "Nice old hotel - needs some tlc", "user": "goldma", "date": "December 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 147752270}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "As others said, reception dull and aquarium dirty, only one poor surviving fish !
