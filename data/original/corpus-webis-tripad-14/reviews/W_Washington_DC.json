It tries very hard to be a hip locale - and I think it succeeds. It's very modern from the lobby to the rooms. Our room was on the 10th floor and we had an excellent view of the city. I also liked the Bliss bath products they provided. HOWEVER, our superb view did not make up for the fact that we had to endure listening to the music and incessant drum beat coming from the 11th floor bar until midnight each night and 3 a.m. on Friday. Ear plugs were provided - but they did nothing to keep out the noise. Plus we were near the elevators and we could hear the dinging each time a car arrived (not to mention people talking). Lastly, our phone kept beeping - we finally had to take out the battery. We complained about the phone and the bar noise and the receptionist was eager to say they'd fix it - but nothing improved. If you stay here - unless you're a young bar-goer, stay out late or a heavy sleeper - I suggest asks for a lower room, away from the elevators.", "title": "Lot of Pomp but lacks service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Zupiedog", "date": "July 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 169181444}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013", "text": "The W might just be the coolest place I've ever stayed.
