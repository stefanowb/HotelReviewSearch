I must say that the overall property, grounds, and the room itself {#36} were amazingly clean. Very clean. There is a large, safe parking lot, with parking spots for each room. The motel's coffeeshop is very cozy and inviting looking and serves breakfast for those that are interested. We missed out. I feel that they could take in a lot of outside business and maximize their \"city ledger\" sales by advertising more. The coffee shop is relatively small but very cute and functionable. There is a vending area and a gathering room, in which coffee and tea are complimentary from 630-930 every evening. The Gathering Room has games to play, books and newspapers to read, and a lot of information about the Amish nicely arranged to look at. Garden Spot is centrally located to the Amish and to the outlets for shopping, as well as close by to other attractions. Although the establishment is situated on Lincoln Highway, the traffic noise was minimal. Once inside the room, it was extremely quiet and peaceful. Outside night time light was minimal and the room was very dark, which makes for great sleeping conditions. The sheets were very soft and made of good material, although the beds were extremely hard and the pillows were very thin. I was really hurting the following morning. I also feel that new blankets and covers should be ordered immediately because they are pretty rough. That really totally sucks because overall, it would of been a nice stay. Each room offers cold A/C, a hairdryer, and an iron, excellent tv and a nice table and two chairs. Nice looking furniture as well. Aside from the bathroom, the room was overall decorated with theme and charm in mind. There wasn't a frig in our room however I am not sure about the other rooms. The bathrooms were immaculate and very clean. Nice soft towels and plenty of them. The tub/shower offers a nice little touch.....Eurobath, which is foam that works for shampoo/body. Smells very nice and works easier than slippery soap. I will go back to stay again, considering the fact that the bedding situation becomes better. Much better. They have a nice little business and lodging establishment to offer. Rates are reasonably priced considering it is still \"in season\". Personally if I had the place, I'd get better beds/bedding for the rooms and then up the rates a dollar or two per night to cover the expenses if I had to. And as a customer, I'd pay a few dollars more a night to stay if the bedding situation was in fact better. Within a short amount of time, it'd pay for itself and business would probably dramatically increase by the advertisement of new beds.", "title": "Nice Play", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "hollsy", "date": "September 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 19913768, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 price, cleaniness, staff", "disliked": "\u2014 beds and bedding"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Nice, very clean little room!
