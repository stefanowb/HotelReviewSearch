If you plan to just stay in the hotel and happy to pay for on location restaurants, it would be a pleasant place to stay. It is not within walking distance of a subway, but the hotel provides a free shuttle bus service that takes you to one of 2 different subway lines. I've stayed at 5 of the 5 star hotels in Seoul and this hotel costs less to stay in. The professionalism of the service is not at the level of the Westin Chosun or Radisson Plaza.", "title": "Scenic Setting, but inconvenient location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Heng", "date": "October 30, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4072367}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Trapped!", "text": "We looked at the pictures on the web and the rooms looked great. Even though we were on a business trip, we always want to see the sights and maybe pick up a few souveniers for family and friends. We arrived to an area where the hotel is in the older section of Seoul and is set up on a hill far away from any other restaurant or shopping area. Only way to get to center of town is to take a VERY EXPENSIVE taxi ride. So, we thought, we'll make the best of it here. They have a pool, gym, stores here, and a few good restaurants on the premises. Well, as it turns out, the outdoor pool is closed in May. The indoor pool is down in the basement, below the lower shopping level, and is not even marked with signage. The water looked green and no one was in it, although I can't blame them. We were told that even thought we were guests of the hotel, we had to pay $14.00 to get into the pool. Can you imagine??? The gym is also in the basement and has the look of a compound rather than a gym. The beauty parlor for massages had a dirty floor and was very cluttered and unkept. So, we'll shop at the stores, I thought. Well, unless you have unlimited funds, forget it. And absolutely no traditional Korean souveniers were available at the stores. Our room was very tiny and the bathroom was very dark and small. No drawers to place your clothes!!! Sheraton needs to take their name off of this property, as it is definitely not up to Sheraton standards.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "citcfx", "date": "May 9, 2005", "id": 3450491}], "location": {"country": "South Korea", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 18, "average": 57, "very good": 166, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 58}, "aka": "Sheraton Grande Walkerhill Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.212987012987}
