Can't complain about the location or the cleanliness of the hotel, and the staff were friendly and courteous - but this is never four star; there are too many basics that are not available. My room was decorated like a corridor; it had no aircon or ironing facilities; the wardrobe amounted to a bar with coat-hangers above the television; there was no stationary or proper drawers for clothes. On the day I left, I had to keep the room until my check-out time (12.00) because there was no concierge service - the only hotel I've ever known not to have some kind of room to keep your cases. When I got back to my room at 11.30, my card no longer opened the door - I had to go back to the reception to ask to retrieve my case. The hotel is serviced by two tiny lifts, so there's a lot of waiting around. And finally, it's almost impossible to get coffee or orange juice at breakfast after 9.00.", "title": "Two star at best", "user": "G-Swike", "date": "September 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 78950570}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled solo", "text": "All individually minor faults, as a combination not something to mar my trip.

It wasn't the newest of hotels, but the rooms were very clean, the linen crisp, the staff exceptionally helpful and friendly and the morning breakfasts (7am - 10.30am) not lacking in refills. What made it a good family hotel is its location. When you've spent a day out sightseeing, you appreciate a hotel that's literally about 30-40meters from the 'Main' Hauptbahnhof station. It's about a 20 minute walk to the Marienplatz. If you take a taxi to the Marienplatz its 10 Euros. The hop-on, hop-off buses (18 Euros pp) were just a 10 minute walk away from the hotel. Note that there are about a dozen hotels all along the Arnulfstrasse area - some look nicer than others. In retrospect, we have absolutely no regrets staying at the Regent and would do so again.

Our biggest gripe was the fact that the heating in our room was stuck on full 24 hours a day, so we were sweltering even with the windows wide open - and bearing in mind it was well below 0 degrees at night outside. We asked this to be rectified but nothing happened. To be fair the 2 broken lightbulbs in our companions' room were quickly replaced, but they should really have been checked when preparing the room. The general malaise was reflected in the albeit trivial fact that the breakfast toaster was only 1/2 working throughout our visit, a source of no apparent concern to the staff - rather than a reason to buy another one or get it repaired quickly.
