Also had a meal in the hotel restaraunt \"Bachus\" which was excellent, i'd recommend going for a meal even if your not staying at the hotel, great food in elegant surroundings. All in all a very enjoyable stay in a hotel that has the peresonal touch.

We were on the left side of the buidling, and despite previous requests to have a room facing the art gallery, our veiw was of the Sheraton across the alley. The staff was generally friendly. Cameron, the bellhop, was always recommending great places to go or eat at. (Cameron recommended The Blue Water Cafe. It's a great restaurant which I also highlyrecommed. It's expensive, but you really get what you pay for.) The people at the front desk were always smiling, with the exception of one man, who we kept having to remind to bring the mini-bed up to our room, and would sometimes would \"forget\" to smile.
