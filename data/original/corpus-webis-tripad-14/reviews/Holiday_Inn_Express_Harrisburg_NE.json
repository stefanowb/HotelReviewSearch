However, this one was a little different. It was brand new, very modern and still had that \"new car smell\". Hopefully Trip Advisor or Holiday Inn staff will move to erase all of these terrible reviews because they are dated and meant for the Comfort Inn that once stood. Regardless, stay here and you will see for yourself...it is worth every penny. I called around noon to see if it was possible to get my room ready early, front desk staff Rick was very nice and said he would do everything in his power to make sure our room was ready. Once we arrived, Rick greeted me at the front desk and said \"we have your room ready sir\". Awesome! Thanks Rick~! And thanks to the nice Asian lady who hooked us up with a crib at the last minute (w/ sheets and blanket). This hotel is located right off I-81 on Highway 39.
