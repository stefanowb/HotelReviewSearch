The rooms are large but nothing overly special or updated. The main thing we loved was that the place was clean, the front desk staff was friendly and helpful, we had breakfast included every morning and it was completely reasonably priced. Port Macquarie is a beautiful town that everyone should visit - even for just a day. We loved our time there and at our hotel. Don't expect anything stunning, it's just simple and clean and well looked after. If you're in Port Macquire for a short stay I highly recommend checking out this hotel.", "title": "Awesome Deal", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Janesse", "date": "March 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 26505883}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We paid AUD99/night which came with continental room service breakfast.
