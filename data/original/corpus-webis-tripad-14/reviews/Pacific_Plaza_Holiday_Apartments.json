It was a great location and had a beautifuuly view of the beach, it was close to surfers but far enough! Waking up in the morning to the sound of the waves crashing on the beach was beautiful and the room was furnished lovely with everything you could possibly need for a self contained apartment. We hope to get there again as it was so peaceful and relaxing", "title": "We will be back!!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "excited05", "date": "May 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5022796}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 1, "very good": 5, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 7}, "aka": "Pacific Plaza Holiday Apartments Hotel Surfers Paradise", "slim_ranking": 0.769230769231}
