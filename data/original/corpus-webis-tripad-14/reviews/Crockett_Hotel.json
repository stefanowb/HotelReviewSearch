Having stayed there many times before for both business and pleasure, I was already familiar with their service, amenities, and great location. But this time, they were over the top! From the first phone call to the last day of our party (months later), the entire staff at the Crockett was exceptional. They are the friendliest, most accommodating group in San Antonio (and I've stayed at dozens of other hotels in San Antonio in the past). Shirley (sales) went out of her way to show me all the rooms available and handled all our reservations personally. Eduardo and Oralia (front desk) were always smiling and went way above and beyond to accommodate all our needs and requests. Alphonso (security) found our forgotten stereo and locked it up safely until we returned. Gil and Daniel (valet) were also extremely helpful with baggage, cars, transportation, and just about anything else we needed. Margaret (office) was always there to assist and provided invaluable suggestions about our set-up and arrangements. Everything was perfect. I really can't thank them enough for making our long weekend event a truly memorable experience. The free continental breakfast is much better than anywhere else, the drinks at the bar are good (and the long happy hour has excellent prices). The location of the Crockett is the best one in town. It's right behind the Alamo and within walking distance of all the downtown attractions. The San Antonio Trolley is just across the street and the CVB is a block away, so you are in the center of everything. And finally, the Crockett is a little slice of San Antonio history - over 100 years old (great old photos on the lobby walls), yet modern, spotlessly clean and completely comfortable - it felt like we were staying with friends. If you want a great view and a spacious suite, ask for room 202 - where LBJ and Lady Bird stayed when in San Antonio.

I was there on business and my bride was with me. Until this trip, I loved The Crockett Hotel. What, you ask, could have so soured me on a venue I was so enamored with? Let me elaborate. I had finished the business portion of my stay and my wife and I were now going to enjoy San Antonio on a personal level. Keep this bit of information in the back of your mind, Texas has really large cockroaches and we had seen them outside the Hotel (which was ok) and also in the elevator twice (which was not ok). The third morning of our stay, we get up and prepared to do sight seeing in this gorgeous town. I'm up and dressed. My wife is in the bathroom getting ready. I go around the corner to make a cup of coffee when I hear a blood curdling scream. At first, I thought she may have shocked herself in the bathroom. As I ran around the corner, I see the item that has so elevated the decibels in the room. There was one of those really large cockroaches on my wife's pillow. As you may have guessed, my wife is deathly afraid of bugs, and cokroaches are one of the worst. I do what any good spouse does, I go in the bathroom, grab a bunch of toilet paper and catch him. This is where the luster quickly comes off the Crockett for me. We finished getting ready and go down to the desk, cockroach in hand. I tell the young lady at the desk the scenario we just experienced and she was mortified (she told us she too was scared to death of those things).

The location is perfect and the hotel has amazing historic energy!!! The Crockett Hotel and Menger Hotel are owned by the same people. The rooms are larger at the Crockett. I read several reviews that said the Crockett was noisy, but our room was right above the bar and lobby and was much more quiet than some 5-star hotels that we've stayed at. I can't imagine paying $100 a night for a room, located within walking distance of the Riverwalk, with the cleanliness and atmosphere of the Crockett and writing a bad review. We had planned to stay at a bed and breakfast, but there was not availability...but we are so happy we stumbled upon the Crockett.

I want to say only good things... But we were fairly dissapionted in our recent stay. The room was awesome-large, clean, etc... But so many small things were just not up to par. Check-in was difficult- we had requested a mini fridge (which was in the room, no problem there). When given the total for our stay, I SPECIFICALLY asked the desk staff if the total included cost for fridge... Yes, I was told... Card was processed, then I was told that she wasn't sure if fridge was included or not, so she needed to re-run my card for fridge- then I should check my records... & if I was overcharged, I should contact them to fix it later... REALLY?!? You can't tell if I've been charged the right amount- that's kind of your job, isn't it?!? Also, they did not provide us with enough breakfast tickets... Ironically, the day we ran out of tickets, our door keys quit working. We figured that she must have gotten our check-out date wrong in the system (even though we were charged for the correct amount of nights!)... When having to re-key our cards, it was an over 20 minute wait, due to the line in front of us... NOT a good experience- the bar was still nice, breakfast has gone downhill in quality from last year (I know that breakfast is a difficult thing to do, but really- warm milk & cottage cheese- we were afraid to ingest them, actually...but they did try, & a free morning meal is nice-)... Pool area was still enjoyable, but busy (NOT the hotel's fault)- could have been cleaner, & there were unattended, underaged children there many times... Again, not really the hotel's fault, but- if you have rules posted & guests inform you that the rules are being broken... MORE THAN ONCE- why is nothing done?!? We returned to the Crockett because we have had GREAT, OUTSTANDING service & stays in the past. We were REALLY looking forward to a nice, relaxing stay while on vacation... If this had been my 1st stay here, I would NOT be coming back... As it stands, we will prob give them one more chance. Maybe we just caught them at a bad time...
