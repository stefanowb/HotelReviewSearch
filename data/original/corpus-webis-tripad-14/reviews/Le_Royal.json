I espeicially picked this hotel for its location on the Promenade des Anglais. 3 Star hotel at a reasonable price for the location. It was my last day in France and I arrived in Nice alone to be told by the hotel \"Sorry your room is not available due to water damage\". \"We are full and have no more rooms\". They said they recommended another hotel one block behind as they still have rooms available. I told them I had come all the way from Australia, Im alone and wanted this hotel as a treat to myself for my 40th birthday. It was all about the location. I told them I would take the room as it is. They said \"Sorry there is nothing we can do we are full\". I asked for a Manager. I was told \"There is no manager\". I went to look at the other hotel a small hotel a block behind. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. I told Le Royal hotel about my disappointment. And still, they could do nothing. I must have sat there for one hour and saw other customers arriving much later than me from the airport etc.. and they were given rooms! Why not me? I asked them this question and they could not answer. An honest answer would have been nice. I had wasted my whole evening talking and waiting for my room that just was not given to me. I felt like a criminal, or that I had done something wrong. I, the customer, who had a booking, felt very unwelcome and then left as they were not providing me with a room. I was terribly upset, embarassed and disappointed at they way I was treated. This ruined my night in Nice. I phoned the next day to speak to the manager, I was told \"The Manager is not available\".", "title": "Never Again!!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "kittycat2706", "date": "August 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0}, "id": 116776937}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed for one night, but reminded me of an Victorian English seaside hotel.
