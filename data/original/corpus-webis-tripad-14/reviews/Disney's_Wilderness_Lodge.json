The hotel was magnificent and the staff couldn't have been nicer! I was concerned when we went to our room (6052) and it looked over the loading dock area (if you looked straight down). However, looking out toward the park, we were facing Magic Kingdom and could watch the fireworks from our room every night!! It seems there is always a silver lining at Disney! We were traveling with our 5 yr old grandson and found the room to be set up well for a family. The restaurant, Roaring Forks was the most ideal restaurant I've used in any hotel at Disney! Great food choices for every meal and the ease of being able to come and go at your own pace, due to it's self-serve nature.

There are lit fireplaces on almost every floor with sitting areas for reading or watching TV outside your room. Somehow we got assigned to the 7th floor instead of our reserved courtyard view, but it turned out to be a bonus since we could watch the Magic Kingdom fireworks from our balcony, plus there is private concierge service and snacks provided by the Old Faithful Club - an all day snacking kitchen! Morning offers a free help yourself breakfast (with a pretty good selection), lunch and evenings offers other snacks including fruits, homemade cookies & milk, finger sandwiches and a small selection of wines, liquors, and alcohol - there's also a good quality coffee/cappaccino/espresso machine. The hotel has a bubbling spring just inside which runs to the outside and down the outside walkways amidst the generously landscaped grouds (Silver Creek Falls) until it turns into a large waterfall and empties into the pool, which is very inviting and with a nice slide for the kids. Just past the hot tubs is their Fire Rock geyser, which erupts every hour. We didn't use the pool bar (Trout Pass), but we enjoyed the Bay Lake beach and you can enjoy the nightly lights/musical parade sail by every evening. Their resterants are all good, with Whispering Canyon Cafe offering home-cooked meals at a reasonable price and the waiters provide entertainment and games; the highest priced is Artist Point - good food with smaller portions, not sure it's really worth the money (although the service was pretty good). but it was nice to try; the median priced resterant is Roaring Fork. The hotel has an excellent gift shop with a groceries selection, too. This hotel is also one of the few that has constant ferry service directly to the Magic Kingdom and is for hotel guest use only (comes in very handy after a long day in the park when you want to bypass most of the crowds to return to the hotel). Arcade, bike/boat rentals, hiking trails, premium fitness center, etc. This hotel also offers onsite airline check in and baggage check. We enjoy this hotel so much we skip the parks some nights and just stay at the lodge. Would recommend to most everyone if you have $300+/night to spend on accomodations.", "title": "Great week at Wilderness Lodge", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "jmhmom", "date": "June 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17185197, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and pool area, hotel was very quiet at night", "disliked": "\u2014 Counter service selections for breakfast...needs more variety"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We really enjoyed our stay at the Wilderness Lodge. In years previous, we had stayed at the Polynesian, which we also enjoyed; however, the Wilderness Lodge was cheaper and just as good. We had a standard room, but were pleasantly surprised to have a peaceful view of the woods, with the lake in the background. The rooms are rather standard size, but you're not in the room that much anyway, so the size was not that important. Everything was very clean. We liked the fact that we could take a boat to the Magic Kingdom as an option. From there, we could connect to the Monorail to go to Epcot. The buses also ran fairly often from the Wilderness. We never had to wait over 10 minutes. The pool area was very inviting and has a small slide and two hot tubs. The people who worked at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. When we checked in, we were also pleasantly surprised to find out that access to the concierge floor was included in our stay. This saved us quite a bit of money since we ate our breakfast there every morning and there was enough food in the evening to make a light meal, which we did one night when we came back from the parks early for a break.", "title": "Pleasant Stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "bearmom53", "date": "June 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 17092003, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Convenience and atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Price"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We used the Disney Magical Express and checked our bags all the way to the hotel.
