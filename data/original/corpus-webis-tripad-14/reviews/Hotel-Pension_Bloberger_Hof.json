The best features of Bloberger Hof are its location in a quiet, serene, residential neighborhood, its excellent ground floor restaurant, and the large, comfortable room. We had a rental car so did not try the bus transportation into Altstadt (Old City). By car, it was an easy 10 minute drive to the Altstadt parking lot. It was also easy to access the A10 for the Eisriesenwelt Ice Caves, Hohenwerfen Castle, Golling Waterfalls, Konigssee, and Obersalzberg. We received a recommendation from the hotel to visit Gut Aiderbichl animal sanctuary, 20 minutes by car from Salzburg. It was not in any of the guide books but turned out to be one of the highlights of our stay.

We mourned when we had to leave for Mittenwald, and cursed that we hadn't booked at least one more night in Salzburg!
