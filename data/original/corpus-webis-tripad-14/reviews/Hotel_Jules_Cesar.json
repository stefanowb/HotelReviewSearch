It's not particularly small and it's not luxury. What it is is a reasonable 3 star hotel in a good location on a main boulevard in Arles and only 5 minutes stroll to the main Roman remains which are definitely worth the visit to Arles. The hotel was clearly last refurbished c1970 and whilst the room and bathroom were spacious, quiet and clean they are definitely old fashioned. The public rooms are elaborately furnished, the service is generally very good with the valet parking particularly efficient. Prices are high given the property and its provincial France location - \u20ac300 for a superior room and \u20ac20pp for breakfast seems a little excessive. One benefit it also has is a pleasant pool to relax in after the heat of the roman ruins.", "title": "Just OK", "user": "Rover10", "date": "September 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 140169028}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Whatever you do however, ensure that you have insect repellent for an evening out (the hotel interior is fine) but an outdoor restaurant at night invites attack from the aggressive Rhone delta mosquitoes.", "title": "Adequate", "user": "toasty754", "date": "August 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 138079822}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Can't say anything really bad about Jules Cesar but then again there's nothing great to report either.", "title": "Very average hotel", "user": "JTMCOOLS10", "date": "August 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 136966891}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "On my bucket list", "text": "On the positive side - it was easy to find and in a good position to explore the town.", "user": "Tassels57", "date": "August 7, 2012", "id": 136530387}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled solo", "text": "The staff were all welcoming, friendly and helpful and spoke good English.", "title": "Great stay.

All his bottles for that year were similarly darker. We agreed it still tasted god but just not the expected taste which the second bottle was. he will recommend the sweeter wine for the foie gras.
