Last year I stayed at Maksoud Plaza and it was nice, but overpriced. Prior to that I stayed at Crowne Plaza which is closed now. My Deluxe room was good size, very clean, comfortable and well maintained. The rate includes breakfast, which was of good quality and had many choices, including Japanese breakfast. The fitness center was one of the best I've seen in Brazil with numerous machines and free weights. I prefer the Paulista area because I can walk around day and night, something you can't do in most of Sao Paolo. I was impressed that this trip there were plenty of police around at night, and I walked to/from dinner. In past trips, I took a taxi on the return.", "title": "Good choice for Av.

After a strong and loud argument the lady at the check-in counter understood that it was not our problem but his. After that everything was ok. Our deluxe room was on the 23rd floor, it had an open city view, a small balcony, a spacious and clean bathroom with all the necessary amenities, a nice sitting area with desk and cosy furnishings, excellent noise-isolation. Breakfast is not excellent but very good. The hotel is located one block off the Avenida Paulista, at a stone-throw from the MASP museum/tube station, and at 15 minutes' walk from the Oscar Freire Street, the top brand shopping street in fashionable Jardins district.
