The head housekeeper said he returned to the room, and also did not see it. Unless it walked away on its own, someone is not telling the truth. I know 100% I left it in room, and in two hours it is gone? We asked for compensation, which manager said she could not do. She said she would take 20% off a future stay for our trouble.

I could see if I came back days later, but this was two hours. The manager sent me an email after I contacted her to follow up on whether the item was found. It included a link to an Amazon listing where I could re-purchase the item which was never found by the hotel.
