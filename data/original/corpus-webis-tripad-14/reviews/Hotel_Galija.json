Location good but I would say you needed to walk into centre to find some good restaurants. I travelled with family inc 3yr old and 75yr old. Food in hotel was good and they also had bar if you wanted a drink, both of which were reasonable priced unlike most hotels. It's also near to a pub/bar sudo Irish with Guiness and TV for sports fans. Staff nice and friendly, secure car parking just up the rd, rooms pleasant. Main downside was TV /SAT didn't work well reported but not sorted. It is also connected to a pizzeria but you can order from the restaurant if you have a mix of dining requirements. Breakfast inc was fine some hot mainly continental. Excellent bread! I needed an extra bed for my 3yr old which was an air bed but fine. Shower needed the hook for the head good enough to feel refreshing without removing your skin. The other big bonus was being in the main building we were just below our room so we could leave 3yr old in bed and finish meal or have a nightcap and not worry. Literally under 30 seconds from room and you could see people coming and going, with only 4/5 rooms there it was fairly quiet.", "title": "Excellent hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Canadian079", "date": "May 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7572627, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Hotel Galija is a gem situated within walking distance of all of the major sights of Pula. It is about twenty minutes walking from both the bus and train stations. Our arrival though was not what we expected. We were given a very small room, so small as to be uncomfortable for the two of us. As well the bathroom smelled. My spouse immediately went back to the reception and they immediately changed our room to a much larger and more comfortable room overlooking the patio area. We were impressed with the immediacy of action by reception. Since we had arrived after the tourist office had closed, reception provided us with everything we needed \u2013 searching on the internet for bus schedules and other important information.

This hotel is hidden on a side street just off the main drag. It is rated a 3 star (sometimes 4 star property), but it is really a 2 star with location going for it. We were housed in their annex accros the street. Our room was small and clean but very basic and a tough climb up three flights with two heavy cases. The beds were tiny and hard and the bathroom had a tub shower with only enough hot water for one guest; a problem when there are two of us! Staff at this hotel are plentiful but they seem to have little interest in the guests; we were never greeted or acknowledged as long as we stayed there. The breakfast provided is \"slim pickings\". A final note; Pula is a very busy town and parking is a problem. You need to be lucky to find a spot on the street near the hotel and lots are tough to find.
