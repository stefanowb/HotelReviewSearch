Actually, we should be keeping it a secret so that it stays quiet, unspoilt and peaceful!! The resort has everything you need for a relaxing getaway -- friendly efficient staff, great meals, idyllic location, and most of all NO CROWDS. In fact, the weekend we were there, we were the ONLY ones on the beach - heaven! Our 2-bedroom beachfront villa, with its sunbathing (or shade) pavillion overlooked the gentle lapping waters of the Gulf of Siam, fringed with palmtrees on the edge of clean sand. Some of the resort area is a little run-down, needs some maintenance attention (esp gardens, interior painting etc), but overall it's a 3-star hotel with a 6-star view!!!! Our six year old loved the horizon pool (she's a good swimmer) and frolicked on the beach and in the sea, even when the waves picked up after an overnight storm. And the adults revelled in the peace and quiet. If only it was a bit closer to BKK (where we are based) we would we would regular guests at Sirarun!!", "title": "Perfect getaway", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TravelTarts", "date": "April 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127162576}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012", "text": "Siarun is a relatively new resort in a very quiet location on a very nice beach", "title": "Lovely quiet resort location for relaxing", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Weldge", "date": "February 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 125220388}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Accommodation very good clean and good value", "title": "Wow!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "aussiemir", "date": "December 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122145672}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Staff very helpful", "title": "This is paradise in a hotel- A must stay hidden jewel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "JJJ31", "date": "October 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119959300}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Prachuap Khiri Khan"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 5, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 11}, "slim_ranking": 0.1, "description": ""}
