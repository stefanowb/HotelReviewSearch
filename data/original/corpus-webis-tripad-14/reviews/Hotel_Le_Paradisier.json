Rooms are very spacious with sea views and the gardens were also very nice. There's a great infinity pool, the food in the restaurant was tasty and the menu changed every day. Staff were also very helpful (although, it helps if you can speak some French - or Malagasy!). We were even offered a discount, because sadly the hotel was totally empty when we stayed, as a result of the recent political upheaval in Madagascar. The only negative is that there is no internet access available, which you would expect when they confirm bookings via a website. This was a bit of a pain because we needed to sort out some flights and the nearest internet access was over 30 mins drive along a very bad road. That aside, this is a lovely hotel and most definitely worth a visit if you're in that part of the world.", "title": "Paradise indeed", "user": "Dom-n-Lin", "date": "September 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 43303527}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great amenities, on the ocean", "text": "Somehow I lucked out and got the honeymoon suite, which was really stunning! Most of the rooms are bungalows and seemed very nice. The suite was about 3 feet from the ocean and had a large tub, hot water, electricity, a flush toiler, a private outdoor shower for post-beach cleaning. The suite also has an in-room safe and a mirror over the bed, as well as a mosquito net.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "DAEsmae", "date": "October 15, 2007", "id": 10083073}], "location": {"country": "Madagascar", "continent": "Africa", "city": "Ifaty"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 11, "very good": 26, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 21}, "slim_ranking": 0.5}
