The hotel is walking distance from old town and many other places, the reception is excellent in service. The residence has everything that one would expect from a nice hotel. The gym was appreciated, the pool was enjoyed by the kids, a big advantage is the full equipped kitchen with washing machine (something that I would enjoy even if I traveled in business). Additional advantages is the well equipped supermarket in the entry level that makes life so much easier as Hanoi isn't really overcrowded with convenient stores. The apartments are really big an nice, wouldn't mind stay here for a couple of months even with family, feels like home. Definatly highly recommendable...don't look at the Hiltons or Sheratons or Sofitels, we checked them and took this instead.

We looked at several other properties including the Sofitel, Movenpik and the Hilton but for sheer location and space the Somerset had the edge. Our rate in June 2011 for a one bedroom apartment was US $95 / night a fraction of the others without compromise on room quality and finish. We cherish space when we travel so separate bedroom , lounge, kitchen and bathroom in an 80sqm apartment is perfect. Its not a hotel, but all amenities are close by including a pool, and a shopping mall with supermarket at the base of the tower. It offers free , high speed wifi throughout the building including the bar. Its a very short walk into the old quarter and close to major attractions. Taxis are reliable and cheap, even if the traffic leaves you perplexed and occasionally anxious. Would recommend this place to travellers who want comfortable accomodation without compromise on quality.

We have been left wondering how this hotel could be number 73 on tripadvisor and the negative reviews. For the price paid for a very well fitted out apartment there is very little to complain about. The only very minimal thing we can think of that you could bemoan is the 10 minute walk into the Old Quarter. It is not a new hotel but is in good order. We highly recommend this place for families or couples who are willing to share and want a room with plenty of space at very good rates.
