If you're driving there a few things you need to know: #1) BR aware of the outrageous hold of funds on your credit card by the rental car companies (US$2000-$3500). #2) The roads are not in the best condition but reasonable. However, be prepared for crazy stuff like bus stops on the highway and cars to come right into your lane at any moment! #3) When you make it into SJ you will go to Calle 7 and Central Ave. the main entrance to the hotel is on central ave which is for pedestrians only.

After a week at the beach, experiencing the \"Pura Vida\" attitude and falling in love with the natural beauty of Costa Rica, I had to spend a night in San Jose before my flight home. Needless to say, coming into central San Jose after a week at the beach was a huge shock to the system. San Jose is dirty, slightly dangerous, and not very pleasant. But the Hotel Presidente helped to make my night in San Jose enjoyable and comfortable. First, it's incredibly central, which makes it easy to get to by cab and also easy to go out to grab a quick bite to eat. The hotel staff were very cautious about my friend and I going anywhere on foot at night, citing safety concerns, so we easily stayed close to the hotel with their recommendations. The next morning before my flight, I was able to easily and quickly do a little walking tour of San Jose to see the major sites - all within a few minutes of the hotel. Also, the staff were very accomodating and nice - and all spoke excellent English. The breakfast that is included was a nice touch, and the beds were incredibly comfortable. It was also great to have a nice TV with cable for a night after \"roughing it\" in the jungle. It helps to have a place to chill out when you don't feel super comfortable wandering the city at night and have some time to kill. The only downside is that the wifi is only accessible in the lobby, and to be fair the decor is a bit bland. It's definitely not a boutique hotel, but for what you'll get in San Jose, it's tops. And hey, it's a great price and you get a lot for your money.
