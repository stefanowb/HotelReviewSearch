We booked a beach front bungalow for our 4 day stay. When we booked our stay the hotel staff indicated all the beachfront bungalows had sun loungers on their outdoor seating areas but, upon our arrival, we found our bungalow did not have the loungers. It was not a big deal for us since the beach was only steps away and staff were more than willing to give us a room with loungers when one became available. However, if it really matters to you make sure you specify this. I think out of the 12 beach front bungalows only one does not have the loungers. Staff were great and I have to give a special shout out to Mo'd. The morning coffee delivered to our room was a very nice touch. The food was very good. We opted for the B&B package and paid for dinner as we went along. Each dinner was excellently prepared and the ingredients fresh. We can not say enough about the friendliness of the staff and the well maintained grounds.

My grandfather passed away while we were there, and when we asked if there was phone we could use with our calling card, the woman who owns the place (I hate that I can't remember her name!) immediately offered her cell phone without a second thought and refused to accept any money to reimburse her for the call.
