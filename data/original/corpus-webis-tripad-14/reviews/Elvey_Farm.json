My husband had the sardines, no I mean sardine for \u00a37.50, and my daughter had the three small langoustine for \u00a3 8.50! The main course options were really only roasts as it was a Sunday menu. The lighting was so dim I couldn't see my chicken breast, three previously cooked roast potatoes then reheated and one spoonful of cabbage. That cost \u00a312.50 and wasn't very tasty. Three scoops of ice cream for \u00a37 and no cheese as it was Sunday! Staff were friendly and I would of left a tip for them, but the owners add in a 'optional service charge' within the middle of the restaurant bill so that initialy you don't notice it- I think it should be discussed when you are settling up.
