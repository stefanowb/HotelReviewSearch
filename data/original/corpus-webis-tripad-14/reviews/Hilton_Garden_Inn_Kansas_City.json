Well, my advice is do not discount something until you've tried it. In July I stayed two nights at the Hilton Garden Inn and was pleasantly surprised. The property was excellent. Downtown Kansas City, Missouri is conveniently located a few minutes away by car. While the immediate area around the hotel is uninspiring, it is safe enough for an evening stroll or jog. The front desk staff is absolutely first rate and professional. Parking is onsite in a small parking garage behind the hotel and free. Breakfast at Hilton Garden's is not free; I thought the breakfast buffet is somewhat pricey for what is offered. The eating area offers a small bar open to 10:00 pm for those needing a nightcap. Defintely more quiet on the Kansas side than on the MO side. If your looking for a good nights sleep, I highly recommend this hotel.", "title": "A convenient location and a great nights sleep", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Keystone_Traveler", "date": "August 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5707634, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location; convenience to highways; away from the noise of downtown Kansas City, MO", "disliked": "\u2014 Views from hotel rooms are not that great"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Disappointed", "text": "We went to KC for the KC Ren Fest.

The bartender (and I use the term very loosely) didn't know how to make our fairly common drinks, and once explained, didn't have the ingredients to make them. (no tequilla????)
