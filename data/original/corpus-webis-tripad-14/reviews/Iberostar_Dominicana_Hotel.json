Not just that, but for the hotel staff not to offer any solution or help in trying to resolve the issue. That's exactly what happened to me at the Iberostar Dominicana. We booked through a tour company and received a confirmation on the flight, transfers and hotel. Everyone else seemed to have our information with no questions asked, but apparently the hotel had no reservation for us, and claimed all of their 3 resorts were totally booked. I find that impossible to believe. After we had them talk to the tour company for a couple hours, they still didn't offer us a room. They didn't even apologize or do anything to help us find other accomodations. To make a long story short, they were rude, very impersonal and caused us to waste our entire first afternoon of our vacation. We asked the tour company to find us another hotel and they did. We ended up staying at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana, a more luxurious resort which turned out to be great. Never again will I stay at an Iberostar or recommend one to friends or family. Nothing like this has ever happened to me.

Im not much for the sea anyway, but I found it a little choppy as it is the atlantic ocean. The night entertainment is ok a little tacky compared to everything else there, it is all catered for familys with young kids, although there was a few good shows and new years eve was a good night, they gave out champagne, grapes and party packs. As for day trips we only did 1, and it was amazing we went to Saona island, it is such a great day out. you get to go on a catamaran, speed boat, visit a desterted island, have a bbq and at the end you go to a natural pool where you can hold star fish!

We arrived early around 10:30 am and our rooms were ready. Rooms very clean and towel formations were decorated with flowers every day. We never saw our maid but we left her a $2 tip every day and she made our stay a pleasant one--clean towels, washcloths, stocked cold drinks, turned down the beds at night with chocolates on our pillows and gave us fresh towels twice a day! A few dollars go a long way--so please tip! Beach and pool were beautiful and clean. We did learn after the 1st day that unless you got a Hammock by 8:00, you were out of luck. 4 chairs together were hard to find at beach and at pool. We started taking turns making a run to the beach by 8 to \"reserve\" chairs under a hammock like everyone else. Lots of bare boobies on the beach--most should've covered up--either too old, too saggy or entirely too fat to show it all!! Some even change their entire bathing suits (tops and bottoms, male and female) right in front of you with no hesitation. They're really quite experienced and you really only got a quick look of their private parts. Be aware that you'll get an eyeful! Specialty restaurants were very good. We ate at the Japanese/Chinese, Steakhouse, Gourmet Seafood--all were delicious! The main buffet was good also--much to choose from--but we're not picky eaters! We found that at lunch it was much better at the buffet on the beach where they have the steakhouse. Less variety but fresher and less of a crowd! You can actually sit on the beach with your feet in the sand, at a picnic table under a roof and enjoy a nice lunch! Really, the only thing that needs to improve are the shows. We seemed to only catch the \"boring\" ones. One night we went over to the Bavaro side and thought that their shows were better--then we realized that they rotate. Drinks were much better at the lobby bar. Pool and beach bars were o.k. but we never got a frozen drink. Drinks with dark rum were the best but be aware of the coconut milk - we learned that it's a natural laxative. 3 out of the 4 in our group had a short bout of diarrhea - bring imodium and/or pepto bismol. Staff were all very pleasant and had a good time with \"Papa Johnson\" at breakfast and \"Juan\" on the beach. We tested Juan everyday to see if he remembered our names--what a great guy! Overall, I would recommend the Iberostar Dominicana but prefer the Iberostar Tucan in Riviera Maya, Mexico. There's not much night life so plan on going to bed early--believe me you're ready! USA3000 at the Punta Cana airport needs major improvement--they were too slow checking in--lines were long and we waited well over an hour in the heat. Thank goodness we were returning home late at night when the sun's not beating down on the thatched roof with no air conditioning in this part of the airport. Security leaving was nonexistent--they didn't check anything--turned their heads away from the x-ray.

We felt the entire staff was eager and helpful. The room was large, clean and maid service was very good. We ate mostly at the buffets but did have reservatons at the steakhouse, its right on the beach so if you go be prepared to walk a few feet in soft sand. There are candles lit and you can hear the ocean, It was extremely romantic. It was my birthday and our anniversary so the staff sang to me as well. We thought the Mexican was allright, it says its airconditioned, but not too well. I really liked the Star Rock Cafe. I will admit I had a few \"stomach issues\", but my husband did not. We went to the Marinarium, and snorkeled with sharks and stingrays. We met a group from Canada, very funny people we hung out with. The water was warm and pretty clear. We also did the Outback Safari, you spend alot of time in the truck, but well worth it, we saw much of the island, made a supply donantion to the school(Pack books,crayons,art supplies, etc. ahead of time the effort will be greatly appreciated). There is lunch at a ranch, visits to a Dominican home and boogie boarding. We made friends with couples from several states and an English family, which really enhanced the experience. We liked the entertainment,even through the language barriers. I had a massage at the spa....very nice! Overall, We really enjoyed the hotel and have no real complaints about ambiance or service.

We stayed at the Dominicana which is a basic resort \" not a 5 Apple\" as suggested by Apple Vacations. The front desk staff was borderline rude and not helpful. We had problems with our phone and they basically told us that they would not fix it. The staff although friendly does not go above and beyond as was the case at other resorts and cruises we've visited in the past. I spent the 2nd day confined to my room with a stomach virus and a fever with the chills. We ate at the Mexican rest the night before. The food was terrible. We are from the US northeast and admittedly spoiled when it comes to food choices but in comparison to other vacations it was bad! Meats were over cooked and everything seemed to be slopped into a tray. Many times there were no cups or plates and we had to wait before we could eat. Couldn't wait to come home to eat. The room again was basic. The tub had chips in it and rust stains running down. The phone did not work correctly and the air cond either runs on 1 of 3 settings or is off, it does not turn on and off by itself. If you enjoy staying at the beach later then most be prepared to take a cold shower when you get back to your room. The maid kept leaving the sliding doors unlocked not sure if this was on purpose or not. Also be prepared to be harassed by locals to buy their products they are relentless. We took 4 excursions and they were all \"different.\" The Outback safari was the only great professionally operated one. The ATV's were fun but mine only had rear breaks and another guy had a flat tire, the tires on all ATV's were nearly bald. Avoid the Saona island trip. The beach at the hotel was much better. Saona island beach was rocky and god forbid you want to relax on the beach, locals will actually wake you up to sell you things. And the massage women just come up to you and dump oil on you and start rubbing you wether you want it or not. BE AWARE OF THE \"GYM.\" It's open air and equip is from 1960's and has the rust to prove it. It's above the spa and the worker at the gym lifted up the rubber mats to show us the holes in the wood floor underneath where weights had fallen through.

Doing that, it kept our mini-bar stocked every day; they claim it will only be filled every other day. The bathroom was nice and in good shape along with the rest of the room amenities. As for the plugs, they will work for US plugs but depending on your plug you may need the adapter because the plugs are recessed. For instance, my cell phone charger plug was too wide that it didn't reach the outlet due to the cover being a good inch off of the wall. I highly suggest you wait and see if you have any problems and if you do need an adapter they sell them at the store in the lobby for 65 cents. For sure buy the cheap one because that is all you need. If the plug doesn\u2019t fit immediately just keep wiggling it because the adapter is cheap and is more of an extension than an adapter. The only complaint we had was that we came back with some phantom funk on our used clothes and suitcases that had to have come from the room. We didn't smell it when we were there but when we opened up our suitcases when we got home it was obvious. That being said, not much you can do and we certainly don't blame the resort.", "title": "Nice place for the budget price", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "nyadventure", "date": "February 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6808451, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The landscape"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "BEACH: Yes, take along a thermos mug.
