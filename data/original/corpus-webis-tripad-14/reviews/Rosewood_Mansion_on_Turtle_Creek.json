Our arrival was uneventful. After lounging by the pool for a short while we attempted to dress for dinner. We had reservations in The Restaurant at 7:30. At this point the bottle of champagne I had requested to be delivered at 6:30 had not been delivered so I was upset and my attitude about The Mansion on Turtle Creek became worse with each passing minute. At 6:40 I tried to take a shower. When I turned the handle to turn the shower on; water sprayed 360 degrees around the fixture. I engaged the shower and the spray lessened somewhat. However, the tub would not drain. In fact, after a brief shower the tub was over half full and my wife still needed to take a shower. I called the concierge and they sent an \u201cengineer\u201d to the bathroom to fix the problem. Here we are on what was supposed to be a luxurious 3 day weekend only to have a gentleman using a long \u201csnake\u201d to unclog a plugged drain. How did housekeeping clean the tub when it had a clogged drain? In any case, the man couldn\u2019t unplug the drain so the front desk attempted to move us to another room. A bell attendant came and escorted us to the second floor (we had been staying on the first floor) through a gauntlet of industrial fans. There were extension cords taped down over the hallway\u2026how posh. We were both pummeled with high pressure air as we moved through the hallway. I asked the bell attendant what the problem was and he said that a drain on the third floor had plugged causing flooding on the second floor. A plugged drain in our first floor room and a third floor room seems indicative of a hotel-wide problem with plumbing. When we reached the room at the end of the wet hallway the gentleman opened the door and all three of us were greeted with the potent fumes of fresh paint. I could hardly believe it. This room must have been painted within 24 hours to smell that bad. I immediately asked for another room. The next room that we were presented with was a smoking room and it was noxious as well. Apparently, the only two rooms left were a freshly painted room and a smoking room. We had the leftovers to choose from. I became somewhat angry at this point and went directly to the front desk to talk with Kevin and a women who was \u201cthe assistant front desk manager.\u201d Both were, in my opinion, incompetent and should take the Ritz Carlton\u2019s training course ASAP. Both talked in the most uncaring manner. The assistant manager apologized but did nothing to help us. She said she would search for another room, but it would be difficult to find since the hotel was at capacity. Why would I let them show us another room anyway when the ones they showed us thus far were so awful? Did they show me the terrible rooms first and then save the proper ones if I complained? I told the woman at the front desk that I was going to check out. Instead of trying to find us a room at their sister hotel The Crescent Court, or anything for that matter, she said ,\u201dwe hate to loose you\u2026\u201d as if I had a choice. There were no rooms! Then she said there would be a room opening up tomorrow night. What, my lady, did you want my wife and I to do tonight\u2026sleep in our car? I then told her to call The Four Seasons and reserve me a room and she quickly called as if to wipe her hands of us. No compensatory offer of any type was made at that point. I did later receive a message on my cell phone from Kevin saying I would receive a certificate for one free nights stay in the future. In my opinion that was too little to late, we were already gone. We needed assistance that night, not in the future. How can Mobil give The Mansion five stars, but the Greenbrier gets 4? AAA is easy to please and get five diamonds from, but my trusted Mobil guide? Either they haven\u2019t stayed in recent history or someone is getting some help. In either case, my wife and I are upset and disappointed as we wanted our first stay at the Mansion to be magical. The Four Seasons was wonderful as usually.
