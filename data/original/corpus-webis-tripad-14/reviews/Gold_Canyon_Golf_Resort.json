Our casita included a fireplace, whirlpool and giant shower, and although it needed updating, it was clean and spotless with a gorgeous view. Our special included golf for hubby on Dinosaur Mtn course, and a massage for myself. Jamie in the spa was wonderful, and my husband provided me with a 5* review of the course. In addition, breakfast was included with both days, and the restaurant was fantastic! The pool was small, but more than adequate, and this resort offered just what we were looking for -- serenity and quiet! It is a bit off the beaten path, about 25 minutes outside of Phoenix, so I would hope that the golf is the purpose of this destination for most. One of the restauant hosts, Seriena is the gem of this resort. She greets everyone with a smile, and outdoes herself to ensure we had a wonderful stay.

Then we went back to our room and my husband went in the spa. I was walking around the room barefoot and almost stepped on a Arizona Bark Scorpion. You might have your staff tell the guests it's not a good idea to walk around the room barefoot since you have deadly scorpions in your rooms.

Had we known at the time it was a deadly scorpion we probably wouldn't have done so. When I called the front desk to advise them and ask if we should be concerned I was told \"Call us back if you get stung and we'll tell you what to do.\" REALLY??? Needless to say we didn't sleep well that night. The next night it rained and we spent all night listening to the leak in our ceiling and the very loud guests in the room behind us. (Your walls are like paper) I put the ice bucket under the leak and my husband told me to call the front desk to advise them that we had a leak. I said \"Why, knowing this place they will just send a guy with a bigger bucket.\" and that is exactly what they did. So we stayed in the room to watch the FREE HBO. Did I mention that channel didn't come in? We also ordered room service the 2nd night because we didn't want to wait forever for our meal in the restaurant. It arrived cold! We had guests join us for the \"Champagne\" Brunch and were never offered champagne. Our room was dirty, my husband got an itchy rash from the spa and as I was searching the room constantly for more scorpions I killed many spiders. I advised the desk man of this when we left and he said \"Wow, sorry about that.\" and continued to charge us full price. Needless to say we will never be staying at your resort again.

Anyway, we had a beautiful view of the golf course, the service was excellent as was the food. The next morning we ate breakfast at the buffet in Kokopellis and again had another beautiful view of the golf course and the food was outstanding.

It seemed that there were some internal changes that had significantly deteriorated the quality of the resort. The resort did not seem to have the staff in order to give its guests the service they needed in a timely manner. We found ourselves waiting for a bellman on many occasions for literally hours. When we needed towels they came late as well, and when we needed bathroom tissue, it never arrived. In some cases the staff was actually shockingly rude as they became frustrated with not being able to provide service. The most disappointing of all of the experiences at the resort would be the lack of accountability throughout the uppermanagement. There seemed to be nothing but excuses and a lack of professionalism from the top down. It just goes to show that greatness or mediocrity starts at the top.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 1, 2005", "id": 3517073}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great resort", "text": "Just spent 4 days at this resort and loved the rooms, golf and the staff, what a hidden jewel I found.

Our server, Jonathan, was pleasant. To start I ordered a Lemon Drop Martini while my husband ordered a Perfect Manhattan. We sat on the patio enjoying a beautiful view of the desert with the city lights off in the distance. When my Lemon Drop arrived I was disappointed in the presentation and taste. The server had no problem bringing this drink to the table. The glass was just over half full. It looked like a drink someone had previously had a few sips of. The rim of the glass was bare. I expect a Lemon Drop Martini to be served in a martini glass full to its sugared rim and ice cold. Jonathan asked how our drinks were just after being served. The Manhattan was a success but I told Jonathan I did not like the Lemon Drop. My husband asked Jonathon if he would replace my Lemon Drop with a perfect Manhattan and ordered a second one for himself. We ordered the prime rib special. First we were served with an assortment of dinner rolls that were warm and wonderful . My hungry husband decided to order the tortilla soup when he realized the meal did not come with soup or salad. The soup was brought just as dinner was served. He started to send it back but decided to keep it. The soup was excellent. The prime rib came with garlic mashed potatoes and assorted vegetables. My potatoes were served just warm but I had no complaints with the taste of the food. The manager came by to ask how our meal was. We both agreed the food was good. I mentioned my disappointment with the Lemon Drop Martini which still sat on the table. We then shared how much we enjoyed the Manhattan with him. He said \"I'm glad we could make a drink right for you.\" When we received our dinner bill we were both surprised the charge for the Lemon Drop was not removed.", "title": "The Restaurant Only", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Sherie010", "date": "June 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 112108703}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Dont waste your money or your time....", "title": "Dont waste your time and money", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jds31350", "date": "April 25, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 105485438}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011", "text": "Good afternoon,", "title": "Beautiful resort with cheap motel feel to rooms", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "RightAngleTraveller", "date": "April 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 104841245}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 17, "average": 16, "very good": 30, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 49}, "aka": "Gold Canyon Golf Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Gold Canyon Resort\u2019s 85 unique Hotel rooms offer a variety of amenities such as Indoor or Outdoor Private Spas, Suites, Wood Burning Fireplaces and Private Patios with splendid views of the majestic Superstition Mountains.
