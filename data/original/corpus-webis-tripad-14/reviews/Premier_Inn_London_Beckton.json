The ground floor room in the main building had been refurbished and was very very nice. Absolutely no moans and groans. The attaching pub next door did lovely food which was hot, tasty and value for money. Equally the breakfasts were excellent. The docklands light railway station is literally next door and a fabulous service direct into london. We bought an off peak day ticket for \u00a38 (DLR and tube zones 1 to 4) which was good value for money. Asda is across the road with a petrol station. Not a lot around and about but if you want a good value for money base to see the sights in London, then this is the place. When all said and done a days sightseeing is gruelling and all you want is a soak in the bath and a good evening meal before crashing out.
