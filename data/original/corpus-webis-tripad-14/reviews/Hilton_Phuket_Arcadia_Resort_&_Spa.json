There are three wings with their rooms called Andaman, Saitong and Lotus wings. The buildings were built about 25, 10, and 7 years ago, respectively, and the older the wing, the lower the rate. The Lotus rooms are larger than the other two. They have newer furniture and are most expensive. To be honest, I did not see any reason why would anyone not choose Andaman rooms. The only thing was lack of separate showers and bathtubs there. I personally do not like baths and we never used it. One should bear in mind that I had very short visit to the other rooms (Lotus and Andaman). We had a cockroach in our room one night. Also the drain of the sink became very slow, which we did not bother to mention. Nevertheless, there might be more significant differences between different room types, which we could not detect.

The Saitong and Lotus wing is quieter and from what i have heard the rooms are nicer looking but we had 3 in a room and it was absolutely fine. The grounds are fabulous very well kept and the food is excellent especially breakfast as there is so much choice. During the day we sunbathed at the Horizon Pool which is the nearest pool to the beach. The beach is just across the road and even though the road is busy there was a guard who took you across so no problems there. The Hilton Hotel is based in Karon which is not as big as Phuket but is a lot more civilised with really good restaurants everywhere.
