A good five minute walk from the centre of town, this Ibis is quite new with a car park behind the hotel.

Breakfast was a good value for the extra 7 euros. The room was modern, clean, had AC (not great), free internet and parking. It is the furthest hotel from the old town...a 12 minute walk in a so-so neighborhood. The bathroom is entirely modular, i.e. fabricated from one piece of plastic, almost resembling a bathroom on a cruise ship. The shower worked well. No tissues were provided in the bathroom or upon request at desk. The hotel bills itself as \"green\" which makes me wonder why the hallways were so brightly lit. Not a bad choice if you need parking and don't mind a less-than-charming walk to town.", "user": "beekay458", "date": "June 16, 2010", "id": 67738815}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Decent hotel, good location", "text": "We stayed here for 4 nights while visiting the Dordogne.

We picked it because of the free parking as some of the more \"characterful\" hotels in the centre of town didn't seem to have any. It's a short walk into town (less than 10mins). Breakfast in the hotel was 7.50 Euro which struck us as pricey - we just popped down the road for a croisant from the bakery for 80 cents....", "user": "michelle D", "date": "May 11, 2010", "id": 63859134}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Brand new, clean hotel outside Sarlat centre", "text": "Stayed 4 nights, a spacious room, good breakfast for 7.5 euro, good price value if you make a reservation through the internet and about 3 weeks is advance.", "user": "Bec_and_daz", "date": "October 24, 2009", "id": 47666254}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great value, some staffing issues", "text": "The hotel was not very full so it was really quite.
