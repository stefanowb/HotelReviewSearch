The mark of a good hotel, at least in my expierence, is how the staff reacts to a problem. After I had checked in, I was startled at a knock at the door and the sound of someone tring to enter the room. I called the front desk and they explained that another guest had misread their room number and tried to enter my room, thinking it was theirs. Without asking, they took care of my incidental charges and offered a credit on my room. The accomidations were immaculate, the beds were unbelieveable, and the bar area was run as efficiently and as pleasently as any i've ever stayed at. I normally don't write reviews, (I live in hotels and that would be a hobby that would take a considerable amount of time) but I had to brag on this propertiy. The staff were excellent, catering to my every whim. I extended my stay an extra night (because of the wonderful service) and invited my wife to Nashville (We live only two hours away) and they got me ticekts to a local hockey game (Nashville Predators, very fun) and arranged for limo service to and from. I will be in Nashville soon on pleasure and will stay no where, but the Sheraton Music City. They have been ranked the number one hotel in Nashville for 5 out of the last 6 years and I can tell why!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 8, 2006", "id": 5438949}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "What a wonderful weekend!", "text": "If your looking for a place in Nashville to getaway for the weekend, this is it.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 23, 2006", "id": 5376941}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Could have been excellent except", "text": "The hotel is absolutely beautiful interior and exterior.

For our fourth anniversary my wife and I decided we deserved a weekend getaway and settled on Nashville, TN. We wanted peace and quiet in a wonderful Sheraton room with a Sweet Sleeper Bed. Having previously enjoyed the Sheraton in downtown Nashville I thought a change of pace would be nice and ventured to this site looking for reviews for the Sheraton Music City. Oh, what wonderful reviews there are on this site... I am envious of everyone who had a great stay\u2026 MY EXPERIENCE SUCKED!!! We called the hotel to reconfirm our reservation while en route to the hotel and were told by the front desk that they DID indeed have our room ready for our arrival. We only live about two hours away from Nashville in Huntsville, AL. We were assured that a room on the club level with a King sized Sweet Sleeper Bed was waiting for us and although we would arrive a little later than 8pm it didn\u2019t matter because we had RESERVED the room. When we arrived (sigh) we were given the wrong room\u2026 a double bedroom on a non-club level floor. We paid extra for a club level room. We called Sheraton Worldwide Reservation and were told that yes we should be on the club level with a KING bed and that she could see that the hotel had changed the reservation in the database at 1pm!!! How was this?!?!?! We had confirmed with them at 6:15pm. Arrrgghhh!!!! No problem\u2026 right?!?!?! We\u2019ll just call the front desk and have our room changed\u2026 I\u2019m sure it was just an honest mistake, right? WRONG!!! They had given our room away because of some high school basketball tournament!!! They were sooo sorry!!! But if we didn\u2019t want to stay in a double room (of course we didn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s our anniversary) they did have a suite on the first floor by the pool?!?!?! Reluctantly, we agreed to stay in the other room and were given two free dinner coupons, whoop-dee-doo!!! But when after we trekked to the other room\u2026 luggage in tow, we found it to house a bed that YOU PULL DOWN FROM THE WALL!!! A hideaway, Murphy bed!!! Not a Sweet Sleeper, at all. This was the best they could do!!!! Just then some kids banged on our door and ran off giggling!!! Oh, heck NO we are NOT staying here!!! To make a long story short\u2026 from the sucky room we call the Sheraton Downtown and after explaining to Jeff at the front desk what was going on, we were promptly treated like royalty. He told us to come on down\u2026 that he would set everything up\u2026 he gave us club level rooms at the same rate we had locked in online (the weekend rate was $200 a night we paid the original $119 a night) and free breakfast. Oh, the King sized Sweet Sleeper Bed was great\u2026 we never left the room. Thank you Sheraton Downtown Nashville. Oh, yeah, when we got home\u2026 we found a $2.97 charge on our American Express from\u2026 you guessed it, Sheraton Music City. They had told us there would be No charges!!! I\u2019m disputing it\u2026 the saga continues!!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 30, 2006", "id": 5234493}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "I have stayed in better organised and efficiently run hotels in Serbia!!", "title": "This was awful", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "StAlbansUKHammonds", "date": "May 29, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 5230876}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "Our room smelt of vomit, the disabled access to the bar and lounge was blocked by a trolley and only grudgingly removed, twice!!", "title": "This is the best nights sleep at a hotel ever, its Sheraton for me from now on!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Sasser", "date": "May 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5205030}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lovely hotel - comfy beds!", "text": "Our Lunch order was fogotten and we were treated to a a member of staff complaing as to how busy they were and couldn't cope.

I had read all the tripadvisor comments and decided to choose this hotel (rated 3.5 stars on hotwire) over a 3-star hotel nearby. While our stay wasn't bad, it was not one which is usually commissurate with a 3-star hotel. I found the service to be lacking, specifically at the front desk--where the attendant mistakenly gave us the wrong keys for our room (even after the bellman asked her to check--because we had reserved 2 rooms), then hand wrote a room rate on the key packet that was $15 cheaper than what I'd actually paid. When asked about this rate, she stated \"Oh--yes. That was the wrong rate. I'm not sure why I wrote that\". Then when asked what the rate actually was...since I'd paid more...she stated \"Oh--um--well, I actually don't know the rate.\" And when further pressed stated, \"Whatever you paid is the correct rate. Yes, whatever you paid.\". How is that response supposed to satisfy any customer who is interested in making sure that they paid the best possible rate?? It didn't. So, rather than pursue it, I decided to attempt to enjoy my stay. Upon arrival to the room, I found it to be quite average--not in keeping with it's 3.5 star rating. The bathroom was small--one cannot sit on the toilet and close the door to the bathroom at the same time. The beds were fairly comfortable, but nothing like the \"dream-sleeper\" that I was expecting. The best thing about the room was the showerhead --which provided a great stream of very hot water and the shower-rod which was the curvilinear-type, allowing for a more spacious feel in the shower. On the first morning, we decided to order breakfast by room service---until we were told that it would take anywhere from 50minutes to an hour to receive the food. That's just unheard of in a so-called upscale establishment. We decided to eat elsewhere. I must say that overall, it's not a bad place. The decor and furnishings were comfortable (about one step away from upsscale), and the place was clean (which is always a plus) , but they could improve upon the knowledge-base and timeliness of their customer service.", "title": "OK overall, Shower was the Best", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "heyindy", "date": "October 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 5908322, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Shower", "disliked": "\u2014 Customer Service"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Went to the hotel website and got a summer special rate of $95 (plus Nashville's outrageous sales tax and lodging taxes, for a total of ~$109 per night).", "title": "Outstanding Hotel In Nashville", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "tsteele93", "date": "September 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5833350, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Classy hotel", "disliked": "\u2014 extra charges for internet and bottled water"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "The hotel is excellent.
