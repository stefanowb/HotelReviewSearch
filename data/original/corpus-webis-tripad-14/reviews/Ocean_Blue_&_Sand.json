The food at all the restaurants were always fresh and always something for everyone and and always very excellent. The staff is so very friendly and helpful. The entertainment is so enjoyable especially Alejandro. He made every day so enjoyable with the activities by the pools and on the beach. There is always fun for every age. We played with people older, younger and made a lot of new friends. Alejandro Beltran is very organized and made our stay a wonderful experience. He is great with activities, entertainment at the shows and there to help us if we need it. For example, I had a terrible cough and he helped me to purchase the right medicine since I do not know Spanish. I highly recommend Ocean Blue. I can't wait to go back for our 4th time. The rooms are huge and always clean. The beach is perfect, clean and very large. We went for a walk for 2 hours each way! Beautiful!! The grounds are meticulous, always maintained.

After sharing stories with other friends who visited the D.R. and other hotels, I realized it wasn't limited to my hotel. Everyone had the same opinion about the food at their hotels, too. The food leaves A LOT to be desired. Our first night, we ate at the Margarita Restaurant. I had a chicken fajita and it was not good. The chicken was ground up and the sauces were really funky. The salsa, I think, was the same sauce they use for pasta at the buffet, the guacamole was weird and the cheese sauce was just gross. It was a COLD yellow blob. SO, skip this restaurant. We had breakfast at the Carribean Grill and again, it was disappointing. Even the little croissant tasted stale and weird. Our \"potatoes\" were round hashbrown cakes and my boyfriend's sausage was a hotdog. The same restaurant had a buffet lunch - the meats and cheeses look a little slimy (I only eat chicken and turkey) so I avoided those. Pizza tasted funny. So, I played it safe and ate penne with tomato sauce and some dried-up BBQ chopped up chicken parts. If it weren't for the swim up bar and huge amounts of alcohol I was consuming, I'd actually lose weight on this vacation. I was actually afraid for dinner. Too many drinks at the swim up bar did us in on Friday so we skipped dinner. Our Privilege Club upgrade included a lobster dinner. So, on Saturday, we had a lobster dinner down on the beach and TG it was good!!! We had (3) grilled 1/2 lobsters and they were delicious! So, if you want to pay extra, the lobster dinner is worth it. On Sunday night, we decided to try one of the nicer restaurants and we were NOT allowed in - my boyfriend was not wearing SLACKS. He had a nice pair of plaid shorts but we were not allowed in. So, we never had a chance to try one of the nicer restaurants. So, we went back to Caribbean Grill and had more lobster. SO, remember, if you are a guy, to bring a pair of slacks.

Stayed 3/14-21 and booked through Apple. We are a family with five kids, ages 4 , 11, 16, 18, 21 and three additional friends ages 21. Everyone had a great time. We have stayed at Iberostars our last 6 trips, but decided to save some money and try another resort. So glad we did. The resort was beautiful. We had four rooms. Three were in villa 6 and 1 was in villa 5 next door (couldn't put us altogether but not a big deal). The pools were lovely and had a couple spots with shade from palm tree which we dragged one or two lounge chairs under every day (on the grass). Also lots of big umbrellas around the pool and if you look in the closet of your room, there is a blue umbrella you can take outside and stick behind your chair if need be. The ocean and beach were gorgeous and we managed to get a cabana with shade when we put towels on lounge chairs by 7 a.m. People go out as early as 5 a.m. and \"reserve\" chairs by putting towels and belongings down to \"claim\" it. We never hogged more than 2 chairs (a cabana holds four chairs) because I think it's rude if you're on the go most of the day to tie up chairs someone else can be enjoying. Not every family member needs a lounge chair because you're playing in the water, at the bar, getting food, etc. so in reality a chair isn't used that much. It was never a problem to find a chair in the sun, but by 7:15 a.m. the cabanas were taken. I also didn't think it was a big deal to share the cabana with two other people. In fact, we met some really nice people from Belgium that way and became friends. We were both looking for a cabana and each took two chairs and it was all we needed, even with our big family. Sometimes people \"reserved\" the cabana and then stayed at the pool all day so if you notice one not being used enjoy it until they get there. \"Reserving\" really isn't enforceable. When we decided to go to the pool we pulled all our stuff at the beach to free up the chairs for someone else. The food was delicious, the room was clean, the people were nice and the weather was perfect, although hot. Bring one bottle of suntan lotion per person. My younger kids wore water shirts and sunhats and even with 30+ lotion they burned a little. Sunglasses are of course a MUST for all ages. It's a long day in the sun. Even with suntan lotion it is easy to burn. My kids ages 16-21 went to the disco every night, and liked the sports bar and coffee shop. The 21 year olds naturally liked the swim up bar. Lots of music and dancing in the water. None of us went to the nightly shows, casino or specialty restaurants--we were content with the buffet and had our share of shows at Iberostars. I brought a lot of single dollar bills and tipped $3.00 per day per room, as they only make $200.00 per month on average. We bowled one game at bowling alley (coupon for free game is on the map they give you so save it but if you lose it they'll still let you bowl and be sure to bring socks--can't bowl without them). My 11 year old liked the bungi jumping ($10.00) and rock climbing wall (free) at the beach. We ate lunch by the beach every day which was really close to pool and beach, but had breakfast and dinner in the buffet restaurant. It was a longish walk but we didn't mind. We thought the food was good. We all found something we liked. We tried not to take more than we would eat so we didn't waste anything. You can always go back! Sad to see what some people take and then throw out just because they can. The ride from airport was about 35 minutes. But when leaving resort to go home be prepared to leave 4 hours before your scheduled flight as that is how they structure your departure time from resort. We had a great time--can't imagine you won't too. Also, rarely saw a mosquito at the resort if at all, but did get a couple bites at the airport in the middle of the afternoon, as part of it is open air and you walk out to the plane.

We booked it based on the comments that we read here on Trip Advisor, as well as the recommendation of the Apple Tour representative we spoke with when considering various resorts in Punta Cana - unfortunately we were very disappointed with our choice. Since we were traveling in mid-March, which is the height of Spring Break season, we were looking for a quiet resort . Unfortunately, this was NOT it - it was LOADED with Spring Breakers who were looking to party 24/7 (been there, done that a loooooooong time ago!). We had to call Security 3 of our 4 nights there to break up late night (3am) parties & screaming/door slamming that was happening outside of our room (our last night there, we had to call them 3 times & we only ended up getting 2 hours of sleep). We felt like we had been deceived because we specifically asked about Spring Breakers when booking & were told \"no, this is not the type of resort that would appeal to them\".

However, if you've been to any of the more exclusive all inclusives (Palace Resorts, Sandals, etc), you'll be disappointed here - the service is not the same, the staff are not as attentive to your needs &/or resolving problems, the food is not as good, (including the fact that nothing was ever really cold enough - the blended drinks weren't frosty, yogurt was warm & soupy, the milk for cereal was warm, as were the shots of alcohol served at the bars), the rooms are not as well appointed (BTW - our room had roaches!), there aren't as many conveniences offered (only 1 place to get/return beach towels & it's located out of the way on the beach), and not \"everything\" is included in your all-inclusive (e.g., certain restaurants are not included & you have to pay extra if you want to eat there, no complementary excursions, etc), and the only place you could get free WiFi was in the Lobby Bar - otherwise you had to pay for internet access.

The Mexican restaurant was not good, and we would recommend not eating there. The bar staff was friendly and fun. We made friends with the main lobby bar tenders and were entertained nightly by Alex and his singing. The rooms were as advertised and nothing more. They were very clean, the furnishings were older and well used, but we spent most of our time at the wonderful white sand beach or on excursions. If your are going to spend most of your time in your room I would suggest something different. (why did you come to the beach to stay in your room?) We didn't use the pools, but from what we saw they were clean, and people that we talked to that used the pool and swim up bars were very happy there. There were children almost every place we went on the property, but for the most part they were well behaved and having a great time like we were. If having a great time on the beach, enjoying a swimming pool, and being treated like a good friend by the staff is what you are looking for then I suggest you check out Ocean Blue.

There are few palm trees, but they offer no shade either. The shelters they have at the beach are definitely NOT pleasing to the eye, nor offer any protection from the sun or rain. They are not huts made out of palm trees. They are square shelters w/strips of material stapled to the top. Very unattractive and crowded together. There were very few palm trees on the beach that offered any type of shade. The few that did were taken first thing in the morning. May have been 5-6 total shelters that were close enough to the trees to offer some shade. If you've ever been in one of the huts that a lot of beaches have, you know that you get shade as well as protection from the rain. These shelters offer neither.

First and foremost, if you just booked a trip to the Ocean Blue/Sand and you're reading negative reviews...stop it.

First, the Ocean Blue has a very small beach - probably one of the smallest in Punta Cana but I will note that I heard American tourist after American tourist walk on to the beach and comment, \"what an amazing beach! Honey, take a picture!\" So, it must have been their first time. We personally love the very long, expansive beach resorts in Punta Cana. The food at O.B. makes up for it though. Second negative is that while a big plus is that the a la carte restaurants do not require reservations (first in Punta Cana not to require 24 in advance reservations including menu selection) they accept large parties with a smile. These dining rooms are small, perhaps 70 - 80 seats, so when they do this, we found that we were told that we would have to wait at least an hour for a table for two. We never managed to get into the Mexican restaurants. From a restaurant owning family myself, I would suggest to the O.B. that they implement a cut-off policy at tables of 8, after that you have to split up into separate tables. It's better to have one upest family rather than 10. Finally, the Royal Holiday time share people can be a pest. Good thing is that they are only they during breakfast. When you see these people in white polo shirts handing out the hotel's daily activities sheets, walk on by and say \"NO THANK YOU\" and they will leave you alone.

Only 1 minor problem at airport , someone was so excited to be there or can't read their own writing because they took 1 of our groups piece of luggage. Apple provides tags and you should actually look at them when retrieving luggage or mark you bags. Fortunately it was someone on our bus to resorts and Apple rep got it fixed before we left airport. Bought some Presidente for the 30 minute trip to Ocaen Blue and off we went. Greeted at the resort with Ocean Blue Drinks escorted to the Elite Club as we had upgraded when we booked our trip. Had Absolute, Tangaray, Johnny Walker Red and Black label Chevas Regal,Bailey Irish Creme, Kaluha, Frangelico, Disarano, to name a few. Available to us all week. Got our room assignments in Villa 10. Great rooms. Had 2nd floor overlooking the pool bar with very big balcony with 2 wicker chairs, foot stool and table. Looked like all other villas had plastic chairs. Our room had 4poster bed bathroom had 2 sinks, glass enclosed shower, with seperate jacuzzi tub. Had trouble always getting hot water, but you are on vacation learn to deal with it. Normally let it run for a couple of minutes and don't shower during demand times and it works. Also had full minifridge with pop, water and Presidente. Our table also had 1 btl. Absolute, 1 btl. Johnny Walker Red, 1bltBrugal Rum(local), and 2 btls. wine.Had no problem getting more Presidente or Pepsi Diet. Very nice pool but only had 1 pool bar open as it was low season. No major complaints, service was a little slow at times wether you tipped or not. Again relax you are on vacation. Still didn't figure out how they stock the pool bar daily, always ran out of Abslute at pool bar, then drank Stoli's. Oh well! Food was good to very good. Ate at Italian, Route 66, Mexican, and EL Bodegan. I'm not a mexican food lover, so I would definatey not eat at again. We did have some in our group eat there twice and enjoyed it. Wife said it was ok. Had heard bad reviews of Route 66 but it was very good as was the Italian. El Bodagon some had good meals (filets) others had New York Sirloin and was tough.Buffets try to cater to all nationalities and are just that buffets. You could always find something to eat. Service overall was very good. Breakfast didn't change much but omlets and eggs over very good. You put what you want on a small plate the give to cook for your omlet. Only had ham as a meat choice at omlet station so I went to get bacon first then went there. Sausage is not like ours so nstayed away from it, however their fried salami is good. Lunch at beach buffet didn't change much, however the chicken was the best. Rotissire and very moist. The BBQ Beach Buffet at LaBrasa was a very nice change one night. Pay attention to your Ocean Blue newsletter as some Rest. are on recess(closed) on different nights. All in all a very nice resort and would go back. It's just that our group likes to try different places and may go back to Mexico next time or to another resort in Punta Cana.

The first couple of days had plenty of College students partying late at night, however, the end of the week was quiet.

We did not attend any of the shows so we really can't comment. The palapas at the beach (that cover 4 chairs each) were abundant, but, must play the 'wake up early and reserve game' to get a good shady spot. We didn't mind waking up early (5:30am) as the sunrise was breathless and never tiredsome. Plus the fact that it was very hot (+29c or 87f) with 100% humidity from 7:30 am onward. The rooms were clean even though the housekeepers sometimes did not clean until late afternoon. Tipping the housekeepers garners extra water bottles and beer in the mini fridge. No problem with the air conditioning at all (my wife was actually cold at night). The food at the buffet was great, lots of variation. There is always something to find for the finicky eaters. Unfortunately, there's not enough staff that can lead to delays on getting a drink or utensils. We tipped especially well which garnered special treatment. We ate egg white omellettes for breakfast (don't be afraid to ask at the omelette station). The specialty restaurants were just okay, no reservations needed. We tried the Italian and the service was brutaly slow and no airconditioning in the restaurant. We also tried the Mexican, surprisingly tasteful.

Checking in was a little confusing as we were sent to the regular check in then told we had to go to the previlege lobby after about 15 minutes. When we got there we were told that we had to pay an extra $1300 US more then our quote. Apparently the website hadn't calculated our children's ages into the total. I booked directly on the ocean blue website. Even though I had entered their ages (4,7,11) the default had set their ages as 0. This was a little hard to digest after having travelled a good part of the day to get there. The manager that we spoke to was very unsympathic to our situation and took no responsibility for the computer error. I had even called to confirm our reservation the day prior to our arrival and was told \"yes\" 2 adults, 3 children. I would expect they would catch the error and say are all three of your children 0 years old? Anyways the error was never caught until we were checking in and thrown the bombshell. We found many of the people unfriendly and the people who checked us in never spoke to us again during the week even though we saw them every day. There was no sorry for the error or anything. It was very upsetting, and for the extra money would have stayed some where else. The good parts of our trip was the time we spent together, the beach was beautiful, the pools were awesome, and Mike's coffee house was wonderful. I would not advise upgrading to previlege. It wasn't worth the extra money. We only ate at the previlege breakfast once. Service was slow, the selection was mininal and the food wasn't very good. We went to the buffet the rest of the mornings for breakfast. We never saw the \"pillow menu\" nor did we get a ceiling fan in our room. A lot of what they listed for previlege was fluff that you never saw. The room wasn't made up until after 4:30 each day. We tipped the maid well every day and gave her toys and dollar store items and she still took something from our room. The bedding felt wet when you went to bed because of the very moist air. As others have noted you need to get up early to get a chair by the pool or beach, even earlier for shade. Part of the week was March Break for a lot of people and it was really packed everywhere you went. There were a lot of topless women on the beach and by the pool, and bathing suits with no bottoms in them as my children say. I think that my children were explosed to more then I would have liked them to be explosed to. The vendors on the beach and at the resort are relentless. Do not go \"looki, looki\" unless you are prepared to be given a huge sales pitch that is hard to escape from. I would have loved to buy more things there but their barter system is an extream sport that I wasn't very good at. Much different then in Mexico. We planned this trip several months ago and I thought all the complaints were just unfounded. I did experience the things I had read about and can now relate to what their complaints were. The seafood restaurant by the beach was really disgusting. None of us were able to eat our dinner. The others were just ok. The buffet was good if you went to a station to have food prepared for you while you waited. They have people going around with monkeys, tucans, and a snake to take pictures. The pictures are nice but expensive. I was sad to see the monkey kept in a small cat carrier and the 2 large birds crammed into a small cage. These animals make them money but are not kept well. All in all the grounds were nice, the pool and beach awesome, but the rest lacking.

The hotel is actually Ocean Blue & Sand. It is a good size - not too big, not too small. If you don't feel like walking, there is a tram that runs almost all day and night or you can call & get a golf cart to come get you. The grounds are beautiful, the staff is unbelievably friendly! The pavers are uneven by design, which can pose a challenge when wearing heels. As Americans, it is hard to break the tipping habit, and my BF and I spent about $60 each on tips for the week. However, the Europeans and others don't tip, so don't feel guilty if you don't. The food is mediocre - buffets were the best. Try La Casa de Mi Abuela for Dominican food. I am vegetarian and had no problems finding things to eat - they are happy to substitute ingredients if nothing veg is on the menu. I didn't eat any lettuce, but ate tomatoes all week & had no problems. People who complain about getting sick from the food in the Caribbean would do well to consider how much alcohol they drink all day long in the blazing sun. Seriously - drink, have fun, get some sun, but USE SUNBLOCK, get some shade, and drink plenty of water (bottled water is in abundance - don't be shy). About upgrading to Privilege - the rooms are a little nicer, there is a special breakfast by the beach with waiter service, you get better and more booze in your room, room service is included, and we got a free dinner at El Bodegon. The private beach with waiter service is nice, but the regular beach is close to the bar, so you getting your own drinks is actually quicker. That being said, the standard rooms are just fine, and unless you simply MUST have top shelf liquor, you don't need to upgrade. Avoid lines at the restaurants by eating dinner after 7:30pm (give your kids some power bars or snacks or something to hold them over). Go to the gym at off-hours (mid-day) & you'll never wait for machines. The sun shines all day, so you won't miss any beach time if you hit the gym at noon or 1pm. As for getting up at 6:30am to reserve chairs in the shade - WHAT??? First, the umbrellas are fixed, so \"shade\" moves as the sun does. No point in reserving something that won't be in the shade for more than an hour or so. Second, reserving isn't allowed. If you see chairs that are \"reserved\" but clearly unoccupied - MOVE THE TOWELS! We did that & never had a problem. The evening shows have a slight cheese factor - mostly lip synching - however, the dancers were VERY good and clearly trained (the women, anyway). They also hang out at the lobby bar afterward & dance with you. SUPER nice people on all counts. Any Spanish you speak is very, very appreciated, but they all speak enough English to get you what you want (booze, food, etc). The swim up bars are awesome. Some bring travel mugs, which the bartenders are happy to fill with your drink of choice. Unless you're totally chugging, your drink is going to get flat/warm pretty fast, but it is eco-friendly. The beachfront shops are convenient - they aren't too aggressive, either. We saw three weddings in the 5 days we were there - made even the hardest cynic get all mushy. The only thing that was a slight drawback - if they ask you if you've gotten your lobster dinner or gift basket, be advised that you must sit through a personalized time-share presentation that takes hours. UGH. We got our gift baskets filled with mamajuana, a cigar, vanilla - and spending time with the Dominican time share guys was actually kind of fun - drinks at 10am? Why not?? Dance with your time share seller? Why not? I appreciated the time out of the sun, had some fun, but it was a little too much time out of our day for something I was not interested in. The Wave Disco played god-awful techno (and I like tehcno!) that pretty much left the dancing to two young German students. Its a shame, because there were lots of people who were ready to dance - when you have 40 people standing around & two people on the dance floor, it's time to change the music. They did have a Latino night, and that was the only time anyone else really danced.

Anyone who has complained about this place is either ultra picky or just likes to complain. I would recommend getting the upgrade for a few hundred more dollars per family because you get a few extra perks like the corner villa by the ocean and can walk out to the pool, but I am sure the other villas are just as beautiful. The only complaint the seven of us had was that we all had loose bowels. I'm just being frank. The people were wonderful and friendly and the lanuguage was rarely an issue if you were willing to try to communicate...remember, you are coming to their country, they try to speak english for you, you can at least try to communicate with them. I think that is the key to the whole adventure, you are going to another country. If you don't want to try new foods or speak to someone who doesn't know your language, then you should stay in your own country. A few words of advice: Take an insulated mug. I got three of them from Wal-Mart for 5.97 each they were 34 oz Bubba Kegs. The bartenders will fill them with whatever you want, and will add as much liquor as you tell them to, the lid keeps the sand out and drinks from spilling and they stay cold and last much longer than having the small dixie sized cups. Remember to tip your bartender and service staff. You don't have to, but when you see the huge white smile they give or get a firm hug or handshake, that small tip is well worth it. One night we has the best service we have ever had, even here at home. We were at the Itallian restaurant, but that doesn't matter because the same people work many different places, you see them morning, noon and night at three different locations. Anyway, after we had that wonderful service, we left the waiter 20.00. He came running out of the restaurant thanking us with a warm smile and huge hugs and handshakes. Would you ever see that in the states? I think the trip is what you make of it. My friend and I got involved in the daily activities and the pool staff got to know us. They lovingly began to refer to me as Jumpy and would greet me daily. There are beach games and water games, you just have to listen for Renaldo to invite you to participate. If you have teenagers, encourage them to meet other kids, it makes the trip much more memorable if they can hang out with kids their age and go to the disco or theatre together or hang out by the pool or play a game of volleyball. The grounds are secure and have guards posted at every entrance, even the beach at night. I never felt like I was not safe. Unless you have an Ocean Blue bracelet on(which you have to wear the whole trip) you don't get in. Other reviews have mentioned the flea market. It seems that they all start at 165.00 but I was able to get a necklace, bracelet, earrings, pendant, and small shell necklace for my daughter for 20 usd. The pieces you see at the flea market are not nearly the quality of the jewelry store, but not nearly the price either. Some venders are willing to negotiate and some are not. You will see nearly the same pieces at all of the stands, just walk away and go to the next one. I only had that problem one time. The hotel does bring in a group of vendors on Friday night. I got great deals at it and it was much nicer than going to the beach. Remember, they want your money so they are aggressive but don't let that bother you just have fun with it. I could go on and on about the place. We just loved it. If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me.

The resort is quite large, covering many more acres than other Caribbean resorts we've visted. We found the property to be clean and well-maintained, with two beautiful pools and a great beach area for walking, kayaking, swimming, and more. Compared to the beaches we have experienced in Mexico, we found the actual beach to be Punta Cana's real advantage (less seaweed, milder waves, wider beach area, larger swimming area, bright turquoise water for miles). Walking and jogging on the beach was great in either direction, and you could go for miles seeing lots of other resorts along the way. Our room was kept very clean, and it was very satisfactory in terms of furnishings, decor, etc. It was nice that there were a few US TV stations available in the room so that we could get news updates, etc. We found the food options plentiful, with both the main buffet and the buffet by the beach having many choices. Breakfast buffets were especially amazing and not to be missed at the main restaurant. We enjoyed the Route 66 American restaurant, and the Dominican restaurant for a little change of pace from the buffet. One thing to note related to the restaurants is that 3 of the a la carte restaurants require long pants for men. We hadn't read or heard that prior to departure, but fortunately we did have something that would suffice for everyone. Just something to be prepared for in packing. In addition to the sun, sand, and pool, we enjoyed services from the spa (massages and pedicure), and found the spa to be very clean and beautiful. The nightly shows and music in the lobby were enjoyable, and the bowling alley with pool tables/ping pong tables were a hit with the kids. We chose to go on the Outback Safari Tour excursion, having read other people's positive comments about their experience, and we were very glad that we did. The guide was wonderful, and the tour gave us the opportunity to see so much more of the country and understand the culture so much more than we would have otherwise. We highly recommend this excursion as a day trip during a stay in the Punta Cana area. The only slight drawback to this experience compared to our visits to resorts in Cancun and the Mayan Riveria was the customer service. In the restaurants and at the beach bar especially, the service was quite slow and a little impersonal at times. The overall hospitality from resort staff wasn't quite as gracious as we had experienced other places. Not a major problem, but a difference worth noting.
