After a five night stay there, we cannot see what all the fuss is about, if ever a place was over - hyped it is this one. This is an average apartment complex which is extremely overpriced. Staff on the reception and in the bar seem to be efficient and personable. The maid working our landing was a miserable old boot who didn't even show any acknowlegement. We paid \u00a3400 for the 5 nights and in Palma Nova at the end of October, this is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. We had a one bedroom apartment with sea view - it was room 602 and it probably has one of the best views in the complex, which was a positive, so if you must stay here, it may be worthwhile asking for this room. You pay extra for the view and we could tell that other rooms would have had a view blocked by the trees. The room was large, but only had one electrical socket hidden behind a sideboard in the living room. The toilet wouldn't flush properley and the walls were very thin, noises and voices carried from both inside the apartment and from on the balconies. The apartment needs updating / upgrading. Whenever the window was open the doors in the apartment rattled incessantly in their frames, even when they were properly closed. It is true what other reviewers have said about the waterproof towels..they have to be experienced to be believed. The safety deposit boxes are in the reception area and this is a major inconvenience, they ought to be in the rooms where you can access them whenever you want to, instead of having to trek down to the lobby. The complex is a fair old walk into Palma Nova (and uphill on the way back) so if you are thinking of staying here you will have to make this trek to get to the 'facilities' of the resort. Most of the other guests seemed to be middle aged and middle class Scandinavians (heaven knows what they were doing in this resort) which , apart from the small area close to where the Ponent Mar is,seems to be frequented by roaming packs of the most downmarket tattooed underclass. There are wall to wall bars showing constant football or the tackiest of the tacky...karaoke. If you really want to see our tourists in all their glory though, take a walk into the neighbouring hell that is Magaluf, because Palma Nova is like St. Tropez in comparison. Won't be back to this grim resort in a hurry and wouldn't stay in Ponent Mar if we did..not because we had any particular problems because we didn't, but I'm sure that there are better (and cheaper) places to stay. Future bookers take note and don't believe the hype about this place, and end up paying through the nose for somewhere distinctly ordinary.", "title": "Reality check", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "hesketh27", "date": "October 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 21379752, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 good sea view, nice class of guests", "disliked": "\u2014 poor sound insulation, lack of safe in the room, rattling doors!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Myself, my husband and two children aged 7 and 10 arrived at the Ponent Mar in Palmanova on 20th September 2008.", "title": "VERY VERY AVERAGE", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "majorca1", "date": "October 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "business": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 20582426}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our first impression was that the hotel staff were very very friendly, it was clean and tidy and apart from the fairly steep hill up from the beach, the location was ok", "title": "Good spot", "user": "Irishman1980", "date": "October 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 20570426, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location and view", "disliked": "\u2014 towels and cold swimming pool"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went out for a meal at night and arrived back to the hotel at 11pm (late enought for two young children) As we walked through reception the music from the bar area was really really loud but we didnt for one second think that it would be as loud as what it was in the room.", "title": "Would definitely go back!", "user": "TashaBSolihull", "date": "September 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 20398402, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything shuts at 12!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband phone reception 5 times until the phone rang off (the receptionist couldnt hear it) He ended up going down and speaking to reception.
