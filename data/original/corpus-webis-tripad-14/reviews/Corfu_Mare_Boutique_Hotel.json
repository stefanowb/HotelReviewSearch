However, no way would you call it stylish. It is excellent in many respects - breakfast is plentiful and the hotel itself is very clean. Linen is good and fresh and bathrooms are also very good with plenty of good toiletries. Excellent shower.

Public transport is available but not late evening as buses stop early. The walk into town is not great being through a rather boring built up area or along a busy coastal road - a dual carriageway. A hire car is pretty much a necessity.

The north is generally very hilly and extremely green at this time of the year - very lush. This is Greece. However what we saw of the south of the island especially around Benitses is absolutely horrendous with potholed busy roads, rocky tiny beaches and grotty scenery. Maybe it gets a bit better further south but we saw no evidence of that. Paleokastritses at this time of year is beautiful and well worth the effort. The north east is the better bet once you have got clear of the Corfu Town hinterland.", "title": "Great hotel, ok location", "user": "prdisaac", "date": "October 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 180330210}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "All in all we had a lovely time but would never come during the season.

The well balanced ambiance combines the exceptional elegance of the Venetian architecture with the serenity of the green-blue shades of the Corfiot landscape. In the garden there is a pool with an incorporated Jacuzzi and inside the hotel offers a bar, a relaxing lounge area and a welcoming lobby all featuring contemporary decor and furnishings."}
