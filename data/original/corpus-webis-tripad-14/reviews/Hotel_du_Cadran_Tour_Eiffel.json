Yes, the rooms are a bit worn but then there is a renovation in the works t according to the photo in the lobby and the room we saw(courtesy of housekeeping) it will be ultra contemporary (alas paris seems to be going that way). however, that's the slightly downside. The location is perfect, the rooms are clean with nice amenties and our room had a view of the top half of the Eifel Tower. For pricey Paris, thought we got an ok deal with breakfast (which is very good) and a two day museum pass. It is a slight walk from the metro but then don't even consider Paris if you don't like to walk.

We only had two issues, the closet in this room was more like a cabinet without a bottom in it. The cabinet took up most of the wall space on one side of the bed and if you weren't careful could hurt yourself (which we did a couple of times). The other issue was the shower, there isn't a shower curtain so by the time your done water was everywhere and there isn't a shelf to put soap, shampoo, etc. All in all minor things we could live with and we would definately stay here again. I went in a friends room, 404, and it was a corner room with two windows, also with a view of the Eiffel. This room was much larger, has a bathtub with a shower and full sized closet.

I have to say I was very impressed. The location was excellent. The hotel is situated within a two minute walk to L\u2019 Ecole Militaire metro station. You could walk to the Champ de Mars and get a great view of the Eiffel Tower within ten minutes. We would often walk to see it lit up at night. It was so good having this icon so close. In fact all the great sights were within about a 30 minute walk of the hotel. However my favourite and lasting memory was the Cadran\u2019s proximity to Rue Cler. The fresh food markets on Rue Cler were so fantastic. We sampled everything from crepes, to cheeses, wine and bread. I felt we had the ultimate Parisian experience right at our doorstep. There were also a number of nice bars and restaurants around the area. The staff at the Cadran were friendly (with one exception) and knowledgeable. The rooms were not enormous but I thought were good quality for the price. Unfortunately our bath plug was faulty so we couldn\u2019t have baths but that is a minor complaint. Another minor problem was the air-conditioning. The room was quite hot at night and the air-conditioning didn\u2019t seem to work. The stay was also somewhat marred by the arrogance of one staff member, a grumpy old man, who was on reception the night before we left. We had paid to use the internet for half an hour, however 5 minutes into our session the hotel computer crashed. When I went and told the grumpy old man what had happened his response was: \u201cSo what do you want me to do about it\u201d? I had never experienced such rudeness our entire stay and found his attitude very frustrating. We explained that we needed him to re-enter the password into the computer. However he was still too lazy to do his job, so he gave me the password, \u201cCADRAN\u201d. So if you do stay here give that password a try for some free internet time. Also on our final day, our stay was further marred by the airport pick up service that the hotel had arranged. Our car failed to turn up. This probably was not the fault of the hotel, but I remain slightly sceptical. But enough of the negatives. In all it was a very positive experience staying here.
