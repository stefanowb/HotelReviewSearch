Taxis etc were arranged by reception and arrived promptly, clean taxis with good English. The pool area was fine, the restaurant / bar is good and the food cooked fresh for every order, even breakfast. No buffets and cold food sitting in bain marie at 7.30am! My wife had a spa and massage and said it was good.
