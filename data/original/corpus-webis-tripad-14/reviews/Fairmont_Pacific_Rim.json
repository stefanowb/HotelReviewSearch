We were even supplied an I Pad for personal use whilst at the hotel. Staff, comfort and cleanliness not to mention the location ensured we had made a wonderful choice. Our initial stay was for 4 nights (ie 8 May 2013 - 12 May 2013)in a city view room and a second stay (16 May to 18 May 2013), this time the hotel placed us in a waterfront view room. How breathtaking it was. Thank you Fairmont Pacific Rim, you have ensured that our stays will remain memorable. Right down to the turning down of the bed with the slippers on stand-by. TV's in the bathroom mirror, this was a brilliant new innovation for us.
