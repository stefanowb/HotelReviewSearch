This was her first visit to Scotland and she was very excited about the hotel as it looked great on the internet. On arrival the receptionist booked her in and did so by sitting behind a desk and not even smiling! Room was well decorated but very dusty. Public areas could have done with a good clean. Kettle could not be used as dirty water had been left in the bottom. On the plus side my friend said the breakfast was nice.
