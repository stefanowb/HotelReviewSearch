We arrived early and were able to check in right away. The Lobby is beautiful and the whole complex was keep up well. You can tell this resort is fairly new. Our room was in the 5th building with 2 bedrooms and 2 baths overlooking the HWY. Everything was very clean & we had no issues at all with our room. My 3 and 1 year old slept very well!! The pool was amazing and warm in the sun, the other heated pool felt like bath water. There are 4 hot tubs total. We ate at the Irish pub, the pool bar and the pizza hut all were good. Also love being walking distance to the outlet mall. They have some good stores. We rented a car, so no need for other transportation. Walmart was literally a 5 min drive we were able to get all our groceries in one shot!

Our only option was for 2 x 2bed rooms in building 5, which were slightly newer. The kitchen cooking equipment was limited. There was no bottle opener, no can opener., and only a cookie sheet for the oven. Although the pirate ship looks impressive, it is only a feature, you cannot access any of it. It has 1 slide but can only be used when lifeguard is on duty. The heating for the pool is only on sporadically.

Internet service didn't work in our rooms, and I was shocked to see they charge for internet use of the hotel's computers. I thought we were passed that by now with wi-fi. Anyways, we all enjoyed our stay, however, I think the complaint we all had was the location. It's really not a pretty area. The shops make half of the hotel grounds look nice enough, but the other half (buildings 3,4,5) have grounds that are pretty abandoned, like a vacant lot or something. The location of the hotel was not ideal. Not that it was far away, but there are so many other hotels for the same price that are much closer to all the parks. We had a rental car and used it the entire time. So, long story short. The hotel didn't blow us away. The hotel buildings themselves are pretty, but the unfinished/abandoned grounds surrounding part of the hotel and the general unfinished feel of hotel itself led to a feeling of disappointment.

We had a great time at this resort. The best thing I can say of this place is the location is perfect, near disney parks, seaworld, shops, walmart, expressways, airport. It did not take long to get anywhere that we needed to go. Rooms are very clean and large, better than the small rooms at disney resorts. The pool with the pirate ship was great, it is heated, however not much so, we did go swimming at 9:00 at night and it was about 65 degrees and it was comfortable in the pool. I will say that thought the waterslide in the pirate ship is cool, it is pitch black in there and scary at first, be prepared for this. You must be 50\" tall to ride by yourself, otherwise an adult can go down with a child, the landing area in the pool for the slide is 4 feet deep, so small children would not be able to touch the bottom. Some things that I did not like were the hard pillows and the thin walls. When you take a trip to disney it is extremely exhausting, alot of walking and alot to see so you need to have a good place to sleep and recharge your system, I found this place a little lacking in this department. The walls are thin, however we were so tired that this did not prevent us from sleeping. My wife did go to the spa and got a pedicure and a sea salt scrub which she said was the best that she had ever had, she was happy and as us men know when the wife is happy the whole family is happy.
