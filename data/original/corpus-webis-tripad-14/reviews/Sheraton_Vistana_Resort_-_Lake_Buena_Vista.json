First of all, we arrived in the late morning and check-in is not until 4:00. That was a problem since my son's multiple food allergies prompted us to reserve a place with a kitchen so I can cook. Two hungry kids and the front desk insisted that we cannot enter until 4:00. Then we were placed in one of the older units. The small stream of water in the back smelled terrible and upon entering, we examined everything and discovered that some of the silverware in the drawers were not even washed! The unit looked very old and outdated. I called the front desk and insisted on getting a newer unit. At first they told us none were available and when I insisted further, voila, a unit suddenly materialized in the Lakes Section. That unit was decent, with a view of the pool. For the most part the place was somewhat clean except the track of the shower door which held a hefty supply of soap scum and hair which was never cleaned, cleverly hidden by the floor mat placed right on top of it. Yuck! Every day, the housekeeper would make it a point to make fancy folded designs out of the last paper towel hanging. I would have appreciated a little more attention in the bathroom instead. The same placemats were placed on the table every day, stains and all. Other things that bothered me was that the pool never had a lifeguard on duty and my \"personal concierge\" never ever called other than to leave messages about the timeshare presentations. For what we needed the unit for; a place to eat and sleep, it was okay, but I would definitely consider other places in the future.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 1, 2004", "id": 2507139}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "WE DIDN'T GET OUR UNIT CHOICE . . . AND STILL HAD AN OUTSTANDING TIME . . .", "text": "It's important to keep an open mind. I read all the Trip Advisor reviews, and after we made our six-months-in-advance reservations, I sent an email requesting Cascades. I even reminded them again just before we left. At first, we were disappointed when we were assigned to Fountains, but as it turned out, we couldn't have been happier. We had a 2-bedroom villa. The two kids had their own bedroom and TV, so they were relatively independent. The kitchen had everything we needed to create a good breakfast at a reasonable cost to begin each day. The unit was about 1000 square feet and included two bathrooms and a washer/dryer. It was a short walk to a very enjoyable pool at Cascades. But after we explored a little, our favorite was the SuperPool at Spas. And they also had a huge and relaxing hot tub. We went after supper every evening. We accepted the offer to attend the time-share presentation, as they gave us a great deal on Universal tickets. The discussion was professional, personable, and without pressure. It had some very strong upsides, and we almost took it, but decided, cerebrally, that it just was too limiting for our vacation inclinations. We were there for nine days, and had plenty of time to look at the different sections. They were all very similar, and all had the potential for a great vacation. We took close looks at Cascades, Fountains, Lakes, Spas, and Falls, and we would have been happy in any of them. If you want Four Seasons luxury, this won't make you happy. But if you've got a family and you're looking for large accomodations that are clean, in a good location, within a well-maintained environment, and with family-friendly activities, this is an excellent choice. Here are a few tips: we reserved through Expedia and got a great price. We rented a car through E-Z Car Rental. Shuttle at airport and good prices, although the sign-in line was long and slow. We did non-Disney trips to Kennedy, Seaworld, Universal, and Silver Springs, and Orlando attractions like Titanic and Ripley's, so having control of our transportation made life less stressful. There are plenty of grocery stores within easy driving distance, so buying food is no problem.

We went to the Resort on a Time-Share Presentation offer. The 90 minute presentation and $100 cash was worth going through for this resort. We paid a small amount to stay there and were in a fabulous 2 bed/2 bath villa. We were treated very kindly. The only complaint was some of the guest service people did not know their directions for the surrounding area of the resort. Kinda had to figure it all out on our own. Took advantage of the free photo session with the resort. Would not do that again. Fine photos but we paid over $50 for color printer pictures, not \"real\" photos. I do this all the time at home and hate how they stick on the glass when put in frames. But, I pay pennies for the copies, not $50.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 11, 2004", "id": 2442199}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice, \"homie\" feel.", "text": "Still would highly recommend the resort and hope to go back some day!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 7, 2004", "id": 2428103}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Returned yesterday from a 7 day trip.

My party stayed in FALLS and though it is one of the older sections, it is still a quite nice place to stay. Our villa had a big kitchen and living room/dining room, a nice sized master bedroom, and another bedroom with two twin sized beds. It was nothing really fancy, but it felt like a nice \"homie\" place. We were very close to all the pools, which are very nice places to go in the evenings. The best pool to go if you are looking for peace and quiet is the Courts pool. At night time, the pool by Zimmie's (an on site restaurant and bar) is always fun, as they have entertainment and karaoke. The Vistana resort was a lot of fun, but next time i would like to stay in one of the newer portions, as they seem very beautiful.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 4, 2004", "id": 2381615}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2004", "text": "Stay 1 week, July 17-24. Requested either Cascade or The Lakes. Was told by the resort, to arrive on a Sat. to be assured a Cascade Unit. So, we arranged our trip accordingly, even, staying one night, so that we would arrive on Sat. Well!!, when we checked in, I was told that all the units had been reserved on FRIDAY. I was assinged a bottom unit in the Fountains. After looking at the unit, I was dissapointed and went back to see how they could accomodate me. After endless conversation, I took a unit on the third floor of the Fountains. Yes, you have to climb the stairs, but the skylight gives the unit a much more open feel. The unit was clean, and very accessible to the entrance. The Fountains Pool, was frequented by drunk locals almost every night. Security did nothing about it, when it was clearly posted no alcohol allowed. They said they come in every night. I called the front desk, and was assured I must be mistaken.

I think it was quite dirty, and then, the cover for the bed had holes. It was DISGUSTING. Overall, the ROOM was dirty, even though the room was \"new\".

Don't go to the supermarkets around the resort, because they charge MORE. Same with the gas stations as well. You guys should definately try out Bahamas Breeze, because it's a great restaurant.
