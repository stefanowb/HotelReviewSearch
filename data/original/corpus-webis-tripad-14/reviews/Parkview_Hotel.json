Mini-fridge and coffee-maker, iron, hair dryer, flat-screen TV. Bathroom was big enough, double-head shower, extra towels. We called down to ask for extra coffee packets, and it was delivered up to us within a few minutes. We asked at the front desk about getting a ride to Armory Square to go to Irish bars, and the desk person immediately got the shuttle driver to take us. The shuttle driver told us which places to go, and even gave us a phone number for the best taxi service to use to return to the hotel as he would be off duty when we wanted to return (late at night!) Check-in and check-out each took about 3 minutes. Lobby is very pretty - TV, fireplace, comfy couch, and free internet to check e-mails. Parking was easy (and free) and close to every place that we wanted to go. I would stay here again - just very charming and comfortable.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Julezz", "date": "March 20, 2006", "id": 4700409}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Why is this hotel in Syracuse????", "text": "What a wonderful surprise for such a dreadful city!!! We were visiting SUNY ESF and booked one night at the Parkview and wow were we impressed. Great big rooms, we were upgraded for free to a suite with a huge king size bed, duvet comforters and featherbeds, wonderful 2 person shower with 2 shower heads, flat screen TV and to boot, a wonderful cafe located inside the hotel that served all fair trade and organice coffees and teas! If only it were in a better city we would stay all the time.
