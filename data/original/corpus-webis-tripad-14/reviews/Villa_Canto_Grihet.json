She gave us such great suggestions for seeing the region--places not highlighted in our travel books that were by far our favorite sites during our visit. Vence is wonderful and I would highly recommend it over St. Paul de-Vence. The Villa is a very short walk from the charming old part of the city. It was a short drive down to the beach, but I would recommend the drive to the other mountain top villages. Claude France can recommend. The rooms were lovely (we stayed in the baou room, which had a wonderful view of the stars), a perfect size, and the yard and home were really spectacular.

The location was perfect, within walking distance to great restaurants and art galleries. Even though the villa is located close to town, you still feel as if you have escaped to a rural country estate. It was quite and peaceful. Our room was the \"Baou\" room, which was very romantic with skylights and a beautiful olive wood bathtub. I have no negative aspects to point out, and would love to stay again.
