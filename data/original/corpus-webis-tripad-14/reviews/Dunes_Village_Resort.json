We did get lost trying to figure out which side to go up in to find out room but figured it out quickly and got to our room. The room was very nice and clean with a beautiful view. My boys slept in the murphy bed on the first night, then in the sleeper sofa and slept well on both. I have read reviews saying the beds were hard but we found them to be very comfortable! My parents came down for a few days and had a King Oceanfront room in the Palmetto Tower, which was also very clean and they slept real well on their bed.", "title": "Wonderful Stay!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jillnc", "date": "October 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20729008, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything!", "disliked": "\u2014 Busy weekend"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Relax & Enjoy Dunes Village", "text": "Both towers had great housekeeping.

Palmetto Tower has a long lazy river, couple hot tubs and 2 slides. We enjoyed all of it very much. You do have to be careful on Friday and Saturday nights when it gets busier and teens/older kids are playing in there.
