I arrived in a bit of a bad mood, having managed to get lost trying to find the hotel after arriving at the bus station (it's actually only about 10 minutes walk from the town centre, if you've got a half decent map and - unlike me - a passable sense of direction, then you shouldn't have any trouble finding it!) and I was booked in quickly and efficiently by a friendly lady on reception, who to my relief, as my Spanish is virtually non-existant, spoke perfect English. So, to my room....I have to say, that for a 4 star hotel, the room was a lot smaller than I was expecting. Also, I was hoping there might have been a mini-bar, or at least a fridge in which I could have chilled a few beers. And it would have been nice to have had tea/coffee making facilities as well. Apart from that though, everything else was ok - it was all clean, I had a nice ensuite, which had bath, shower and bidet, the bed was comfortable, there was a big wardrobe. The TV was only a portable, and it only had 2 English language channels, both of which were news (CNN and BBC world) but then I don't go on holiday to watch TV. I think I was definitely in one of their 'budget' rooms, but for the price I paid I don't have any complaints at all. What else can I tell you? Well, there's a nice pool area, clean, with plenty of sunloungers, and the food was generally good. The breakfast buffet had a good selection of hot and cold food, occasionally a few of the cooked items were a bit lukewarm, but on the whole the quality was fine. I also ate in the 'a la carte' restaurant a couple of times, and thought that was good as well. All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful, and spoke good English.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jadawi", "date": "September 4, 2007", "id": 8654967}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Hotel Cristina for our Honeymoon arriving on New Years Eve 2005.
