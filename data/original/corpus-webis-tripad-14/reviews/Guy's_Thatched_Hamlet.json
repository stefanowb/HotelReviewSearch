When we arrived and checked in my partner asked to confirm the time of the booking for the evening meal and they had us booked in an hour earlier than my partner had asked and sighed when we wanted it changing. We went for a drink which was good and the bar staff were very helpful. We went for the meal, ordered and our started was taken to another table and then waited for around 30mins for our main course. The food wasn't good enough for what they charged, I've had better meals at half the cost. We went back to the room and then the noise began and carried on till 4:30am. We did complain to the manager at around 1:30am and asked if we could be moved to another room. The manager did speak to the couple in the next room and there was silence for all of 30 seconds. We could hear everything the couple were doing and saying and I mean EVERTHYING. If we hadn't had a drink I would of left. Breakfast, well I wish I hadn't bothered, total waste of more money.

As we were staying on a Friday evening we took full advantage of their 'Friday Feeling' offer which was a fab price of \u00a380 per night, including \u00a320 off an evening meal in the restaurant with \u00bd a bottle of red or white wine and full english breakfast. Having read the mixed reviews I wasn't expecting too much especially from the accommodation but how wrong were we! I arrived before my husband and was shown directions to my room by a very helpful receptionist. We were allocated room 27 which must be in a new/refurbished area of the complex as it was like new, a spotless, modern room - bathroom was spacious and absolutely spotless. We booked into the eating establishment that evening and after a quick drink at the bar our table was ready. The food was excellent, the wine was good, service was excellent - we had a great evening. Next morning we were up early and first in for breakfast, our papers which we had ordered the evening before were waiting for us when we arrived and we were quickly shown to a table. The breakfast is self service, with plenty of choice, everything was fresh and good quality. Unfortunately, we didn't get chance to fully explore all that Guys had to offer but we will definitely return for a further investigation!!
