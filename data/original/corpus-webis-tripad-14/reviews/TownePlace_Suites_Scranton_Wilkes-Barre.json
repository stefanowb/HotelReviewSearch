After sitting in a lobby for 25 min. no one even started working in the room. So I had to remind it again. After being in the lobby for a total of 1hr. 15 min I was able to come to my room. I asked management not to overlook this issue for the rest of my staying. So the next morning they decided to make cleaning at 9:20AM when I was in the shower.

Great idea! I have been staying in a King studio. It is a little smaller than similar rooms I have stayed at in other hotels. It might be a little cramped for more than two people. Lots of cabinets to store your stuff, a small closet just inside the entry, a bigger closet in the bathroom, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, and two burners for cooking. There isn't a kitchen table and chairs, but there is a table with wheels that fits under the desk. I love this because you can put it anywhere you want for eating or your computer. Furniture is comfortable, though the bed is a little firm for my taste. I travel for work so when I go somewhere I'm there for 10 to 11 days.

Part of a Marriott complex with multiple hotels brands nearby (Comfort Inn, Spring Hill Suites, etc.). Staff were friendly and building was clean. A buffet breakfast was included featuring mostly cold foods like yogurt and bananas but also some breakfast sandwiches that were okay. Our main complaint was the design of the guest room. We are a family of four and reserved a room with a king bed and sofa bed for the kids. We arrived late and were disappointed that we had to make up the bed ourselves. In addition, the room was set up so that when the sofa bed was pulled out it divided the room in half with no space to walk between the king bed and sofa bed. A few other odd design choices: main closet in the bathroom rather than near the entryway, waste basket in a cupboard under the bathroom sink (so took us a minute to find), small square pillows for the bed instead of standard size pillows, smaller TV situated parallel to the bed (although you could swivel for viewing). A lot of space wasted on a large desk with a hutch that seems like it would never be used unless someone set up an office there and brought all of their books and binders along. There was a kitchenette in the entryway with a small stove, microwave and a large dishwasher that could be useful for someone.
