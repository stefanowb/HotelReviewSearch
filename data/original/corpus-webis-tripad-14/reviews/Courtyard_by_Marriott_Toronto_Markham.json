The assistant was over at the Bistro buying food, which wasnt a major problem to me. We checked in and headed up the elevator. I might add the lobby is very modern and I love the decor. The carpet on the second floor smelled a little foul, i guess like any hotel does. We enter the room and it was very spacious and we were very satisfied with the size. The downside was the smoke alarm kept beeping intermittently for the first night. We didnt know what it was so left it alone. The Air conditioning/heat was taking no settnings that we input and was working on a mind of its own. The second night, the smoke detector got worst and i called the front desk. A gentleman came up and said he was going to change the battery. He then proceeded to take the chair we had for sitting on in our room, and laid a towel out and stood on it to change the battery in the smoke detector. Now I believe this is totally unacceptable as a maintenance man should walk with a ladder. I then asked him to look at the Air Conditioning control and the gentleman proceeded to go to the Unit. He as a maintenance man should know that the Temperature is controlled by a control on the wall by the bathroom and not the unit itself as the knobs are broken off. I then realized he did not know what he was doing and didnt want him to screw it up, so I asked him to leave.", "title": "Modern Hotel", "user": "Shaun S", "date": "October 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 143048573}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We just got back from a weekend away in Toronto for a dance competition.

We loved the artwork on the walls (wished we could have taken it home with us), it had an asian flare and went well with the rest of the decor. The fitness room was nice and there were even headphones to plug into the TV's, which was great since I forgot mine. The location was perfect for what we came to Markham for, To EAT!

There is nothing super wrong with this hotel, especially as an overnight road trip stop; however, given the wealth of hotels in the area, I imagine that most travelers can do better. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating, which is always appreciated. The hallways showed a lot of wear and tear, but the room itself was very clean and appeared to have been recently updated, so perhaps the common areas will soon see a facelift. The theme throughout had a minimalist Asian tone with burnt oranges, umbers, and reds, punctuated by the occasional photograph of a row of rain drops or some other Zen like photograph. The arrangement of the room was unique, with the bed facing the window and the dresser and TV off to the side. Some may not like this arrangement, but I found it refreshing. It seemed to open-up the space. The shower had hot water. The pressure was sufficient but not great. The biggest draw-back, for me, was how crazy expensive the breakfast offerings were. Coffee was gratis, but other than that, a hefty price had to be paid for what items were on their limited menu. I found it amazing that they were charging the prices that they were for basic breakfast items, when so many chain hotels at least offer a continental breakfast, and in many cases much more, for free. The whole breakfast experience made me feel as if I was being taken to the cleaners (unfairly parted with my money, for those who don't understand that American idiom). You will see that I also review another Courtyard Marriott, which was part of this same trip. If I had not already booked this hotel, I would have chosen something different, based on my experience here. If you do stay, I don't think that you will be disappointed with the stay, in general, but plan on eating someplace else and keep in mind that you can probably find better value for the money.", "title": "Somewhat disappointing", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LoveJBM", "date": "January 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 149326783}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Great location!
