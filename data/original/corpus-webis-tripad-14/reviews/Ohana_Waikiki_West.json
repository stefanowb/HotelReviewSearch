Upon arrival this time, we were put into a kitchenette (an upgrade), but it was dark and depressing. We went to the front desk and were told nothing was available, but to check back the next morning. We did check back, and they worked very hard and got us a great room (city view on the 11th floor) for a little extra charge each night. It was worth every penny we spent for the upgrade. The maid service was excellent and she was as honest and friendly as could be. It seemed that she would be sure and get in there to clean the minute we stepped out. The hotel is conveniently located so that you can walk or take a bus to just about anywhere you want to go. I only wish we would have walked towards town a little sooner, because there were lots of other places to eat and see that direction (both on the main streets and the beach). As everyone has stated, the elevators are slow, but be patient. The stairs are always an option. All in all, if you want a great value and a clean place to stay, this is it.
