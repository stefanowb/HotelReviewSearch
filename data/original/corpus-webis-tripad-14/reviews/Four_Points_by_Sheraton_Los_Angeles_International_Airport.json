We travel in and out of the US via LAX so the location is perfect for us. If you're in LA on holiday, there are much better locations to stay, but if you're here for business and connecting through LAX, it's hard to beat. You can check in and check out at any time during the day or night, so you're not stuck with that problem of arriving at LAX at dawn, only to be told by reception that your room will not be available until after lunch. The Starwood Preferred Guest system works well and we often get a room upgrade - try not to stay in the Tower but ask for one of the recently renovated rooms on the upper floors of the main building. The new rooms have a strange designer storage system, where you put your stuff in cartons, instead of drawers, but it's no big deal. Four Points has retired the old polyester bed covers and linens, so the beds are comfortable and clean. Check-in could be faster, because they're usually short-staffed, but we like the people and put up with the wait. The coffee shop is over-priced and the breakfast is not great if you prefer to eat healthy, so we drive a mile to Trader Joe's and buy our own ingredients, stopping at Starbuck's along the way. If you don't have a car you can walk to the Starbucks next door in the Marriott. There's an ACE car rental office in the hotel which simplifies returning your car, and Budget car rental is directly across the road. ACE counter staff are incredibly slow at checking out cars, and if there are two or three customers waiting you'll spend at least an hour in line. We've never had any problems with ACE cars and they're much cheaper than Budget, but there are some horror stories about them online that you might want to read before renting - buyer beware. Parking at Four Points is $15 per day, you can usually get an undercover spot which is unusual for the LAX area, and the parking is on the hotel property - unlike the nearby Sheraton which offers parking at a remote site out back of the hotel strip. If you're accustomed to the service levels of a four star or five star hotel in Asia, the Four Points at LAX will come as a major shock - you get your own luggage out of the car, you put it on a luggage cart yourself, and you push it to check-in by yourself - usually while the guys at the concierge desk watch you. But you can get a room more or less any time during the year at under $100, there's a fridge in the room and the internet's free - so if you're a business traveler without a lot of luggage, this hotel saves you money on tips and it's really convenient.", "title": "Not a bad place to overnight near LAX", "user": "stevenUsa", "date": "September 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 118156361}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Nice, clean Sheraton hotel.
