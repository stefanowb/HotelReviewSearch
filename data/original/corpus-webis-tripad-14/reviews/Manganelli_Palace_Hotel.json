The room was clean, had plenty of room and a small balcony; however, there was no fresco of any kind, just white paint (room right off of the breakfast room). The staff was very friendly and most spoke good English. All of the recommendations they gave me were helpful. I really liked two restaurants near the piazza for Italian seafood dishes: Sicilia in Bocca and Osteria Antica Sicilia. I did a day-trip via bus to Taormina and recommend it. The ruins there are really well-preserved and there are lots of shops, cafes and restaurants to enjoy. You catch the blue buses in a lot two blocks from the main bus station. The tickets are bought at an office one block from the lot. I also did the afternoon trip to Mount Etna. I wanted the morning trip, but the company moved me due to another couple wanting the cave tour, which was nothing special. Francesca was a good tour guide who provided useful information. If you are into markets, make sure to check out the fish market by the duomo and the flea market not too far from Manganelli Palace which has a variety of things.", "title": "Great location with helpful staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mkmpls", "date": "February 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 151338155}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Manganelli Palace is perfectly situated close to the city centre of Catania.

It is lively busy on Saturday outside and until late night quite noisy, which can be heard inside, despite the curtains and windows. Easiliy reachable with bus 457 from the airport. Buy the busticket (\u20ac 1.50 vs a taxi \u20ac 20) inside the airport (the outside ticketcentre is not always occupied). If it is late take a taxi. Get off at Piazza del Duomo, walk straight across the Duomo square / piazza del Duomo past the church and get on the shopping street Via Etnea. Then take the 3rd street to the right or ask the many police officers the Piazza Manganelli.The hotel is somehow odd, an elevator to the reception on the 3rd floor and the rooms through another elevator (2 buildings, which are glued together). The air conditioning and safe did not work properly, the shower is great, but water leaks under the glass (room 303), giving you wet feet on a necessary towel on the floor. Simple breakfast in a small space, but the price is fine. Watch out for the quiet spots around the quiet neighbourhood of the market. We were almost robbed by a thief on a scooter (also happens in NL). Take a tour to Mount Etna (half a day \u20ac 49, pricey but the enthusiastic tour leader Francesca offers you a good and enthousiastic story). 3 days Catania, but 2.5 days would have been sufficient.

Well, remodeling, fare enough I should say, humidity won't do much good to those frescoes. Rooms are very nice, and the bed is comfy. You also have safe, and all the usual amenities.

The water pressure is a bit of a nuisance, at least in my room, a friend of mine, staying in the other room had no complaints. Basically, a very decent stay, pity for the modern feel and the utter feeling of remodeling present everywhere in the common areas.
