This place is very safe and after reading the local Toledo newspaper we were even more pleased to know that this place is \"safer\" than downtown Toledo as we had a lot of valuable memorabilia in the SUV that was parked in the lot. Our room was very clean, quiet and spacious. The water pressure of the shower was good and the toiletries were all neutrogena. We ate the 9.99 American Buffet Breakfast which was more than enough and the person serving us did a great job. She was very attentive unlike some buffet restaurants where no one ever comes back to refill your coffee, juice or take your order. You can also take Starbucks coffee from the buffet breakfast to go.
