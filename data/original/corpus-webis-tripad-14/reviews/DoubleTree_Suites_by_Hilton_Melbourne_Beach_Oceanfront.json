When I got home I immediately put all the clothes in the dryer and then washed them. I left all the suitcases and other bags in black trash bags and left them on the deck in the heat.

The pool and whirlpool were well kept and enjoyed by all--close access to beach with beach service. The laudromat was clean and easy to use. The warm, fresh cookies available any time were a nice touch! Unfortunately the restaurant was really slow---the food was good just took a really long time to get it! Don't go there if you are really hungry. The neighboring restaurant Squid's Lips was wonderful--nice menu with open air on the waterfront. Also enjoyed the Eco SUP trip (stand up paddleboarding).

The fruit was good but that was the only thing on the breakfast buffet that was worth paying for. We didn't use the vouchers the next morning and, instead, went to get breakfast elsewhere.

Yes that means you have windows that can open on both sides of the room! That is extremely hard to find these days.

The instructions in the room give a tech support number to call so I did that. After spending 15 minutes on the phone with a technician, he determined that the cable must be bad. I ran down (thru the bugs) to the front desk in hopes of picking up a new ethernet cable. No such luck. I was informed that maintenance would try to find another one but no promises. About 40 minutes later we were given a new cable but this one didn't work either.
