Its made up of little townhouses. 2 units upstairs and 2 down. It was so welcome to not have too many neighbors. The property offers a breakfast buffet and snacks at night which I skipped. They have great laundry facilites with 5 washers and 6 driers! My room had a full kitchen with all the fixings so I was ready to cook as soon as I went grocery shopping (a service they do for you for free if you want). There is even a Trader Joes in the neighborhood! My room had a fireplace (which they sell logs for in the lobby). All in all everything about my stay was great except for the bed. It was so lumpy I couldnt sleep at night. I ended up camping out on the couch where I was much more comfortable.", "title": "Great property, lumpy bed", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "D-is-on-tour", "date": "November 17, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2831321}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Tucson"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 7, "very good": 27, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 34}, "aka": "Residence Inn Tucson Speedway Hotel Tucson", "slim_ranking": 0.377952755906}
