When I went back to the site, indeed I found the announcement labeled, \"Hotel Enhancement Timeline,\" a farily devious title. The construction is problematic. The noise, the standing water (literally puddles), the intermittent (short lived) power outages, and the dust are annoying to say the least. Putting aside the construction, I thought the hotel was just ok. Nothing really special about this hotel, including those areas that have been reconstructed. The staff are ameable, but not nearly on par with Marriott metropolitan hotels in terms of service. I specifically booked and paid for an ocean view room. Technically, they gave me an ocean view room however, it was a corner room with a very small balcony (2 chairs fit, nothing else). Breakfast and appetizers during happy hour were average, not bad, just nothing to write home about. As others have said, forget about communication with the outside world, i.e. internet at this hotel. No wireless in the rooms, however, I was able to connect in the dining area. The parking fee ($14) is ridiculous; clearly, just a money gouging intitiative, much like the \"ocean view\" room. The room itself was clean and fairly spacious, with a small but adequate bathroom. The bed was not great; again, not on par with other Marriott properties, by any stretch, but I didn't have trouble sleeping either; think, poor support.", "title": "Disappointing", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "blondeq", "date": "December 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 121718353}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Overall, the hotel is fine if you can get a room here for under $100 per night, otherwise, you can get much more value for your money at other well reviewed properties on the northeast side of the island.", "title": "SleeplessinKapaa", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Heat31", "date": "December 10, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121578623}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I spent 4 nights at this hotel. The renovations were supposed to be almost completed and when we got there we found that there are major renovations that will take some time to finish. The people we received service from at the bar were friendly and helpful. One problem was there was no in room internet. You had to go to the bar area to get on the internet and the connection there is slow. The worst thing about this place was the bed. The beds looked and felt like they were original to the hotel. My back was hurting by the day we left on the plane back to CA. We had come from a Marriott in Waikola, Hi that had the most comfortable beds ever, to this place where it was like sleeping in our toyhauler bunk.

Try the Maui burger with onion rings and a Mai-Tai. On the only evening when we tried to eat at the Hotel restaurant, the food was TERRIBLE. The pork was overcooked, smelled and tasted \"old\", and was not edible. Management agreed and did take it off our bill, but that evening's dinner was not a satisfactory experience. Except for the evening dining being unacceptable, this was a wonderful experience.
