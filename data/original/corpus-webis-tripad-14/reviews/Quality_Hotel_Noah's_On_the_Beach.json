I was only here for two nights, but I wish it were longer. The hotel is small and comfortable. I had a beach side room and it was well worth it! When I stepped out on the balcony from my room, the New Castle beach was right there-I could almost touch it. The waves late at night and early in the morning were so peaceful. It was winter when I went so the weather wasn't too great. The heating in the room was terrible. It was either unbearably hot or freezing. The comforter on the bed was terrible. It looked old and used- maybe it was the brown orange color that turned me off but I hated it. The bathroom was small and a bit uncomfortable, but the showerhead was great! But the room always smelled clean and new. There were several channels on TV but the wireless internet was not free but was reasonably priced. After I paid it was easily accessible. The restraunt was gorgeous with a glass wall showcasing the ocean view. I would very much recommend this place.", "title": "Beautiful view", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "misstaryn08", "date": "August 14, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8419488}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great location and restaurant", "text": "This property is worth staying at for the location and the restaurant alone.
