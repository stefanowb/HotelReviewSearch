Very impressive atrium and the service is friendly. Attended to by a very charming Jamaican lady at reception. Friendly concierge as well. A big plus is that the metro is linked to the hotel. We did not eat at the hotel so I cannot comment on the food. I must agree with other reviewers on the \"okay-but-not-a-wonderful\" bed but I should not complain because I got an excellent internet rate. Rooms are exceptionally clean and I particularly liked the rooms overlooking the atrium. When I returned after a day's stay at the Reston Hyatt (great beds) for a further two days at the Grand Hyatt in DC we were not given a room overlooking the atrium and it was \"gloomier\" but we were out for most of the day and too tired to care when we returned. Safe to walk at night: Chinatown, movies and a very short cab ride to Union Station. Pleasant walk to the White House.

We also took the Trolley one day which enabled us to cover a lot of ground in easy fashion. It stops in front of the Hyatt.
