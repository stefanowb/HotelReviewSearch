The reception staff was friendly and eager to help (from directions for public transport to recommendations for restaurants). The service was very good and we didn't face any problems (they also changed a light bulb in the bathroom which was out when we got there and which we always forgot to mention to them). The breakfast was very good and there was a big variety to choose from with frequent refills. Heating was good on the 5th floor and although our room was facing the main street it was quiet. The Wi-Fi code we were given was valid for all days and not for 1hr, so we enjoyed the fast internet connection they have. The cleaning service was ok and the room was very spacious (especially the king size bed). The location is excellent, it's 10-15 minutes walk from the city center, a couple of minutes from the Underground stop (Staadpark), there is a bus stop opposite the hotel and there are tram stops for the main lines (1 & 2) one block away. It's not really in the center but it has the advantage that it's quiet.

We rarely had to take a tram to go anywhere. That was definitely nice. The hotel was really quiet, you rarely heard hallway noise and we never heard street noise.
