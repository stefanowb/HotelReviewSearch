The shower is open i.e. no door; and because it was under the stairs, the ceiling sloped and narrowed. My husband is 6'1\" and could barely stand upright in the shower.

There were good and bad things about the hotel but it's definitely not splendid; more like so-so! The rooms are not very large but satisfactory. They are tastefully decorated and the bathroom is a good size. The 'hydro\" shower was a plus. The breakfast was not great. Not a good selection and not the good quality food you would expect from a luxury hotel. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk into teh heart of Florence, but manangeable if you don't mind walking. The main problem with this hotel is the staff. They are indifferent and some don't even try to hide the fact that they detest tourists or Americans or both. I asked one particular gentleman at the front desk to just confirm arrangements that another staff member has made for me. He became annoyed and argumentative with me. I have stayed at many fine hotels and have never been treated this way. You would expect the staff to be polite and try to accomodate you.
