The fans are right above the beds so you are constantly in a draft at night and it's too hot to turn them off. We were most disappointed with the attitude of the receptionist who was most unhelpful. We were required to reconfirm our airport transfers in advance, so we asked Reception to do this for us. The Receptionist reluctantly did the one to Cairns airport at a charge but refused to do our Sydney transfer. She told us that it was a freephone number and to do it from our room.

First, we got a great deal: $470 for flight (Sydney-Cairns return) plus 3 nights accommodation at On The Beach. Second, the location is magnificent. The apartments are located right across the road from the beach and, more importantly during stinger season, they are directly across from the stinger net (the only safe area to swim on the beach). Third, the apartments are spacious, wonderfully set up, and the kitchenette is a great thing to have to cut down on dining costs. Finally, the service is beyond expectations. The owners were extremely nice and hospitable. They recommended a wonderful tour company for exploring the reef (Seastar tours) and they gave us great restaurant tips. They also gave us a tip that the local grocery store (which is about a 20 minute walk away) would drive us back to our hotel for free if we spent over 30 bucks there. Even nicer, we had a late flight and we want to spend the day relaxing on the beach. So, we asked if we could store our luggage. They went beyond this and let us stay in our room well past check out time so that we could come back and shower in our room at the end of the day. They were absolutely wonderful.
