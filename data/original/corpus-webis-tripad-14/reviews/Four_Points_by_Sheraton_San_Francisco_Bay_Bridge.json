We do not have many complaints. It meets our need and it is good for the price. It is not a true four star property but if you are looking for one, there are many of them in SF that are much more expensive. The front desk staff does seem to lack training and they are not the most knowledgeable. Plenty of free parking is great as compared to what you would pay in downtown SF hotels. The rooms are nice and clean, and big enough for our needs, although the bathrooms are pretty small. The sink is actually located outside the bathroom and you still have trouble closing the door without getting in the way. The few times we have ordered room service, it has been decent and fast, but you may be better off going to a local dinner for better food, at lower price. Street/freeway noise has never been an issue for me (except when cops pull someone over which seems to happen rather often at the intersection) My main complaint is that the \"Four Comforts Bed\" always leaves me with a sore back, but I guess different people have different preferences for the bed softness. The last time I wanted to stay here though, I found that the price at the Hilton Garden Inn was lower. I stayed there and was impressed with the size and amenities of this other hotel. If I can not get a lower rate at the Four Points, the Hilton will definitely be the better choice.", "title": "Good hotel for its price range", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "travelSanFrancisco", "date": "June 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7752127, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness, free business center, close to shopping/movies", "disliked": "\u2014 Bed not very comfortable, bathroom too small"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled solo", "text": "I book this place for my sister when she came into town to visit.
