We stayed in Room 2 right on the beach and we could not have been happier. The night waves lulled you right to sleep - we did not need AC since the sea breeze was so wonderful. Waking up in the morning and being able to roll out of bed and into the ocean was phenomenal. We got the meal plan and it worked out great since the food was so delicious. My husband is a chef and even as picky as he is, he was thrilled with both the choices and the preparation. The fish was the freshest and the lobster succulent. Tony arranged for two and a half days of fishing and we had a blast. Watch out for the Belizian sun if you are not used to it - my face was sunburned after the first day on the water and it took all trip and a big tube of lotion for it to feel normal. Fishing was fun and we brought back barracuda for Tony's famous \"Barracuda Bites\" - yummmm. Angela's coconut flan was incredibly scrumptious and my desert of choice for the week. We rented a car in Belize City from Budget and the drive to Hopkins was easy and beautiful. The Hummingbird Highway was gorgeous with lots of photo ops. We drove all over Belize and had a great time. Tony helped with all our plans and was great on answering all my emails in planning the trip. The meal our last night in Belize was incredible - a six course Chef's choice with wine - unbelizable - definetely go for that - each course was better than the one before and Angela's desert tray for two was the ultimate ending to a fabulous vacation.

The resturant is one of the best places you will eat. We did the all day fishing trip. That evening Tony (the chef) cooked the fish for us and it was outstanding. If you are into Ancient Ruins you must visit the Xunantunich Ruins / Clarissa Falls. When at the Ruins you are able to see into Guetemaula. Cockscomb Basin Jaguar Preserve is a great tour of the jungle. You will go with a guide. Watch out for the Howler monkeys, they will try to pee on you as you walk underneath. You will be lead to the Falls and you can cool off by taking a dip in the water. The road through the center of Hopkins is a dirt road.
