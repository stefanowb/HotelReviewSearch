But, it was clean and the bed wasn't something that I would complain about.

This is a seasonal motel run by the Four Points Sheraton which is next door. It would be an understatement to call this structure \"shabby\". We requested a non-smoking room. However, we were booked into a smoking room. Upon opening the door (which banged into the night table), we viewed a shoddy, smoky, disgusting sight. The room was dingy, dirty, and rug-stained. This was totally unacceptable to us. The desk clerk tried her best to be accommodating, however, she was totally overwhelmed. Believe it or not, there were no other non-smoking rooms available for her to switch us to. We were totally frustrated since we had booked this in March. Guests that had booked after us, were assigned to non-smoking rooms. I asked her to honor our request. As it turned out, she assigned us a room that would be ready late afternoon, however, it was my sister and brother-in-law's room who had booked at the same time as us. As a result of all this confusion and our frustration over the motel's condition, we asked her to check next door at the Sheraton to see if rooms were available there. The manager came over and was quite apologetic and was able to move the four of us next door to non-smoking rooms which were quite nice. Meanwhile, the other wedding guests that remained there stayed in musty, dirty, rooms where doorknobs fell off the doors, blankets were ripped, and there were other occupants beside \"humans\".
