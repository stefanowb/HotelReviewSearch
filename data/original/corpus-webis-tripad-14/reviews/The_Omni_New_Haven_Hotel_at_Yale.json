Arriving by train from New York, the hotel was 10 minutes walk from the station and easy to find. Reception was both friendly and efficient and the room above average for comfort. There was ludicrously large pile of pillows and cushions on the bed but the maid cleared these out of the way and kept them off the bed for the duration of my stay! The view over Yale was spoilt by a large flat roof and unappealing building located nearby. The food provided by the hotel was acceptable, given that they were catering for a large group. The lack of alcohol in the mini-bars was strange and was compounded by the fact that the bar on the 19th floor (views over the rather dull downtown area) closed at midnight or earlier.", "title": "Pleasant stay at the Omni", "user": "Pete M", "date": "July 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 17399821, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pleasant and efficient employees", "disliked": "\u2014 It was in New Haven!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "New Haven itself has little to offer and maintained the theme of early closing, with all bars seeming to shut by 1am on a Thursday night.

I asked to be on a high floor in a quiet area; there are lots of restaurants and bars downstairs. I was on the 18th floor and it was quiet. The bed, pillows, linens, and towels were very good. There is a refridge in the room full of snacks and drinks, too. The food at the meeting and room service were also of excellent quality.
