Of course, there are never wash clothes in the bathrooms, although there is a bidet and lots of slippery marble on the floor. The restaurant is very nice.

The Park and the Falls are amazing, its worth taking the time to visit from the Argentinian side as its a totally different experience. Crossing the Argentinian border was a bit tedious, took ages, despite us making an effort to turn up early (8.30am) it was quite quiet when we got there but nothing seemed to be getting through and within 15 mins its was really busy!
