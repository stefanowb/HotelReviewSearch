The grounds have a real 'wow' factor with a lovley lake and decking that extends out from the function area and overlooks it all. The B&B room we stayed in itself was small but tastefully decorated and very clean. The only negative for us was that breakfast finished at 9:30am and after being at a wedding all day for the previous day there was no way that was going to be doable, especially with checkout being 10am! That's just a personal opinion on not being a morning person! There were kitchen facilities to prepare your own snacks though so that's helpful and tea/coffee making facilities in the room so you can do your own refreshments. I would highly recommend this venue for both the accomodation and for the whole wedding package.", "title": "Great accomodation - fabulous surrounding grounds", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LeisureRules", "date": "May 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130738094}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012", "text": "We stayed here recently with a baby and had a great time.

The owners were great even providing a nice bottle of wine for the room (no bar facilities on site unless you are attending a function in the barn). The site is to die for with a nice lake and decking area to the barn which was brilliant for milling out onto at the evening party! Definately would stay here again.
