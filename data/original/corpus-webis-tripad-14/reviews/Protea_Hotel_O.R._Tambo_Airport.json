The paraphernalia and theme of the hotel is quite different, with much of the imagery resembling an airport hanger, etc. Rooms were very neat, modern and I found it comfortable with everything I needed during a very pleasant stay. The hotel is conveniently close to the OR Tambo (Johannesburg ) International Airport, and although you can hear the planes take off and land in the close proximity, the sound insulation of this hotel is very good and the planes-noise do not prevent a good nights rest. (I think it has something to do with the exterior curtain walling which has been placed strategically to deflect the sound of vehicles and planes) The restaurant and the culinary aspects of the restaurant was also good. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms also have internet WiFi which is adequate. I really cannot fault this hotel and would stay there again without thinking twice.
