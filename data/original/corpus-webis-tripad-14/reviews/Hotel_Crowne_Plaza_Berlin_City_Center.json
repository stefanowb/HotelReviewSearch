Unfortunately for us the night we chose to stay for dinner the hotel was staging a very limited \"Italian\" themed night. The lack of people eating there should have warned us. The regular hotel patrons obviously knew better. The hotel bars are seriously in need of modernisation. The seating in the \"Pinte\" bar is worse than the local underground trains and extremely uncomfortable. The piano bar is not much better with leather stools from the 1960's. Both bars are extortionate and again very smokey. The lobby area is inhabited by a few worn-out chairs so, as a place of relaxation, not very inviting. Best to go out in the evenings. The hotel is well situated for the nearby markets, shopping and main-line station Zoologicher Garten.
