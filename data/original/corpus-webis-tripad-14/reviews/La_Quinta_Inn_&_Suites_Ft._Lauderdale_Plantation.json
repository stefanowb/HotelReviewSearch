The room was not ready when we arrived, but we arrived before their listed check-in time of 1:00 pm, so this was to be expected. Actually, 1pm is early in comparison with other hotels I've stayed at. Most don't allow check-in until 3:00 pm. Regardless, the nice guy at the front desk called housekeeping and had them drop everything and clean our room next to minimize the waiting time (only 15 minutes or so). The room was cozy and the bed comfortable. We had access to both wired and wireless Internet (though we were never sure whether the wireless was the hotel's or someone's in the neighborhood). Breakfast is included with fresh muffins and danish, a waffle maker, coffee, juice and assorted flavors of tea. The landscaping around the hotel is lovely, and there were tables outside in a tropical setting near a pretty gazebo (as well as indoor seating). Little touches like a thank you note from the Manager along with a big chocolate chunk cookie and a bottle of water in the room were appreciated. We also received email upon checkout from the Manager asking about our stay. I wrote back with my one and only complaint (the awful coffee that was served) but all in all it was a great value for the price as compared to other area hotels who were charging twice the price due to the season. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably-priced, clean, pleasant hotel. By the way, there were literally dozens of restaurants within a two block radius of the hotel.", "title": "Very comfortable - Nice Atmosphere", "user": "Newlyblond", "date": "February 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 13797303, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, Landscaping, Comfort", "disliked": "\u2014 Coffee served with breakfast"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled on business", "text": "First, check in took nearly an hour, and we were lucky.

It would shut off at night but as soon as we opened the curtains and let the sun in in the morning, the AC would kick on. Weird. Breakfast was ok, basic continental with waffles. Luckily we only paid $59 for the night because my brother used some discount coupons he found in the local gas station.

Unfortunately, its convenience for me---workwise---was outweighed by the bad experience. The staff is poor. They are not helpful, nor ar they very well educated in any of the most basic elements of customer service. Do not expect helpfulness at this hotel. I booked online for a nonsmoking room. To my suprise I was given a smoking room. Well, i don't like the smell in a smoking room, so I called downstairs to be moved. They said they didn't have anything else available. Now, I looked out the window and based on the number of cars in the parking lot and the size of this place----I found that hard to believe. I travel ALOT and my guess was probably 1/2-2/3 occupancy. So about a 1/2 hour later I called from my cell phone and asked about getting a room that night (non-smoking room). Of course they said there WAS a room available. So I called downstairs again and tried to get a new room. Same story..nothing available.....yeah right!!! So they like to play games with people here. In addition to the unpleasantness of having to deal with the smell in this room, there was also just one very small garbage can. I spoke to some other guests and they said they had the same situation. So I had to put trash on the floor. Nice, huh?? There were no extra garbage cans according to the desk.
