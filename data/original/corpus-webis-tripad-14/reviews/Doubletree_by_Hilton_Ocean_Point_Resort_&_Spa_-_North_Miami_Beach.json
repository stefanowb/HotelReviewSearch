We were looking for something a little more quiet and roomy. We rented 2 suites one a two bedroom suite for our family of 4 and a one bedroom suite for my parents. The rooms were very roomy and had plenty of extra space. Both had incredible ocean views. The two bedroom suite had an enormous deck. It wrapped all the way from the master bedroom to the extra room, giving us both a view of the ocean and of the city. There were lounge chairs on the desk and a table which we ate dinner at one night while watching the sunset. The only downside with the rooms is that they need a little maintenance. They are getting a little outdated and the walls, curtains and bathrooms could use some fixing up. That being said overall the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Service was incredible. Every staff member that we interacted with went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. They have this program called \"catch me at my best\" and we put in cards for several staff members. We have pretty high standards for our vacation rooms so I would give this hotel a 3+. The only issue holding them from a 5 is the fact that the rooms need some re-modeling.", "user": "trendy726", "date": "June 7, 2010", "id": 66800999}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was pleasantly suprised on how wonderful the accomodations, service and overall experience was for myself and my family at the doubletree. I did online research prior to booking the hotel and after reading the reviews I thought it sounded like a great place and it really was. we stayed in a two bedroom, 2 bath suite/condo oceanfront and it was definitely more than enough space for 3 adults and 2 small children. Some of the furniture/decor is just a little dated, but very clean and comfortable overall. The pool and beach access was amazing. The pool was especially excellent for young kids, it has a walk in very shallow end that the kids can just hang out in and be safe with supervision. If i could try and find any negatives it would only be the expense 26.00/day for valet parking (kind of steep to me/us) and the expense to rent beach equipment (10.00/chair, 15.00/umbrella).
