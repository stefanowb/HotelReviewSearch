When she found out we hadn't stopped for dinner she generously offered us a snack. Minutes later we had a tray filled with lamp chops, sausages, fruit and soft drinks...more than we imagined and certainly more than we could eat! Breakfast the next morning was just as filling. Rosie seems to love caring for her guests and making them a part of her home. The accomodations were clean, simple and quiet - just what you would expect from a farmhouse cottage. Her place is a little out of the way from town but close to Cango Caves if you want to get an early start there.", "title": "Warm Hospitality", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WHERESWAUGH", "date": "October 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 10098789}], "location": {"country": "South Africa", "continent": "Africa", "city": "Oudtshoorn"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 1, "very good": 11, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 53}, "slim_ranking": 0.242424242424, "description": "Set on route to the Cango Caves, in the Schoemanshoek Valley (14 kilometers north of Oudtshoorn), Berluda is an intimate guesthouse experience. 7 en suite bedrooms in the original Farmhouse (renovated 2008) and 8 self catering cottages. 2 swimming pools are available to guests.
