There were two days when curiously the maid did not leave us bathmats but there were so many towels we used those. We did ask for a kettle and a tea pot to be delivered to the room as the coffee maker did not boil the water hot enough for a decent cup of tea. The tea pot arrived within minutes but not the kettle.
