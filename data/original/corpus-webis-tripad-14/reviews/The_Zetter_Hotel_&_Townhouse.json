Luckily we managed to find somewhere else for the same date nearby (others weren't so lucky I believe). We still ended up staying at the hotel but were again unhappy with our treatment. Having been sent away at around 1:00 for an hour while our room was made ready it still wasn't ready 2 hours later. It was as if none of the staff knew what they were doing. The room was quite small but perfectly clean and comfortable so the nights sleep was all good albeit quite expensive. Check out the following morning was frustrating though as overnight the 2nd of 2 lifts stopped working resulting in hotel staff dragging lots of peoples luggage down 4+ flights of stairs. Again, just seemed really disorganised. For the money you'd expect a slick operation.

The addition of the Zetter Townhouse is perfect. More traditional in style to its sister, its design is eccentric English. You walk in to a welcoming lounge/bar, with plenty of sofas and a relaxed atmosphere. There is no Reception Desk - its more like arriving at someone's home. The bar offers a number of old fashioned cocktails, with English twists - such as a Gimlet with Nettle and a Rhubarb Kir Royale - all wonderful. The staff are extremely friendly and create a warm, relaxed atmosphere. We were there for a friend's 40th Birthday party - which was held in one of their private dining rooms. A lovely entertaining space and again, in line with the homely atmosphere. Dinner was excellent and large serving dishes provided on the table in a family style. A beautiful goats cheese and lentil salad to start, followed by beef stew, with mash and apple pie and creme fraiche - perfect food to share with friends. We were able to bring our own music and a great party developed. There are a few rooms upstairs - all very unique and comfortable. I would thoroughly recommend this place for people looking for a memorable vacation in London (away from large, corporate hotels) and also, as its close to the business district - it would be a real treat for a business traveller, who spends their life on the road. Oh - and also throw a party there - a truly great place.", "title": "Zetter Townhouse - Fantastic quirky addition to the Zetter", "user": "Globaladventure", "date": "June 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 112845196}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "As always had a wonderful stay at the Zetter.
