Right in the heart of the CBD with lots of fantastic coffee shops, restaurants and bars in the vicinity. We had a studio apartment that faced Flinders Lane and the 24 hour noise should not be underestimated. Opposite is an office building and you can look right into these offices and the office workers can look right into your apartment. We found the apartment functional, however very dark. You need constant light and the dark carpet and furniture might be practical as it hides marks and stains, but it gives a depressed feeling and the cheerful little tin cat on the window sill doesn't make it better. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom small with a small shower cubicle. The airconditioning system is the noisiest we have ever encountered. Yes, the floors squeek, but it is an old building and can be tolerated. Housekeeping is slack. During our entire stay we never received any amenities. When we checked in there was not even a little soap, so we had to go to Coles Supermarket around the corner to get some as you do want to freshen up upon arrival. During our 4 nights in the apartment, there was no housekeeping at all on one day, on another day the blanket and pillows were just thrown over the bed. Tables were never wiped, floors never cleaned, bathroom just got a quick wipe over. Staff from Front Desk were very friendly and helpful. The price was reasonable for the location but we would probably prefer the Punthill Manhattan up the road where we stayed once in the past, simply for the better housekeeping and less noise.", "title": "Punthill Flinders Lane - best place in Melbourne - right in the heart of hip vibe of Flinders Lane", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MerryweatherBrisbane", "date": "March 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125969315}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Love this apartment /hotel.
