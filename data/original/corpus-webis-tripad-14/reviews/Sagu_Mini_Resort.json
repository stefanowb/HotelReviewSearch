The damper on our trip was that the staff seemed startled that we were a Black couple and therefore they did not know how to act. That meant that upon arrival we did not get the same treatment of the other non-Black couples that we later saw arriving, i.e., the introduction to the hotel, hours and location for breakfast, lunch, dinner, the location of the hidden internet/library, etc. There was initially no energy in our room which we had to inform reception. Had he not just dumped us outside our door and said, here is your room, and entered and turned on the light for us and done the normal thing, he would have known that. They were also not very helpful organizing massages, etc. I could have dealt with this; however, the lowest point came when the reception attendant, assuming that we were of course NOT hotel guests, did not want us to take the key to our room (we had left the key as a sign instructed to do and were trying to pick it up as we had seen other couples do with no problem).
