Additionally, the hotel is within walking distance to Disneyland (Approx 1 mile) and the Garden Walk (Many good restaurants) and only about 2.5 miles from Angel Stadium. The hotel charges $16 a day to park at the hotel, but the lot has ample spaces and is very convenient to get in and out of. An additional perk is free wi-fi at the hotel.

We used Hilton Honors points for our stay, so we didn't pay out of pocket for our stay. We found the rooms to be spacious and very comfortable - nice linens, good assortment of pillows, living area had a comfortable sleeper sofa. It was nice having a suite as it allowed my husband and I to relax with a glass of wine after a long-day at the park without disturbing our daughters' sleep. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast buffet (perhaps only to HH members?) and we all enjoyed the quality and variety of the food. In addition, kids eat free in the restaurant for lunch and dinner, which is a nice option after spending so much at the park. We requested a top-floor room, away from the elevator and facing the park so we could see fireworks at night. They were not able to accommodate the park-facing request, but our top-floor room was very quiet. The only drawback I would list is that the shuttle service wasn't super convenient and there was some confusion when we asked for help getting a cab. Apparently, the cabs aren't allowed to drop you off at the main entrance of Disney and one cabbie even told us they weren't allowed to drop off across the street. This doesn't seem possible. The next time we grabbed a cab, we told them we were going to the Camelot Inn across the street and the driver brought us right there. We just walked across the street to the main entrance. Keep in mind, the hotel is within walking distance, but the 15-20 minute walk on top of walking around the park all day was too much for our little one.

Great stay, front desk staff very helpful in directing me to the nearest Best Buy. My husband sent us with the wrong camera charger, and a Disneyland trip with no pictures to show for it was not an option. Kudos for their assistance with options/information on local businesses that might have the right camera battery charger. A 20 minute round trip to Best Buy, and crisis was averted, with plenty of time to relax by the pool before heading to Downtown Disney. Restaurant staff is excellent, we enjoy seeing familiar faces with each stay. The hostess (manager?) who seated us is phenomenal, (my apologies on not being able to recall her name.) Her warm and sincere greeting and genuine interaction with us as to how things are going were refreshing, in an era where customer service seems to be a dying art. Breakfast buffet was delightful and delicious, as usual, even for 4 picky eaters ranging in age from 6-14. Our suite was well-appointed, with very comfortable beds, pillows, and linens, very inviting after spending 10-plus hours at the parks. Oddly enough, way back in 2007--our first stay with this hotel--a Disney employee (corporate level) recommended this property to us, and we have no reason to look anywhere else.
