Outdoor patio and 19th bar for drinks were great. Outdoor pool was not heated but hot tub was great! If you are a golfer, bring down your clubs! Excellent driving range but even better pratice putting and short game area! To pay between $125-195 to play at TPC not worth it. But experience the pratice area it's worth working on your short game. Room was overall good with a good bed to sleep on every night.

I dined in the restaurant for a buffet breakfast before I left and it was amazingly delicious and the wait staff were more than helpful. If you're a golfer you will love this place.

We arrived a little before check-in time and were told it would be a few minutes before our room was ready. Within just a few minutes the front desk called and told us they were ready for us. We had a Villa room on the 18th green of the TPC Las Colinas golf course. It was an older room, but very well appointed. We had a separate shower and a large jetted tub. We had a nice view of the putting green and a large flat screen TV (which my husband was glad about). We were going to ask if we could purchase the bed at check-out-it was that comfortable. The pool area is very nice and the attendants were constantly bringing me water and asking if everything was OK. The service was top knotch at this resort and only had one minor inconvenience when we needed to remind housekeeping that our room had not been made up the second day. We left for a little while to visit the pool and they quickly cleaned our room for us. My husband remarked at how quiet the room was. We were able to sleep past 9:00 everyday and never heard a soul. The only thing I would mention when visiting this property is that they do charge for everything! Upon check-out we used valet parking the first night and it was $22.00 plus the tip we gave the valet attendant. A pina colada by the pool was $11.50 and a canned coke on the golf course was $4.50. Most people who stay in five star resorts may be accustomed to this, but we were shocked by it. Fortunately we took advantage of a promotion they have going called the Escape package where all incidentals at the resort were 25% off-so that helped with the sticker shock. We will definitely visit this property again-especially with our children.
