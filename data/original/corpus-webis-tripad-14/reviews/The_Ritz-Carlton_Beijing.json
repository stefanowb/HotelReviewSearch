Instead, the designers have opted to go with touches of Chinoiserie, which make is very refined and elegant. We were certainly not disappointed and there were actually few things to fault about the hotel. Our room was really fantastic\u2014very big, very comfortable, very refined, with lots of beautiful details. The bathroom was great and very luxurious (although having the toilet simply behind a glass partition is not necessarily that practical if there are two of you!). We used the laundry service a couple of times and it was really efficient. The breakfast selection is also really incredible\u2014among the best we've ever experienced (and we've travelled a lot). The service overall was also the best that we experienced throughout China. The only question mark about this hotel for me would be its location. It's situated in a new district to the east of the city (near the 4th Ring Road), where there are lots of luxury boutiques. We were there just after the Olympics and the system of alternate number plates was still in place. So, there wasn't too much traffic on the roads and it took us only about 20\u201325 minutes to get to Tian'anmen Square in a taxi. However, once all the cars are back on the streets, I reckon the that location could be a little more problematic. Solely for that reason, if we went back, we'd probably try the Grand Hyatt, which is so much more conveniently situated for the tourist sights.", "title": "Refined and elegant, but is this the right location?", "user": "ianp1", "date": "September 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20060421, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The decor", "disliked": "\u2014 The location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here while covering the Olympic games.
