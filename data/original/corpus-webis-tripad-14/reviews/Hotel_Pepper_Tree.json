My family loved this hotel, it was clean, spacious, quiet, and very cute. The kitchenette was well supplied with all utensils, pots/pans, etc. The stove and fridge saved us a ton of money not having to eat out all the time. Closet space and drawer space was great. Our room overlooked the pool and it was lovely to sit out on the full-length balcony and converse with my husband. Breakfast was buffet style at the adjacent restaurant (on the property) and more than ample at $6 for all persons staying in the room (up to 4), and consisted of eggs, fried potatoes, ham, pancakes, toast/muffins, yogurt, cereals (3 types) and orange juice, coffee, or milk to drink. We bought steaks and bar-b-qued poolside one night at the facilities provided. The hotel is 3.9 miles to Disneyland, and we bought our park tickets through Triple A (CSAA) and got free parking at the park (saved $75) so distance was not an issue. I teach music lessons and brought back business cards and pictures for all my students who travel to Disneyland each year, I liked this little place so much. If you are looking for the Taj Mahal, then spend $200+ a night on a room. We stayed for $53/night and did way more on our vacation having saved all that money on room costs and dining out. We will go back to the Pepper Tree for sure, and I am already looking at dates to return. In all, we were there for 9 days, ample time to get the feel of a place. The only issues we had were: the maid forgot to leave coffee for the in-room coffee service one day, and, on another she accidently took our kitchen sponge. Both were quickly ammended by the front desk personel, who were also lovely.

There is a small kitchen with paper towels, dishes, dish soap, and other items so all you have to bring is the food. They even had ice cube trays in the freezer! On our last trip, we wanted a home base that we could poke around from, and this hotel was good for that too, it is maybe a half-hour drive from the ocean. The rooms are unique, and do not have that cookie cutter feel you can get in other hotels. The hallways are wide and well-lit. The curtins to the balcony are good at keeping out the sun when you want a little extra sleep in the morning. Most of the rooms overlook parking lots, but other than that the hotel meets all of our expectations. We found them to be pet-friendly, which on our last trip was the deal-maker...we couldn't find anyone to watch our dog at the last minute and we were pleased to find out that The Hotel Pepper Tree is pet friendly (with a very reasonable pet fee).
