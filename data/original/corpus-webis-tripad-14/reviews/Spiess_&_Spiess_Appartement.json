At first, we thought the hotel to be a bit overrated and not quite what we'd expected from the glowing reviews. A couple of other guests we met at breakfast had the same impression. But overall, we truly thought this a nice property in a good location blessed with an excellent and caring family to oversee day to day operations. The hotel is easy to get to since the local underground station (train 3) is just a hundred meters from the front door. We took the CAT from the airport and transferred to the 'U' for the ride to the hotel. This cost 27 Euros, which seemed a bit much considering that a taxi would have been only 34 Euros. But I wanted to experience the CAT and the public transport system in Vienna, having just come from Switzerland where such things run like clock work. Our room (room 6) was roomy with a nice seating area, and roomy bathroom. It also had a small balcony sitting area where one could smoke cigarettes outside the room. There was a separate toilet room, which was nice. The room had a fireplace, which we didn't use. It also had fridge and stainless steel counter space for a small kitchenette. The breakfast room, as noted in other reviews, is quite pleasant and the breakfast service is all anyone could want. The family grand-dad serves hot coffee and eggs on request. He's quite a nice gentleman. Gabriela, from Hungary, operates the front desk during the day. She is a gem. And the family grandmother takes over on the evening shift. She also quite a charming lady. So, very high marks for the hotel staff. The only glitch we experienced in this regard was for the room cleaning. For our first three days, the glasses in our room went unwashed. We were washing them ourselves when we finally reported this to Gabriela. We also said the bath towels had not been changed for three days. We were told we had to put the towels on the floor to indicate that a change was requested. Fair enough. After that, we had fresh glassware and fresh towels everyday in our room, which made things a lot nicer. One more criticism to make regards the mattresses in our room: they seemed rather worn out and sagging in our sleeping experience, no doubt in need of replacement. The neighborhood has some good places for dinner nearby. We can recommend the Greek restaurant across the street from the hotel. I can say without hesitation, based on our six-night experience, that we'll be back to Vienna for another visit, and we'll definitely be back to Spiess & Spiess.", "title": "We enjoyed Spiess & Spiess", "user": "bangkokcassidy", "date": "October 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142529657}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Large room with fireplace, comfortable chairs, spacious bath, and a very helpful staff.

The room even had a fireplace although we didn't use it. We were on the 4th floor in an attic apartment so it was very quiet.
