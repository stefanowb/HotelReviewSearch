It would be difficult if you did not have a car but that was not a problem for myself and 3 girlfriends. We have been to Warner's before and we think this was definitely the best yet. The staff were lovely, particularly the entertainment team who were excellent, very talented and working so hard. The restaurant was also very nice, food is not cordon bleu but plenty of choice and we enjoyed it and perhaps ate too much! The only criticism we could find was that the star show \"The Beach Bouys\" were a little too full of their own importance. They should have been appearing on Saturday night but this was changed to Sunday night at 9.30pm. The entertainment team did a great job to get everyone into a great party mood and then the curtains opened to .......... nothing. The DJ valiantly played four Beach Boy numbers to cover the delay but eventually the audience started the slow handclap and eventually they came out,20 minutes late, no apology but just grumbles because we were not too receptive to them. They are a good group but everyone was moaning about their arrogance. They might only be performing in front of a Warner's audience but perhaps someone should tell them that without us they would not get paid!!!!! The fact that 3 of the group were seen in the bar before the performance and all their equipment was on stage and ready for them suggests that perhaps they were not over keen to perform for us oldies..

As for the old wooden windows - the frames were completely peeled of paint in some places, the windows did not shut properly and part of the frame which had obviously rotted had been replaced with an unpainted piece of wood. There was also mould around the bath. The shower made such a noise when turned on too. As it was our friends 20th wedding anniversary we did not feel we could complain. Would not have a problem with recommending this hotel but would suggest you make sure not in Ledge House.", "title": "standards have slipped", "user": "bernardperks", "date": "July 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 34718827}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "just come back from a fri to mon with friends this was my 4 visit in 9 years last time 2006 the standards have slipped awfully . i took advise from one of your letter writers and booked a signature room the decor was great and modern but carpet was dusty all around the edges toilet roll holder was hanging off bedroom ceiling was badly water stained . the whole hotel complex looks tired and need of t.l.c. the food is awful works canteen style when i told the waiter my soup was cold he said the microwave was broke and he could not do anythink about it . needless to say we will vote with our feet and never go here again", "title": "ADVERTISEMENT DOES NOT MATCH REALITY - BEWARE", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DABDorset", "date": "July 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 33967343}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 16, "average": 38, "very good": 127, "terrible": 8, "excellent": 178}, "aka": "Warner Bembridge Coast Hotel Isle Of Wight", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "With spectacular views over The Solent, this secluded, shoreline Character Hotel is just the place to take in the sea air.
