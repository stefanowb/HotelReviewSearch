This was my second time in Penang, so I knew the area I wanted to stay in before I booked. The Northam is a short walk from both Gurney Drive, where the action is, and Georgetown centre (about 15 minutes' walk, although the pavements can be decidedly dodgy in places). I booked a deluxe suite and got a huge suite with two toilets, bath, shower, two sinks, two oversized-single beds (120cm+), a sitting room with dining table, sofa and a tv (there was an extra tv in the bedroom too). Food within the hotel restaurants was excellent and extremely good value for money. The staff were friendly, spa treatments were cheap. There is a small pool on the 9th floor, but all the sunbeds are under a roof, so that was a slight disappointment for us sun-starved bunnies from northern Norway....otherwise, this hotel represents the best value I have found in the area.", "title": "Keep up the Good Work!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Vardomannen", "date": "January 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4330700}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Best in Town", "text": "I stayed at the Northam for 6 nights while visiting friends and family in Penang.

Let me begin with the room itself: I stayed in Room2805 on the 28th floor (lowest floor is 24th), a studio suite that comes with, all the obvious aside, a lounge, a guest cloakroom, wall-to-wall windows which give you a 180-degree sea view, a fax-machine, a bathroom suite equipped with a massive jacuzzy bath tub (easily fits two!), built-in wardrobe, a giant mirror over the a double washbasin and separate WC and shower units.
