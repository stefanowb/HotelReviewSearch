Our nicely sized room was a hodge-podge of furniture, none of which looked like it was placed where intended, but most importantly, the bed was very comfortable. Wireless didn't reach to our room so I had to stay at the desk when I would have preferred to be sitting in bed using the internet. The bathroom, although basically clean, needs a good corner scrubbing. We had an interior room overlooking the pool so road noise was nonexistent...a good thing. The breakfast was ok, nothing special. Friendly staff directed us to dinner at the unassuming Mexican restaurant (El Maguey) across Rt 13, and that was fantastic. Overall, a satisfactory stay.
