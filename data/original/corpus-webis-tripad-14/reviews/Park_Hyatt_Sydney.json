No type of muffins whatever, and the bread selection was limited. There are refrigerators in back of the buffet area filled with some cold cuts and yogurt and fruit, but upon opening these, you are overwhelmed with meat and spice smells, and nothing really is that appealing after that...certainly not the yogurt and fruit (which looks a little dried out).
