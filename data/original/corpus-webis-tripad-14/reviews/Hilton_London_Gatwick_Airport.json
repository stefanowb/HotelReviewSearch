We got into the room after the restaurant had closed after 15 hrs traveling on 2 planes and a speedboat to find that the room was in a mess, bed unmade, food and drinks on all surfaces, clearly the room had not been prepared or cleaned for us. It tooka further 30 mins for an alternative room . No apologies . I asked as a gesture from the hotel, it might be nice to get some complimentary sandwiches. That was clearly a difficult tricky problem that had to be referred to the manager . A phone call came back 10 mins later that we could only have one sandwich between us. I slammed the phone down in disgust.
