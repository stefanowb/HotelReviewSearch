Very convenient from Salzburg Airport, about 1 hour 20 min straight motorway until the last 6 miles up the mountain. Spacious modern rooms but would advise you to book the Royal Rooms in the main building as the Classic Rooms are in an annexe and apparently quite old fashioned and dark. Ski hire and ski school very convenient in building. Slopes accross the road. Unfortunately we came at the end of the season and the snow was not very good anymore but apparently they had very little snowfall this winter anyhow.Normally beginning of April is apprently still good. Fantastic pool and spa area although view to beautiful landscape is obstructed by hideaously ugly apartment blocks!! Food very good. A negative is that we found the staff to be quite inpersonal and unfriendly. We have always stayed in family owned hotels on skiing holidays in Austria and the staff is a lot friendlier. Especailly the restaurant staff was quite unfriendly. One very irritating thing was that the plate was taken away from you as soon as you put your cutley down, before the others at the table had finished their meal which is not correct.", "title": "Good family hotel", "user": "basi25", "date": "April 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 103609353}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Very good for skiiers but as there is no village there is not much to do if you are accompanying and don't ski.

There are two parts to the hotel, the modern building with the spa, pools (yes two pools - more later) and the restaurant & bar. There is also an older building linked by corridor which contains more appartment style rooms. We stayed in the older wing and this was in very good condition and we had a room with bedroom and lounge/kitchenette with sofa be & dining table and balconies in both. If we went again we might try to stay in the main hotel but only as it is a walk to the older wing. The facilities here are excellent, a spa with loads of tratments, exercise room, quiet room on the top floor with great views, a spa pool which goes outside - my son loved being in a warm pool in the snow! There is actually another full kids pool with a slide, its own sauna and changing rooms and adjoining nursery area. The food was excellent and the service professional & friendly. The hotel has its own ski shop & ski room which exits right to the nursery slopes just accross the road. The hotel is great for families as the ski school brings your children back to the nursery club where they are looked after until you arrive.
