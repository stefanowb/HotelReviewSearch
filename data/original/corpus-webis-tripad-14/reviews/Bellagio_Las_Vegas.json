We were not disappointed with the city or the hotel. The Bellagio is a gigantic, high end, luxury hotel and we had a great room overlooking the fountains and wonderful service. The room was spotless and everything worked. After we told the front desk that we were celebrating our anniversary, they sent up a box of chocolate truffles and a card. The restaurants in the hotel were expensive but that was expected. I found that the service was fabulous, from the bell men to the concierge desk to the coffee shop employees. An example of such service was when we had eaten lunch at the buffet one day and I had asked for ginger to go with the sushi. It seems that they had run out and their order had not yet arrived. After about 5 minutes a very pleasant gentleman arrived at our table with a bowl full of ginger, explaining that he was the assistant manager and that he had gone to room service to get the ginger. How wonderful, they had gone beyond the ordinary to please us. The only issue we had was with some neighbour having a screaming baby in the middle of the night. A suggestion that we have for the hotel is to try and segregate the rooms with little children. Otherwise a fabulous hotel and we will certainly stay there again.", "user": "dadofjessie", "date": "December 9, 2013", "id": 187194274}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Gorgeous holiday presentation, fabulous room, great gaming!", "text": "Just got back from a three night stay at Bellagio.

I was looking forward to staying at the Bellagio for the first time after many trips to Las Vegas. At first glance, the hotel is beautiful. But what a nightmare checking in - it felt like there was not nearly enough front desk staff as 3/4 of the wickets were empty. On top of it - it was a mosh pit as people were scrambling for their spot in the queues. Take a less from other properties which have clearly marked lanes for queueing up. Was never offered the option of having my bags taken to my room. Check-in was quick, but I am starting to get tired that you have walk through a casino to get to the elevators - there is a constant train of people with all their luggage continually walking through the casino - maybe at Circus Circus, but not the Bellagio. The room was very nice, but I was facing the Bellagio Fountains - so felt like gunshots were going off in my room every 15 minutes. And the walls are super thin - felt like The Hangover was taking place next door to me minus the tigers. Finally got fed up because I was catching up on some work, I just packed my bags, and went downstairs and I was moved to the Spa Tower. Still a nice large room, and quieter, but walls are still super thin so any noise in the hall came through. I know that you shouldn't spend that much time in the room in Vegas - but at some point you have to sleep or in my case get some work done - and all I kept thinking was, \"How did this place get a 5 Diamonds - did the reviewer actually stay here?\"", "title": "Not sure why this hotel is rated AAA 5 Diamonds", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "LeisuresuitEDR", "date": "August 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 135988214}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Must see lobby with flower displays changed seasonally.

Regardless of room type, my advice would be to opt for a lake view room overlooking the fountains - this is definitely the highlight of having stayed here. We booked directly through the hotel website, which allows you to select the upgrade of a lake view room (you do pay a little more, but it is worth it for the entertainment value) - if you book through other accommodation search engines, whilst you may get a great rate, you may have to take pot luck on getting an upgrade at check-in, so if room type is of paramount importance then I would book directly with the hotel. Just beware though if you are a light sleeper, the sound of the fountains may disturb you - I thought they were meant to stop at midnight, but I saw them running beyond 1am on a few nights.

The beds were super comfy, and the air con temp control was reliable. Despite the room and floor not being a non-smoking, there was no stench of stale cigarette smoke, much to my relief after hearing bad stories of the smoking indoors in Vegas.

The housekeeping service was top notch and done twice a day. We asked for firm pillows & extra toiletries, they gladly brought those to our room promptly. The pools were nice but crowded most of the time. I tried their fitness center/gym twice and found it to be more than adequate for my needs. The hotel boasts of quite a few fine dining options and we enjoyed some of our memorable meals there. However, I do feel they should improve their service.
