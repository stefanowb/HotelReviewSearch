We found the rooms were a little bit small for the three of us. Too small that a roll-away bed couldn't have been put into the room. The microwave and the fridge came in really handy in storing food for dinner as we didn't feel safe to walk around the area at night.

The hotel is pretty close to a large shopping mall, a supermarket, trolley and bus stations, train station and the local prison. The area at night had quite a few homeless people around.
