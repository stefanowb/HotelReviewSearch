Hotel room was clean and quiet and a had a nice big verandah but didn't get to use it as it was sooo cold, good heating and nice breakfast room. Only one bad thing was the actual shower good of done with a good bleaching but otherwise great value for money with the bus stop just out the front costing 1 euro to get to venice. It wasn't worth paying extra to stay in venice when you can get such a good hotel for half the cost.", "title": "Good, cheap hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "excited05", "date": "December 2, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4157962}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "The first thing you should know is that Mestre is the city across the bridge from Venice. If you want to walk right out into the watery canals of Venice, then do not stay in Mestre. With that said, this hotel was actually very comfortable and well maintained. The hotel is right next to a bus stop, which runs a frequent city bus that takes you directly into Venice (about a 15-20 minute bus ride). The bus drops you off at the main vaporetto station. For all intensive purposes, this feature of the hotel makes staying in Mestre instead of Venice a feasible and economic alternative for the budget traveler. However, don't be fooled by the hotel's description of being 800m away from the Mestre train station -- this is completely untrue. We couldn't figure out which city bus to take from the station and ended up taking a cab instead. The trip was more like 8 kilometers! However, we discovered later that at the same bus stop outside the hotel, you can catch a bus that takes you to Mestre train station in about 10 minutes. The breakfast was very good; you get a plate of meat and cheese, and a buffet of breads, croissants, hard boiled eggs, fruit salad, tea/coffee and juice.", "title": "Good hotel, but definitely further than 800m from Mestre train station", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Laiyee", "date": "September 19, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3915525}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Veneto", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 37, "average": 51, "very good": 73, "terrible": 25, "excellent": 27}, "aka": "Club Hotel Mestre", "slim_ranking": 0.75}
