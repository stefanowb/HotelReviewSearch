He switched us to the 7th floor with no problem and had our rollaway bed moved to the new room. Our room was clean, large and very very comfortable. Even the rollaway bed was comfortable! The room was also extremely quiet. Best towels too, they were sooo comfortable!!! The maid kept our room very clean everyday regardless of how much of a mess my kids left. Internet service was pricey in the rooms ($25 a night) but it was free in the large lobby. We, and many other people, chose the lobby for Internet use. The pool was large and clean and the fitness area was better than my gym near my home. There is a large beautiful Terrace with several fireplaces and lots of comfortable seating to relax in with waiters available to bring food and drinks if you choose. The garage is accesible from hotel elevators and is well lit and safe. The hotel is about three blocks away from the Metro with many places to eat and drink in-between.
