They have designed a hotel room to be more than a room, a little screen here, well placed desk, purpose made furniture give you the illusion of a suite with a living room when you just rented a room. Cascade Station by PDX has an IKEA caffeteria just down the street for your lunch folks! And the free breakfast was quite adequate for free. Free internet, free parking. Max station near. And with Occupy Wall Street now \"Camp Down Town and Trash It\" being indulged by the oh so tollerant government in Portland, being on the outskirts isn't bad for $119/night. Only thing, use the bed for 2, don't use the sofa bed for adults, it is very skimpy and so our 4 adult family had 2 well rested and 2 grumpy guests! Very good for 2, not so good for 4, although they did tell me they have 2 bed rooms that were not available for us, but I haven't seen them.
