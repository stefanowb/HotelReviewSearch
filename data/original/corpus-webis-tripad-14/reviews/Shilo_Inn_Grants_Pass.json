We have made comment about our stay in Tillamook seperately. We paid approx $90 for Grants Pass, which was adequate for our overnight stay. The swimming pool was closed for maintainence whilst we were there, but we were told we could use the YMCA pool for no charge. We didn't bother. We asked for a recommendation for a good restaurant in Town, and were directed to 'The Brewery' which was excellent. The room was OK, nothing special, but clean and the beds comfortable. We didn't try the free continental breakfast. The Shilo Inn was good enough for our overnight stay in Grants Pass.

The check-in and check-out folks were very courteous and friendly. However, on the afternoon that I checked in, there was a terrible downpour. Later that evening, as I stepped to the window to close the drapes, I noticed that the carpet was sopping wet on the window wall plus the two adjacent walls about 8\" out and radiating to a lesser dampness to about 12\" - 13\". I could not detect where the water was coming. It was obvious that it was not from the window as the casing was dry so I concluded the water had came in at the foundation level or down into the walls. Because it was very late, I decided to report this in the morning.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 28, 2006", "id": 5405783}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Barebones but adequate", "text": "I did have to think hard and fast about plugging in my camera and phone chargers on those walls!

It's a bit run-down, but serves its purpose. The rooms are spacious, there's plenty of parking, but overall the place is a bit rickety. But the air conditioning was blasting, and that's a big plus on a hot summer day in southern Oregon when the temperatures are over 100F. The biggest plus of the room was free wireless Internet access. There's a complimentary continental breakfast available in the lobby for you to take back to your room, with basics such as cereal, bagels, pastries and coffee.

Upon entering the room we found it extremely clean. The new carpet and tile are a wonderful touch...we can't wait to see what the rest of the improvements will be.
