(My profession holds an annual conference at the Lodge.) This time, it has just been decorated for Christmas, following the Christmas in November events earlier in the month, so the setting was particularly beautiful, with swags, wreaths, an enormous Christmas tree in the Great Hall, and lots of lights on buildings and grounds. The JPL is a resort-style Fairmont property, a collection of small buildings with multiple rooms, situated all over a large property, and a main building for restaurants, administration, shopping, etc. We had a lakefront room in a building that housed about six rooms. We had a lovely view of Lac Beauvert, on which the winter ice was just beginning to form. As in most Fairmont properties, the room was nicely appointed, with nice amenities such as kettle, coffeemaker, hair dryer, etc. The bed was very comfortable and the toiletries above average quality. The one thing I can fault the Lodge for is the soundproofing: as others have commented here, it's poor between cabins. For two of our three nights we shared a wall with a family in the next room which had at least two toddlers and an infant -- their presence was evident (blessedly, primarily during daylight hours). We also heard a good deal of noise from the bathroom fan of the adjoining room. Otherwise, the stay was great -- a wonderful respite from the city. JPL may not be the best choice for those with mobility issues as some of the cabins are quite far-flung and particularly during winter months paths and roads can be snowy/icy. That said, though, the snow that fell while we were there was cleared quickly from the main pedestrian path. Parking, in some areas on site, can be quite removed from cabin areas as well. November in Jasper is shoulder season, so there's often not a lot going on in the town, and many of the restaurants are closed.

We used the JPL as our base for three days of hiking and chose it for its setting and the availability of the Athabasca cottage, the smallest of their signature cottages as it was just my wife and I. We wanted the cottage for its privacy, its location, and anticipated luxury considering its $800+ per night price tag. It was a big disappointment on two levels: it needs a lot of upgrading and doesn't even come close the fine line between shabby and chic. It's the former all the way and misses the charm quotient by a mile. Secondly, there was a sizable masonry construction project, complete with masonry power saws, going full tilt daily on the bank of rooms right next door. The cottage should have never been put on the available list to begin with, and at the very least management owed us a phone call prior to arrival. At this point I need to give management a nod, because when I complained to the night manager he had us moved the next day to a lakefront suite which was fine. He said for our troubles (we couldn't unpack, but they did move our bags while we hiked the first day), the hotel was taking $100 a night off the suite, but honestly I believe that was the original price of the suite to begin with. Whatever...at least it was quiet. Another gripe is the parking situation. If you drive your own car or have a rental car here, good luck finding a spot near your room. The availability of parking spaces near the rooms is totally inadequate. JPL will remind you that their valet is free and will bring your car to your building. They are correct and that scenario isn't too bad in the morning. However, it you're returning from an evening out and there are no spaces in front of your room, you must take your car to the main lodge, give it to the valet, and hop a golf cart to be driven back to your room...and that is a pain in the rear, especially if the weather is foul or you're unlucky enough to get some inebriated conventioneers with lit cigarettes in hand as your cart buddies! We saw many cars parked on the side of the road in front of room units because the guests didn't want to hassle with the inconvenience. I did it myself a couple nights although you'll receive a warning sticker that they have the right to tow your car. Our first night, since we arrived late, we just wanted a quick bite to eat and chose the Emerald Lounge because we thought it would be quick and we'd get a decent sandwich or something. We were wrong on both counts. The place was really understaffed (though they tried hard) and the food was marginal. It didn't help that there was a gaggle of convention folks smoking up a storm right outside a corner double door, and each time someone entered or exited that particular door into the dining room, a purple foul haze greeted the diners. We never ate at the hotel again, and enjoyed the many good establishments in Jasper. The one he JPL has going for it is its location. It is stunning, and the surrounding view is remarkable. It's a quick and easy drive to downtown Jasper, and the Park and countless trails are at your door step.
