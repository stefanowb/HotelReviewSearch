The room was very comfortable with an amazing view. The breakfasts were the best on the South Island--fresh baked croissants, French Toast with carmelized bananas, fresh fruit from the garden--we couldn't ask for anything more. It rained during our stay, so we could not hike in Abel Tasman, but Anthea and Brian had great recommendations for touring in Nelson.
