Everything about this wonderful B&B was just perfect. The building itself is gorgeous and in the ideal location within Norwich city center. The rooms are incredible - so tastefully decorated, immaculate, homey, perfectly maintained. And Jan is just wonderful - from the amazing selection of little treats she leaves for guests in their rooms (as opposed to the typical packets of biscuits), the little extra things she does to make her guests feel at home, to the incredible breakfasts she prepares, everything was just fanastic. We had the added pleasure of meeting Dobby the cat, as well, who sat with us as we read the morning paper.", "title": "Amazing in every way!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LJWNYC2008", "date": "February 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25107447}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I travel frequently and are quite picky - and rarely have we stayed in a place that truly felt like home.

Jan, the bubbly and enthusiastic owner is truly wonderful, nothing is too much trouble. Within 5 minutes of arriving she had delivered delicious home made muffins and a huge pot of tea to our room, yum! We only spent one night here but will definitely be booking a much longer stay next time. Our room was right at the top of this magnificent house and was simply beautiful. The room has recently undergone a very sympathetic refurb, uneven walls and floors, which thank the lord have not been rectified, add to the very charm of this property. Our bathroom was immaculate with one of the best showers we have ever used. The location could not be better, as we found it so easy to get everywhere within a few minutes of walking out of the front doors. Despite its central location it is incredibly quiet and we slept extremely well in our \"ever so comfy bed\". Breakfast was sublime, small touches like good yoghurt, honey and blueberries and freshly squeezed juice already at our table, added to the feel that Jan really cares about her guests. We both opted for the Full English, which was very well cooked , with bacon and sausage to die for. We could have also had organic cereals and muesli. Despite feeling completely replete we could not resist the tempation of the homemade jams and marmalade.....delicious! This is one place we will definitely be coming back to.", "title": "Totally amazing!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Paul L", "date": "February 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 24673904}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "38 St Giles is the most amazing place.
