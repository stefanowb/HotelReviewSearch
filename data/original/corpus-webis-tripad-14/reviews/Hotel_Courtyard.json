The bed was a very thin mattress, was told the locals slept with no mattress. We had came from a very hot and humid Singapore, and the first night we had to wear sweaters, jackets, gloves, neck scarf, fleece hats, all the winter clothes we had. We requested if there was electric heater but they say only blankets, in the end we did not get them any blankets. The next morning we saw, opposite to our hotel, Courtyard Hotel. We met Michelle, she took to see the rooms. I booked the room immediately, it had a thick 6-inch king-size mattress, an electrical heater, clean-white bedsheet and duvet.

Both of them encourage the interaction with other guests, all of which you will find to be like-minded people, which makes for many interesting conversations with people you may never have even passed the time of day with.
