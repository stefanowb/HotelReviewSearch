There is a marina nearby that is mostly fenced in with a high gate and barbed wire. I have no idea how the Tripadvisor ratings are so high. The facilities themselves are fine - clean albeit outdated furnishings. It's as if they bought all the 'modern' furnishings off Overstock.com or something. Room is a good size with two big closets. There is a balcony overlooking the houses nearby. The rooms on one side of the hotel are overlooking construction. The hotel pool is nice and big. Food is fine. Not much variety in the buffets but sufficiently fresh.", "title": "Decent facilities, but nowhere near the beach.", "user": "esheng", "date": "August 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 137134475}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "The biggest problem is the location.
