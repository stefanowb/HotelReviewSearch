As soon as we arrived we realized that two nights was way too short of a time for the beauty and the enchantment of the place. It is a camp spread over, under lovely vegetation, the banks of a river where hippos and crocodiles abound. The colors of the sand on the river's banks, the milder climate of the Samburu region, and the overall feeling of openness and ease all contributed to our falling in love with it. We had an amazing driver (Jeremy who is no longer there) who was able to show us every possible animal one can imagine. He knew where to spot one of the only two leopards in the area, he knew at what time exactly entire families of elephants would bathe in the river and make fools of themselves while the babies (elephants) sought refuge under mama's legs for fear of attacks. In short, our two days at this camp and in this area were something that we will never forget. As for the cheeky monkeys, yes, they were everywhere, but as long as we kept the tent zipped up there were no problems. In fact, it was quite a cute thing to wake up and find them on our porch (really, how many times do we have such an experience in our overbuilt. societies?). The quality and the preparation of the food also belonged in a much higher class. Carefully prepared, it was varied and succulent. The wait staff and the helpers were also genuinely some of the nicest people we've ever met. To this day, I still correspond over facebook with one of their waiter (Franco), a guy with a crack-up sense of humor and a sincere desire to make your stay wonderful. I can't say anymore, other than I would like to go back soon. The safari company I used, Shoor Travel in Nairobi, was also splendid in securing our stays in the most delectable and unique places and we are most grateful to them for this particular arrangement.", "title": "The most memorable camp of all", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lzucchetti", "date": "September 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141457831}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "While some people", "title": "My favorite camp while on safari...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lucysfriend", "date": "September 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139843716}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Larsen's is a bit larger than some of the camps we stayed in while on safari, but not huge by any stretch of the imagination. What I liked so much about this camp was the setting under shade trees right next to the Uaso Nyiro River. Here you might find elephants or baboons next to your tent in the morning. You will definitely find the little vervet monkeys \"everywhere.\" In fact you are warned from the moment you arrive not to feed them or leave your tent unzipped or you may not like the results. There is a wonderful breeze through the camp many times of the day. It is hard to believe how cool it gets at night, yet how hot it can be during the day. The variety of birds here is remarkable. For birders, this is a great camp. One of the best parts about this camp is that there are hair dryers in your bathroom.

The setting of the camp is beautiful - right on the river with a lot of large nice trees providing shade and a place for the vervet monkeys to play. The sun comes up just across the river - so it made a neat backdrop for some very early morning sunrise photos. This is truly a tented camp experience, so make sure you're ready for that - a large canvas tent permanently mounted on an elevated platform. The rooms are very nice, and the beds are extremely comfortable. You do have to get adjusted to a bit of a lack of privacy being in a tent (which was new for us). We also found out that the monkeys are very smart - they figured out how to open the tents and come in looking for the morning cookies. We had a hilarious start to one day with a monkey \"visitor\" in our room. We shooed him away with no difficulties and it added to the great stories we will tell for years to come. The food is offered in a communal style - it is quite good with a number of selections - and the staff is excellent. The dining manager and the beverage manager were wonderful.
