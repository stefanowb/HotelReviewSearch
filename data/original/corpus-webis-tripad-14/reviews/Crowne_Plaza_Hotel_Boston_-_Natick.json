We recently held our 35th reunion here and we can't say enough about this upscale hotel (we were in the beautiful \"Constellation Room\") as well as the excellent service provided by all staff members. Senior Catering Sales Manager, Sherry Michelson is a true pro. She worked with us for nearly a year until we had an event planned that was specifically tailored to our needs and our budget. We started our evening with cocktails in the lobby area of the hotel and then moved into our function room. We had looked at several properties to host our event, and this by far was the most unique, offering us the flexibilty to use several spacial areas of the hotel to mix things up a bit. I heard from several classmates who opted to get overnight rooms who were extremely pleased with their accommodations. The renovations are amazing!

Our most recent experience was unique in that we had a personal issue that the hotel staff stepped up to the plate for, and all involved were amazing help! The general manager, Steve, handled us with top notch professionalism. Very attentive and caring. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the Natick/Boston/Framingham area. Rooms are clean and comfortable...with a contemporary flair. The bar, The Violet Thorn, is hip and also boasts a contemporary feel with roaring glass fireplace, unique lighting and cozy seating.

However, he discovered taxis did not run that early and only limousines, which would go directly to the airport , would be willing to come out at that hour - for a charge of well over $100.00! At that point, Mr. Barry graciously said that he thought he had a solution to our problem, since we had already changed our flight and could not go at any other time. He offered to take us to the nearby Station if the other gentleman on duty at 4:00 AM would not mind covering for him for 10 minutes.
