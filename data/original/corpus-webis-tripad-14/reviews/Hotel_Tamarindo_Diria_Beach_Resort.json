First, there is a lot of construction going on. In the hallway right outside my ocean front room, they were redoing the ceiling. It was dusty and loud all day - even on the weekends. If you opt to stay here, make them promise to put you in a room away from the construction. I asked to move, but they were completely sold out. Second, the walls are paper thin and many of the guests who opt to stay in Tamarindo are in party mode. Given the construction and the other loud guests and the blaring music from the hotel's own bar, this is not the place to go for quiet beach serenity (and, in fact, if that's what you're looking for, I'd skip Tamarindo all together). Third, the housekeeping staff really dials it in. They didn't replace dirty glasses with clean ones, they didn't restock in-room coffee, the floor was never quite clean, etc. For a hotel of this caliber, it was not acceptable. Fourth, when you check in they give you a ticket that you can exchange for 1 beach towel. If you fail to return the ticket at check out, they charge you $20.

It is on a very nice beach, it is in an ideal location and there are a few options for dining. I just feel that for the price they charge, it should've been a nicer property. Small details made my experience sub-par. The AC leaked all over the bed, the property and room weren't super clean, the property feels a little old and tired and the service was really not great. It is definitely a surfer hotel and it is fun to watch all the activity along the beach. The drinks were good at the bar but I had to flag someone down twice to get service (not because they were busy, but rather too busy talking to co-workers than to work!). The breakfast buffet was very good and located in a nice restaurant overlooking the beach. Tamarindo was a fun little town but I don't think it's worth staying more than two nights unless you are a surfer. If you find a good deal on the hotel, definitely go! If you are paying full price, I just don't think it is worth it.", "title": "Not a bad property but not a good value for the price", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "SEGMN", "date": "December 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146877615}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I recently spent four nights here on our trip across Costa Rica.

Our room was small with the bathroom being very small. While we did have a nice view of the beach, there were several nights when music coming from either the Diria or a neighboring hotel was very loud and continued late (one night until 1 AM) which kept me awake on both occasions. While the grounds are nice form lounging and enjoying the ocean view, if you sit too close to the wall separating the beach from the hotel property there is a steady stream of beach vendors trying to sell all sorts of \"stuff\". And they come back over and over, even though you've said \"no gracias\" on numerous times. The pool \"across the street\" was nice and not used much, but the majority of lounge chairs were broken and if they weren't they were uncomfortable.
