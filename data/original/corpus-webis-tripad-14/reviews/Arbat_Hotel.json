When the judge in our region waived our two week waiting period, our return trip through Moscow was moved up by 14 days. Every American chain was fully booked. Every other \"recommended\" hotel was also booked. We even tried to find an rental apartment I was so opposed to staying at the Arbat. No luck. So back to the Arbat we went. Now here is the best part of the story: I don't know what we did right this time around, but the room we had at the Arbat in November was terrific! We had a bedroom to ourselves (my husband and I), another room with a large fold-out sofa for the boys (with a TV that had at least 1 channel of cartoons - hooray!), another room with a desk and sofa, a full bath with tub and shower, and a half bath! There was a fridge for sodas we bought on Arbat Street, which was an easy walk from the hotel. The buffet breakfast, included in the rate, was fabulous. A large assortment of Russian and Western style breakfast foods, including fresh fruit, juice, pancakes, eggs, blini, yogurt, pastries, etc. Since we had the boys with us, we needed to get out during the day, and Arbat Street was very entertaining for the kids. Santa and other cartoon characters (costumed adults) strolled Arbat Street as the holiday season approached. McDonalds is also on Arbat Street ... need I say more? A few surly looking characters as well, so keep the kids in sight. While a couple of the reviews posted here mention internet service not being very good, and the mention about the rates, paying in Rubles, etc., etc. are definitely an issue, I cannot comment on those issues as (1) we had no need (or time) to seek out internet availability, and (2) our trip was a necessity to complete our adoption, so we really could not quibble about the cost, etc. Suffice it to say, that if you are traveling to Moscow and the price and location work for you, consider the Arbat. I would request seeing the room first before agreeing to it. And unsmiling desk clerks? Well, just be lovely and polite and smile at them anyway ... they LIVE in Russia; you get to go home.", "title": "Useless internet connection and surly staff", "user": "szlwzl", "date": "March 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14116110, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location and price", "disliked": "\u2014 surly staff and internet access"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Although this is supposed to be a business hotel their internet access is ridiculous, for the first 300 roubles(roughly \u00a36) you get 5MB of data transfer and then you start paying more.
