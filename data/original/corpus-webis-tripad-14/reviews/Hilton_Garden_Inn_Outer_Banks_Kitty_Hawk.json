My wife and I stay here multiple times each year because we love the hotel, the staff, and the location. The hotel is situated perfectly in Kitty Hawk as soon as you reach the island. The property is great, with access to the Kitty Hawk Pier for fishing or just taking in the view. The rooms are quite large and spacious and all rooms have a view, even if they're not oceanfront. I particularly love the breakfast, and I've found the kitchen staff to be extremely accommodating. The french toast, omelets, and pancakes are fantastic and the cook that makes them is super friendly and always helpful. I have yet to use the indoor pool and exercise room but both are great amenities and look like excellent facilities. We find that this is a great place to stay when we want to go to the beach to get away from everything at home. We always leave here feeling relaxed and always have a great time while we're here. If you enjoy hanging out on the beach, you can rent umbrellas, chairs, and even floats and boogies boards directly from the hotel right on the beach. The pool, which is oceanfront on the hotel side of the dunes, always has the best sea breeze. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone that likes to visit the Outer Banks and that wants the comforts of home while being at the beach.", "title": "Always A Wonderful Stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ardmoreflyer", "date": "September 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 79783173}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Let me start by saying my spouse and I travel and stay in hotels approximately 8 weeks per year, so we are more accustomed and expect a certain level of service from a hotel that is a member of the hilton chain.

The property itself is beautiful. However, the rooms are a different story. After checking in (this was a free stay using Hilton rewards), we go to our room. We walk in, there's a newpaper on the floor, someone's McDonalds cup sitting on the nightstand, the pillow looked liked someone slept on it, the ice bucket is full of water and there's a used bar of soap sitting out in the bathroom. It looked like the housekeeper decided she didn't want to finish cleaning the room ! It was pretty disgusting, so we marched right down to the front desk. They were very apologetic and immediately gave us a new room. Well, taking a shower later that night (room 210), within 2 minutes, the water in the tub had backed up and was ankle deep ! They obviously need to Drano that tub ! Finally, being a Diamond member, I am always comped breakfast vouchers for my wife, my daughter and myself. Well, I only received two breakfast coupons, which was disappointing, especially after the ordeal at checki-in. I guess since you have a free room, you get what you paid for.

First of all the Outer Banks is a unique ocean/ beach location. I know thing or two about beach locations because I live in and travel around Florida. Unlike Florida where beaches are usually lined with mammoth condos structures, and the Outer Banks you'll find beach houses lining the beaches, people riding their bikes to and from, and the comfortable down home beach experience that is second to none. It is truly a special place. The Hilton Garden combines beauty, functionality and comfort in its design. Everything you could possibly want to do during your beach vacation you can do either at the hotel or buried close nearby. You can swim in the ocean, the pool, work out at the hotel exercise room or take advantage of their partnership with a larger gym facility. The hotel has its own fishing pier and there were several additional piers nearby. Every kind of water sport is available close by including jet skiing, boating, parasailing, windsurfing, surfing,etc. Note that the water temperature is cool. At least it is from my perspective but then of course I live in Florida. This is one of the few places in the United States where you go hang gliding for both the novice and the more experienced. So if you are like me and you enjoy trying new experiences, there's plenty to do in the Outer Banks. The staff in the hotel personifies the friendly, caring, southern hospitality that is typical of the unpretentious South. This is a lovely place to stay, next year I will return again but stay much longer. One of the surprising memories for me is that although I am not typically a meat eater, don't usually eat more than two steaks or hamburgers a year, I had maybe the best hamburger I have ever tasted anywhere (and I've done alot of traveling) at this Hilton Garden. I took a bite of the hamburger my son ordered and ordered one for myself without thinking twice. Although I felt a little guilty, I had to have another one and it was the last thing I did before I left the hotel. Don't leave the Outer Banks without ordering a hamburger and french fries at this hotel. About the sleep quality, I must have known feather non down pillows feather beds etc. I think one of the pillows that I slept on the first night was feather because I was a little stuffy in the morning. I left a note for the housekeeper asking that anything that was farther be replaced with hypoallergenic, there were different pillows when I returned that afternoon. Everything combined makes this vacation experience at this hotel just about perfect. I highly recommend this hotel.", "title": "Great hotel, incomparable location, outstanding friendly service\u2013a GEM", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SWEETHEARTSUNNY", "date": "August 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 73677881}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "First, ;et me say there are not an abundance of places to stay (hotels) on the Outer Banks that are named chains.
