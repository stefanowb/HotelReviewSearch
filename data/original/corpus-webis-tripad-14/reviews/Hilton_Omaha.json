Yes, rooms are starting to see some slight evidence of wear and tear (nothing out of the ordinary for a convention hotel that gets a lot of use), but management has noticed it before it has become an issue and a renovation is scheduled.

Bathtub had a large rust stain and a few of the shower head sprays pointed in awkward directions due to lime/grit buildup.

Rooms were larger then average, with plenty of room for a large desk and a comfortable chair/ottoman. Room was decorated very nicely. 32 inch flat screen TV's had a great picture.
