We have travelled to Orlando probably a dozen times over the years (our honeymoon was spent there in fact) but this was the best venue yet! The staff cleaned constantly and were very helpful. They had full time recreation people around the poolside, cabana bars and activities for all ages/ all the time. The fitness area is small but we packed in and did our thing anyway! Everyone was friendly and yes, there was timeshare presentations trying to engage you but hey, that's Orlando. No pressure was felt on our part to go and the free family portrait was a wonderful perk. We ended up buying some extra copies but it was worth it. As far as internet access, I am on vacation...buy a cheap phone card and CALL home! That is probably why we had such a relaxing time, sitting in front of a computer was out of the equation. It was all about fun and relaxation.

There are a lot of very good golf courses in the area as well. The resort has a free shuttle that runs 3 times a day to and from Disney World. They should segregate areas for families and adults so that you can decide if you want to relax in a quiet atmosphere and not have screaming children around. Restaurants are about 3 miles or more away. We did find a very good Asian restaurant, Sakura. There are really no activities for adults at this resort, it is primarily geared towards children.
