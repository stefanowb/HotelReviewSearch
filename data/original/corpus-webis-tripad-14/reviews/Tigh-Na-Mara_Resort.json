My window looked out onto the Georgia Straight, a pictoresque view of ocean water, mountains and a wide span of blue sky. In a few minutes, I was able to transplant myself from the vaulted ceiling room to the beach down below. I felt like I had finally come home when I took of my sandals and walked barefoot along the shore. The scent of ocean sprayed across the water, arriving with the gentle breeze that caressed my face. Shells, seaweeds and empty crabshells turned the morning into a childish game as I stepped, scooped and stored the newfound treasures into my pocket. Invigorated by my seaside explorations, I made my way through the tall cedar trees along the forested path to The Grotto. Within seconds of entering the spa building, I was overwhelmed by a sense of tranquility and calm. A stream of cascading water welcomed me on my way to the inner water sanctuary. To prepare for the mineral pool, I showered under a unique copperhead faucet reminiscent of ancient times. My mental pace began to diminish, as reluctant as my body was to slow down - slow down from the pace of living that modern life demands. I stepped into the warm waters of the healing bath and sunk into bliss. Floating and careening through the water steadily drew me into a deeper state of relaxation. My mind dreamed of cultures of people who, over the centuries, regularly returned to such sacred aqueous areas to rejuvenate and detoxify their bodies. The traditions of water therapy balance the body at all levels of existence - physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. Bathing in the mineral waters simply is similar to our sojourn in the saline waters of the womb awaiting birth. Upon leaving Tigh-na-mara, I felt reborn, full of new dreams and rekindled hope.

We got a free pass to go into the mineral bath (normally a $40 value) - you get to go to the mineral bath with your 1hr+ spa treatment (which we were doing the next day), so we wanted to maximize the experience and spent the evening at the mineral bath. It was a great experience - the mineral bath was absolutely amazing, there's a mineral pool, hot tub, and cold shower, some lounging chairs with tables and magazines, and a water cooler so we could stay hydrated - the only comment I have is that they ran out of robes that evening.

(Make sure to book everything way in advance of your trip) We had to split up some of the treatments so one girl went for her 90 minute massage at 10am while the rest of us slept in. Then we checked into the spa so that we could all meet up at TreeTop Lounge (on the top floor of the spa, third floor). The women's locker room on the main floor is huge, lots of lockers, lots of space, plenty of change rooms, mirrors, showers with space to put your robe and to change in (the shower heads were really interesting, big wide rain-like pouring spouts) Up at the lounge (in our robes), the server said that the tapas were quite small, there was a selection of 40 altogether, but I can tell you that they weren't that small - each of the tapas were creatively and beautifully presented on their own plates, one by one. Absolutely exquisite! We ordered 26 of the 40 tapas and most of them were fantastic! We ate luxuriously for 2.5 hours (let me know if you want to see pictures, we took one of every dish we got!). There is a spa concierge and the lounging area just outside of the restaurant - I let the concierge know that we were still eating, and they had our massage therapists come to get us right in the restaurant! So 3 of us girls had our 90 minute massages at that time. My massage was very relaxing, the blanket kept me warm and comfy - so much so that I fell asleep (the food probably did it too). It was a relaxation massage (not therapeutic) because my attendant was not a registered massage therapist from BC (you would have to check with them first if that's what you needed). After our massages, we went back and relaxed and rehydrated in the lounge until we were due for our pedicures - there is a main lounge area and also a women's only lounge area - we tried them both. The main lounge area had beverages (tea, water) and fruits to snack on, the women's lounge didn't, but an attendant came to check on us and to see if we wanted anything! Our estheticians came up to get us in the lounge, and we went down to the main floor into the manicure/pedicure room. We sat in reclining massage chairs with foot baths. The 3 other girls had 90 minute pedicures, and I had the basic 60 minute sport pedicure - this is the only disappointing part of the experience for me - the 90 minute pedicure included a foot/leg/hand massage and paraffin wax, as well as a polish. The sport pedicure only had the hand/leg massage and no polish, but I felt that my treatment was not performed well - she barely massaged my feet, and the overall result wasn't very good - I ended up having to do more work on my feet back at the suite. I left the spa earlier and walked back to the suite to prepare dinner (it was a light meal since we were all still full from lunch). Somehow my room pass stopped working so I had to walk back to the spa and had them deliver a new pass. The rest of the girls came back to the suite while I was setting up, and we spent another evening chatting, playing games, and eating - we wanted to go back to the mineral bath, but we ran out of time.", "title": "Great Setting & Amazing Food", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "stationgate", "date": "May 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7540619, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Jacuzzi"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We booked a cottage at Tigh Na Mara to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
