This is a beautifully decorated B&B and we were fortunate to get the ground floor \"family room\" which was a suite with a fabulous marble bathroom. This is a very stylish, yet casual environment.. The setting is parklike with large gardens, absolutely quiet. Located in the Graves region, it is only 15 minutes from the center of Bordeaux and easy commuting to St. Emilion and the Medoc. There are chateaux and gardens galore to visit, with stunning small village churches and stone architecture.
