The lobby changes are very new, sleek and modern. Nice conversation areas, boarding pass printers, departures listed by the elevator. Rooms have been redecorated very nicely. Nice little sofa in our room with new mattress on our king size bed. But, gone are the elements that made it where I liked to stay. Free parking and internet aside (and good prices), the Bistro idea needs to be totally redone, including the continental breakfast. Gone is the omlette station that made it special with the included reasonably priced breakfast. Gone are the nice simple dinners that one could get with a nice glass of wine and enjoy. Gone are the comfortable breakfast tables with plates and cups and glasses of orange juice and endless coffee. Gone with the service are the tips that at least gave the staff an opportunity (if not incentive) to make some extra money and give rudimentary service. The breakfast menu cries out for some decent variations other than just egg scramble. We had a snippy \"Well, you both want coffee and orange juice\" after we gave the waitress our breakfast voucher, a program Marriott has yet to perfect. We not only waited 10 minutes to get waited on at the counter, I had to ask for coffee that should have been offered to me. They offered no glasses for the orange juice, only the bottle out of the cooler, and one cup of coffee (granted Starbucks) with no obvious attempt to refill. To be fair, coffee is still available 24/7 at the coffee bar but I miss real cups and the pot of coffee on the table. If they are trying to cut down on expenses, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. But, I think this microwave and pre-packaged Bistro lacks not only imagination but any kind of consideration for the people they want to attract. Tall tables and bar stools are not good for seniors, children or families. The message: we don't want you. You expect overpriced items in New York (and the Marriott) but this menu pushes the limits of garbage food and poor service.", "title": "Renovation Not Complete", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "BeanOhio", "date": "December 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 50449263}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My message is that the old Courtyard is gone and it's too bad.

The shuttle can get frustrating when you have pilots and air crew boarding.

These delays in getting to P4 can delay your entrance into NYC, because the trains from New Jersey Transit are timed every half hour.
