My husband went a la carte and he had a excellent meal. I chose the lunch set menu and was disappointed. Although for eur 32 for 3 courses in a Michelin star resto, I didn't expect a eur 100 meal, I was disappointed with the plain ingredients used (chicken as a main??) and my starter (red mullet) was slightly sinewy. I didn't find the dishes to be that flavorful. Our waitress was very nice though the maitre d' annoyed me by continuing to use French when discussing the menu when it was clear to her that I struggled with French (though gave it a good go) and she spoke English well. I would expect this at a brasserie in France but not at a Michelin star resto where service is paramount. At a certain point, I simply asked her to speak in English but I didn't think I ought to have needed to do so. Overall, though, go a la carte and you will enjoy the food. Wine list is reasonable for Corsican wines.", "title": "Be careful of the lunchtime set menu", "user": "CPThomas", "date": "May 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 161019204}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited May 2013", "text": "We dined here our last night in Calvin and our table of 4 all started with the asparagus which was beautifully presented and delicious. My husband and I shared the local fish for 2 which was also great. Or dining companions had the meat and the lobster which was sadly not the same quality. My friends lobster was a nit undercooked and her husbands stake a bit tough and chewy.....as this was a special occasion for them this was disappointing! We also made the experience of having to order dessert with the other orders. For a souffl\u00e9 or other timed dessert this makes sense to me, but for the other desserts less so....", "title": "Our meal very good but dining companions not quite so good...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "marlena m", "date": "May 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 160370805}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited September 2012", "text": "The ambience was very good ands the service was good but it is obvious that the staff is uncomfortable with English so could be a challenge if no one in your party speaks French.

We were seated at a large round table for 6 people, pushed to the side of the room with our backs to the restaurant, facing a wall! We had no side plates and no wine glasses on the setting.We gave the maitrie'd our starter and main course order, and she then asked us what we would like for dessert! Her face was not impressed as I told her I would prefer to decide after my main course. The starters were ok, but there was so much foam you couldn't see the dishes. I had the saddle of lamb. The presentation was not michelin standard atall. I had two mouthfuls of lamb and the rest was pure fat! It was accompanied with aubergine caviar, but it looked and tasted like baby food!I my partners fish tasted good but the presentation was terrible! I complained to the waitress and she just smiled. The maitrie'd not informed. We had to top up our own water and wine throughout the meal. I have never written a review about any restaurant before but I felt I had to after this experience! Restaurants are awarded michelin stars for their outstanding food and service, which almost gives them the right to charge the prices they do. (\u20ac34 for a starter) This means that people expect a high standard no matter what! This restaurant was so overpriced for the food we recieved and the service we got. I have been working in this very high end industry for 7 years on board super yachts so I know what is expected from a Michelin star restaurant. I am so disappointed.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Guillaumeleconqueran", "date": "July 20, 2012", "id": 134917230}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited March 2012", "text": "You can't go wrong.
