It was to be a special holiday for my daughters, granddaughter and friend. When we arrived we were in a completely different villa. Nowhere near as nice as the one we had booked. When we queried this we were told that the villa we had booked (and confirmed) wouldn't be available for three days. As we were only there for five days this was not acceptable. We were eventually transferred to the villa we had booked but by then it was too late.

We were served \"Jungle Juice\" rather than fresh juice which is readily available and delicious in Bali. The pastries were extremely ordinary and delicious pastries are available at retail outlets nearby in Seminyak. We opted to have breakfast at nearby restaurants on a couple of occasions and much preferred the experience. We have stayed in villas in Bali before where breakfast has been prepared in our room at a far higher standard, so we know it is possible.

Overall we enjoyed the stay, but it doesn't take much to reduce the overall experience. These villas are not cheap to stay in and the very least that international travellers expect is wifi.
