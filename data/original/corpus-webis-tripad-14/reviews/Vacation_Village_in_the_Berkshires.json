This is my timeshare resort. I love this resort, because you can do different things in every season. The summer is beautiful, going to the lake, and Mt. Greylock. The fall the colors of the leaves come right out at you! The resort is in the middle of the mountains across from Jimmy Peak. In the winter, it is completely different. Cold crisp air, snow on the mountain at Jimmy Peak. Watching the skiers while swimming in the indoor pool, is so cool. But my favorite thing of all is, that this resort is pet friendly. It has three building just for people who want to spend their vacation with their pets. I love it. I can now take my two dogs with me, and spend quality time with them. They enjoy it as much as I do.

We are a couple age 32, stayed for a week. The location worked out great for us. Powder Hounds at Jiminy Peak has some really friendly waitresses that helped us with some must see places around the area. The small country store at Jiminy Peak was okay for a couple of necessities. We also were able to find a few necessities at the Store at Five Corners and Cricket Creek Farms. We typically shop local produce at home so it was nice to find places to shop for local dairy and produce so close to the resort. The resort itself worked out rather well for the most part. Being a younger couple relative to the average clientele I believe I slightly threw off the staff upon check-in. I can look young sometimes so there was a little confusion as to whether I was old enough to check-in. But once we got past that the rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Not all guests are over 60 so it isnt a retirement village, its just a product of timeshares. The typical person under 40 isnt going to be able to afford the money and time for a timeshare. We got lucky with a voucher from some RCI members. We noticed about 4 or 5 couples that were younger than 40. I believe i may have been in the same building as Emma because we ended up next to a family with a young child that loved to run down the hall, but hey thats a kid and they have energy to burn. The first night they stayed I think they didnt realize how thin the walls were and we awoke at 1:30am to their conversations and jacuzzi tub noise. I think they discovered how thin the walls were by the next day and were respectful the rest of the week. It is unfortunate that you can hear basic volume conversations through the walls though. There isnt a lot that can be done about that by the resort short of adding insulation to every shared wall, and as a guest its not comforting to stay alert to what your saying and doing in your own bedroom so as not to make your neighbor a part of it. Now for the wi-fi. Ive seen the response from Vac. Village that the priority of the guests is not wi-fi in these days of smart phones and unlimited date plans. The problem is that I see a lot of reviews putting bad marks on your wi-fi. I think in these days of E-Readers it is time to bite the bullet and provide wi-fi to your guests. I think i saw out-houses on the side of the road that had free wi-fi. Charging $10 a day is really in the dark ages of providing wi-fi especially if its slow. The Radisson has had free wi-fi since 1995. I think a good start would be to offer free wi-fi for basic internet connection and email but then have a charge for higher bandwidth usage. But the speed will need to be addressed either way. To continue the review. The onsight nature trail was definitely better than I hoped. It had a couple surprises and was easy walking. I tend to take hard trails back home but after being out all day, walking this easy, pretty, forested trail near the room was a nice relaxing end to the afternoon. Then there is the bed. Short of putting in a sleep-by-number bed in every room I dont see how any hotel/resort could ever make everyone happy. It was very soft and i felt like I was being swallowed and suffocated by it but i could see how the right person could feel like they were sleeping on air. At least there is a pull out bed in the couch for a change of sleeping venue if needed. Last, the shower is big enough for two but the water pressure is depressing. A bulk purchase of shower head replacements for the resort would do a lot for the morale of the guests. Nothing like a good shower to make people forget about their troubles.", "title": "Nice place, just a couple things shy of excellent.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "trueyemage", "date": "September 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 140597171}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Why terrible?
