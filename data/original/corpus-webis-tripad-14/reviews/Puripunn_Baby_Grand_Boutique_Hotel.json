The rooms are very beautiful, clean and spacious. The hotel facilities are very nice, lots of flowers, trees...it seems that you are somehow in the middle of a forest! It is a small hotel, so you won't see the breakfast area crowded or the pool full of people, it's a very relaxing hotel just 5 minutes by tuk-tuk to downtown! Close to the hotel you have restaurants and everything but the hotel has free shuttle to downtown or the night market at many hours so it's not necessary to arrange a taxi!", "title": "Fantastic!", "user": "Lorelaina", "date": "July 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 36199735}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Service is exellent, all staff is very helpful and kind!", "title": "Great ,Great ,& Great services", "user": "csiri_99", "date": "July 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35242004}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I was there with my family.
