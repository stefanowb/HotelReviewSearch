They took our flight details and kept track of the flight so that the pick up service was on time.

I think the fellows name was Justin, but I am not 100% sure. The room itself was a King, not a large room whatsoever. But the sheets were clean, the room was spotless. The bathroom sink is located outside of the actual bathroom (not my favorite setup for a sink). But it had a nice countertop and plenty of counter-top room. The lighting over the sink could have been a tad brighter for me. The bathroom tub/shower & toilet were in a small room with hardwood floors. The shower water pressure was a bit skimpy....but it worked, and again, all very very clean. The air-conditioning unit worked fantastic. There was a large window one could open up if you didn't want to run air-conditioning. There are 2 buildings both with 2 floors. Keep in mind if you need assistance, there are no elevators to 2nd floor. On check-out the gal that was working was extremely friendly and kind. There was free coffee/ tea and Sunday newspaper. I will return here again in the near future and have to say these employees care about this facility and the grounds.
