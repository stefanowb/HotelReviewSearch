It's positioned very close to the main shoppng area and very close to the Forbidden City and Tianamen Square. The lobby is huge, decorated with black marble and has it's own shopping arcade with Tiffanys, Cartier and other top brand names. Check-in was a pleasure with very pleasant staff who all spoke exceptional English. The rooms are large with 42 inch flat screen tv's, coffee making facilities, hairdryer, iron and ironing board. The mini-bar is very well stocked and for a 5 star hotel exceptionally cheap! The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have ever experienced. It is situated in the Jing restaurant that is below ground but had something to suit anyone. From eggs and bacon to miso soup; danish, a massive choice of fruit, they will make pancakes or waffles for you, omlettes, in fact just about anything you want - even baked beans! We used the hotel for a day trip to the Badaling Great Wall and found their own tour guides to be very good. Our guide was called Lily in english and tailored our day around what we wanted to do - most of the tours you book will take you to a jade market or something like that, but as our tour was tailored it was made to suit us. It cost about 1900 yuen per person for the day and that included all entrance fees, a fantastic chinese lunch and a visit to the ming tombs. It left when we wanted to from the hotel and dropped us back when we were ready.", "title": "Would definately go back", "user": "Something-Different!", "date": "October 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10349913}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I would definately recommend this hotel.", "title": "Beautiful rooms, noisy tour groups and public areas", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Sinberg", "date": "October 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10219814, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Room design and quality, cleanliness, staff, Huang Ting restaurant", "disliked": "\u2014 Tour groups, noise, crowded public spaces, over rated tours"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned from Beijing having spent two night at the Peninsula in two interconnecting Grand Deluxe Club rooms. The rooms were attractive, spotless, and very comfortable if a teensy bit on the small side. The rooms really felt luxurious. Unfortunately, once we left our room the serenity was shattered. We found that the hotel was filled to the brim with tour groups. The lobby is super noisy and packed with very large tour groups waiting for buses, and checking in and out. The elevators were stuffed full as was the club lounge, and the hallways were quite busy with guests day and night. We found the highly touted academy tours that are supposedly exclusive to the hotel to be over-priced, standard, run-of-the-mill tours and were quite dissapointed in this regard. Huang Ting was one of the high points of our stay and truly outstanding (absolutely don't miss this restaurant!) while we thought that Jing was good but not a must. We found the staff on the Club level to be helpful and attentive. Overall, I have mixed feelings about our stay at the Peninsula. It may be that my expectations were too high or that we chose a bad time for our stay as it coincided with the stay of so many tour groups. There isn't anything wrong with tour groups it's simply that the design of the public areas of the hotel, from the lobby to elevators and hallways, doesn't seem to accomodate these groups well creating an atmosphere where the groups feel obtrusive.

The thing I love about the other Peninsula properties i have stayed at is that they almost anticipate my needs before I even ask. This was not the case at this property.

I had left some valuables out in the room and was not happy about this. Their wi-fi service was slow and intermittent, althought complimentary. The hotel was virtually empty (as were many other Beijing hotels at this time) and yet the hotel was unwilling to give me an upgrade (for a fee) to the club floor. The hotel airport transfers were sub par as well -- the greeters at the airport were disorganized and made us walk around the parking garage with them to find the car instead of keeping us in a pick up spot to wait for the car to come to us. When it did arrive, it was an OLD model mercedes which compared to other hotels like the Mandarin Oriental or Regent, was very below standard. I would not use their car service again for the amount of money paid (about $100 each way). Doormen were pretty god for getting taxis. Restaurant Jing was a good breakfast buffet but on the expensive side - $40 a person. Overall, i would not recommend this property, especially for those of you who regularly stay at Peninsula Hotels.

It's expensive and eclectic, but very good. You must order the chocolate dessert that is warm and oozy and served in a bowl with dry ice for effect. Wild ! Its a short drive from the hotel. Don't walk, its too far. We negotiated a driver from the hotel and were slightly overcharged. We let the conierge desk know for their information and it was no big deal. Within minutes the unrequested difference in cash in an envelope was slipped under our door. Can you imagine that happening in any U.S. or Canadian Hotel ? Asia is all about service and China specifically about \"saving face\". The people here are very welcoming.The Club floor is excellent. When you arrive, don't be put off by the outside appearance. It's what's inside that works and works nicely. The hotel run \"Jing\" restaurant is beautiful, but overpriced and like most places in Beijing, it's okay to smoke while others dine. Oh, and \"Made In China\" is a very good restaurant in the Hyatt hotel, a short walk from the Peninsula.

As soon as I settled in, though, I realized that the reason the room looks so unassuming is because there was a place for everything and everything was in its place. The room design is well thought out. It was always a pleasure to come back to after a day of sightseeing in Beijing. The breakfast buffet in the Jing restaurant was outstanding with many choices. The entire restaurant was sparkling clean. The open kitchen was immaculate. It was a pleasure to wake up to that delicious breakfast every morning. I ate once in the Huang Ting restaurant and found it too was delicious. The staff was attentive, courteous and professional. Most spoke English and those that did not were eager to do there best to help. The morning that I checked out, I had forgotten my password to the room safe and someone was in my room to help me open it in less than 5 minutes. I can only think of two things to complain about. First, I found the bed to be a bit on the hard side. Second, the room rates are pricey. That having been said, however, it is not enough to make me not go back to the Peninsula.
