Ladies, the only toiletries that are included is an all-in-one shampoo/body wash dispenser on the wall in the shower and a hand soap dispenser near the sink. We found this adequate but others may want to come prepared with additonal comforts. (To my surprise my hair actually looked better than when I use expensive products from home.) A toiletry kit can be purchased from the hotel. Toilet tissue is from a dispenser in small sheets. (You'll adjust.) The shower is fairly small so obese people should be aware of that. If you book online a \"cot\" means a baby crib in the U.K. In the U.S. a cot is a portable folding single bed.

The beds at all Premier Inns are superb, huge and comfy. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, the shower great! The hotel was let down by poor service in the restuarant. The waiter came and took my order and I then sat for 25 minutes until he came back and said he had forgotten what I had ordered. I re-ordered; starter, main and a drink, and then waited about 10 minutes for the starter. The food is good, a decent choice on the menu and good value for money. Sadly, the service was a let down. When I had finished, the waiter presented me with a bill despite the fact that I had pre-paid for dinner. This wouldn't put me off using the hotel again, it is ideally located, clean, comfortable and good value for money - maybe they should just buy the waiter an order pad and pencil!
