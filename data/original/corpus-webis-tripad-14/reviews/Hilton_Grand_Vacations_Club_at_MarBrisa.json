The hotel has it's own private entrance to the park, which was great. The phase two pool area was really nice. I wish that the poolside restaurant/bar was open but I was told that it would be open during the summer months. There was a great gas fireplace near the pool. Also, while the TV's were HD, none of the channels were HD. Channel selection was also a bit limited for the kids. This was not a big deal, but a bit surprising.

I specially love their new pool and the fact that they have a small bar/resto with decent prices from the drinks to the food. Their pool is so big that I don't feel crowded by the other people enjoying the area. The only CONS I noted is the lack of washer/dryer in the units. Been to 2 other Hilton Clubs and I specially appreciate the washer units coz I have kids. They also need to put redbox type of DVD rentals that I enjoyed when I was in the Grand Waikikian in OAHU.

I also voiced my opinion at the desk upon checkout. Below are some of the issues that occured in which I was less then pleased. * We had a family above us that had 3 children. The children DID NOT STOP running the entire 4 days of our stay. It sounded like our ceiling was going to cave in. It started early in the morning, in the late afternoons and even as late as midnight. I made over 4 phone calls to the front desk to please call that guest's room and ask them to please have them stop running. Im not sure if the room was called or not, because the kids never stopped running. We were constantly being woken up by the running. They would also run up and down the stairs, across the 2nd floor pathway and then back up stairs as well. After multiple phone calls to the front desk with nothing being down, I gave up. I was traveling with my 2 elderly parents in which this was supposed to be a relaxing getaway, instead we lost sleep and were annoyed. * Towels and trash. I had to call the front desk/guest services several times to have new towels brought to our room as well as have our trash throw out. When I called the second day of our stay, no one ever came to do that. I finally tracked down one of the housekeepers and asked that they come give us fresh towels and take away the trash. I had placed a call to the front desk as well as put the plaque requesting that service on my door. The 3rd day was the same thing. A call was made, no one came and then I finally got fresh towels from a housekeeper, but this time they did not take the dirty wet towels, they layed in a huge mound on the floors in both bathrooms and were still there when we checked out. We had 3 bags of trash sitting on the floor as well. Needless to say I was very displeased with the service at MarBrisa. As a Hilton Grand Vacation owner, this was not acceptable.
