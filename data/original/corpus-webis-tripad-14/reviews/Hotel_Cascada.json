It's an 8-10 walk from the train station; in some cities, that might mean you were in a sketchy part of town, but not so in Luzern, since the train station is central to almost everything. Our neighborhood was upscale and interesting, again just 8-10 walk to the river and the old town. The hotel was relatively modern, certainly chic in the lobby; the room was large and comfortable, ditto the bathroom. As usual, everything was spotlessly clean. Staff was friendly and helpful; breakfast buffet the best of our trip (omelets cooked to order). We ate only breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Luzern is wonderful, and the hotel helped make it possible. Tip: it's much easier to walk from the train station, pulling a suitcase, to the Cascada than going into the old town, over cobblestones.
