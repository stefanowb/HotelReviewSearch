As my previous post states, at times I do require a hotel/motel room on Cape Cod to avoid the Summer traffic as I now live on the South Shore. I am amazed with the over-inflated prices for hotels and motels on Cape Cod. This motel looked \"OK\" from the street. As I turned into the property from rte 28 I then noticed the large amount of bicycles chained and lock to every inanimate object. Your unable to view this phenomenon from the street until you enter the property because of the narrow entrance. I then realized I had entered a motel that rents out on a weekly basis i.e. \"affordable housing\" My observation was confirmed when I entered the lobby and witnessed several residents rummaging through the communal post office box looking for their mail. My assigned room smelled like a smoky bar.... \" Of course it's going to smell like a smoky bar, someone has lived in it all winter smoking cigarettes! \"", "title": "Same old Rat Hole on the rte 28 Motel Mile", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "scott s", "date": "July 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "front_desk": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 17407439, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 My earplugs, Ambien tablet and the AC actually worked!", "disliked": "\u2014 I'm embarrassed that I stayed at this motel."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Motel opportunities are limited in the Hyannis/South-West Yarmouth/Dennis area.

Rooms are cleaned once a week, I kid you not. It is advertised with \"free continental breakfast\". This consists of 1 box of cereal and a box of old, half eaten doughnuts at the front desk, which is a unattended shack. When we first arrived there was no one at reception. 30 minutes later the \"manager\" strolls in from an adjacent room, just out of his bed. It was early afternoon. He then denies the cheaper prices he quoted us on the phone so we have to pay more. In the pictures there is a pool. In real life there is a cesspool covered in tarpaulin. It seemed like we were the only idiots who chose to stay there as it was completely empty. We found out later that there are lots of much better, cleaner, cheaper motels on the same street.
