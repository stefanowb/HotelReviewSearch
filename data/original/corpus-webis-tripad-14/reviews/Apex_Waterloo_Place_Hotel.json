We had the same view which wasn't very exciting, but didn't expect it to be great as the location of the hotel is tucked away slightly off Princes St. The room was nice, however our bath obviously hadn't been cleaned - as it was all hairy - and the conditioner hadn't been replaced in either of our rooms. We phoned housekeeping to ask that they clean the bath (because I'm a bath person) and to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation, which they did. The housekeeping manager came to look in the bath and she apologised, offered us a free drink in the bar and said she would get someone round to clean it right away. We didn't want a drink in the bar as we were just going to wait in my sister's room until it was clean. So that was a bit of a hiccup but they sorted it out for us so it's fine. My sister's bathroom had been cleaned properly, they'd just not given her any conditioner (we got some when ours was cleaned properly).", "title": "Disappointing, such a shame too.", "user": "Travel-Diva-KD", "date": "March 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 58431793}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We used the spa facilities - pool, sauna and steam room.
