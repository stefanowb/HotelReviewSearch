The rather small but well-appointed rooms quickly get too hot in sunny Summer weather and sleeping with open windows is difficult because of the very noisy road traffic close to the hotel. I totally disagree with the comment that the breakfast is unsatisfactory. Quite to the contrary, it is one of the best features of the hotel. I also found the reception staff very helpful and the young waitresses are very keen to please the guests. Its location very close to the motorway makes it a good location for visiting the many places famous for the 1944 invasion of the Allied forces. I would definitely return but not in the heat of the Summer. For that reason, I would also avoid a room in the attic (\"mansarde\").", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 4, 2010", "id": 69674636}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2004", "text": "I stayed here for three nights over the Christmas holiday, as it was one of the few hotels open in this small Normandy town. It's not in the city center so to get to the hotel from the SNCF gare you will need to take a taxi (about 10 EUR). To get back into the city center to catch the connecting Bus Verts or trains to other parts of the Calvados region or to just even visit the centre ville, you can take a city bus (Lexobus, the local bus service provider) from a bus stop about three minutes walk from the hotel.", "title": "Large rooms, hearty breakfast -- but a little far from city center", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "LyonZ", "date": "January 6, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 2982851}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Normandy", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 13, "average": 34, "very good": 41, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 7}, "slim_ranking": 0.416666666667, "description": "3 star hotel entirely renovated, 69 rooms, in the outskirts of Lisieux near Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux basilica.
