I booked this hotel after reading that there was a complimentary shuttle to the casinos. There is not. This was a huge inconvenience as I was attending late night events in Atlantic City that ended well after the last bus. Taxis have a flat rate fee of $25 not the $5 advertised on the website. Despite these significant problems the hotel itself was clean and comfortable. I did not like having curtains that wouldn't close though. I liked that the rooms were separate from the lobby and front desk. I stayed just inside the exit/entrance. I could walk out my room and be in the lobby in under a minute. The staff from the front desk to housekeeping were outstanding. I particularly enjoyed the extensive continental breakfast. I enjoyed being able to get a hot cup of coffee or tea and a cookie or piece of fruit, day or night. The rate was very affordable.
