Booked flights and hotel from Globespan. Like most of the hotels they use Don Pedro was great value for what we paid. Booking in was hassle free; we were a bit worried about a sign saying we should check in after 14:00. No problem, we turned up at 11:00 and were in our room in minutes. Dont use a coach transfer to this resort if you can avoid it. Its only a few minutes in a taxi and it saves an hour or two going up and down making 15 drops. The taxi fare was only 16Euro each way. The hotel is comfortable and very clean, even by SOL standards which are usually very good any way. It is only 4 floors high, and is a plain building but some clever landscaping and mature gardens work wonders on the outside. Didnt use the pools, but they looked ok. Cant say how they would be at peak times. Food was usual hotel buffet, but was a bit better than most. Well the salad was fresh and everything wasnt full of fish, and for a veggie thats about as good as it gets in hotels. Outside Torrimolinos was busy, mainly with spanish tourists enjoying the beach and the dozens of seafood/tapas places that are all along the front. Sunday afternoon they were all packed. So its not your usual chips with everything place. If you feel like a walk head all the way along the front towards Benalmadena or go up the winding stairs, lined with shops, bars etc to the town centre( there is a lift for 50 cents, but no view) Overall it was a good weekend", "title": "**Fab Hotel**", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "holidayguruFalkirk", "date": "April 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7300269, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The facilities.", "disliked": "\u2014 Leaving it!"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here in August 2005 after recommendations from friends. The hotel is part of 3 hotels, (Don Pablo and Marco) this one being the 3* the others are 4. The hotel is at first sight very Spanish, low beams, cheap plants etc but the staff at the entrance were good and practically bilingual. We were at first given a room on the top floor which only has a handful of rooms and no lift or balcony, we went back to complain expecting a fuss but were given a different room immediately. The rooms are fairly basic but comfortable, we didnt spend a great deal of time there, the hotel had lovely public areas however. There was often a queue to get into the restaurant after an hour or so so its best to get down early. The food itself was great, there is a wide selection and something for everyone. there is also a lovely italian buffet at the back where u can get spag bol, pizza or pasta every night,i was told none of the other hotels have this facility. Now for the facilities, as it is a sister hotel i can only rave about them you were given the choice of 3 sets of pools, jacuzzi's and cafe's. I think if you stay in the Pablo or Marco you are able to eat in any hotel too. We loved the hotel's own pool as it catches the sun. We were usually found at a wee nook we found which doesnt allow children it was round from our pool but i think it was next to Pablo's. The nightlife is ok, not really made for young groups but nice for families and couples. this is also the first place iv visited with a proper town, if you go along the street (to the right through the beach side) and walk along you will find a lift and set of stairs, go up here walk along and then turn right you'll find a huge town with 100's of shops. Plenty of activities to do which we booked with hotel. You will love the facilities this hotel has to offer! We will definetely go back!

This description as 'superior' should not be mistaken for being anything special - it only offers what would be expected in any ordinary hotel. The room looked out onto the pool, across to the Sol Don Pablo and had a partial sea view. There was plenty of activity going on all around to stop you being bored when sitting on the balcony. The room and the hotel were kept spotlessly clean. Air conditioning in the room was very effective. The only down side of the room was the very small balcony, which was a bit of a squeeze. We were out and about for most of the time and did not take full advantage of the facilities on offer so cannot comment fully on what is available. This is why we are giving it a neutral score. All staff we encountered were professional, efficient and obliging. The hotel is well situated for all the amenities of Torremolinos. We would recommend taking the 'superior ' room option if available since we wonder what a less than superior room would offer?? We found two excellent places to eat - try the Cafe/Bistro Europa (Pasaje del Bajondillo) - good service and lovely food - the stuffed red pepper option and the sea bass option were superb - this is next door but one to Sheerins - a pleasant Irish Bar. On the Carihuela Beach side of town try the Cosy Nook restaurant (on the seafront, just at the start of the row of bars/cafes on the prom when you have walked round the headland from Bajondillo. ) The Cosy Nook has pleasant staff, good plain reasonably priced food and best of all - REAL CHIPS!!!!! Good bars to visit - Sheerins, El Bar de Ana and the Ship Inn (brilliant for people watching if you can get a table outside). These three bars are within a few hundred yards of each other.
