The hotel is an \"all suite\" facility, in which all the rooms have a living room with a wet bar, a sleeper sofa, and a desk. The bedroom has a laughably small balcony, and possibly the smallest bathroom I've encountered outside an airplane. My only true complaint is that you can't control the thermostat. They have one in the room, but the front desk informed me maintenance controls the ac/heat. That's a little maddening to me.

Paper towels, paper plates & silverware are provided. They offer a free shuttle to airport and local area places and there is a CVS and supermarket right across the street. There is a bar and restaurant in the lobby along with a Starbucks coffee bar. Unfortunately the coffee bar was never open during my 5 day stay. But there is another one a mile up the road along with a Target, Costco, Sears, Ross and several fast food restaurants. The room was a little musty and it took some time for the ac to cool it down. I did appreciate the sliding door to the balcony for fresh air. This property does sit on a busy street so prepare to hear traffic. The grounds are nicely maintained and overall the property is very clean. There is a small snack area by the front desk. Make sure you get the WIFI code at the desk upon check in.

The clerk that checked me in was distracted, didn't explain anything to me - just handed me the key and a map to find my own way. Her co-worker must have noticed how I was treated, gave me some bottled water and thanked me for being a Priority Club member.
