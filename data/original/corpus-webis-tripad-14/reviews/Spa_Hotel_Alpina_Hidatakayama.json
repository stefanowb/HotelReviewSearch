Rooms are fairly large by Japanese standards. Basic modern fitout throughout the hotel. Cleanest onsen we've come across in our travels. Onsen is on top floor overlooking the town. The front office reception staff are welcoming and professional with good English language ability. Spa Alpina seemed to appeal to foreigners. A bit highly priced so moderate value for what it is. Lacked character and seemed out of place in a small town. Spa Alpina would be awesome in a big city! I do recommend Spa Alpina but only for short stays...perhaps also try more traditional lodgings for a broader experience of Takayama.", "title": "Modern and super clean", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mahiwahoo", "date": "December 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 89787012}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Unless you have super-high expectations, you would love this place.

There are pleant of places to eat and lots of great little alleyways to explore. It would be nice to have free internet access in the foyer like in many hotels.Bikes are available to hire nearby. The free foot spas outside 2 hotels are great and the Folk Village well worth a visit. It snowed while I was there, which was lovely.
