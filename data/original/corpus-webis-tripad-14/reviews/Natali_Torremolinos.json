Bar staff favoured spanish customers, which is fair enough we are vistors in their country. However, in the middle of being served bar staff would walk away and start serving a spanish customers. The hotel is in a residental area, so the main part of the town is an hours walk away.

This hotel specialises in spanish oap holidays. So there we were on blackberry week surrounded by 800 spanish pensioners. Not an english person or a kid in sight which didnt go down with my 3 kids very well. The spanish pensioners have to be the rudest in europe and think nothing adout pushing you out of the lift to let yet more oaps in,and the dining hall was just a free for all (all of them anyway). The food was ok but the breakfast was terrible. We lived on bread rolls for a week. The pool was freezing and most of the time not open. All inclusive ends at 11pm sharp so dont dare ask for water at 5 past even if you are a very cute 8 year old as you will not so politely be refused. The only difference between full board and all inc. is the biscuit that you have to ask for at 5pm. This hotel is based in the town and is either a long walk down to the beach or down 200 steps. 800 meters my foot. Our taxi wasnt picking us up until 9 30 pm and a late check out was NOT available nor was a curtesy room so we had to sit in reception from 12 pm until 9 30 pm without a shower ect.
