The entire facade of the building is glass and the lobby is bright and cheery. We asked for a room on a high floor and were given a 9th floor, allowing us to fully enjoy the glass elevator which shoots you up in an amusement park ride kinda way. The rooms had that typical starwood mid-level hotel look, which I like. Not showy, but comfortable, with an excellent bed. There is a spa in the hotel, but it costs around 15 euros to enter. We did, in order to use the pool, but didn't think it was worth it, as the pool room is too hot and smells too much of chlorine. There is a patio bar, which seemed inviting, but we didn't have anything there. There is also a restaurant, which is horribly decorated in an embarassing 1980's bigger is better style, but the food and wine we had there were excellent, as was the service. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Location is not walking distance from the old part of town, but not too far, about 5-10 minutes by car, and is pleasantly residential, and situation behind a big soccer stadium.
