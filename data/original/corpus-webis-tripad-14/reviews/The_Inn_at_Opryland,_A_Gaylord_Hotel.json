The only reason that we chose to stay here instead of the Gaylord resort was because the Radisson is a pet friendly hotel and my mother and father in law never leave their dog anywhere! The hotel was nice - the rooms were clean and comfortable but nothing fancy. We had an interior room on the second floor with a king sized bed and although I didn't find our bed to be very comfortable, I spoke with some guests who had opted for the sleep number beds and they were absolutley raving about how comfortable their beds were! The hotel staff was fantastic - very polite, welcoming and accomodating during our stay and the lobby looked gorgeous all decorated for the holidays. Also, it was so nice to have the complimentary shuttles that ran to the resort as well as the Opry Mills mall, and the Grand Ole Opry House. My husband and I would have been happy to walk - as everything is pretty close and sidewalks are available, but the weather was pretty cold, windy, and rainy during our stay so it was quite nice to have a warm dry ride everywhere (without paying for parking!). The hotel is nice and reasonably priced - it's certainly not a luxurious property, but it was clean and well maintained and the right choice for us as we needed a place where we could bring a small dog. My in-laws were also quite pleased with their room as it had an outdoor entrance and was close to the small dog park on the property.
