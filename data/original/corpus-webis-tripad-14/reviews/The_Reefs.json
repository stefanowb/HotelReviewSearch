The food is wonderful, and we welcomed seeing many of the wait staff from previous years. Some in our group played golf, and the rest of us enjoyed just relaxing. We took the ferry boats and buses and traveled about during the day. Bermuda has changed a lot over the years with most of the wonderful stores gone, but still a few left, mostly at the Dockyard.

If you are looking for a new fancy hotel with a big lobby that nickel and dimes you and the staff wishes you were some where else....don't stay here!!!.. True the Reefs is not brand new and it shows in some areas, but this is by far a great resort hotel. The rooms have neen updated and the beds are very comfy. The views....second to none. The beach is fantastic. And activities on the beach are included. Snorkeling gear, kyaks, chairs and unbrellas all included. We were on MAP plan and ate all our meals at the hotel. Food is fantastic. Service is not at the speed we are used to stateside, but nobody is in hurry on Bermuda. And that is the whole point. This is a place to relax and slow down. Concierge will set up whatever you need. Diving, Horseback ridring. We rode the beach at Spicelands on horseback...awesome!. We just got home yesterday and can't wait to go back. My only word of advise to not book a room directly over the pool. Not much privacy. But, the rooms south of the pool are very private and all have great decks with awesome views.

This was the first trip we took without our daughter and we picked the perfect place. There was a nice mix of couples young and old and some families as well - a perfect blend of vacationers. The staff were all very professional and accomodating - from the front office, bellhop, beach, restaurant and housekeeping staffs. The grounds and rooms were very clean and the staff referred to you as a name, not a room number - a real nice bonus that I appreciated. The #7 bus stopped right in front of the hotel and we used it to get to the Dockyard and Hamilton-very convenient. The infinity pool was beautiful but a bit small to really swim in - more for cooling off and enjoying the view. We were able to snorkel right from the beach and used the hotels complimentary equipment. You can also use complimentary kyacks that the hotel provides but we never did. Because the hotel is built into a cliff you have remarkable views. However, there are a lot of steps to the the beach and Coconuts-defn. not the place for someone with bad knees or hips but perfect if you want to work off your dinner at Coconuts! We ate onsite all but one night and have very good meals. We ate at Pompano one night and felt that The Reefs was a bit superior. The only reason I didn't give my review an 'excellent' is because I thought the bathroom in the room was a bit outdated and at times the restaurant service was a bit slow. But certainly nothing that would force me to complain to management about. Furthermore, if anyone is worried about the construction noise there was none.
