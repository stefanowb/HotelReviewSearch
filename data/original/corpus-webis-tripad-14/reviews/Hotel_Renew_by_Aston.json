Within a certain price point, a room is a room, but the staff in a hotel can make all the difference and they really do at the Ocean Tower hotel. The staff bent over backwards to make sure we had a great stay. Our room was on the top floor and had a great view of Waikiki beach. The room was not great but it was about what I expected for what I paid but what I did not expect was the helpfullness of the staff. Leonor was all everyone on this site mentions and more. She even let us use one of the renovated rooms as a day room on our last day since our flight did not leave until 8 PM. The remoldeled rooms are really nice and the hotel will look much better once the renovations are complete and the renovations did not bother us at all while we were there.

She gave me a flower lei - which was my very first one. She put candies on our pillows with orchid petals. What special touches these things were. They really help to make your vacation memorable. The day we left we were supplied with towels for the beach and another new room to shower in before we left for the cruise. They also held our luggage for us. All of this for no charge. Upon leaving Leonor asked if we wanted bottled water or needed anything else. Her and Terry, the GM, went out to our rental car to see us off. Leonor gave us another box of candy to take on our cruise. I have to say, I have stayed many places, and in some really nice 5 star hotels (due to husbands work) and I loved the personal care that we received while staying at the Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We loved Hawaii, the Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel and our cruise.
