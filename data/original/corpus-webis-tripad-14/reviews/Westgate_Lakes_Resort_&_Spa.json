Apparantley, this is normal operation for them to have so many people check in. No one told you where to go, but I guess with the line of 37 people they expected you to figure that out yourself. I foolishly assumed these people had no reservations, NO, everyone had reservations and like me had already paid for at least one night, so we were all forced to stand in line or lose the 200 we had already paid. btw the line took 53 minutes to get through. There were all kinds of employees,& managers walking around but unfortunately only half of the check in desk had people checking in guests. This is a big resort, they have alot of amenities BUT they have entirely too many guests for the amenities. Inside the room was nice, spacious and it was quiet, we didnt hear much but outside was the hood. People EVERYWHERE, yelling from balconies. There was alot of staff but they didnt stop the commotion. For the size of the room, the price was good BUT apparantley everyone else found out how great it was and piled into rooms. There was a room in my building that literally left the front door open all day and night and people wandered in and out, yelling, etc. My son talked to one of the boys from that room, he said they had 19 PEOPLE staying in the room that split the cost of it They never asked me when I booked how many people would be in the room, and obviously didnt ask them either. I wouldnt go back bc this is not my type of crowd, I like more laid back low key. This was teenagers walking in the parking lots, hooking up in cars. Grown people yelling from balconies and there was no reason to complain bc they did it right in front of the staff.... smh, ive never seen anything like this at a \"resort\".
