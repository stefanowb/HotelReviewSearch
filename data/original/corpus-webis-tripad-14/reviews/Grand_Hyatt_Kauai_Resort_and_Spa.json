They have a very nicely laid out adult pool with hidden caves and a \"lazy river\" that seems to go on forever. At the end of the adult pool lazy river they have a jacuzzi and a surprisingly long and fast water slide. We spent a lot of time enjoying the water slide, then running up the stairs and heading right down again. Down the stairs from the adult pool area is a HUGE family pool area with another jacuzzi and a artificial beach area. We didn't spend much time on the lower level, but it looked like a blast.

As eveyone else states, the grouds are just beautiful. The check-in process was seamless. Our room was a partial oceanview. It overlooked the adult pool and off in the distance, the ocean. Im my opinion I wouldn't book an ocean front room because the hotel is set rather far back from the water. So I am glad we didn't pay all that money for an ocean front room. Our room was comfy and just what we expected. I would have liked it if there was a jacuzzi tub, but none the less it was perfect for us. The breakfast was good. They had a large variety so there was something there for everyone. Made to order omletts to cereal, fresh fruit, fresh juice, miso soup, pancakes, muffins, breads, etc. The beach is rather rough so we didn't attempt to swim there. There were surfers out there. We even saw a monk seal right on our beach! There were a few wedding ceremonies happening right on the beach too. The hotel didn't seem crowded. The man-made lagoon was cool to swim around in and expolore behind little islands and curves. You could rent canoes there if you wanted. The sand by the lagoon was more like little pebbles. I would have liked it if it was a little softer. You need to get bracelets and towels from a little booth. You need a bracelet to ride the slide. The bracets was free and the towels were free. A nice touch would have been to have people setting up your chairs with towels for you. The pool is really neat with little caves and twisting all along waterfalls and flowers, we really like it. We ate at Tidepools and tell the truth we wern't impressed. I got some sort of hawaiin fish. It was good, but I expected better for the price. Better off going to The Beach House. We also got some appetizers and drinks at Stevenson's lounge. It was nice to sit next to a giant fish tank before we retreated back to our room. We also ate breakfast at the restaurant by the golf course. The view was beautiful. That restaurant turns into a Chinese restaurant for dinner. We also ate there one night. It was good. We also made use the of the spa. We got a couples massage in a little hut with the breeze coming in. It was fantastic. Then we layed by the spa pool on comfy chairs with thick pillows. The spa has sauna, hot tub, showers, etc. They have a shower with like 12 spouts, the lady there called it a \"human carwash\"! They aslo have outdoor lava showers.

However, if your budget allows, I would recommend the Hyatt to anyone (and everyone) I know. The adults loved it, and if possible, the kids loved it more. Between the lagoon, the pools, the slide, and the hot tub, I thought they all might start growing gills. Mahalo to the entire Hyatt Staff. We had a GREAT time.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "OBHF", "date": "March 1, 2005", "id": 3238749}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "disgusting, horrible service", "text": "Here it goes........ We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and were greeted with leis upon entering. When our bellman escorted us to our room -- we walked for about 10-15 minutes to get there from the lobby -- there were bugs and geckos on the walls leading to our ocean-view-ground floor room. Upon entering our room we saw silverfish and mosquitoes on the walls, on the bed and even on the phone!! We called the front desk and we were told the manager would get back to us shortly. In the meantime, they sent over some housekeepers with bug spray to spray our rooms and kill the bugs. After a few hours of waiting we were getting hungry -- so we decided to order room service -- we ordered 2 salads and was told it would take 45 minutes to an hour for delivery ... fine.. We were starving and still waiting for a manager to get back to us so we didn't want to leave. After an hour and a half our salads came and the manager finally called us to tell us we would have to wait until the morning to get our room changed. The fact that we had to stay in that room for 1 entire night made me sick!! Also, by the time management got back to us the night was over -- we waited hours to speak to someone and ended up spending our first night in Kauai frustrated, upset and going back and forth with the front desk and a manager. We also noticed that other guests were stuffing the bottom of their doors with towels to keep the bugs and geckos from crawling in! They are supposed to be an above quality hotel, I nor any other guest should have to do this while staying there! The next morning, we spoke with 2 of the managers --Now a full night and the start of our first day relaying frustration to managers, we decided to forget what had happened and start fresh. The Hyatt made it impossible. EVERYDAY we stayed at this hotel it was miserable and a different occurrence happened. There were green bugs in my scrambled eggs at the buffet breakfast, the daiquiris tasted like sour pink lemonade, I had called the front desk to ask where the closest laundry facilities were to my room because I had 3 bags to carry. I was directed to a room in which there were no washing machines/dryers. There was a sign on the door that said it was being upgraded and to go to the other side of the hotel. This is frustrating since I called especially not to be inconvenienced, it also shows me that the staff is uninformed!! The next night we dined at Tidepools--my shrimp had to be sent back because, yet again, there were bugs in it. When we checked our car in valet it was put under the wrong name delaying us 25 minutes because my husband had to go with the man to pick out our car in the lot. During the next couple of days the managers did not even check in with us to see how everything was doing nor did they offer any compensation of any kind after the room incident--we did get to move our room to a higher floor in hopes of no bugs. The final straw was when we booked ATV tours and were supposed to get picked up at 7:45AM --we were out front waiting.....one of the valet men asked us if he could help us --I told him no thank you we were waiting for our tour to pick us up. At around 8:00 I went inside and asked the concierge if they would please call the tour company because they were late. The response I received was \"If you would have asked anyone they would have told you that you are at the wrong entrance.\" This response was uncalled for and rude!! When the tour operator came back to pick us up she told us she had called the concierge and valet to ask if anyone was waiting out front because apparently this happens a lot. No one bothered to check. We had to leave the hotel only to be irritated at the start of our tour and day--and LATE!! When we arrived back at the hotel we AGAIN had to spend time talking with the managers and informing them of what was going wrong with our stay. one of the managers asked us what he can do to make it all better. At this point we were leaving the next day and I told him that I only thought it was fair to comp us for our miserable stay to which we spent more time talking to their managers and being aggravated then enjoying the beautiful island of Kauai. he said he would talk to the manager above him and get back to us. We were again inconvenienced by having to make another appointment. The outcome was, the last day we were there, 1 hour before leaving, We were offered $150.00 in compensation for our horrible stay--this is a smack in the face and quite frankly an insult to my intelligence. When we expressed we thought this was unfair of course, the manager was unavailable. We paid in full with no compensation -- including $15.00 a day for valet. I have traveled all over the world--I have been to every island in the Caribbean, I have traveled extensively through Europe, North and South America --I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SUCH BAD SERVICE AS I DID AT THIS HOTEL... I have stayed in Holiday Inns that had better management and staff. We spent a lot of money to stay at this hotel and as far as I'm concerned I have stayed at hostels that were better l!! I told my husband that I didn't think the manager would do much for us because he never followed up with us and didn't do anything for us from the start. What he did tell us was that the hotel was renovated and they didn't raise prices, is this the reason the quality has gone down the tubes?? We also were informed that management changes as many times as you change your pants. Many members of the staff were not helpful and were frustrated themselves at where they worked. Even more so, many people from the different tours we took were ex-employers of the Hyatt and were not surprised at how we were treated. Needless to say, time is precious, vacation time is even more precious -- it was one of the biggest disappointments of my life!! My husband and I are now in the process of contacting the regional director--(who, incidentally is new) I have 3 friends that are getting married next year, and going to Kauai and Maui, they will not be staying at the Hyatt.", "helpfulness": 31, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 27, 2005", "id": 3233060}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2005", "text": "This was paradise.
