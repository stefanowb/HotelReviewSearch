I am so glad we did as it was absolutely wonderful. I live in Dubai so am used to a good standard of hotel and wasn't disappointed with this hotel. We stayed in a Presidentail Suite which was amazing. Very spacious and with the huge terraces and rooftop sundeck and jacuzzi it was very romantic and the perfect place to relax and soak up the sun for 4 days. The seaviews were spectacular, the bed was comfy, the room was clean and the staff at reception were very helpful and friendly. The inclusive buffet breakfast was great and there was certainly something for everyone. The general setting is very pretty and romantic and is only a 10 minute walk into Puerto Banus (take a taxi back though) along the beach, which was quite lively for mid October, so was glad that we were not staying in the centre.", "title": "A wonderful hotel right on the beach!", "user": "Lyndadubai", "date": "October 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 47086143}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Room service was very good.

You will have to carry your luggage yourself. Slow and somewhat uninterested persons at check-in. No introduction of the hotel services, facilities, breakfast etc. Find your room on your own. What really chocks me is finding out this hotel opened in spring 2005!! How can you let a hotel run down so fast? The interior design lacks any design what-so-ever and is worn down with boring colors following you in the hotel areas as well as in the rooms. Our room had brown-beige colors; sofa, wallpapers, kitchenette and carpeting. Looked very old and is quite worn down. The \u201cfully equipped\u201d kitchen (read: kitchenette!) had no casseroles or any cooking tools. When asking for a casserole reception sent us a kettle. Sigh! Even though the bedroom and living/dining room were good size, the bathroom was tiny! No separate shower, just a bathtub. And again, really worn down. However, what made up for all the flaws was the remarkable floor-ceiling window view in the bedroom and living room. Furthermore, the suite had a large terrace with a magnificent view. The terrace was surprisingly nice decorated with comfortable sofa/sitting group and outdoor dining table. The half way open wooden shutters blocked most of the sun during day, but not the view. The room had some technical gadgets such as electric controlled curtains and possibility connect your mp3 player in living room or bed room for the built in speakers in the ceilings as well as on the terrace. No DVD player in the room or hotel. Our friends stayed in junior suite which was smaller but had a better kitchen and bathroom. Their terrace was smaller and not as private but with nice sea view. We visited one of the deluxe junior suites with roof terrace. In short: horrible! I wouldn\u2019t sit in any of their worn down, dirty furnitures on the terrace and certainly NEVER set my foot in the Jacuzzi! It was filthy! The general service was slow and inefficient. A charge of 6 euro to get ice to the room (5 star hotel???). The buffet breakfast was excellent though. The restaurant was not. Instead of having the bar facing the ocean with a nice view, it was located by the hotel entrance with its terrace facing the taxi stop. The pool was of nice size with comfortable sun loungers. Pool bar close at 6. There is a beach bar but it was closed. However, the beach was good and nice swimming. No personal on the beach this time of the year so towels had to be collected at the pool area (the \u201ctowel card\u201d only allowed one towel per person ) and any drinks or food to be ordered in the hotel. Location was good with only 10-15 minutes walk to Puerto Banus. The air-condition in the small gym was not working and never repaired despite several reminders. Staff in general friendly but obviously lacking the service level and knowledge of a 5 star resort.", "title": "Lovely public areas, tired, shabby and small rooms.", "user": "LoopyLoo_7", "date": "December 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 51397227}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "In conclusion: For our terrace, the views, pool and beach \u2013 Yes a nice and possibly 4 star quality.

Whilst the public areas of this hotel are very nice, I feel the rooms are rather tatty and worn, certainly do not command a 5* rating and are in general need of a refurb. We stayed in a superior room, which was in our opinion very small, however it did have a lovely view of the pool and sea. On the downside every item of furniture in the room had at least one chip in it and two walls had watermark stains on the wallpaper. We had an inconnecting door in our room which did nothing to muffle the sound of our noisy neighbours. Food and drink at this hotel is also very expensive and heavily overpriced. We had requested a queen size bed and arrived to find wo twin beds. This was however rectified within an hour of requesting a queen bed. We also requested an iroing board and iron which was delivered within 15 minutes.
