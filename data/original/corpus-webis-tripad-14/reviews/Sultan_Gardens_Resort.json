But we would definitely recommend this hotel and Sharm El Sheikh as a resort. Make sure you go quad biking, para-sailing, snorkelling, camel riding and star gazing. These were all incredibly fun and interesting trips. Would also recommend going to Naama Bay for a night out as it has a really vibrant atmosphere.

It was our fifth time in Egypt as we come here every year in the second week of June to celebrate our own and my parents wedding anniversary. Last year we stayed in Hilton Sharks Bay and although our stay there was very pleasant, we were very disappointed with their house reef as the corals were mostly dead and there wasn\u2019t much fish in the sea :) So this year after reading a huge amount of reviews on tripadvisor.com we decided to book Sultan Gardens hotel. Prior to our tip I e-mailed Basel to arrange airport transfers and as we were coming to celebrate a special occasion I asked him for two rooms with nice views. He replied promptly and confirmed our airport transfer time and he assured me that two very nice rooms were reserved for us. It was so great to hear it and immediately it put us into holiday mood :) On Sunday the 8th of June we flew from Dublin to Sharm el Sheikh with Futura Airlines-the worst flight ever and even worse on the way back. We were delayed by two hours so we landed at 02:30 instead of 00:30. Twenty minutes later we were outside of the airport and the first thing we saw \u2013 was a board with our names :) A short ride on the air-conditioned bus and we were in the hotel. Receptionist was very efficient and he did smile (just some previous reviews mentioned that reception guys never smiled) and five minutes later we were on the way to our room no 657. Somewhere between Dublin and Sharm el Sheikh my husband managed to loose little keys from our suitcase and I was panicking that we won\u2019t be able to open it. We mentioned it when we were checking in and we were told that within 5 min somebody will be in our room to help us (and that was 3 o\u2019clock in the morning). From the moment we saw our room we understood what a great present Basel gave us- we were upgraded to junior suite with a beautiful sea view, my parents were upgraded as well and they were staying in no 659. Few minutes later we heard a knock on the door \u2013 it was one of the maintenance guys to help us to unlock the suitcase and it only took him a minute to do it. And after such a long day we were fast asleep with smiles on our faces as we were so happy to be back in Egypt. Next day we started with a fantastic breakfast, there was a great selection of food and yes, toaster machine was a bit slow, but we weren\u2019t exactly rushing anywhere :) All our big family really enjoys snorkelling and that\u2019s one of the main reasons we come to Sharm el Sheikh every year, so after breakfast it was time to check out Sultan Gardens house reef. We had no problems founding 6 sun beds and umbrella and that was around 10 o\u2019clock in the morning. The sand on the beach is not as fine as you will find in the Caribbean countries but it was much nicer comparing to other resorts in Sharm el Sheikh. To enter deep water you can use either plastic pontoon or two paths made out of blocks. Wow, what a variety of fish and corals we saw under the water. Most of the coral reef is still alive and boasting with the variety of colours and shapes. Let me just tell you that last year we went to Ras Muhammed for a day trip and we were supposed to see all the amazing corals and fish but the under water life is ten times better in Sultan Gardens. We had lunch in the main restaurant and afternoon we spent lazing around pools, again we didn\u2019t have any problems with sun beds. It does get a little bit hectic in the main restaurant at dinner time but only because second floor restaurant is being renovated at the moment. But even at that we never had any problems finding big table for us. All the staff work so hard and still find a minute to talk to customers and smile. We especially enjoyed the service of Abu Rahman as he always made us laugh and he was very kind to my little sister. As regards to the quality and variety of food we can honestly say that Sultan Gardens has the best of both. We travel a lot \u2013 Caribbean, America, Asia, Europe but food in Egypt could never compare to any of these countries, it never tasted as good and was mostly bland and tasteless. Normally in any hotel in Sharm el Sheikh we\u2019ve been before (we only do all inclusive) you would walk into the restaurant and you see a huge amount of food but you could easily walk out hungry after the meal as beef was tough, chicken was dry, vegetables \u2013 tasteless and etc. It is a completely different story in Sultan Gardens, although you might think that selection of food is not great (which is absolutely not the case), because of the layout of the restaurant, you are sure to find that every dish tastes fantastic, is hot and plentiful. Lamb stew, BBQ beef, chicken curry, fish, vegetables, fresh pasta are only some of the dishes we enjoyed. During lunch and dinner we always found two types of soup, diet corner with steamed veg, rice, chicken or fish and great selection of desserts and fresh fruit. Let me just tell you that watermelon at lunch time was to die for, so sweet and crunchy\uf04a As soon as a tray of food was getting empty it was replenished straight away. In some other hotels we witnessed (especially at dinner time) how people were killing each other for that last piece of chicken or meat on the tray and then the empty tray was sitting there for 10-15 min and then as soon as people saw a new tray coming they would jump and push other people just to get there first so that made dinners more like hunting championship\uf04aAt the time of our stay Sultan Gardens was completely full but even at that there was enough of food for everyone. My husband recognised Muhammed- one of the restaurant managers from Tropicana Grand Oasis (we stayed there 3 years ago) and he was very kind to send 2 fruit platters to our rooms. I know it\u2019s a small thing, but small things like that make your holiday so much more enjoyable. Few times we had lunch around the pool or on the beach and it was really good as well. We tried Italian restaurant for dinner as well, food there was very good and we didn\u2019t find service to be slow but on the opposite to be very efficient. During our stay we mostly drank beer, red wine and soft drinks, all of them of a good quality; soft drinks are poured out of the cans or plastic bottles, not out of a dispensing machine and are all branded \u2013 so it\u2019s a proper Pepsi, Schweppes tonic, 7up and etc., which is great. You get one 1.5l bottle of still water per room per day and during the day you can get water out of dispensing machine per glass in any bar or restaurant. One thing I really liked in Hilton Sharks Bay last year \u2013 around the pools, beach, all walking paths they had small coolers stocked up with 0.5l bottles of still water, so you could grab one as you were walking around or just lazing by the pool or beach. I would like to mention again that all staff work really hard, Mustaffa- he cleaned our room and done an amazing job every day, animation team \u2013 was fantastic, evening shows were great and during the day they provided great entertainment. Judging by the amount of kids on stage at kids disco I can only assume what a great job girls at kids club do. We went on a trip to Tiran Island by speed boat; we booked it through one of the guys on the beach. As there were six of us he didn\u2019t put anyone else with us on the same boat, so it was more like a private trip which was amazing. We didn\u2019t see turtles but really enjoyed a spin and snorkelling of the island. What we loved as well about this hotel- the international mix of people: there was an equal mix of Russians, English, Italians, French, Polish, Slovakians and etc.", "title": "Fantastic hotel, fantastic holiday!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "nadiasmyth", "date": "June 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17302467, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything!", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Overall we had such a fantastic time that we are still raving about it to all our friends.

The reception staff were so helpful and fixed us up with a room with a sea view as arranged . The hotel complex is vast and situated on a sharp incline down to the beach . Being partially disabled my first impression was how will I manage all these steps to the main restaurant ? but my mind was soon put at ease when I realised a small bus runs around the complex from 08.00 to 20.00 every day, if out of these hours all you needed was to phone 26 and it would be there in minutes . The room we had was excellent and cleaned with fresh linen every day. Plenty of english speaking tv channels if needed . The restaurant staff and food was 100% perfect. Everybody employed there are so polite and helpful,what more can any body want . Egypt being a country that expects tipping I thought it very wise to take 1$ bills with me ,they are worth about 60pence and are I think very reasonable as a little thankyou for whoever I wished earned it . In doing this I can assure you that I was treated like royalty and various staff gave me the name as the Presidente. I would say the staff from the bottom of the ladder to the top all deserve a very good thankyou and I will definately be returning. Thanks for a very relaxing and enjoyable holiday .Sorry I cannot comment on the entertainment as we didn't attend but I am sure they made a good job of it.By the way take a snorkel and water shoes it is a sight worth seeing . Nothing to do or go outside the hotel only flattened Sinai desert no where to have a stroll . Only set back for me was 50 steps down to the beach which has no toilets so if I went there I could not climb up again more than once a day because of my motability so I more went to the quiet pool for comfort . I had no nasty tummy bugs at all and onlydrank bottled water as advised.

The view from our room was great we had a sea view room,every morning we got to see the sunrise. Mohammed the guy who looked after us at pool 1 was great always willing to help. This was a heated pool which was 1 of 5 pools. the rooms were very comfortable and we had tea/coffee facilities in our room which was ideal if your a early riser. The main restaraunt was buffet and the had a theme nearly every night, pleanty of choice for all to choose from, again all the waiters were very hepful and they remembered you and what you had to drink. The beach was nice and the small jetty was ideal for looking at the beautiful tropical fish, you could hire snorkel equipment and just get in the water to see all the coral and fish. We went out on a speed boat to Tiran Island and went snorkeling there it was great and not too expensive. Because the hotel is set on different levels it would not be very good for people with walking diffuculties as there are steps down to the rooms and the beach, they do have a bus called the Taftaf which goes around the complex to pick up and drop off this runs all day until around 10 at night. There was plenty of space and seating areas to relax and chill out. Only 1 dissapointment was the Casa Mia Italian rest...not very impressed with it and would not recommend it, other an that it was a great place and it was only 5 minutes from the airport...would definitley return there again.
