Apart from taxi driver from Pisa airport getting terribly lost on arriving in Lucca, the hotel is situated in a superb location in side street, which leads to main streets of the centre. So quiet that ,although narrow roads run alongside (and I mean narrow!) once in our room we heard nothing. Very comfortable bed, and whils't I note the comments of a previous review about the room being dark, we were always shattered after busy days out \"exploring\" surrounding areas and enjoyed the peace and quiet of a good nights sleep. The hotel is only about 5 minutes from main bus station (which is quite small and just within city walls) and we took bus when we left to return to Pisa which at only 5 euros was a lot cheaper than taxi (the buses run approx every hour) Although a lot of restaurants were closed whilst we were there, we still had a great choice and didn't manage to get around to visiting all on our list. We were always happy to return to Lucca and the hotel and visited many places in our time there, including Siena ,Viarregio, Cinque Terra, all accessible by bus and train station for destinations further afield. Train station is approx 15 minutes walk from hotel along city walls. Mario, Franco and the rest of the staff at the Palazzo Alexander are extremely friendly and helpful and will do their utmost to help and assist you with anything they can to make sure your stay is as comfortable and stress free as possible. The bar Stella Polare situated on the corner of the Piazza Napoleone is a fantasic place to enjoy a wonderful glass of wine (many to choose from and served in beautiful glasses) or a beer coffee etc. There is also a wonderful restaurant located on the first floor, where we enjoyed a very pleasant lunch, all freshly cooked on the premises. We found this place to be our bolthole each day on our return to Lucca from our \"adventures\" before going back to the hotel to get changed. I cannot say enough in favour of these lovely people and Lucca as a wonderful place to stay....regardless of the weather!. we spent the last night in Pisa and to be perfectly honest wished we hadn't bothered..after checking out leaning tower and walk along river we found it quite tacky and boring. Nothing like what we had experienced and we felt we had cheated ourselves out of another great night in Lucca!
