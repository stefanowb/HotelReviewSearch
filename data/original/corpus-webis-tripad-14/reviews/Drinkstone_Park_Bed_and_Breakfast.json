It has taken me so long to write a review for Drinkstone Park because I cannot think of anything different to say from what other reviewers have said. Michael and Christine have a talent for what they do. Drinkstone is the only b&b I have suggested to the wife that we go back to just to stay there and for no other reason. It was the ideal place to finish our tour of East Anglia (it's the guy in the 'sporty' red Honda speaking, Michael). We have stayed in some excellent b&bs over the years but Drinkstone tops them all.

On arrival, Michael & Christine welcomed us back like old friends. We were more than happy with our bedrooms, the Red & Peach, and we all enjoyed Christine's afternoon teas, with her delicious homemade scones, served in the Guest lounge. The highlight of every morning was breakfast. Christine's menu was extensive, with a daily 'specials' board, a range of stewed & fresh fruits, homemade preserves and Michael's honey, eggs from their hens, and local bacon and sausages. Added to this, Michael served us with skill, and kept us entertained with his unique humour. It was good to see the gardens in a different season, too.

I did not know the area and relied on Trip Advisor reviews to help me to make a choice of where to stay. I was not disappointed! From my first phone call to my final departure(via the village fete), I was made to feel thoroughly welcomed and comfortable. I was not the easiest of guests, either. I arrived late in the evening and, having got myself lost in dark country lanes, had to be rescued by Michael, who set out in the rain to find me. Taxis to the venue of the wedding were expensive, so, again, Michael took me there and collected me!", "title": "Superlative", "user": "cooaklea", "date": "October 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 182320633}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Christine and Michael make a happily united team and their breakfasts are stunningly good.
