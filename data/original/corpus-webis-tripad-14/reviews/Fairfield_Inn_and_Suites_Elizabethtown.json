I upgraded to a suite because I knew we had a long day driving. What a great place. What we thought would be a sleepy little town was bustling with activity. Great check-in experience; everyone was very accommodating. We changed our room because we found out we would be located on the railroad side of the hotel. A good choice, the trains come through at all hours and we would not have been happy on the train side of the hotel. Great location off the highway, within walking distance to a few restaurants. The room was great, roomy and quiet. The breakfast was very good. Definitely a top shelf Fairfield. My only complaint was the towels. As with previous Fairfield Inns, their towels are really paper thin and in need of upgrading.

Exercise room had empty water tank in the am. We had a room facing the back of the hotel and did notice the train rumbling by a few times. No horn blows but would wake lighter sleepers. Our tv was newer \"thin\" kind. We asked to be near another party upon reservations and with check in (which was around 5pm) and we were put at the other end of the hall from them. Felt bad for the people between us hearing the kids run back and forth between the rooms in the evening.

Kept sliding open and you had to watch not to run into it. Furniture a little worn. Beds just ok. TV old box type. Towels a little on the thin side. No microwave or refrigerator. It was extremely hot outside during our stay so the AC was cranking the entire time which gave the hotel common areas and our room a kind of musty, damp smell.
