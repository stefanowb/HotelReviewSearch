First I'll say something good about the hotel - the food in the restaurant was incredible! It was a HUGE buffet, and much of the food was gourmet quality. If you are going to a hotel SOLEY for the food, you would have a hard time finding better. And don't get me wrong, the hotel was beautful. But other than that, we did NOT enjoy our experience here. The shower handle came off in the bathroom when my sister was trying to turn it on. The TV's were older, and it was difficult to turn them on - you had to make sure the silver button ON the face of the TV was pressed in before the remote would work. The Wi-Fi and computer center prices were EXORBITANT - 1 POUND FOR 10 MINUTES!!! And the price didn't go down very much if you bought more minutes. We called downstairs to see if they had a corkscrew, and they said it would cost us FIVE POUNDS to bring it up. So, my sister asked if we could come downstairs to use one, but the woman at the front desk would never give her a straight answer. The front desk woman was not exactly rude, but she was not friendly or helpful, and she definitely did not understand the meaning of hospitality. The only people in the hotel who understood the meaning of hospitality were the non-British employees (i.e. the Indians). The room rate was 309 pounds per night, which is roughly $510.00 US dollars per night. If the airline had not paid for this hotel because their delay caused us to miss our connection, I would have been PHYSICALLY ILL that I paid so much for such shoddy service and broken/poor accomodations.
