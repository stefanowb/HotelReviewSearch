Could not fault any aspect of it. All the staff are very friendly and willing to help. The choice of food is fantastic. If you did not want to go to the main restaurant every night then there was the option to book either the Mexican, Greek, Asian or Italian restaurants down near the beach. You have to book a table two nights before at the online booking system next to the main restaurant starting at 10.00pm but as we were Thomas Cook customers we were allowed to go straight to guest relations and book there without queuing which was excellent. There was also the other bars around the pool bar which did Sushi, Pita, Burger, Beeraria, Ouzerie and the Pastry corner, these were all open from 12.30 to 7.30 but the Pastry corner alwasy stayed open till midnight in case you wanted that crepe or ice cream after the entertainment.", "title": "What an amazing holiday", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Rebecca T", "date": "July 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166158657}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "The entertainment was excellent could not fault the animation team they were really friendly.", "title": "The loveliest holidays", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Stacyucrainian", "date": "July 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 166095599}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "The resort is on a bit of a hill which we did not find too difficult being a young family but if you did struggle there were golf type buggies which you could call to take you wherever you wanted to go.", "title": "Overall great family resort.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "RPunn", "date": "July 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 166061340}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "The grounds are stunning and are kept clean and tidy and there were always gardeners and maintenance people keeping it looking in top condition.", "title": "Very pleased with the animation team", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Undertaker1981", "date": "July 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 165935837}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Worried for no reason at all due bad reviews!", "text": "The rooms are well equipped and lovely and clean and you are provided with a mini bar which is stocked up every day which contains bottled water, beer, bottled fizzy drinks etc.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Harry12623", "date": "July 1, 2013", "id": 165867859}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Best holiday ever!!!", "title": "***Fantastic holiday in Mitsis Blue Domes***", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MarinaKall", "date": "July 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166618603}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have never been in nicer hotel than the Mitsis Blue Domes.", "title": "A very stylish hotel, worthy of its 5 stars.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Jake M", "date": "July 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 166510502}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The Hotel is located on hills, with a fantastic sea view!
