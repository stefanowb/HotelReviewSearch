I had e-mailed the hotel prior to arrival, and I had originally booked a junior suite (which by the way look very nice, some have a small living room and the others are on the sides of the hotel with huge balconys, definatly worth it and you are guaranteed a awsome view) but they gave us that room.

We did book the steak house a couple of times but always missed our reservation because we were so busy. I personally liked the self-serve ice cream..mmmm.. There is always food available 24 hours a day and there is a store in the hotel but I recommend going to the pharmacy right next door to the hotel (it is attached to the hotel but you just have to walk outside down the driveway 1 min.) and things are much cheaper there. The beach is soo nice! We went walking down the other hotels beaches one day and ours was by far the best. Very clean, no seaweed (if there is the staff cleans it every morning by 7 or 8) and big. The loungers are nice and comfortable and you can get one anytime during the day, only if you want specific ones I would recommend saving in the morning when you wake up, no need to get up extra early as long as it's before 10am. There is always staff cleaning everywhere, in the restaurants, bathrooms, lobby, outside etc. We did the bar crawl, Xel-ha and the jungle tour and I would recommend all 3. But there is always something going on at the hotel. There are shows every night at 9pm and the entertainment team goes to a diff. bar each night at 1030 with a bus that takes you there and you get in vip and vip seating. All in all I dont see what people can complain about?!? I would suggest when reading these reviews just to watch what people are actually complaining about becuase most of the time it is such small things I dont even see how it would ruin your trip. Relax, have fun! Oh we also went to the island right across from the hotel, so fun, beach there is soo nice! Its 15$ roundtrip on a ferry and you can walk there (you depart at captain hook).

Yes, the food was repetitive, but when we did manage to get a reservation at one of the other restaurants, they were great. Snacks and drinks were also available any time! The staff was quite friendly, and there were lots of organized activities every day. It was too bad that there was no nightclub on the premises, but a shuttle bus took interested folks to a club every night. The nightly shows at the hotel were also enjoyable.
