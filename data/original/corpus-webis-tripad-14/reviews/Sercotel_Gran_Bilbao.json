The acoustics are treadful and its is like having a meal in a very large works canteen. There are lots of people who clearly use this hotel and their noise rebounds from all corners of the large, high space. It is not helped either by the robust manner of the staff, particularly near the kitchen entrance areas, who seem to throw plates onto tables, shout at each other, and are just a little too eager to remove empty plates from cramped table layouts. They have not got the balance right between speedy service and that of giving the impression that it's a race to get your table cleared for the next lot of people to use. The whole eating experience is noisey and rushed. It really detracts from what is potentially a very good hotel. The reception area was little better and a quiet drink at the end of the day talking with friends was impossible.", "title": "Vacation", "user": "Ramon R", "date": "September 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139723219}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel is situated in very easy ( about 10 minutes ) walking distance from the old town.
