Silvana dealt very efficiently with our bookings. She is a very friendly, pleasant person who gave us good advice and was always more than willing to help us with whatever we needed.

The staff was friendly, and the breakfast was very pleasant in a nice room at the top of the hotel. A couple of minor issues: no matter what we did, we just couldn't seem to communicate that we needed more toilet paper. We finally had to tackle the maid to get some! Also, although the room was certainly clean, there were a couple of things that were overlooked - like an empty shampoo container that was left behind in the shower from the previous occupants. These minor problems certainly weren't big enough to distract from our stay, and maybe since it was off-season, things weren't up at full speed.

The staff were very friendly and helpful with our enquiries. It is in a great position on the main street of Sorrento. The rooms are clean and decorated modernly. There were a few downsides to this hotel though. The room is not very well soundproofed and is therefore quite noisy. Also the curtains let in a lot of light because, being on the main street, the streetlights remain on all night. The internet connection was very weak and was continuously dropping out which was quite annoying when you were trying to book flights etc. Also, they had the annoying situation of having to put a plug into the wall in order for the electricity to come on. Except that all the keys were on the same key ring as the plug, including the safe key, which meant that when you wanted to unlock the safe you had to take the key off the ring so the power didn\u2019t go out.

We originally booked 2 rooms for 3 girls for a month ago through the booking.com. After we travelled from Roma, we decided to change our booking to 1 triple room. As the time constraint, I have no time to modify my booking through the booking agent. I tried to contact Silivana directly, she was very nice to offer a triple room with the original early bird price. The hotel is most likely an IKEA style as all furnitures in the room are in white colour. We are assigned to a room with rooftop window (2 single beds and 1 extra bed) so that we have chance to see the moon and stars in a clear night. The breakfast is served at the 3rd floor (next to our room). Not much choices only bread, cake, yogurt, few kinds of fresh fruits but it seems enough to have a cappuccino as well. The hotel is at the centre of Corso Italia Road (shopping street). When you arrive Circumvesuviana Train in Sorrento, you have to walk down the street and turn left on the Corso Italia Road, then straight ahead into Piazza Tasso. In the main square in Piazza Tasso. You then will see a statue in the middle of the square, keep on going ahead towards the Cathedral. Just under the bell tower of the Cathedral, on the left hand side there is an arch, go through the arch then turn left again, under the second arch and 20 meters on the left you will find the entrance to Palazzo Tasso. Silivana was also recommended us a restaurant named \" Zi ' Ntonio\" which is a very traditional and delicious restaurant. She also advised us how to travel Positano and Amflfi by bus.
