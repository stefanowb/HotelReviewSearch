As for design, the owners (one of whom I happened to meet on my stay) were originally Latvian, but emigrated to Sweden. It is a family run place and feels like it (in a good way). There is a distinct stamp of Swedish modernist design on the place, complete with some furnishings from Ikea, hardwood floors in the room (a nice touch!), and interesting pale green, beige paint colors (finally a hotel room with some color variation/texture!).
