Our son is a freshman at Fitchburg State University about 15 minutes down the road from the hotel. We booked a room in June when he had his freshman orientation and decided to stay here again for his Freshman move in day. Rooms are impeccable, the staff is very pleasant and there is a full service restaurant and bar onsite. We arrived after 9pm and had a very good meal of cajun prime rib and baked stuffed chicken. there is a complimentary breakfast in the morning that was more than I've seen at some major hotel chains. The decor is beautiful and reminds me an old time mansion complete with the spiral staircase as you walk in the main doors. There is a pool and jacuzzi on site but we did not check it out on either occasion. The beds are very comfortable and rooms generously sized for a double room. We plan to spend the weekend at the end of September for Family Weekend at my son's college here once again. So glad we found this hotel because we know that we'll be taking advantage of the close proximity to the college for the next four years...Wish they had a frequent guest reward program!", "title": "Step Back in time..

So, I was very excited to return to the hotel for this past Easter weekend for a three- night stay. We have 3 kids so booked the king room with pullout sofa. The room size was average size. My biggest complaint was the sofa mattress was HORRIBLE! We went to the front desk to see what could be done. Even housekeeping agreed it was worn out. The front desk had to check with management before they could offer us cots without being charged. I realize sofa mattresses aren't the most comfortable, but when you pushed down on this one, there was absolutely no cushion. My daughter thought it was a box springs. Also, found it strange the cots didn't have mattress pads on them. So, the room size was o.k. with the pullout sofa but once we added two cots to the mix, it got tight quick. And, the bathroom was small as well. You had to open the door then go behind it to close it. Water pressure was good though and the room was clean. I'm not sure the refrigerator worked in our room. O.K. for drinks but didn't trust it with milk. Nice size TV that pulled out so we could turn it. TV channels were limited but several showtime stations. I was very bummed they didn't offer NESN. The pool and gym were excellent. Towels in the room soft and in good condition. Free breakfast is included on weekdays but you have to pay on weekends. The Colonial Grill was great. In fact, I found the staff in the restaurant much more pleasant than the front desk staff. Have to say, the front desk staff was not friendly at all. Parking wasn't a problem and close to Route 2. I'm torn if I'd stay there again. Loved the indoor pool but wouldn't attempt to use the pull out sofas again. Would definitely visit the restaurant though - food was good and staff was awesome. On a side note, they don't allow you to bring in alcohol. Not a big deal but found the policy a little strange. I rated the value of this hotel \"Average\" because I had the AAA rate. I would have rated it \"poor\" had I paid the full rate.

She made sure to ask the front desk clerk if we could check in EARLY at 10 am, and was assured it was absolutely no problem. She booked the hotel and paid for it right there.

She rudely snapped back \"well you can't check in early because there is someone staying in that room. Check out is not until 11 am and check in is not until 3 pm.\" The mother of the bride explained that this had been already arranged ahead of time and showed her the paperwork she had when she came to book the hotel. The woman at the desk said she did not know what to tell us because, again, there is someone currently in that suite. She also repeated the check in and check out times. She said that she doesn't know who said we could check in early, but that is not something they allow. She did not once apologize to us, instead, she made us feel like it was our problem and she wasn't going to do anything to help us. So the mother of the bride asked to speak to a manager.
