From the moment we arrived, we were made so welcome. The rooms were spotless and we had a beautiful balcony. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were very quiet at night. We had a choice of three pools: two outdoor and one indoor. I thought this was fantastic! There was even a pool bar on the top floor with fantastic service. The spa offered really cheap treatments. We also had lots of choice in where we ate dinner at night. Even when we were checking out, the reception staff were so nice.

Not noisy at all, even though a street down to the ocean. People across the road had a dinner party one night and so it was nice to know I was amongst the normal population as well. I was about 4 minutes walk to the promenade and the ocean...with all the restaurants and buses easily accessible. My room was spacious and the linen fresh and clean, and every day my room was cleaned and very clean at that. The bathroom was always fresh and was a good size too. I loved the oldness of the hotel, and although older was well maintained. I was well-treated by all, and rate this hotel highly, and I am quite a particular person, especially when it comes to cleanliness and good manners.

The location it self was also good in close walking distace to restaurant areas, shopping and rocky beach areas. I think we had one of the \"old\" rooms (after what I understood steaking to other guests). The room was on the 2nd floor and it was really big, but had kind of the \"old\" smell, which I guess is partly caused by the humidity..! We got used to it anyway. There was also a balcony with a good size that we didn't use for the intended purpuse, but more for drying clothes/bathing suits. The great thing about this hotel is it's connection with the neighbour hotel! Which in fact means you can use one great pool area!! This is a lovely place to sunbade and maybe have a lunch. A fitness center is also available, and is weel equipped for a one week vacation workout. We had the breakfast buffet every morning, it had a great variety in choices and nice eating area.
