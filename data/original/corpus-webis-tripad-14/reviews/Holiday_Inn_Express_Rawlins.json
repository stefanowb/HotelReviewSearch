I always ask before making a reservation. I was informed that Holiday Inns do not allow pets (and have stayed at many that do adhere to this policy). Before I made this reservation I asked this question about pets and was informed, by the reservation clerk, that pets are not allowed. So I made the reservation. Unfortunately, I learned too late that this was not true. Upon arrival, I saw people with 2 pets entering the hotel. When I asked the hotel's front desk staff about the dogs, they said because they are privately owned, pets are allowed. Unfortunately another hotel that does not allow pets did not have any vacancies; therefore, we were disappointed & \"stuck.\" So, I took a couple of Benadryl and hoped for the best. Despite my disappointment, I must give credit where credit is due.
