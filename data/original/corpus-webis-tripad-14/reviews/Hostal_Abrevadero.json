It is a monastic room, at best, with a camp-like bed. The shower leaked so badly, we had to toss our towels on the bathroom floor to soak up the water, lest we fall. The bathroom door did not close. One had to take a chair in to prop against the door for privacy. We had to ask for soap, but towels were provided. Mold was growing on the walls of the room. There is no phone, and the desk people were not particularly friendly. It is not 5 minutes from the La Rambla as they claim, (perhaps 15) and the neighborhood is a little seedy.
