A trendy place, good value for money. The rooms are a bit small but comfortable and they have even a nice beach bag for the beach towels. Staff friendly and helpful. There is a computor with free internet to borrow in the reception/bar area. Cool red bean bags to chill in by the pool. I never saw anyone use it, but for children it might be good and it looks nice! Thursday evening is the Walking Street in the village. Go there! We walked along the beach 5 min to the right to Moonhut Bungalows for lunch as we had fiends staying there. Their food was always delicious. We had dinner once at The Hammock which was also good. The breakfast was a bit poor.", "user": "Annakins63", "date": "March 3, 2013", "id": 153613137}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect, loved out stay here", "text": "After spending 4 days in patong Phuket the hammock was a nice change, all the staff here are super friendly and this made our stay amazing..

Away from the hype of Chaweng this is a real Haven in Samui. Modern minimalist decor, beautiful location, excellent breakfast, staff who just can't do enough to make your stay more comfortable yet are not in any way invasive. I intended to arrive here on Friday night but unfortunately missed my ferry as such arriving at 7am the following morning. My room was ready straight away on arrival. I pre booked and prepaid my accommodation and it was entirely my own fault however the staff kindly offered a late check out free of charge until 6pm Sunday when I depart for Phanang.", "user": "Jennie B", "date": "February 2, 2013", "id": 151271219}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Cute little one", "text": "I was there with my boyfriends for 2 nights for a short vacation in Samui. We've never been to Samui before so had no clues where was the hotel and found the staffs were very helpful giving direction. Finally we got to the hotel by our car and found out there was no space to park my car. Anyway, the room we're in was lovely - it was a P-02. The shower curtain is a pain coz it would wrapped you up when you were showering. Rain shower was best! I love it. :) The swimming pool is too small and it is too close to the reception and the restaurant so we were too shy to swim there. The beach chairs were nice, the beachfront is lovely. The food and a quality of breakfast buffet is fair. Not fault for booking this hotel.", "user": "Nirada P", "date": "June 19, 2013", "id": 164547571}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Finally!

Grounds are adorable, leafy path to bungalows, well-kept, tidy, thick but plentiful pillows. The best: soooo quiet! They have strict noise rules so utterly silent by 9pm. Bliss! Reception \"closes\" at 11 but always someone around to give you your key. Book exchange, free wifi (only in one side of room so learned to plug in there to backup). Good restaurant, good mix of nationalities in guests, everyone polite, respectful, kids well-behaved even! Pool is very tiny so didn't use it but don't need to, as in other places, because beach is literally right there & super calm, clean water. I would absolutely love to stay there again.", "user": "leonatphiket", "date": "April 13, 2013", "id": 157596275}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lovely Little Place, tucked away in Maenam Beach", "text": "Beach: golden sand, not white & fine like Chaweng, but Chaweng is if you want busy, nightlife, noise & tons of people. Water at Mae Nam is perfect, calm, warm, no noisy jetskis/speedboats/booze cruises. Gorgeous bay. Super shallow. Lots of beach chairs/umbrellas provided by hotel. Only weird thing is several stray dogs (at least 4) made it their territory, at times growling, lying under the chairs, & saw 1 defecate right on beach twice, so I guess there is no animal control (lots of dogs & cats on island). Not hotel's fault as they have a sign not to feed them, but I don't really want to swim around dogs.", "user": "AishwaryaB", "date": "April 2, 2013", "id": 156358454}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice quiet hideaway", "text": "Location: A few steps from main road with restaurants, ATM & 7-11, & a block away from Thurs nite market which has great food & stalls set up, but far enough that no music heard, gorgeous sunsets, perfect! My suggestion for island is a bus service, because you have to sometimes wait for 20 min for taxi & costs about $16 to Chaweng, $8-16 for Big Buddha. Ko Samui is huge, would be more to Lamai, for example.

The beachfront room does have a very nice view of the water and two private mats that you can relax on, or chairs that are less than 5 feet away. Walking along the beach there is a great vender that sells fruit and grilled corn. The breakfast is nothing to rave about, but it was free and was a good snack before we began our day.
