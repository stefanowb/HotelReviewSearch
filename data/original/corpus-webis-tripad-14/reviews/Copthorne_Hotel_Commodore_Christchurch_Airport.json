Get from the airport via free hotel shuttle and phone near the airport doors and 10 mins later your there. Friendly family run hotel. Good enough standard rooms but we didnt get the business rooms which others wow about. A good restuarant with good reasonably priced food. The hotel will give you a free pass into town via the bus stop outside (20 mins). Hotel pool was useful with good hot spa bath but sauna never got up to temperature. HIghly recommend a drive of the ridge top road past the gondola if you have a hire car. Better than the gondola and superb scarey views. The original settlements on the other side have super beaches and worth the visit as Christchurch was lovely but a bit sleepy when we were there.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "watchitLondon", "date": "September 8, 2007", "id": 8677125}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "From the minute we were collected by the hotel shuttle the friendly hotel service started and didn't finish until were were dropped off at the airport the next day.", "title": "Friendly Staff, Great Food & Comfortable Rooms", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Jetboy787", "date": "August 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8483369, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly Staff"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled solo", "text": "Arriving at 9.30pm after a long flight the driver asked if we required a meal and called ahead to make sure the kitchen did not close until we had arrived.

What a room! The bed was the most comfortable I had slept in for years, the sheets crisp and white, the TV was huge and there was a comfortable sofa, and a desk. But, it was the bathroom that amazed me, with a huge bath, a walk in shower and a big window between the bathroom and the bedroom so that you could lie in the bath and watch TV, with the sound piped in to the bathroom.
