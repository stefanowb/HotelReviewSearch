Unfortunately, the rooms with suites were all reserved and we could not upgrade. The rooms with suites are recently renovated and have more room and storage space. Ski storage is now in-house which is a big improvement from before where they rented storage space from the Carleton Lodge.

Even though the room looked out on to one of the main streets in the village and the Telus festival was on it was pretty quiet in there. We met the lady who was cleaning our room in the morning.

The complimentary ski and boot storage was a treat, often they greated me outside kindly taking my skis and storing them properly until i beckoned for them early the next morning, not to sound gaudy but the awesome service at a great price had me feeling like royalty. The location is so good that you can hop off the mountain head in shower and change and be drinking at the bar before others have found a place to rest their skis. Getting the apres drink quickly was more than pleasing. Not to mention the bars located inside the building. One of the bars within serves a more laid back style, with an entertaining kareoke night, and good spot for us 20 somethings, the second is in Rics which is more up-scale but great service and good tv viewing makes it for a good place to grab awesome food and watch a hockey game (they were also happy to put on the game sound upon request). Not to mention on a busy night there can be a bounty of attractive women. Its hard to complain about a, place this convient especially when its to skiing/boarding and drinking.
