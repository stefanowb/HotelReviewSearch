The hotel is in a perfect location, near to everything you could wish for, a vivid ambiance of the Lakeland of memory - Swallows and Amazons and Hill Top, a welcome calm from the tourist excesses of much of the area and stunning views of the lake. Add to this the fact that it is now better run than on past visits and you have the location for a perfect break. The staff are outstandingly responsive and friendly, the d\u00e9cor is now much smarter than in the past.
