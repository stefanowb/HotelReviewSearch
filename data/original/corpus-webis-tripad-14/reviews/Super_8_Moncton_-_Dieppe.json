There was little question on where we were going to stay since the primary amenity for this hotel is their indoor swimming pool and waterslide. Leading up to our weekend away, my son anxiously waited for our arrival at the hotel so that he could go down the waterslide. Let us put that story aside for a moment to review the hotel. Check was quick and serviced by a polite and informative front desk staff. The lobby area is nice though not very spacious. I am not sure if this is a great place to cozy up and catch up on your work but there is a small fireplace in the lobby. Located off the lobby is the breakfast area. In addition, I noticed the breakfast area was serving cold refreshments in the evening (juice). Our room was very clean and fresh. Typical of most economy hotels, the d\u00e9cor was simple and plain though not worn. There was a small fridge and microwave unit in the room, directly under the late model television. We were assigned one the handicap/accessibility units which offered a single double bed and accessible shower unit. The bathroom was clean and bright. With respect to some hotel features: there are three small-medium size conference rooms on the main level. There is small yet accommodating exercise room near the pool entrance. Only a few units on each level offer a Jacuzzi in the unit. There is an even mixture of units with a king size, two queen beds or handicap/accessibility units. The hotel is 100% non-smoking and pets are allowed. If you are not interested in the breakfast offered at the hotel, there is a great breakfast venue, across the hotel parking lot, called Cora\u2019s. Now back to the pool... shortly after check-in we headed for the pool only to learn that the pool was \u201ctemporally closed for maintenance\u201d though there was no sign on the door, we were simply denied access when we attempted to open the pool door with our room key. After questioning the front desk on when the pool would be ready, we were informed that it would be open at 2:00pm. We decided to leave for 45 minutes to find lunch and return later. Upon returning, the sign on the pool door now stated that the pool would be open at \u201c3:00pm\u201d. We waited in our room for 45 minutes. At some time after 3:00pm, we were dressed for swimming and heading down the hall only to find the pool still closed. The front desk informed us that it would be another 30 minutes as they were completing test on the water. We went back to our room. Shortly before 4:00pm, we went down the hall to the pool area. The pool was still closed. The front desk said it would be closed for a while longer. They could not say when or if it would open. Once again, we headed back to our room. With a crying child, I was, to say the least \u201cok\u201d with the situation. I was strongly debating on leaving the hotel since the pool was the principal reason for us reserving this hotel. However, I cannot say that the front desk was not understanding of our situation because they were. They did apologize many times. They offered to give us a discount on our rate and even called a local hotel to gain us permission to us their pool. Without their efforts and empathy, this stay could have easily been a disastrous weekend. Facing the hard reality of the situation, we elected to take our son to Crystal Palace, a nearby indoor theme park. Before we checked out on Sunday, we managed to get into the pool and at check out, our room rate was discounted without any question or prompting. It is because of the efforts of the staff that I would recommend staying at the Super 8 Dieppe (not to mention a good rate for the area and hotel amenities).", "title": "Pool/Waterslide Temporally Closed However\u2026", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "StandingRoom", "date": "July 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 72309921}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed with them Feb 28th.

Because of job obligations all we could commonly come up with was one short weekend. We decided we would go only as far as Moncton because of the time restraints and chose that hotel because of the waterslide. I called the hotel directly and reserved the rooms. I explained that we were one family but needed 2 rooms. I asked about adjoining rooms. The girl was very helpful and said they had one set of adjoining rooms and she would be sure that we were not moved out of those rooms. Based on that I made the reservations. When we arrived we were told we couldn't have those rooms and it was not the hotel's policy to assign certain rooms. I told them as a customer I am unaware of what the hotel's policies are, I just know that I was promised those rooms and that was why I booked there. We asked if those rooms were allotted to someone else and were told no. Then when asked why we couldn't have them then, we were told we could have one but the other wasn't cleaned yet. We told him that would not be a problem, we will all go up to the one room and wait for it to be cleaned. He went in and checked with the manager and came back in agreement. He processed our credit card for 2 nights for two rooms gave us one \"key\" and we went off to wait. We waited about an hour and half and then we decided we would go out. The desk was swamped with folks waiting to check in and we waited to inform him we were going out for a bit. He said the room would be ready when we returned. We were gone about an hour and quarter and when we came back I stopped at the desk to get the other room \"key\". A different desk clerk was on and I told her what I wanted. She said she couldn't give it to me the room was already rented. (Yes, of course it was rented - to us) - Nope she had rented it out to someone else! Eventually, we were finally able to get another room across the hall from us and that is another huge story by itself with lots of waiting for the same reason and again they wouldn't assign the room to us until it was actually cleaned. We originally booked in around 1:30 and did not have a 2nd room until 6:45. Then we had to work out of the same suitcases carry toothpaste and clothes back and forth across the hall. We had asked to speak to the manager 4 times and never did we ever hear from him. We finally did get the adjoining room for the 2nd night but only by watching over it like a mother hen and going to the front desk as soon as housekeeping closed the door from cleaning it. The gal when I booked on the phone was very nice but in person the staff couldn't have cared less and obviously neither could the manager as we were there when they called him. There was no concern to the inconveniences we were put through or the way our last family weekend was ruined, no adjustments to the bill or any perks thrown our way. We dealt with the same 2 desk clerks while we were there and they were aware of what they had both contributed to. We couldn't afford the time to hang around the hotel waiting for a room, we had such a short amount of time to be away. Had they been concerned or apologetic I would have written it off as a mistake and forgotten about it. This trip was taken a few months ago at the end of April and it still makes me angry to think of the wasted time and their \"don't give a rip attitude\". There are no warm fuzzies with this place.
