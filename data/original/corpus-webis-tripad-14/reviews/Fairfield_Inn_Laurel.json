My mother advised me to come ASAP b/c the doctors d/n know if she'd make it through the night. She made me reservations at Fairfield Inn in Laurel told me all I needed to do is say I was her daughter and to pick up my keys. Unfortunately I d/n make it to the hospital in time and she died before I got there :( The only thing now I could do was assist my mother w/funeral arrangements and the writing of the obituary. This was a very sad time but at least I didn't have to worry about accommodations which was one less thing off my mind. Traveling with your spouse and 4 children can be very trying at times, but like I said, at least everything was taken care of as far as my accommodations. When I got to the hotel, everything was ready! One thing I enjoyed most was the complimentary breakfast and the laundry. Unfortunately, to take advantage of the breakfast you would have to be up bright and early;first come, first serve and the best items went fast - donuts, muffins, fruits, bagels. Now they did provide things like yogurt, hard boiled eggs, hot water to make coffee, hot chocolate, tea, or even oatmeal. My visit was short, not sweet, but at least I was there to provide support for my mother at her time of need and was able to say my final goodbye to my grandmother at her funeral.

The hotel is like any other Fairfield Inn. The rooms are nice, clean and spacious- not luxury, but pleasant. The difference is the customer service. Betty at the front desk is the BEST! So is Jamar! Both were so accommodating and friendly- asking how our day was when we came in at night. Betty talked to us about the area and was interested in my daughter's swim meet results. Just really above and beyond what you normally get from a front desk clerk. Great customer service. Also, while the breakfast was pretty basic--- continental w/ waffles- the customer service was again exceptional. Breakfast was to open after the swimmers staying at the hotel had to be at the pool, so the set up crew had everything ready early each morning to accommodate.
