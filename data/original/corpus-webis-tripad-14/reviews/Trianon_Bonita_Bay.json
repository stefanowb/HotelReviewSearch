Although we had read many good reviews of the hotel, it definitely exceeded all expectations. The room was tastefully furnished in traditional style and was bright and welcoming. Beds were very comfortable and we had plenty of space to unpack and settle in for 5 nights. The bathroom was large too, with walk in shower and bathtub and everywhere was spotlessly clean. Everything about the Trianon makes you feell that its management really cares. The staff were friendly and helpful and we liked the intimate atmosphere of the bar area and the tropical terrace overlooking the lake, where yoiu can see alligators swimming. The recently opened lakeside pavilion restaurant is a good place for a casual meal. Location is great too as there is a small exclusive shopping mall with nice bars and restaurants next door and plenty of good fish restaurants nearby on the main road. The main thing this hotel has got going for it (apart from good facilities and comfort) is charm - something you cannot typically find in an American chain hotel. It is priced similarly to some of the more ordinary ones, yet it was of a far superior quality. We went out for a great Christmas dinner at the nearby Ritz Carlton but I would choose the Trianon over its more glitzy neighbours every time.", "title": "Excellent value and quality that exceeded all expectations!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MicheleLondon", "date": "July 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8112803, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Comfortable, friendly, good atmosphere, good service.", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "I had seen previous good reviews for this hotel but because of its cheapness in the Virgin brochure, I was still unsure.

Its location was ideal being only a matter of yards from a good quality shopping centre with a variety of restaurants. The beach could be reached within 10 minutes.

I think it was the water but it was hard to take when you step into the shower! The rooms are tired, worn and very dark! Only lighting is from a few lamps. They have a continental breakfast that is included. (Cereal, bread, bananas and coffee.) We got the room for $100/night so I guess you can't expect too much. There is a neat shopping area across from the hotel that has some upscale stores and good restaurants. Across Tamiami Rd. there is a grocery store called Fresh Market that is similar to Whole Foods or Central Market that has nice wines, gourmet cheeses, coffees, sandwiches, fruit etc. Very convenient since there is a good sized compact refrigerator in the room.
