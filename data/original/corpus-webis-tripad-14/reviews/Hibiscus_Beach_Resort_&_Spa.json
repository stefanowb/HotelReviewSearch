When the Taxi turned up a member of the hotels staff ask me to tell him to wait while we checked out, while i was round the front the porter made a strong sexual advance on my girlfriend, luckily i walked round the corner in time, he told her to be quiet but she told me instantly. i confronted him and we left the hotel immediatley even though he refused to take our hotel keys. Hopefully he hasn't done this before and wont again. We didnt have anytime to tell anyone there hence the review. The experience left us very upset.
