There is a mixture of good and bad reviews but those about safes being broken into and belongings being stolen are not something we were looking forward to. Anyway after a long flight we finally arrived and wow are the only words, this place is amazing. Long check in... Not for us 15 minutes and each family got the full low down on the resort including maps, towel cards and restaurant information.", "title": "No need to worry", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "diamond1London", "date": "August 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 170671243}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The rooms we booked junior suites are a great size and cleaned thoroughly everyday with the mini bar stocked daily. Buffet restaurants always had something on offer even for the most pickiest of eaters. In day 2 we booked in for the al a carte restaurants no problem at all and day 3 we booked again for the Italian which we found the best. Oriental was a bit confusing not sure if it was Chinese, Thai or Japanese or a mixture of all 3, food was edible though. The grill started off great but BBQ ribs uh oh not good. Ribs to me are grilled BBQ with sticky sauce not a boiled lump of meat but the starter and deserts were amazing! All the pools were well kept and clean we preferred the pool closest to the beach but often stopped by the party pool for a giggle during the day the drunken dancing in the jacuzzi is so funny bit like an American music video, winding down, women in tiny bikinis so funny but hey if that's not your thing you just find another pool there are plenty to choose from. The beach was lovely had no hassle from the vendors, a polite no is all that's needed. We hired jet ski's which were great fun. The sea although not crystal clear is very warm and you and go out some distance just take care on the few rocks. The resort is very large but we did not find this a problem or a 20 walk end to end as some have stated. We were staying by the hammocks and kids club and managed to walk to both lobby's within 10 minutes. The train runs very regular for those who would prefer not to walk but the resort is so beautiful it seems a shame not to walk around. 24 hour sports bar is great if u gave hungry teenagers, burgers, hotdogs, nachos and fried chicken not healthy but who doesn't like a treat now and again. I could honestly go on and on about the Riviera princess but all I will say is if u want sun, relaxation, happy friendly staff, clean and tidy surroundings and yes value for money the just book it!", "title": "Lovely vacation", "user": "Ellie W", "date": "August 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 170624738}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Went to this hotel to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.

Our summer vacation is normally 2 weeks in duration and a winter getaway 1 week, though we could very easily spend longer at the Princess!
