They had admitted me to their frequent guest club and everything seemed to be going along well, until it wasn't. I was at this hotel specifically because I ran a company branch in Cebu, so this hotel needed to \"work\" for me from a business perspective. First problems started occurring when the in room web service failed me miserably. I had a client call scheduled and desperately needed to \"connect\". Several repeated calls to the front desk resulted in me waiting and waiting until they could locate someone who could help. I wish I could describe the dialogue in this calls, but it would require me to use profane language which is inappropriate here. Let's talk about their \"loyalty\" program. On the surface it offered some really special perks, evening cocktails, daily breakfasts and an opportunity to bring a \"guest\", mind you this was predicated on my paying a higher room fee, but it seemed to make sense to me. As a any logical person might do, I used the free breakfast offer and brought a guest, daily, until the woman who monitored the \"loyalty lounge\" breakfast facility provided me with a check for the breakfast charges of my guest. I protested, telling her I had a letter in my room that outlined my right to bring a guest. Essentially, she called me a \"liar\" without saying the words. I paid the bill, so as to avoid being pegged a theif and went to my room to retrieve the letter. When I brought it right back to her, she admitted she knew some letters said this, but after the fact they decided this was too expensive and retracted the program. I want to be clear, I was offered a program upon check in, and it was rescinded mid-stay, but mostly, I dearly appreciated being made to feel like a liar in a business setting. I spoke to the hotel manager who was too busy to be bothered with how upset I was and sent a \"stand in\" to discuss all of these issues. I am not sure what happened to the old adage that the customer is always right, but this pompous, arongang woman sat in front of me and tried to make me feel like I was someone out of line and wrong for my complaints. Needless to say, I told her the conversation was over. Never once did I stay at this hotel again. It is old and it smells. The restaurant is no where near as clean as some of the other comparable hotels in Cebu and overall, as a business traveller with service needs, I would much rather poke my eye out with a pair of scissors than ever return to this hotel.
