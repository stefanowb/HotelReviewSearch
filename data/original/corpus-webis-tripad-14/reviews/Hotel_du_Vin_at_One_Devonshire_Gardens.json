High quality little extras abound, from high magnification mirrors by the washbasin to an excellent sound system for your music. Each room is interesting and different.

I am very fussy and like to choose my dining table and even have a choice of bedrooms. we all have our own specific wants, preferences and needs and in my experience once these are expressed they will be met.
