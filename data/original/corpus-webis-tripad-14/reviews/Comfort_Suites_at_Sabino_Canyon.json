The courtyards were beautifully maintained and cool in the hot weather, with the flowing fountains and foliage. Did not use the pool, but it looked clean. The breakfast /brunch buffet in the lobby was excellent.

If you are going to Tucson to enjoy the outdoors this is within a short driving distance to some nice walking trails. The room was very secure. It had an extra deadbolt and chain. There was a nice continental breakfast with some extra hot items such as bacon and eggs. The staff was very friendly and the lady maintaining the breakfast area a cheerful attitude which adds to starting out the day with a good outlook. I stayed in a room that had a little refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave. The property seemed well maintained and the room I stayed in was very clean. The only concerns I had were minor. The beds were a little soft and the hotel is adjacent to a strip mall so that might be a drawback for some people. If you are traveling to Tucson and you will be having an active vacation in which you are looking for sights and outdoor experiences verses a spa vacation I would recommend this hotel.
