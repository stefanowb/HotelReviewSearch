I called down to the front desk who sent someone up to inspect the room and they determined that the room was not cleaned. The staff then assigned us another room, their last one they claimed, in which we once again started to unpack and get settled in. During my visit to the bathroom to unpack my cosmetics, I once again noticed hair in the bathroom. This time there was more hair on the floor and the countertop. I also noticed the bathtub had mold growing around the tub! I decided to accept the room since it was the \"last\" one and decided to spray everything down with Lysol (thank goodness for Lysol). But after pulling the comforter back, i noticed several (not one or two) but several human hairs from the lower region (or could have been chest hairs). At that time I called down to the front desk who informed me that they should have checked the room but they couldn't assist me anymore than that. I ended up checking out and going to another hotel down the street. I am still trying to get my money refunded from this hotel since their rooms were dirty. I can only assume they only changed the bed sheets and removed the trash from the room and nothing else.
