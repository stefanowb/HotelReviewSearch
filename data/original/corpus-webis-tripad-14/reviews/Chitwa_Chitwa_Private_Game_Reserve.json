We saw the first leopard the camp had seen in 5 days on our first game drive, as well as lions and elephants. Raxon let us watch the leopard for a long time before he radioed to the other vehicles aout her -- it was a truly amazing experience. We saw the Big 5 many times over as well as many lesser animals that were incredible too. The amount of sightings we had in comparison to the other lodges we went to was incomparable!!

Every detail is perfect. The staff is first rate and so anxious to please. But you are here for the animals and the trackers and guides are exceptional. Everyone I met here raved about their guide, but it's hard to imagine how ours (Tristan) could be surpassed by anyone. So knowledgeable and skilled and just as delighted to see the animals as we were. His tracker, Gianni, was super-human, with powers of detection that defy logic. Can anyone really see a chameleon on a high branch in the dark while the car is in motion? Anyway, we had 4 fantastic days here and, despite the 400 am wake-up call, we bounded out of bed each day for another incredible experience. Since the lodge is on a lake, there are animals to see all the time over meals and even from the shower!
