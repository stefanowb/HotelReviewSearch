We had a great time traveling around the city, going on tours, enjoying the local food. Our room at the Pelicanos was decent, nothing special. I would recommend wearing slippers around the room, because the maids couldn't seem to get the floor clean, and our feet would be filthy. The pools were cleaned every day, but seemed kind of murky. We still had a great time swimming, and one of the staff, hopped in the pool, and organized the game of water volleyball. He talked us into doing some water aerobics afterwards. The aerobics instructor was very thankful, considering nobody else wanted to do it. If your allergic to bees, I would avoid the bar area, they were attracted to the sweet drinks. The food at the buffet was terrible, maybe a few good things here and there. The desserts were the worst of all. I don't think I would stay at this resort again, unless it was highly discounted. Unless you want some deals on excursions, don't do the Shell Vacations timeshare presentation. We did it, just to get some deals, and they were extremely rude, but we were firm with the no. For the Kontiki, the Canopy Tours de los Veranos, a City tour (which was terrible!!), and 2 days all inclusive for 4 people, we only shelled out a total of $50. So it was worth it. I hope this helped, and if you have any other questions about PVO you can email me at fiercevox@yahoo.com Happy traveling!!", "user": "Sgrubbies", "date": "October 7, 2007", "id": 10050710}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This Hotel is a joke! The front counter staff was rude and you had to yell to get anything that you requested. I inquired about a perc that we had paid for and I was told that Expedia had lied about that and it was only stated to get people to stay at this hotel. The rooms were distguisting mold,standing water, cochroaches, stained sheets, towels and a leaking roof. We had to be moved 3 times after I requested to be moved to a different resort. The ammenties that are advertised are false. The pool was merkey and there was slime on the walls of the pool. Don't pay for an upgrade in fact don't stay here! The activities were a joke my wife and I went to Casino night as it was advertisied, 4 teenage kids (Activity Crew)1 deck of cards and a stack of hoyle chips I had to show them how to play blackjack. I must say that we did meet some great people you know who you are! 2 things I highly recomend Blakes Sports Bar Mike was great with his local knowledge. His Chef Luis was great the Beer is cold the food awesome and the American Football even better. Thanks MIke!!!!!!!

We felt satisfied with the hotel for the price we had paid. Coming in with low expectations, we were very happy with the overall package. The staff was very friendly and helpful and worked their buns off all day. Please tip these folks as they are not very well paid by the hotel. The guests at the hotel were mostly Canadians, upper mid west and a few Mexican tourists. It seems you could strike up a conversation with just about any person. We had tried to get in to the section II on our arrival but we were told they had no rooms available, try again tomorrow. They put us on a request list. We did try for the first 2 days to get moved but it just seemed to add stress to our stay so we decided to stay where we were in section I. This part of the hotel is off by itself and has it's own restaurant, bars and pool. A walk of about 150 yds out through the lobby and across the street would bring you to the timeshare section pool area that had a snack bar and swim up bar. Another 150 yds would take you to the section II pool area. In between these two pool areas was a large grass/ garden where they held their stage shows and Mexican fiesta. We never did get a good look at the section II rooms but did peek into a couple when the maids were cleaning. The rooms looked to be about the same size as sec. I but maybe a little newer. We were told by some timeshare owners that the tower was recently built and the first floor rooms were all redone after hurricane Kenna in 2002. They also told us that sec.II used to be called Plaza Las Glorias but then combined with the Pelicanos. Sec.II had a larger pool area and a smaller buffet restaurant which was always a wait to be seated. The restaurant at sec.I you could pretty much chose your own table. We never did any of the a la carte restaurants as we went to old town every evening for dinner, so no help on those. Both sections seemed to be low key around the pools and in the rooms. The only activity was around the timeshare pool area. Overall the hotel was fine but did have a few gripes. First, the lack of pool chairs at all pool areas. We could not get a chair unless we played the game of getting up early and staking your claim with your towels (RUDE). Some people would claim chairs and not show up until mid day or as we noticed, not show at all. Management should put an end to this practice. Second was the walk from the pool back to our room in sec.I. It was quite a hike and you had to walk right through the main lobby. We felt a little awkward walking through in our dripping bathing suits. Third was the air conditioner was too loud to use. It was really unbearable and we decided it wasn't worth using . We slept with the window open which wasn't too bad until the occasional late night partier came back from the bars at 2 or 3 A.M. or the mosquito that would find it's way in to annoy you. Last gripe, the location. You have to taxi everywhere as there is not much for restaurants or bars on this strip of hotels. We did walk to the marina one day but it wasn't easy as the road was under construction.
