The room was lovely, great quality, very clean and well kitted out - flat screen tv's in both rooms, tea and coffee making facilities etc. The communal areas were all immaculate and well designed, it felt like a new hotel. The pool area was also great and family friendly. The shuttle that runs to the park takes about 6 minutes and is very efficient and very punctual (if your a minute late it's gone) we found no problem with the service or the timetable but should you wish to come back from the park at times that don't match the shuttle timetable you can get a taxi very easily.

For a Disneyland partner hotel you'd expect some consideration for children rather than the standard business Radisson set up. The kid's playroom consisted of 3 of the type of sit on rides that you find outside supermarkets and that was it - and only 1 of the rides worked. There were no board games or other toys and it was a distance from the main restaurant so you could not leave your children there. The hotel website described 2 restaurants although only one was in use at any time. The meals each evening were buffets were looked unappetising. The kid's buffet when we looked the first night was sushi and salad. There was a limited bar menu with no options for children but the food on our last night was inedible. We had given advannced notice that our son was gluten intolerant but they had no special food options available. The rooms were boiling with very thick duvets. They failed to top up the tea/coffee in the room one day. They also scored low on green aspects - despite a sign encouraging you to reuse your towels they still replaced them each day with fresh towels. They also threw out the soaps each day even though they'd hardly been used so we had to start new ones each day. The breakfast service was chaotic - they just couldn't keep up with the numbers despite it not feeling that busy. It took 20 mins for them to bring bowls and milk to the buffet when they ran out despite lots of people asking. We had no cutlery at our table and after my 3rd request and a 10 min wait I found them and laid the table myself. Whilst they run a coach to Disneyland this is in frequent and very busy as it picks up at another hotel first.

We checked in and were given a room with a double bed!!! i mean come on mother and daughter i think not!!! So we asked to be changed rooms and the receptionist happily allocated us with another room, this time to find that there was someone else staying in that room! as you can imagine by this point things were getting worse. we were the allocated another room which we couldnt even get into!!! 3 changes of keys and a recoding of the door and we were eventually in our room!!! which i must say was fantastic the view was brilliant and the cleanliness was outstanding!!! Next day we went down stairs to breakfast which i found less than standard. however i dont often eat alot. there was pastrys cereal and fruit galour and a number of hot food!!!! we never managed to eat in the resturant so i really couldnt comment!! The decor was extremly tastful and modern!!!! lovely hotel!!! the drinks are expensive however, at 5 euros for a coke!!! :O The bus service to and from the hotel is infrequent however with careful plannin you can catch it and it is free however i recommend you wait outside for it as it leaves dot on time!!!! the number is 57!! getting back to the hotel is exactly the same!!! i recommend that you also get the disneyland bus back to the airport as its around 100 euros for a taxi. and after spending so much money in the park its a bit much!!!!", "title": "excellent hotel bit too far away though", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "missthorn", "date": "September 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8750092, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 how posh it was", "disliked": "\u2014 wasnt close enough to disneyland"}}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 49, "average": 111, "very good": 256, "terrible": 30, "excellent": 200}, "aka": "Radisson Magny Le Hongre", "slim_ranking": 0.142857142857, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "description": "Located in the heart of Disneyland\u00ae golf course, the Radisson Blu hotel is a little heaven at only a few minutes from the magic of Disneyland\u00ae Paris.
