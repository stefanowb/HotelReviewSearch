We got a good price in the summer but what we did not know was the building works inside and out by our bedroom window. The works outside started early and continued until late in the evening, though Sunday was quiet. The room was not particularly good, but adequate it was terrible hot and stuffy, requiring the window open. Then the noise was louder. The bathroom was magnificent. The breakfast was very good and the ambiance of the well appointed breakfast room was as you would expect in a grand hotel. Once the renovations are complete I imagine the hotel will be very good, but expect it to be pricey. Overall I was disappointed with the room's lack of air conditioning and poor presentation, and the building materials in the hall.The price was good.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "atraveler246", "date": "October 5, 2004", "id": 2620416}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Well-appointed sweatbox", "text": "The rooms at the Astoria were a disappointment.

It is right next to the mail mall and only a few minutes walk from the Opera House, ring road and St. Stephens Cathedral. Our room was very tastely decorated and opened onto the mall so that it was possible to sit by the window at night and listen to the sounds of street performances down below. The only major downside to our room was it was not air-conditioned, so that we really suffered. Even with the windows opened, the temperate in the room didn't get down much below 30 and so we got very little sleep during our entire study. For this reason, I would strongly recommend checking to see whether the current rennovations at the hotel include the installation of cooling, especially if you intend to travel to Vienna during summer.", "title": "LOVE HOTEL ASTORIA!!!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "CCataldi", "date": "June 6, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2157906}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful Classic Hotel", "text": "Having said that, the hotel services were generally very good and we enjoyed the breakfasts.

The hotel staff is friendly and accommodating. Our room was clean and spacious. The tub had a curtain and the lights were all working. Their buffet breakfast is quite good. The location is just perfect. The area abounds with restaurants and shops. A lot of the city's major sights are within walking distance. (That's important for us because we get to save time.) The metro and the tram which can take you around are within easy walk. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends.

Was extremely disappointed with the hotel. The location was fabulous but the hotel is getting old and needs major work. First room I was shown was not what I asked for, wanted a twin, not a single and reserved such. Second room had the twin beds but the floor to the bathroom had a HOLE! By this time, I had dragged out my travel book to look for alternate lodgings. Third try, got the twin beds, together, no hole in floor but light near the bed didn't work. Bathroom had old fixtures. The staff was extremely nice but we were sort of disappointed since this was an indulgence staying at a 4 star hotel rather then the normally 3 stars we were staying in. We had stayed in a 2.5 star hotel which was way nicer then the Astoria! If you want to shop, Astoria is perfect but if you want modern luxuries and comforts, NOT HERE!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 31, 2003", "id": 926964}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great downtown central location", "text": "Astoria is a great central hotel downtown.
