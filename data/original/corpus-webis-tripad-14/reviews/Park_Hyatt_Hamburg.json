The location is perfect, within easy walking distance to the main train station and next to fabulous shopping. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious, modern, yet warm. The food in the restaurant is divine. The staff are extremely professional. I've stayed there three times within the last year. I ran into a problem with the car rental which we'd arranged through the hotel. We requested an automatic from Avis, but was sent a standard instead. As there wasn't an automatic available in the class we'd needed, we were left with what we had. The concierge followed up and arranged to have another car sent to us in the next city we were staying at. Mistakes can happen anywhere and how they're dealt with is really the litmus test of a first-rate hotel.
