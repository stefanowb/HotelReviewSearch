All you can eat, both hot and cold food. It was totally adequate. Ate enough to get me through lunch. I felt safe going out at night to the opera and the symphony. The Christmas market in the main square was very pretty, didn't buy anything though, no comparison to the ones in Germany. The weather was wonderful, even though December is normally cold.
