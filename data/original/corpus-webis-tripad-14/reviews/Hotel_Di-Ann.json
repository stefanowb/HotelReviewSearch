The stairs are indeed steep, but the staff carried my luggage upstairs for me. THANK YOU!!! We stayed in room 410, which overlooks the main street and the canal, so we had a window on each side and enjoyed the view down towards Koninklijk Palais and Dam Square, and also the view towards Westerkerk and the Ann Frank House. As far as breakfast, it was ample and fresh. The hotel cat was delightful and slept with me during a nap. Everyone was polite and helpful. The central location of the hotel beats out any complaints I could have possibly found. We chose the Schippol Connexxion shuttle from the airport which runs about 19 Euro round trip; can't beat that. There is a great restaurant right below the hotel on the corner (screaming lasagna; to die for). It's only a 10 minute walk to the train station, and trams and busses run right in front of the hotel. There is a canal taxi just 2 streets over, and a grocery store on the next block, across from the Westerkerk. Every museum was a nice walk away.
