The rooms are spacious and the hotel provides a fairly nice complimentary breakfast bar. My recent stay here would have been great if it were not for two housekeeping/maintenance issues the otherwise spoiled my stay. There was a second sink located out of the bathroom in the main room. The coffee maker was situated on the sinks counter. When I went to use the sink, I noticed that the drain stopper was closed. I opened the drain and started to run water and was immediately hit with a blast of pungent mildew odor coming from the drain. I ran the water for a while but the smell did not go away so I closed the drain and did not use the sink again. The second housekeeping issue was the bathroom floor. It did not look clean and as you can see by the attached photos the grout is white under the sink and in the edges of the room but black in the middle of the floor. The floor really could use a through scrubbing.", "title": "Nice hotel but beginning to show housekeeping issues", "user": "Steeler_Pens_fan", "date": "December 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 187177024}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My teenage son and I recently were looking to stay in State College for a football weekend (fans of the visiting team).

We found the hotel, staff and even the guests very welcoming. The room was clean and beds comfortable. The location was very good - easy to find off of main highways, ample parking, close to several chain restaurants, including a Cracker Barrel. The hotel breakfast was essentially cereal and sweet rolls, and better than average. We took advantage of a shuttle to Beaver Stadium with a stop less than 1/4 mile from the hotel, which was definitely the way to go to avoid parking hassles, etc. All in all, a very positive experience, and I would not only recommend the hotel but would stay there again.", "title": "Nice choice", "user": "guswho1", "date": "November 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 186205383}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013", "text": "Great location, great main facilities, great room layout but the sheets were like starch filled sandpaper and two doubles in a room that big, cmon folks its 2013 the queen size bed does exist for nearly the same cost.", "title": "Great location and facilities but...", "user": "pizboin", "date": "November 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 185730960}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled on business", "text": "My overnight stay at the Holiday Inn Express was very accommodating.
