We were the only guests in the main house at the time, and were very pleased with our experience. Dianna was helpful from the first email we sent many months ago. Our bed was comfortable and while the bathroom was small, it gave us everything we needed to get ready for our next day's adventure. Our room and bathroom were clean and refreshed daily. The breakfasts were large with delicious foods, recommendations for other area restaurants were right on and they even made us a special, private dinner in-house one night although the restaurant was not open to the public. The price of the dinner was excellent when compared to other local establishments. We'd definitely go back and recommend this place to others.", "title": "Not what we expected", "user": "reviewOttawa", "date": "June 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 32113722}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Window screen in room had wide torn gap at bottom and when problem identified was resolved with a large strip of scotch tape.

Towels replaced daily however last one smelled sour. Water not replaced nor baskets emptied. Why did we not move?
