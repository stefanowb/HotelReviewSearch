The room was quite large, with a comfortable king bed, a sofa, a large desk, a coffee table, and a beautiful view. Breakfast had a good choice of options. Location is good and close to several stores, particularly to the Town Center at Boca Raton, a very good shopping mall. The only problem we had during our stay was caused by a noisy family next room (there was a connecting door). I complained about it to the reception and they immediately phoned the room and returned to me to say that they hoped everything would be fine from then on. The day before our departure, management called me and asked about our stay and whether we had had any problems. I think this is a very professional attitude that, at the same time, adds a personal touch. Checkout was fast and simple.
