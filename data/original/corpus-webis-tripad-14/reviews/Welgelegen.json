The rooms are lovely and comfortable, the breakfasts are delicious (fresh fruit, yogurt, granola or hot breakfast choices), the common areas are conducive to chatting with other guests (something my family likes to do--but there are enough places to sit quietly and read if you want as well), the location is in easy walking distance of Kloof St with galleries, shops & restaurants, the art work throughout is stunning.
