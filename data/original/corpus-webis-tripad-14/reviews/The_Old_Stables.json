This was plenty and if you were on a budget i think you could have had these for dinner too! I've stayed in plenty of hotels for business and what makes this stand out is the quality of the items they leave for you to eat / drink and use.

For our needs, it was perfectly convenient as it was an easy walk to our brother's home. Down a cobble alleyway in the village center - all very quaint. The small building rents 4-5 (I think) apartments of various sizes. We rented one of the smaller ones - and it was quite small for two people - more like a hotel room. Nevertheless, the place was comfortable, homey and quiet. We loved it. Great bed - cozy and comfortable. Fantastic shower and spacious bathroom. And very quiet ....... we didn't hear or see of the other guests.
