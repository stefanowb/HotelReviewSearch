The mountain view room was a joke- there was no reason to open the curtains. The pool and lake area were very nice. The downside to this hotel was the staff. A few staff members were very nice, but a few were down right rude and snobbish. The restaurant at the lake is a gorgeous setting, but very expensive. My partner and I were not terribly hungry on the night that we arrived, so we just ordered pasta. The waiter seemed to disapprove. We also were not given the table that we were promised when we made the reservation. The head waiter rudely abandoned us and then we were served by a young man, who was much nicer. This other man could not have made us feel less welcomed. My major complaint about this hotel is that if you did not speak Italian, it was very difficult to communicate with the staff. Even knowing German did not help much. In a five-star hotel, I expect the staff to be more multi-lingual. My other major criticism was the breakfast. Not at all appropriate for a 5-star hotel. The breakfast room was too hot (why not serve it down by the pretty lake?). Instead you have no view, or a view of the parking lot and street. The offerings were slim and average or below average quality. Free shuttle service to the town of Lugano was nice. But if you don't speak Italian, you won't be able to communicate with your driver.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AmericaninBasel", "date": "August 26, 2009", "id": 38917350}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went to the Olivella for a weekend getaway and we were not disappointed.

The hillside view is of no interest however the room is small but lovely (see picture) - a typical large city 4* room. From what we saw the rooms facing the lake are quite larger and have a fantastic view but seem to be not as nicely decorated. The bar off the lobby is exotically decorated and they serve food from the restaurant. There was also entertainment (singer + piano). We really enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurant on the lake is across the street but can also be reached via an underground tunnel which is marvelously decorated and well lit. Off the restaurant is the pool and terrace.

Superb location though there is a road between the hotel and the lake, but thanks to air-conditioning in all the rooms you can sleep with the balcony doors closed and there is a beautifully decorated tunnel to the pool area, the restaurant \"Lago\" and the lake. Staff are friendly and helpful and contrary to what a recent guest wrote, the shuttle service to Lugano is absolutely free of charge and the welcome drink can be an alcoholic drink if you ask for it (we had a gin-and-tonic). The view is fabulous, the pool area quite large but at the lake itself, there could be a few more deckchairs. The rooms are large and very well appointed - if you do not like the rather heavy duvet, ask for a \"letto italiano\" and you get sheets and blanket. Breakfast very good. Our only complaint was that the restaurants are rather expensive and even when you ask for \"the little menu\", the prices are quite steep. This can be overcome by taking the shuttle to Lugano, it only takes about 20 minutes. We did have dinner one evening at the hotel's \"Lago\" restaurant - the food was excellent as was the service.
