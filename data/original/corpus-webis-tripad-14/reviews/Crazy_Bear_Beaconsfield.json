The dining room wasn't even decorated with the same flourish that CB is renowned for - and the restaurant is in a building over the road from the main hotel. We've enjoyed CB in London for drinks before, but this restaurant is frankly having a laugh. It's incredible that they can sell the most mediocre food at these prices, and then take the p**** even more by giving you child size portions.
