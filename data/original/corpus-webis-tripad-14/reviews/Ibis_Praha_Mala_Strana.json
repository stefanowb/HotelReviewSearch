If you are looking for luxury or scenic views this is not a good choice. If you are looking for a travel base by tram and metro lines that is clean and convenient, this is likely to work for you. The included breakfast might not be great by fancy hotel standards but it's waaay better than American-style \"continental breakfast. Bring your own laptop and converter, unless you want to wait while drunk college students use facebook to flirt with each other on the two internet stations in the lobby. It's next to a mall with a Tesco and it was kind of cool to see daily, non-touristy city life in action, plus have access to an ATM, and some pretty decent espresso. There is also a Paul (french bakery chain) right nearby which is convenient for picking up snacks before a grand day out. If you can afford somewhere fancier and more central, go for it, because Prague is lovely and you want to spend as much time as possible exploring.
