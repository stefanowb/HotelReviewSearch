Our exchange this week at Suntide was a new experience at least for me since she owned a week at a very similar facility 3 resorts to the north and had had a lot of experience with the area for ten years running in the 90's. I have to say that I was very impressed with this small (41 unit) property. Some critics have written that it's harshly managed and I will note that management here is ... strict about rules, but it works since the place is unfailingly clean, quiet and well run. The clientele here is mixed in ages, but geezers predominate. (I'm 65, so I qualify!). The design is a bit dated and single bedroom suites can be compact with mostly queen-size beds and a combo living/dining room and kitchen area. But the layout is efficient and with a lovely beach 50 yards away, and a beautiful pool and huge hot tub, why would you spend a lot of time in your room?! Incidentally, while the layout is dated, the pool, hot tub and all of the fixed assets here are either new or recently refurbished.", "title": "Small, quiet gem on the beach!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CelticMutt", "date": "December 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188248075}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The locale is perfect.
