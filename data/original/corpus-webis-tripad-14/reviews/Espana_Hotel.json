We paid \u00a322 per night each including breakfast which was a real bargain. The hotel is ideally situated in a quite (but slightly rough looking) side street about 15 mins from The Coloseum and 10 mins to the nearest Metro Station. The hotel is safe and secure but the staff didn't speak english, but hey thats our problem. The hotel thoroughout is pleasantly decorated, clean and tidy and quite compact. The rooms are small but comfortable, modern and clean. What more do you want for that money and really only somewhere to sleep. There is a safe which is free to use.

One time our safe was deactivated for some reason, and was told to call mgmt, again all she said was \"I don't know\" and hung up on us. The location of the hotel was horrible, very quiet street in scar neighborhood. The receptionist will never greet you when you walk by.
