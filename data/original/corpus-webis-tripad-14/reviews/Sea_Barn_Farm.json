We were 3 family groups together so there was a \u00a320 each family bond to put down which we easily got back at the end of our trip. Yes there is a long list of rules, but what campsite doesnt have rules? The kids played in the park most of the day and we werent disturbed at any point of our stay by other campers or by the owners. Toilet and shower block was amazing, always clean and presentable, with spacious shower cubicles. I am an early riser so at 6-7am hot water was plentiful although there was on one occasion at 9am no hotwater for a short period. We comfortably ran many electrical items off the electric point without any tripping which was nice. Some areas of the campsite are exposed to wind as the site is so high but where we stayed (140,141 and 142) was well sheilded by the trees and was actually a lovely corner plot for the 3 families to live, play and enjoy!", "title": "Very lovely", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Rachel R", "date": "May 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 159886858}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The shop has periods of closure, but we just made sure we knew these... simple!
