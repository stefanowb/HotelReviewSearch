Many of the bad reviews for this hotel are based on the fact that the rooms can be so different (for the same price range). This time instead of having a large room overlooking the Piazza Republica, we had a smaller room with the smallest bathroom you could imagine (some of the other writers described them in their reviews)...imagine a small bathroom with a shower head in the middle and an drain in the floor...guess what...they weren't kidding. The second thing that was different this time was that the staff was not helpful in getting reservations at the Uffizzi or at the Academia....(on our first stary they took care of everything). The final negative experience was that they demanded payment in advance (I'm convinced that they do this to avoid having people check out early or cancel entirely once they see some of the worst rooms). The hotel occupies the 3rd and fourth floors of a great old building...the rooms on the square are large with great views and large bathrooms (odd numbered rooms 205 through 211) and I think odd numbers 111 or 113 through 121 on the thirdd floor (but you need to confirm this with the management).

I was in an inside room with less than no view (one bothered why there was a window at all.) AC worked. Long complicated walk to the breakfast room on another floor, but the breakfast was good.

We stayed at a quadruple-bed room which was spacious but run-down. I have attached pictures of the room furnishings - I do not believe a thrift store would even sell these. Every item had a hole, a crack or was worn out. It looks like these are furnishings that were passed down from the refurbished rooms. My guess is there is a refurbished part of the hotel (the part that Rick Steve's saw and which are pictured on the Pendini website) and the unrefurbished part of the hotel (where we slept). One of the photos is blurry but shows the good hallway and the start of our hallway. Upon arrival, I was so surprised at the room that I actually went on the internet to check the website photos again just in case I made a mistake. I asked the front desk lady if I can have a room in the refurbished part of the hotel, she tells me all their rooms are the same. I asked again in the morning to change rooms since the room next to us (in the refurbished hall) was checking out, and she said I can't select which room to stay in and I probably won't like the room she would put us in. The refurbished rooms might have problems too, but they at least don't look like a flophouse.
