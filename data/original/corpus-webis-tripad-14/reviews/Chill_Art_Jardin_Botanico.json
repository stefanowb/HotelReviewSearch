This is a lovely little hotel located near the art institute and the botanical garden. It was a nightmare finding it by car; we drove around and the around the city for almost two hours until we made it to the door. We realized that we should have rented the GPS unit! Although we \"knew\" where the hotel was, the tiny maze of one-way streets was almost impossible to navigate and we ARE used to urban driving.", "user": "beekay458", "date": "July 11, 2007", "id": 8103571}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great little hotel", "text": "The hotel, once found, was very contemporary and clean. The facilities were excellent, the AC was above average, and there was a free public computer to use. Breakfast is served in a light, airy restaurant. It is about a ten minute walk to the old city and the nightlife. Valencia was probably the dirtiest city we visited in our 9 city Spanish trip. The bars obviously cater to throngs of tourists.

It is a 2-3 mile walk through the park to new City of Arts & Science, worth the trip to Valencia in itself. (Or you can take the #95 bus along the same route for 1.10eu per person). In one mile you can be at cathedral and its magnificent square, and also the beautiful Lonja (silk exchange).", "user": "tigger65", "date": "May 25, 2006", "id": 5225602}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Valencian Country", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 21, "very good": 43, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 21}, "aka": "Chill Art Jardin Botanico Hotel Valencia", "slim_ranking": 0.465346534653}
