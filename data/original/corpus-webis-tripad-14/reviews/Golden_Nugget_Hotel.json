There were several minor problems with our room but having spoken to personnel on the reception desk we were swiftly moved to another on the same corridor. The room was extremely comfortable and large and was fine as a base as you're not likely to spend that much time in your hotel room in Vegas! The location is great for the Fremont St experience as it's right outside. We had no car, but getting onto the strip was pretty straightforward as the Deuce double decker bus leaves downtown regularly and stops all along the strip. It's quite slow, however! The ongoing renovation and refurbishment at the Golden Nuggett didn't bother us at all and I'm sure it'll look fantastic when completed.
