But my room was exceptional, with mircowave and coffemaker, large screen TV, nice QUIET heating system, and plenty of room. The hotel is set back from the highway, which makes it a little harder to find, but also makes it quieter. And the staff was cheerful and helpful. Everything about the hotel was perfect.
