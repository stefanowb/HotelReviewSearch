Upon check in we met Senora Bonilla who was very cordial and helpful. Despite the pouring rain she showed me to our cabin to make sure it was satisfactory. All the staff at the lodge were great. Our room was cleaned well each day and the breakfast (included in price) was very good. The nature trail in the surrounding forest and butterfly garden were beautiful. The lodge is off the main road outside La Fortuna and the road is bumpy but not impassable. It's location is perfect if you want a quiet retreat, which we did. There is no view of the volcano but you will see it every time you travel around the area since it is so close and huge. The cabins don't have AC but are equipped with a fan. I would definitely recommend this lodge to friends and family.", "title": "Great Stay!!!", "user": "CalTraveler45", "date": "July 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 72641900}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010", "text": "We spent three nights at Arenal Oasis. What a great place! It's a short distance away from La Fortuna, away from all the grinding gears and constant noise, and the air is fresher and cooler, since it's a little ways up a hillside. The taxi into town was $3. But there was a small village nearby with restaurants and a grocery store, so we had all that we needed close by. Arenal Oasis has its own trails through the jungle, complete with a butterfly dome, live animal exhibits, and frog ponds. The morning breakfast in the open air dining area was a real treat. We enjoyed excellent gallo pinto and fruit while watching the exotic birds feast at the bird feeder and the chickens pecking around in the grass. The host family was very quiet but friendly and helpful with our activities. Since virtually all activities include pick-up at your hotel, the distance from Fortuna was never a problem. We felt very much at home here.", "title": "Great place!", "user": "Nancy052", "date": "May 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 64092835}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Once we arrived up the bumpy road, we knew that we'd found a remarkable place. While it's not far at all from La Fortuna, you feel as if you are staying in a jungle lodge - a lodge with beautiful and cozy accommodations, delicious breakfast, and friendly staff. Our casita was peaceful and felt isolated, though it was steps away from the dining area. Actually, our best sleep of the trip was at Arenal Oasis, free-range roosters notwithstanding! As detailed in New Key to Costa Rica, Arenal Oasis includes some really added value in its mini-zoo, which includes a butterfly aviary and exhibits of frogs, spiders, snakes, and lizards.
