After reading so many negative reviews about people not happy with their room we called the hotel directly to tell them exactly what we did, and didn't want. They were very understanding and room 545 worked well for us. Not huge, but not too small either. Had a king bed, table and chair and a loveseat. Only 1 robe though which seemed odd. Bathroom was good sized with good water pressure from the shower. The public areas are beautiful. Bar is very nice and drinks were reasonably priced. No street noise from our room. Rate was $329 before taxes and $34 per night for parking. I think at those rates there should be a newspaper outside the room in the morning and turndown service in the evening and they aren't. Complimentary wifi in the room didn't really work at all. If you like historic hotels and tell them what you do and don't want in your room you should be fine. Staff was pleasant and helpful.

The concierge looked at his co-worker with a worried look and said that he would go check the bikes, that they had just been serviced. He came back about 15 minutes later and said we were good to go, but that they did not have a bike lock. He offered to give us $20 for us to stop while were were out and buy one (really??). We hopped on the bikes, excited to go explore. We turned the corner and tried to stop - NO BRAKES! We have similar bikes at home and ride frequently, we knew what we were doing. One of the scariest moments of my life. I had to ride into a curb and jump off to stop.
