We stayed in a balcony room overlooking the river and, if you stood on the left side of the balcony, you could see the American Falls off to the right. We were disappointed that we couldn't enjoy the scenery when we sat down because there was a long horizontal plastic part of the railing that blocked our view. Also, there were lights on the balconies that attracted bugs at night, making it hard to enjoy the balcony during the evening. The room decor was dated and the bathroom fixtures were old and worn. We found all the above to be minor inconveniences because this Inn did have a LOT of good features! The rooms were very clean and housekeeping always offered assistance if we ever needed anything. The room temperature was comfortable and the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable! The parking was free and quite ample with two lots available, one within the Inn and one lot behind the Inn. We had the breakfast buffet once and, although pricey, we found an excellent variety of delicious food. The location of the Inn was away from the very busy tourist area, yet, we felt safe walking around this quiet area at night. The tourist attractions are all within walking distance of the Inn, but we found the distance to the Horseshoe Falls to be quite a hike. However, if you go up about two blocks from the main road by the falls, you could find parking lots with cheap rates (about five dollars a day). Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Michael's Inn, and would stay here again if we ever return to Niagara Falls.", "title": "Overall, A Decent Place for the Price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DeeChristine", "date": "August 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 74194947}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled solo", "text": "I stayed three days in July.
