Had a room for 4, you have 1 room which consists of both bedroom & living room plus a little kitchenette. We had a pull down double bed from the wall and a sofa bed which had another single sofa bed underneath it which you pull out from underneath. We had to make up the bed's when we arrived which is no big deal. We re-arranged the room to give us more room as we left the beds up permanently, we felt we had adequate room. Tv in room with 1 english speaking channel (euro sport) the rest were french channels, this was fine as we weren't there to stay in our room. On the 2 occasions when we were a bit worn out from the slopes all day and stayed in for the night we just entertained ourselves with making a meal, having a few beers and chilling. I took my laptop along with me and the footage that we filmed of us skiing on the slopes were entertainment enough for us to watch by plugging the laptop into the tv : ) There are adequate side tables, chest of drawers and a 4 seater kitchen table with chairs as well as your beds to chill out/sit on. We had storage and coat hangers for our clothes. All rooms have a small balcony which i found bliss, ours looked out onto other buildings which was fine and we could see the top of one slope.", "title": "Stayed here 10th - 17th March 2012", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Cathy C", "date": "March 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 126270042}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Bathroom: We didn't have a problem with the bathroom, big enough for us.

We didn't spend hours in the apartment but there were enough chairs for all of us. I wouldn't have wanted to have anymore people staying in their though. The underground on site car park was really handy and made unpacking less of a chore than we imagined after the drive from the UK. The staff could not have been more helpful and the pool and sauna were a great bonus. The residence is close to the centre of town so getting food from the supermarket or going out for a drink was not a problem. Supermarkets however aren't cheap in Val d'Isere so stopping before the resort is recommended. We did not find the walk to the bus stop or the slopes a hassle but with small children and lots of kit I would leave more time in the morning.
