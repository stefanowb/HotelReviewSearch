Ok, there may have been a few 'oldies' but, neither more nor less than life in general. The absence of shaven heads, excessive tattoos and boorish behaviour was a massive +. The food (and choice) was excellent and the attention to detail given to diners by the restaurant staff was impressive. Not for the pie, chips and a pint fraternity unless they plan to enhance their lifestyle. Loved the pool, the quality of the water and the well monitored sunbeds. Put your towel down before 8am (and walk away) and you'll have to collect it from reception...it works well. Highly recommended. Final point for the ladies.

From the time we checked in until departure everything was excellent. Our room looked out over a pedestrian walkway up from the beach. We did think intially it might be nosiy but this was not the case. The room was large and really clean. We had a good sized balcony with two sunloungers as well as table, chairs and parasol. Room was cleaned every day, towels changed daily and sheets changed twice during our stay which was great. Meals were excellent as the scales proved when we got home! There was the usual choices for breakfast plus made to order omlettes which were good. Evening meal was really good, usually about five to six choices for main meal, plus two choices on the grill and the carvery. There was also a vegetarian corner and a huge variety of salads to choose from. Good variety of desserts and ice cream. Don't think we saw the same thing on the menu twice during our eleven night stay. Pool was excellent - whole area was throughly cleaned every night. The hotel was quite quiet during our stay so there was an abundance of sunbeds regardless of what time of day you went to the pool. Pool bar offered good value lunchtime snacks, eg burger and chips etc all priced about four euros. Entertainment staff deserve a special mention - they were really enthusiastic and had a wide variety of different activities on every day to keep you amused when you were not frying in the 38 degree heat. Certificates were handed out at night in the bar to the winners which was a nice touch. The main bar was open all day, happy hour from 6pm till 7pm - two for one which was good. Entertainment at nights was a bit of a hit or a miss but we went out most nights anyway. The surrounding area was good, a couple of modern shopping centres are just down from the hotel. There is a strip of pubs just down from the hotel including a Scottish bar and Irish bar which were both really good. Two euros a pint and plenty of live music. One down side though - absolutely loads of people trying to sell sunglasses, watches and silly toys etc. We ate out one night at Teppanyaki restaurant in the Safari centre just down from the hotel - it was really good, would recommend it. We ventured to Veronicas (the strip) one night, it was okay, typical of what you would expect, loads of touts trying to entice you into their pubs for a free shot. We found the drinks were very expensive here. Had a fantastic holiday at the Hotel Vulcano, anybody booking a holiday here will have a great time.
