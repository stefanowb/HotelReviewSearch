Also we faced towards the city which is located next to the the boardwalk to the hotel and the chinese place and a 1000 other shortcuts and it is very LOUD. whats that you say? Close your window, well cannot since no airconditioning so all I am saying is that it is loud. Also on the first floor people walking by get a straight shot into the room this of course made it hard to enjoy the porn. Curtains were the type that were just about 4 inches to small so always some spot open. and the hotel is nice enough to put a bench for people to sit on right outside the door which puts it outside our window and we were lucky to get every young Brit in town drunk and loud and telling of all his conquests in the red light district which sort of made up for the porn intrusion.
