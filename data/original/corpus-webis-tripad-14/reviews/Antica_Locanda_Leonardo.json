Not knowing Milan very well, I found it recommended in a guidebook, and thinking it looked nice, decided to take a chance and try it. I was not disappointed on any level; rather, I had an utterly lovely stay. Its diminutive size lends it a cozy charm bigger hotels simply can't equal, and a level of service to match. Everyone at the hotel was simply wonderful, friendly and helpful and happy to go out of their way to improve the quality of my time in Milan. Breakfast, included in the price, was a real treat, one of the highlights of my day--there's nothing like starting the morning off on the right foot, and with excellent (not to mention free) food and amiable service in a delightful breakfast room, I can't think of a better way. My room was, if simple, elegantly furnished and spotlessly clean, with a fantastic marble shower I was always thankful for when returning to my room after a long day in the summer heat of Milan. If the room wasn't dripping in opulence, it more than made for it in being perfectly charming, with a comfortable bed, plenty of space, and abundant peace and quiet. The hotel itself was always miraculously quiet, really a haven in so bustling a city. The common rooms and hallways are all nicely decorated, including a wonderful outdoor courtyard that was beautiful in the summer. All in all, I found it a quaint and charming hotel with a superlative, courteous staff, tranquility and elegance in abundance, and a thoroughly pleasant decor.
