We first stayed for Oktoberfest in 2007 and again in 2008. All of the hotels in Munich were VERY expensive, which led us to Unterhaching instead and the wonderful find in Hotel Fresh Inn! Hotel Fresh Inn is basic but comfortable and clean. It has free parking if you drive there and is about a 10 minute walk from the train station if you don't. Once on the train it's a direct shot to Munich. Just make sure to take note of the proper train stop for the hotel, as our friends used the Unterhaching stop which wasn't correct and made for a long trek back to the hotel. Hotel Fresh Inn reminds me of a hospital because it seems very sterile. There's very little color or decoration but that's perfectly fine since all we cared about was a clean, quiet hotel with free breakfast. The bedrooms are very large, but sparsely decorated with standard IKEA furnishings. The beds are warm and comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious. Our room had a hotplate and kitchenette which was convenient for reheating the prior evening's leftover dinner. In 2008 there was very little in the way of restaurants near Hotel Fresh Inn but it seemed like the area was under construction so the convenience of the area has probably improved. As with most European hotels, breakfast is included and they offer a decent buffet of food items. The price was reasonable at about 120 euros per night during Oktoberfest. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.", "title": "Very Affordable for Oktoberfest", "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "October 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 181184649}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "this place is about 10 minutes walk from the s-bahn (S3 suburban Train) which takes you to Marienplatz/City centre in about 20 minutes. i\u00b4ve stayed in this hotel twice this year. the rooms were always clean. beds are okay to sleep on for a few days, cause the matresses aren\u00b4t the best..but what do you expect for that Price? 48 \u20ac is really cheap for a single room, the double room i shared with my mom the first time i stayed there was around 57 \u20ac . that\u00b4s very reasonnable for a place just a little ouside munich. the rooms are big enough, but quite hot in summer, cause there\u00b4s no Aircondition,which is normal in Germany when you book lower than 4 stars. well again, you get what you pay for! ;-) but the staff was friendly and always tried to be helpful. one of the best things about the place for me was the fridge in the room. well actually it\u00b4s a kitchenette. you\u00b4re able to rent a set of kitchen utensilies like plates,cups, glasses, pots, spoons etc. for 2 \u20ac per day if you want to. and they offer a breakfast for around 7 or 8 \u20ac, which i didn\u00b4t try, cause there were Lidl and Aldi supermarkets just next door where we could buy everything for our breakfast in the room, even fresh baked Ciabatta, Baguette, danishes, Croissants etc. I\u00b4ll be back there soon for a few nights, cause munich is such a beautiful City and you usually don\u00b4t spend much time in the Hotel anyhow, so why pay more for a chic extravagant place if you\u00b4re there to see the attractions of munich??? :-)", "title": "reasonnable and not too far from city centre", "user": "kathy1983", "date": "September 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 176290742}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "...with a number of drawbacks possible guests should consider:", "title": "good price and location, but...", "user": "nightfairy76", "date": "July 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 134282187}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not a great deal.", "text": "- 4 storeys but NO elevator!", "user": "K_Soze_DC", "date": "June 26, 2012", "id": 132830358}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled solo", "text": "- very unpleasant heat in the poorly insulated top floor rooms during summer", "title": "Clean, good price, nice breakfast, 20 min. from center!", "user": "Omer P", "date": "May 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 130346857}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 16, "very good": 7, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 0.875}
