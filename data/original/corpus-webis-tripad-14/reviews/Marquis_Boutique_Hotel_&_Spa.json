Our upgraded room (deluxe terrace) was very large but definitely in need of a little TLC. I doubt it had been painted in years. My husband hated the fact that it had a bathtub with handheld shower but NO shower curtain - he took a lot of Shamu baths! However, the porch was fabulous - half the size of the entire room with couch, two easy chairs, cocktail table, dining table and four chairs AND a hammock swing. We spent many hours relaxing there. There are two restaurants 'on-site' which is helpful as you are pretty isolated in this location.

Reading a review on Travel Advisor helped me pick the Marquis and I'm glad I did. It was our 5 year wedding anniversary and I wanted something a little different than the typical carribean resort...that's exactly what we got. If you want amazing service and a small, quiet, modest resort, you will love this place. Really important...this resort is NOT on a beach and the pool is really small. You are literally on top of a mountain and the entire resort has a \"rustic\" quality. The beds are low to the ground and the bathrooms are very nice but not modern. The view from our balcony was breath-taking, the breakfast in the morning (hot chocolate croissants, croissants and french bread, fruit and fresh squeezed OJ) was included and incredible, the staff and the service all get really high marks. Think bed and breakfast rather than mega resort and you won't be disappointed. Forget the spa, it's just not that great and very expensive.

This was our 2nd time. The 1rst time we stayed in a deluxe room, the 2nd a Great View room. The rooms are identical, and no matter where the location, the view will be amazing, better from the Great View room though. Rooms are tastefully furnished, and have wonderful tubs, a luxury in the Caribbean, and all rooms have a spacious balcony with teak furniture and a hammock. Rooms come with nice touches, such as an espresso/tea machine, well stocked mini bar, CD player, robes, in room safes, and a beautiful tea light candleabra. Breakfast is served at their pool, or on your balcony and is delightful. A basket of croissants, baguette, and chocolate croissants (warm), fresh squeezed OJ, your choice of capuccino, coffee, or tea, and a lovely fresh seasonal fruit plate, are delivered and set up for you to enjoy. We chose to have breakfast on our balcony, where we watched the dancing butterflies, and enjoyed the serenity. The staff are wonderful and accomodating. Their restaurant recomendations are excellent. Do rent a car, so you can easily come and go as you please. It is not expensive. Treat yourself to a massage from Maria in their \"Zen\" area, or have a Thai massage from Cathy, both excellent therapists. Everyone speaks both english and french. It is nice to be able to stay at this small resort and enjoy all of it's personal touches, and still be able to enjoy the facilities of Domaine de L'onvillers, the large resort directly on the beach at Anse Marcel, where you can enjoy complimentary beach chairs, their pool, and dine in their excellent restaurant. Drinks and dinner can be signed to your hotel bill which is very convenient. Our favorite restaurants are in Grand Case, Le Cottage and Tastevin. Eat on the French side, shop on the Dutch side, and don't stay on the Dutch side if you are looking for a peaceful stay. Le Marquis is unique, and a true find.

The views from the ride up and down the mountain to the hotel were incredible, the ocean almost always visible. The hotel was fairly quiet, giving me the feeling that I was in my own villa., with my own wait staff. Breakfast by the pool every morning was wonderful, and the coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice , plate of freshly cut fruit, basket of croissants were delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive, Graziella ,Samantha and Rosemary were wonderful and very helpful with any questions or services I needed. The room was quite spacious, with a balcony overlooking the cove of Anse Marcel. The beach was small, but quite beautiful, soft sand and warm gentle water. There were very few people there because the two hotels on the beach front were closed, so it felt like my own private beach. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are truly looking for a low key and relaxing vacation. Make sure to visit Ilet Pinel, a tiny island close to the hotel, with a fabulous beach, and take the ferry from Marigot to Anguilla.

The rooms are not super fancy, but they have small touches such as a small stereo system, candles, a espresso machine, and the views are amazing, and you can have the continental breakfast in your room while looking down on an amazing view. There is also a nice hammock on the terrace you a can relax on while looking down on the marina. Also, the bathroom does not have a shower, just a tub with a handheld showering attachment and no shower curtain, so you really basiclly end up taking a bath. The hotel is not on the beach, but the hotel staff is always available to take you down to the beach in the car, and it takes literally two minutes to get there. The beach is very nice also, very quiet without the music and crazy people running around. When we went, there was probably about 15 people out there. If you are looking for a place that is close to all the action, and where are all the people are, this is probably not the place. But its a great place to unwind and spend some quiet time. It is kind of far from the airport, and although the actual distance is not much from the airport, it almost takes an hour to get to the hotel due to the roads, other than the drive to the hotel, it is really a great place to stay, with great service!!", "user": "fh1234", "date": "January 21, 2008", "id": 12863905}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful Small Hotel", "text": "We loved this quiet little boutique hotel, with great service.
