We were in town for the MegaCon comic book convention. We had a wonderful stay at the hotel, we were on the 14th floor in the tower. The beds were comfy and I loved the view of Sea World out the window. Everything was very clean and kept clean throughout our stay. We used our laptop in the lobby for free. It was nice to sit in there at the end of the day and watch all the important comic book writers and artists walk in and out. Since we checked in early we were given free breakfast vouchers. If we had to pay for the breakfast we would not have went with it being $17 per person. The other mornings we went to the Villiage Inn across the street. The Village Inn does have free wifi so you can bring your laptop and connect to the internet for free. We did get room service one night but it took over an hour to get our food. The woman at Room Service did call and let me know there was a mess up with our order and she did give us a discount for the mix up. I thought that was nice. We used the trolley to get to the convention and back and it was a nice ride. Everyone at the Front Desk was very nice when I had questions and when we checked in. A lot of the employees would greet us and say hello or good morning which I thought was a nice touch. My husband normally doesnt care where we stay but he really liked this hotel and wants to stay here again when we go back to Orlando.

The day before my departure, my laptop was stolen out of my room. I called for security, to no response. After 30 mins I called the police and then the \"emergency number\" button on the phone in my room. The police arrived 5-10 mins later, and after the report was written up security came to my room and said absolutely nothing to me and didn't ask me any questions. I was told by the police officer that they had asked him for the information. Being totally freaked out that someone had been in my room, I was not about to stay another night, so I had a friend come pick me up. Upon check out I was told everything was taken care of and didn't receive a receipt, so naturally I thought they hadn't charged me for my stay. Well, I was wrong, I was charged for the full stay including the night that I didn't stay. Having heard nothing from security for a week, I made several calls to their security always getting an answering machine, and calls that were never returned. Concerned that there were no security cameras on site, and this horrible response from security I let my professional organization know what had happened, so they would choose a better hotel next time. In turn, they contact the hotel about the matter, in which they received a response from security, blaming me for the incident, insinuating that I was lying about when I told the police I was in my room!! I am soo shocked and horrified by this experience!! I have no idea what to do about it. I suppose I came out lucky that more things weren't stolen (I think I surprised the thief, as I wasn't at the pool long) It could have been much worse and I'm glad I wasn't in the room when it happened! I would still beware of staying at this hotel. There is no security cameras in the areas of the rooms, and no key required to get in the pool area.

Only 15 mins drive from the airport. Hotel was clean, pool was spotless, staff were extremely helpful and friendly - especially staff at the front door who were great for directions and advice. The grounds were immaculate and lots of things for kids to do e.g. outdoor giant chess, playground, ping pong, pool table, crazy golf and Suzy in the kids club was a big hit - even though we only spent 1 day at the pool!! She was great!! When we arrived we asked to change rooms and this was accommodated immediately. Moved to Block 6 right outside one of the pools - great for the kids aged 9 and 12. Only ate at the hotel once - had pizza from the Deli - nice pizza. We had breakfast every morning at the Village Inn across the street. It was great value and kept up going until dinner time! Hired a car and would recommend this as its very easy to get around and you don't have to depend on buses or trams. The I-trolley has a stop right outside the hotel door and this is great if you don't rent a car.

The hotel had some good amenties, loads of pools to choose from, golf and laundry. We had a very nice meal in their restaurant one evening which wasn't too pricey. We found instead of going across to the Village every day for breakfast that the Max Deli sold bagels and fresh juice.

NO WHERE on the web site did it state that almost all the rooms have OUTSIDE entrances. Yes, they are on \"resort\" property however there is a lot of foot traffic in this area of Orlando and security wise it did not sit well with me. The room was listed as an \"Interior Double\". Meaning we had an upgraded Courtyard view...which was just grass. Although much better than the opposite side of the building that looked at dumpsters. I did call the front desk and asked for an upgrade to a Tower room-the only rooms that are all inside rooms. They upgraded us for an additional $10.00 a night. Not bad considering the room was almost twice the size of the previous room with an awesome view of Orlando. Also the shuttle they provide to Sea World is on a set schedule so you are rushing to catch it or have to wait. Also the knowledge of most of the staff was marginal. We also had tickets to the UCF football game but since it was pouring down rain opted to stay and watch it at the bar downstairs AFTER calling to confirm that they would be showing it. The bar is very attractive and the service okay, however they could not get the game on TV because they only have sateliite and do not get local channels. So we ate mostly unimpressive food while we waited for 45 minutes for the game to come on that they could not get. The concierge was no help either as he was completely unaware the hotel has DirecTV and not the local cable and did not offer to call or provide any numbers for local sports bar to see if they had the game. We ended up checking out early and forfeiting our 3rd free night. Most of this was due to the torrential downpour, however if the service had been better we would have just stayed. I will say the main property looked very nice and the pool areas were lovely. It also looked like they had a lot of activities that would have been fun if not for the hurricane like weather. When we checked out they did take the $30.00 upgrade fee off our bill. Bottom line, okay stay but get a Tower Room. Plan your events yourself and don't ask or expect much info from the staff and you will be okay. You can also take the walking path to SeaWorld and forego parking fees or waiting for their shuttle to show up.", "title": "a hidden oasis", "user": "lovesibiza", "date": "October 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119249796}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Having stayed in Orlando in the \"International Palms\" (formally the holiday inn i think) up beside \"Wet n Wild\" the Doubletree was a really enjoyable stay.", "title": "Fantastic hotel.Would stay again", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "EMMA P", "date": "October 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119182702}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with family", "text": "A light bulb went in our room and when we reported it we are thanked for reported the issue with warm cookies rather than made feel like you were being a annoyance.", "title": "Average Property", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RozzyW", "date": "October 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119175830}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I planned our family vacation over six months ago, I was torn between the Hilton Grand Vacation or this property...I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE!!!", "title": "Wonderful Property", "user": "daisy20071960", "date": "April 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 104962424}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The staff is wonderful, starting with Joseph (who I bothered the week before we arrived, to ensure that he knew what type of room we wanted).

I always stay at Hilton Hotels when I go away. This was the only Hilton hotel were i would have second thoughts about staying there again. Firstly on arrival we were promptly allocated a double twin room rm number 1030. When we used the shower within our room the shower tray wasn't draining and was over flowing over tray. I reported this to reception desk and this was fixed promptly i have to say. Then we were invaded from the start with sugar ants that were crawling all over washroom and taps and within bedroom area. I promptly reported this to a male member of staff on main reception who was disinterested and stated he would send an engineer to have a look. The engineer arrived within the hour and said the guest prior to us must have brought them (sugar ants) into the room through their lugguage. He briefly sprayed lightly in wash room to remove ants. I am asthmatic and couldnt tolerate the smell of spray throughout room. Two days later ants just kept getting worse in room and i had spoken to a different male member of reception staff and yet again no appology for inconvience caused and unhelpfull member of staff. I couldn't sleep well for the whole 10 nights we stayed within the Doubletree due to the ants within room area. I feel prior to our arrival the cleaning staff preparing the room for our arrival would have seen the large amount of ants crawling around the room and should have had the room treated properly prior to guests being allocated rm 1030. On depature i checked out at reception and a young female member of staff asked how we enjoted our stay and i explained my experience with reception staff when i reported i was unhappy with my room and this was quickly dismissed by them. Female member of reception staff who did deal with my checkout was very polite and stated she was sorry to hear of my feedback and offered us both complimentary breakfast which we both declined as we were checking out and had airport transport arranged. Reception staff should have dealt with my concerns prior to my departure and should have moved us rooms instead of dismissing me at reception when reporting my concerns regarding the condition of our room.
