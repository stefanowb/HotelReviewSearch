The corridors were old and worn; the elevator small and inconveniently placed. We came with lots of luggage, and had to enter and exit through the restaurant with luggage cart due to steps inconveniently placed in the lobby. Pushing the cart up narrow, long ramps to get to the elevator was more exercise than I was looking for, and maneuvering past the pop and ice machines to get into the elevator with the cart was another inconvenience. Although downtown St John's is enchanting, the area that this hotel is located in is anytown, ugly North America. Would recommend staying here only if you have a car and very little luggage. Most of the lobby staff were adequate only or less than adequate.

It is hard to fathom 1) how the Ramada outranks the Holiday Inn on Trip Advisor and 2) where the Ramada spent a couple of million dollars in a recent renovation. The Ramada is one very tired and outdated hotel. It also has some serious accessibility issues unless someone tells you that you can bring your luggage through the restaurant and into the hotel (!) But if you do, you are at the very opposite end of the building to take the scary elevator that creaks and groans. The elevator fits 4 people but our family decided against taking it for the most part, but when we did, we decided not to travel in it together to allow other family members to get help if required! The fitness area is a makeshift extra room where they could not even find the time to take the headboards off of the walls.
