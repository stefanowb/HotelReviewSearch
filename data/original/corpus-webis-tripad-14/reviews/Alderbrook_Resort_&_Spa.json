The resort is right on the Hood Canal with lots of beach access. There are kayaks to rent or you can cruise the canal on the Lady Alderbrook. The indoor pool is huge, and is bright and cheery. We had a room with 2 queen beds in the lodge. It was on the smaller side, but still large enough for two adults and two kids. One of the kids was able to sleep on the large window seat. Our room also had a balcony with a lovely view of the water. There was a huge soaking tub in the bathroom. The walls were somewhat thin and we were able to hear our neighbors on more than one occasion. The lobby had lots of comfortable seating with a huge fireplace. Our children enjoyed access to the DVD library and the chess board in the lobby, but by far their favorite thing (aside from the pool) was petting the resort's resident cats, Alder and Brook. My only complaint has to do with food. It was way over priced. There was a main restaurant as well as a \"patio\" that is open seasonally. Twice we ordered room service from the main restaurant. Delivery was prompt, but the food was too expensive for what it was. (The room service prices were the same as the restaurant prices.) We ordered lunch on the patio once. While the prices were slightly more reasonable (particularly the kids' meals) the service left something to be desired. After waiting forty minutes for our food, we were forced to gulp down our meal in order to make it to our cruise on the Lady Alderbrook. It's as if the resort knows that there really aren't any other great dining options in the area so they're free to charge whatever they wish for mediocre food and mediocre service.

While the location is idyllic, the restaurant was a huge disappointment. We were seated for dinner at 6:30PM and ordered fairly quickly as I had both my children with us. The service was excellent and my initial impressions were positive. The appetizers arrived in a reasonable time, however, the clams were swimming in a broth that was so salty I needed to drink water after each bite. The crab cakes were good. The next 1.2 hours proved to be the most frustrating. It took well over 1 hour from the time we finished our appetizers to the time dinner was finally served, We were repeatedly told that it would be just a few more minutes. When dinner finally arrived I would say most dishes, there were 6 of us, were good but not great. My son's ravioli was overcooked and bland. The other dishes were just OK. When you are spending in the neighborhood of $30-$40 for an entree you expect an excellent dinner. The host did apologize for the slow service telling us that it was an unusually busy night coupled with a new kitchen staff.
