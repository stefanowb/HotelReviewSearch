People standing in the check in line with huge rolling coolers. And the noise level was incredible. Back to the Saint Claire - friendly, extremely helpful staff especially the front desk manager. He couldn't do enough for us. He provided a list of free DVDs (great selection and lots of current releases) to check out. He helped us get some sodas and snacks without having to call room service, and when we checked out, he even gave us a package of nuts as a parting gift which was so sweet of him. We felt so special. The rooms are comfortable with a flat screen tv, DVD player, wifi, comfortable beds and a window that you could open and enjoy fresh air. The bathroom had a painted sky with stars painted on the ceiling. We enjoyed the elegant lobby and sitting room with the big comfy chairs and sofas. And most of all, in spite of a wedding taking place in the ballroom, we enjoyed the quiet. It was so relaxing. Christmas in the Park is situated right across the street and we had fun walking around the various displays. The movie theaters are very close and we enjoyed the walk.

Parking is free at the city lots after 6pm and all day on the weekends, so we used that parking instead of the valet service. We felt safe leaving the car; as the lots near the hotel are nearly always full and there is plenty of activity going at all hours. The check-in was quick and easy. Since I had booked a special package deal directly at Hyatt's Website, I was told I had $30 in food and beverage credit at the Il Fornaio restaurant as well as a bottle of champaign to be delivered. The front desk set up my dinner reservations right away, scheduled a delivery time for the chilled champaign, and gave us a great room on the top floor looking out at the towering Marriott and the convention center. After looking at the Marriott's hotel highrise, we knew that we had made the right decison to go with the Sainte Claire and its unique personality. Our room was not standard, as we had an oversized room with a great big fireplace. Since it was a nice weekend, a fire was not used, but the grand setting of a huge fireplace in the room was very romantic. The ceilings were high with crown moldings and lots of little touches adorned the walls like various photographs and artwork in different styles of frames. The 19\" televison is small; perhaps that would be my only complaint, since there was easily room for a 25\" or 27\" model. The bed was very comfy, with triple sheeting and a feather bed. The bath area was very clean with wonderful old tile work, a beautiful teak vanity, and an inset ceiling light that was painted to look like a skylight with birds flying above. The water pressure was more than adequate and the water temperature was perfect. I'm not sure what may have caused other reviewers to have problems, but we did not encounter any. I had never stayed at this hotel before, and am only a Hyatt Platinum member, but I was treated very well, with the staff I encountered remembering my name and always asking how my stay was going. Dinner at the Il Fornaio restaurant was excellent, and was a great way to end a day of sightseeing. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who likes things a bit different. Yes, you can hear the street noise below, and yes, you may even hear some noise occasionally from the hallways, but this is part of being in a old hotel in a city setting. I actually enjoy a bit of city noise every now and then. This is a very nicely renovated historic building with wonderful architecture and a lot of history.
