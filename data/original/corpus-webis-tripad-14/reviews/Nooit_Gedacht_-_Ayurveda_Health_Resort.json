My room was lovely with a patio overlooking the waterlily garden and in a newer block beside the swimming pool, Approaching it however, I wondered if I had been downgraded as the grounds behind the pool (and also in front of our walkway) were overgrown and looked a bit neglected. The other rooms looked as delightful but for less cost, the size is smaller. The airconditioner worked well and quietly (something always worth checking if noise and heat is an issue to get to sleep). Only problem were the dogs barking at night. The walk to the beach was hot and noisy via the main road (10 minutes) as the pathway is too overgrown and takes time to negotiate. Cafes on the beach are good but are accessed beside shops or guesthouses and are difficult to find until you know which one leads to where. The beach was alot smaller than I had remember (since the Psunami) and the surf too strong for me to swim - July is the end of the monsoon season. The meals at the hotel were better than at the beach so we opted for eating here almost every night in a magnificent setting.

The staff were friendly, the room was modern, clean and had a small balcony at the back which gives a view to the forest. It's very quiet and green around the resort. Lunch and dinner is available a la carte at reasonable prices.No alcohol is served, so you might find the alcohol shop down the street useful. Although it is not right next to the beach, it is only 3-4 minutes of walking from the resort. As for negative points, I felt the breakfast variety could be improved, since it is a bed/breakfast place. There are two swimming pools and Ayurveda services(for a fee). If you are thinking about getting dinner from the resort, you will have to place your order by 6pm. If you are a late eater, good luck as there are no restaurants around the area and most shops close by 9:30pm-10:00pm. Overall, we found the place nice, and we enjoyed our stay in Unawatuna.
