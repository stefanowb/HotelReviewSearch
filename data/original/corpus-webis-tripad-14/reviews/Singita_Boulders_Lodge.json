I think you could probably stay in your impossibly beautiful private cottage the whole time and be happy. The cottages are huge, 2 bathrooms, a bathtub, an indoor and outdoor shower, a private pool, fireplace, fabulous furniture, great complimentary toiletries (Dermologica). The game drives were great here too, we saw lion cubs, hyena cubs, leopard cubs, a pack of male lions who roared to each other while surrounding our vehicle which was amazing. The food is very good with both buffet and plated meals which is nice because some other places are all buffet which gets tiring even if the buffet is high quality. Although the food was good the thing that was really special here was the wine program. They have their own sommelier and he offers free wine tastings if you let him know a little bit ahead of time. This isn't really what you might think of when you think of free wine tasting, this is a professional fully opening his amazingly stocked cellar and sharing with you his knowledge of south african wines. I learned a lot and was able to use some of this knowledge on the rest of my trip. This was really special and the highlight of our stay, aside from the animal sightings. The only negative thing I would say is that the service is a little overly fawning at times which I find grating, and even though they say it is relaxed I found the atmosphere it a bit more formal than I would care for.", "user": "oscarfelix", "date": "November 15, 2008", "id": 21868722}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Luxury in Sabi Sands", "text": "Cannot compare to any place we have ever been.

The experience was beyond incredible- from arrival to departure. Every staff member went out of his/her way to ensure our stay was in line with the true Singita experience. (Exs: our camera broke after we came back from the first safari drive- under idle threats of divorce- my husband explained the situation to the staff and we were given a digital slr camera to use for the rest of our stay- no questions asked. We missed our opportunity to sign up for a wine tasting in the cellar- which is a beautiful sight in and of itself- and upon our return from afternoon safari we were assured there was room for us. We got to share fantastic South African wines with Singita's owner Luke Bailes.

There are books, sketch pads, and paints if you feel inspired by the surroundings. The fireplace was lit each night when we got home from dinner, the plunge pool was a bit cold but so refreshing, there were elephants roaming several hundred feet from our deck, there were impalas and kudu grazing directly off our deck. The feeling and sounds that come with taking advantage of the two outdoor showers were indescribable. Each guest is also provided with an endless supply of wines, other beverages and snacks. The bed is super cozy and outfitted with a mosquito net (that was never needed but still comforting to have).

We stayed at Ebony for 3 nights & then they packed up our bags for us & we stayed at Boulder for 2 nights. We preferred Ebony as it is more traditional British Colonial & Boulders was more modern, with one whole wall being pure glass.
