We paid $185 euro per night for a superior double room facing the courtyard. Though the room is small, as most rooms in this price range are in Paris, it was quite clean and the location was great. It's located on a very quaint street with boutiques, restaurants, pubs and creperies. On a side note, there is a wonderful little Italian pizza place across the street from the hotel (Pizza Positano) that serves authentic Neapolitan pizza nd pasta. Delicious! We ate there twice. Good shopping in the surrounding areas and walking distance to many key sights.

My girlfriend and I went together for the first time in August of 2006 and stayed for 6 nights. It was truly a wonderful experience. Our room was facing the courtyard area, which we requested so that we wouldn't have to deal with any street noise. Turns out that the street it's on, Rue des Canettes, is tiny and very quiet. They have a small bar/restaurant that has about 6 tables and is very cute and efficient. The room was on the small side, but totally functional and very comfortable: small flat-screen cable TV hanging on the wall, two big French door windows, hair dryer installed in the bathroom wall. The hotel is immaculately well-kept and the staff was very friendly and happy to help us with directions or making restaurant reservations for us. It is in the midst of a great neighborhood for shops and cafes around St. Germain-des-Pres.
