Yes, the bungalows are quite small but you do not visit this part of the world to spend all day inside!! Ours was clean, comfortable and most important, air-conditioned. The pool was a welcome relief from the heat and the grounds peaceful and relaxing. Breakfast (optional) was a tasty treat of local goodies and provided a healthy start to the day. Sue, the owner, provided us with some great tips and information on the local area and couldn't have been more helpful. Next door is the Butterfly Farm and Cafe which is a colourful and relaxed place for drinks and dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!", "title": "Breakfast?", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "kagriff4", "date": "June 19, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7936567}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 9, "very good": 20, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 36}, "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667, "description": "Rum Jungle Bungalows, peaceful and serene: it's simply gorgeous!
