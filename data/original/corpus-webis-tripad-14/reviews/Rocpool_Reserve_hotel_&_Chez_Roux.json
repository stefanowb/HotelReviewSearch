I did think it a bit odd but my steak came nicely pink in the middle and cooked exactly the way I liked it so I have no complaints! The service we received in the bar was always very good too.

As a treat we booked the \"extra decadent\" room, which we obtained for a very reasonable rate through booking a few months in advance via the hotel's website. The room most definitely lived up to it's billing as \"extra decadent\"! From literally the moment we arrived, the staff were there to greet us at the door and help us with our bags. The level of service was consistently high throughout our short stay. For example, my wife is allergic to feather pillows and duvets, with which the staff were happy assist by changing the bedding. The staff also brought us tea and coffee on arrival to the hotel. The extra decadent room comes with it's own outdoor hot tub (not overlooked by other rooms, in case you are a bit shy!). This was definitely worth paying for, for that extra touch of luxury! The indoor furnishings also do not disappoint, with a very large, comfy bed, a large flat screen TV and DVD player. One slight issue is that we didn't feel there was much room to dine in the room, but we were happy eating room service with a tray on our laps on the bed! It should be noted that there is space on the balcony for al fresco dining, but it was a bit too cold for this in November. Breakfast can also be delivered to your room at no extra cost, along with a morning paper. The cooked breakfast was superb, not too heavy to eat. The bathroom is also very well equipped with a large bath and monsoon shower. One slight issue is that the bathroom door was glass. I don't want to seem overly prudish, but we found this a bit uncomfortable, especially not sure what we would have done if the hotel staff had knocked on the door while one of us was using the loo! Location wise, the hotel is again superb, being about 5 minutes walk from the centre of Inverness. It is close to a main road, but as our room was round the back of the hotel we didn't hear a thing. Overall, a superb experience that I would recommend to anyone looking for a special treat or something that little more extravagant.", "title": "Luxurious hotel ideal for a special break", "user": "JediMickey", "date": "December 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 88996309}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Rocpool Reserve for two nights in the Fall of 2010.

The first time we stayed was pre - Chez Roux days and the ownership was local as opposed to the current owners in Inverlochy Castle. Our first stay was actually very very good culminating in one of the best breakfasts I have ever eaten being enjoyed in our room. However, the experience now has gone to a new level. The service level is superb without being 'in your face' - it is very subtly provided but you know that should there be any requirement whatsoever, it will be fulfilled, however small or big. I would regard the service level as being an informal butler type arrangement - a member of staff is allocated to look after you to enable you to build up a personal relationship with them and from that you build a rapport. This is overseen by a Manager or should I say Team Leader because make no mistake, this is a team effort as regards service. Our particular Manager / Team Leader was a very pleasant and effective individual who made you comfortable from when first entering the building and you instinctively knew you would be very well looked after. The Suite we stayed in was Room 3, a spacious and well designed living quarters with everything you could ask for provided. Wonderful shower which is what I normally judge a Hotel on (yes, quality of shower!!) and a sumptious bath for my partner to relax in which is her thing. We dined in Chez Roux on our two evenings spent at Rocpool Reserve. I had only ever had lunch there before so I knew roughly what to expect which I should add is outstanding. We were not disappointed. This is French Cuisine incorporating fantastic local produce delivered with flair and imagination. On one evening, I had one of the 'Specials' which was a Tagliatelle based dish with lobster and other assorted seafood. Quite delicious with the Tagliatelle cooked to absolute perfection. What's more, the Head Chef visited our table after our meal to get our feedback on our Dining Experience. A nice and essential exercise as regards continuous improvement. Breakfast was superb with a choice that was so extensive that it made choosing quite difficult but enjoyable at the same time. So, all in all, a wonderful holistic experience and one that makes a return visit compelling when the opportunity presents itself. And no, I've not been paid to write this or have I or will I receive preferential rates in the future!!!!!!!
