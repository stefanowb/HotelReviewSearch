On trying to buy the passes it started to become clear something was very wrong at this resort, the member of staff on duty did not seem to have much clue about what was going on or how to go about processing simple credit card transactions. We also started to get the low down on the fact business was bad and the lodge / restaurant was now out of business except for weddings and that the manager may or may not be around that week as she had been off for some time. Once we had paid up and then got to look up close at the facilities it was clear they were falling apart and even with the hard efforts of the maintenance staff they were struggling to hold it together. Throughout the week during the day, very few people who are either local residents or staff come along from time to time to use the outdoor pool but it is very quiet, so even though it was not the best quality it was actually fairly pleasant to have a quite pool and sun lounger. The strangest thing however was they clearly have a problem on an evening particularly with people trying to use the pool for free, and this lead to a couple of local members asking us who we were and had we paid as they were concerned the place would soon close down. I did not mind the polite locals asking and they were happy that we had chosen to use the facility. However there was one incident which is why I am only giving the score of 2 - a very rude member of the real estate staff was incredibly rude to us and particularly to my good friend who I was traveling with, she basically started yelling through the glass doors as soon as we arrived, did not introduce her self at all well as staff and basically made us feel like we were free loaders who should not be there. Even after explaining we had paid and were just looking to enjoy the pool she carried on stating they were doing us some kind of favour allowing us to pay 75 dollars each for 5 days use of these very warn facilities. I could not believe a supposed manager who was yelling at us in her swim suit would be so rude, no wonder no one wants to come pay to use the facility if that is the level of customer service you can expect. Just also to note we did e-mail the staff member and her management to complain and suggest some re-training was required but they never bothered to reply - my advice probably go somewhere else which is a shame, as it could be so much better.", "title": "Only bought access to the facilities for the week - past it's best", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jb812", "date": "August 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 170349128}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in a beautiful house called forest preserve 4.
