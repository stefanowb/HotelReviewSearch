Cottages are native style and I guess basic, but the owner has made nice touches like air fresheners in rooms and bathrooms. Very clean rooms and good modern fans. There was no hot water, not that you'd need it. Bottled water is provided in the room and a water cooler outside to top up when you require. Gorgeous little balcony with seat outside and space to dry your clothes. Just off the beach. Food in the restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced. The bar also runs happy hour promotions at different times on different drinks. Staff are fantastic and can organise day trips, transfers etc. they even organised someone to come and cut my hair for a very reasonable price! The bar is quite lively, but you will not be disturbed in your rooms. Nice and peaceful and set in little gardens with 24hr security. Really friendly, fun place to stay.
