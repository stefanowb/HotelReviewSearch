Well we were told about these apartments by our friends who go there every year. We arranged to meet several other families there all with teenagers. Unfortunately we arrived several days before they did and initially we were'nt impressed. We arrived in the early hours of the morning in total darkness. The taxi driver had to go and wake up Kostas' dad who seemed furious! He threw the door open with not a smile or a word of welcome and i was very upset by this. We entered the room which was gloomy and basic, on the verge of being shabby really and at that point I could've wept. It was 2 bedrroms both with single beds and a tiny dark kitchen with a table squashed in at one end next to a basic bathroom. The beds were VERY uncomfortable. The next day I asked to be moved but in August of course they were full. However no one asked what the problem was or came to explain that a move was impossible. The pools are lovely to look at but the main pool especially turns all your swim wear green. I was told this is not a problem. The yucky toilet bin was not emptied every single day, a few days were missed and our bin got full, not what you need to be worrying about on holiday, other than that our room was kept clean.", "title": "Mixed Feelings at first....", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tulip", "date": "August 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 38455076}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Anyway, we sulked and brooded for a few days until our friends arrived then we snapped out of it and had a truly fabulous time!

All of the resturant and bar staff are very welcoming as were the staff in the Solaris resort itself, who would often have a chat with us. Alongside this Solaris also has a wonderful, refreshing pool and benifits from being set back a bit from the road which means at night we weren't disturbed by bar/resturant nosie. Despite other reviews which comment about the toliet bins not being emptied regularly enough, we found this not to be the case and in fact found our room was cleaned almost every day.
