There were 10 of us in all including 4 children,we were shown to the Green room which was also very impressive, which had been booked many months before, a must as it seems to be very popular. We had a very nice young man attending to us for the majority of our time there. We had a set menu with three choices of starter, main and dessert which I consider a little limited but we all managed to choose something. We ordered all three courses at the begining, a little odd as one would normally peruse the dessert menu upon completion of the main but not a problem to us. There was a slight mix up with the wine as we had ordered a sparkling wine to come first so we could make a toast being a celebration but the other wines came first, very quickly sorted out though. We all enjoyed our food without feeling too rushed. At the end of the meal we had arranged a birthday cake to be brought in which was a great surprise to my mother whose birthday it was. We enjoyed this with plentiful cafetiers of coffee. After this we all decided we needed a little fresh air so we headed outside and looked around the gardens, kitchen garden and animal enclosures which the children thought was great. All in all we all we had a great afternoon at The Pig, even though it is a tad on the expensive side it is worth it for the quality of the food and the service.

Oh yes, and for some bizarre reason they give you what they describe as an extra large towel to share between 2 - looked like a normal bath towel to us - 2 people need 2 towels please! Service too pushy / overly attentive - there is a balance between being ignored and smothering your guests. The staff appeared to be too busy trying to follow a process and push you through the restaurant rather than delivering a personal service - and at times they simply did not listen e.g. on the second night having been pushed through on the first night we asked not to be asked to our table until the food was ready ... completely ignored. However on the up side, the food on the whole was very good, great kitchen garden, non-alcholic cocktails were delicious and the setting was lovely.

This time, we went for mine and spent the night there after a delicious dinner, leaving after an equally good breakfast. We had a courtyard room which is described as \"comfy deluxe\" so I expected a small room. I was therefore delighted to discover it was nothing of the sort! The bedroom area had a desk, fireplace, large comfy bed (although a bit creaky, like the floorboards!), cabinet containing a mini bar and Nespresso coffee machine and of course a television. This led through to a dressing area with a large wardrobe and chest of drawers. The bathroom was really big with \"his and hers\" sinks, large shower and free standing bath. Very comfortable with everything one would need. As the weather was so lovely, we ate outside on the terrace and as before, the staff were very attentive and friendly. After dinner, we sat in the back courtyard where there was a log fire and heaters in the biggest umbrella I have ever seen! Overall, this is a great place to go for a mini break with a comfortable room, good service and fantastic food. I have given 4 out of 5 merely because there is always room for improvement and in this case my only small niggle would be that it would be good to have reading lights by the bed that don't disturb your partner.
