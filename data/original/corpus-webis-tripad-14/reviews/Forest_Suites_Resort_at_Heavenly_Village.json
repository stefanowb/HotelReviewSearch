The suite consisted of 2 queen beds, with one of the rooms also having a twin bed. There was also a sofa bed in the living room. The suite comfortable housed us and the kids. The bathrooms were a bit dated. The service in the hotel was great as were the activities for the kids (roasting marshmallows, crafts in the morning, etc.). We happened to check in at the time of the wine/cheese party, so that was a nice greeting. Breakfast consisted of coffee, juices, cereals, bagels, eggs (powdered?), bacon and potatoes. While a bit busy, there were plenty of places to sit for our family of 5. They have a \"green\" program which lets you receive a bottle of wine or snack package in lieu of housekeeping. I'm not sure how this is green as opposed to labor cost savings, but we did not mind as we don't swap out linens/towels during our stays. The hotel is located right behind Heavenly Village, so its in walking distance to the bars/restaurants in the village as well as the casinos. The hotel staff recommended visits to local beaches and the Taylor Creek Visitor Center, both of which were hits the kids.

Originally we were supposed to go to Ireland but due to work related reasons we decided to stay closer to home (Reno). Upon arrival I didn't quite know what to think. The property looked a bit worn on the outside but I quickly changed my mind when my husband showed me to our room, a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen and rustic cabin decor. The room was spotless. It was so clean and comfortable I could totally see a family spending a week here on there ski vacation. A nice perk was a free bottle of wine for not needing to have our room cleaned one day. It is the perfect property for families because the hotel has arranged fun activities for every age. We enjoyed the wine and cheese social in the evening and the breakfast in the morning. We also enjoyed the pool and spa. I would like to come back and bring our son so he could take part in the arts and crafts activities the hotel offers, pony rides, ice cream socials, and evening story time and marshmallow roast around the campfire. There is also a fitness center on site, massage therapy available, family movie nights and fitness classes during certain times of the week.

A cookie sheet in the oven was great for reheating pizza from Blue Dog Gourmet Pizza across the street to crispy perfection. Entire staff was friendly, helpful and welcoming. Suggessted breakfast buffet before 8 to avoid big crowds. Very few people, mounds of piping hot items and good selection of cold as well. Really liked the option of just clean towels and trash emptied in exchange for a gift - chose the movie package: 2 sodas, microwave popcorn, chocolate bar and bag of candy.
