Didn't get much sleep that night! The breakfast went down hill too. We paid $125 usd so the price was good for Amsterdam but I wouldn't stay there again. I like the location. There are a few other hotels in the same square I will try next visit.

They were apparently having unseasonably warm weather in Amsterdam the two days that we were in town, and it was unfortunate that the window in our hotel room only opened a couple of inches. The room location was on the side of the building and faced other buildings with balconies, and at night, and into the early morning, people would sit on the balconies and talk rather loudly. As if the heat didn't make it difficult to sleep, the constant voices was very distracting. (Try to request a room in the front of the hotel, if possible.) However, this hotel is in a very convenient location. A very short walk to the Rembrandtplein tram stop and within walking distance of many restaurants and bars. The room is very basic, but if you're not too picky, the price is right. We didn't spend much time in the room anyway so it wasn't that big a deal. The bathroom was clean and modern. The staff was fairly helpful. Overall, not a terrible experience, and if it weren't so hot, which isn't normal anyway, it would probably have been very enjoyable.", "title": "Very basic hotel for good price.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "jmffl", "date": "June 15, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3555519}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Prison cell at Eden Hotel", "text": "If you plan to get a museum pass when you arrive, there is a place in the Central Station that sells them.

Our rooms had all the charm of a prison cell. The carpet was stained, the bathroom tile grout was dirty and the formica table top was chipped. The complex system of elevators and labyrinth of hallways was very confusing. The only good thing I can say is that the bed was okay. We were there during the Queen's Day celebration, and the music was so loud that we did not sleep at all that night. Even my friend with the major earplugs couldn't sleep. It sounded like we had loud speakers in our rooms. The best thing I can say about this hotel was that it was inexpensive compared to other Amsterdam hotels. At 110 euros per night, it was still a bad deal. And the pictures looked great on line!
