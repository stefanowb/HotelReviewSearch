Staff fantastic. For a 3 star I was thrilled- I am usually a 5 star tossed but wanted to stay somewhere a little quirky for my daughter. Not suitable for older people as you have to lug your cases up the stairs - no porter etc. The concierges were a one woman/man miracle. Would have loved room service. As a 50 year old the location was a bit full on and busy - if I could have picked the hotel up and move it 3 blocks back into a quiet street I would give it 100%:)", "title": "My favorite hotel of all- just a shame about the noisy location.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Spreadthelove", "date": "July 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 115358700}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel was perfectly located!!!!

Room was fine, funky decoration which we thought was really cool but a fridge and kettle would have been good. Probably not a good hotel if you can't carry your bags as the lobby is up a flight of stairs from the street. Reason for only three stars is that on our last night there was loud banging below us from ten until eleven-thirty and smoke rising through the floor, followed by a really unpleasant smell of chemicals - went down to reception and found them welding one of the beams in the ceiling below us. Our complaint was met with a \"sorry, but we had to do it\" - it should have been done in the daytime, or we should have been warned and offered a move to another room.
