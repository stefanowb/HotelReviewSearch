So glad we chose the Best Western Ptarmigan at Dillon because it turned out to be the best hotel we stayed at during a week-long trip in Colorado. Unlike several Grand Lake hotels that are pricier or did not include breakfast or are not that close to the lake, the Best Western Ptarmigan has very good off-season rates, includes breakfast and is in a great location right by Dillon lake in a nice area of town. The grounds are nicely landscaped and the lake view is beautiful and peaceful. The room is clean and tastefully decorated, and the bathroom is nice and spacious. There was a refrigerator and microwave in the room. For dinner we dined at the Arapahoe Cafe and Pub next door (check for nightly specials served in the downstairs pub). The hotel served a hot breakfast in the morning with scrambled eggs & sausage, hard-boiled eggs, waffles as well as pastries, cereal, juices and fruit. After breakfast we took a stroll along the lake. The whole experience was so nice we wished we could stay another night! Would definitely stay here again if we are ever in the area.", "title": "Very enjoyable stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sarah4nil", "date": "October 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 81989904}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled solo", "text": "I drove to Dillon with no hotel reservation and this was the only hotel I could find by the lake.

The only complaint I have (not the hotel's fault but could have advised us, possibly moved us to another room) was that there was some sort of \"car testing\" going on in the parking lot ALL night long outside our room, starting up of engines, loud talking and this kept our pets barking and kept us up as well. The front desk advised we should have called them, rightfully so however very disruptive. After they all check out the next day, our stay was restful and relaxing. Complimentary breakfast was great, go early cuz it gets really busy in a small area. Hot and cold items, nice selection.
