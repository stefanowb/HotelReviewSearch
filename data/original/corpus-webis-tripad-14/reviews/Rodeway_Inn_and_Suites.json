Also the light in the bathroom didn't work. Secondly, the flimsy bed the had had no support and the bedding keep coming off the mattrees as I sleep. Finally, the heater was a joke.

We had a suite, which I think might have been an old apartment building. Floor was old. Furniture was old but comfy. Bathroom was tiny and smelled mildewy at times. The bedroom was big and the window overlooked a trailer park. Both TVs worked but only one remote did. There was a micro/fridge with leftover milk and juice from the people before us. The room was kept pretty clean and decent. There was an outlet for a dryer. Pool was kept up nice, we didn't go in it because it was too cold, but it looked good enough. VERY friendly staff. Loved everyone I talked to. Parking was weird, the building we stayed in had parking on the other side of it, the side facing the trailer park, and there's only one way in and out of the motel so if someone's coming in you might as well have to back up until they drive past the lobby, then you can get out. Location was decent, close to alot of fast food. It took about 15 minutes to get to Manitou/Cascade area.
