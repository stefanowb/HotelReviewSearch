There were ground level suites for disabled patrons. My shower didn't have a shower chair in it as it was supposed to, so the staff immediately went out and purchased one since they were unable to quickly locate it. Very nice part of town in a business park so during the workday it could get a little busy, but after work hours it was nice and quiet. Within 1/2 mile of the Light Rail station at Dry Creek and it took me right to Mile High Stadium. It was more convenient than staying at this hotel's downtown location (though that is equally nice) because of the Light Rail station being so close. The staff were courteous and it was also nice to be able to print my boarding pass at the courtesy computer in the lobby. Now that I've been there I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else while in the Denver area.

That's why we decide to choose this hotel not easy to find if you arrive from Germany for the first time in denver and have to find it with your rental car on a dark evening. But with the help of google maps we tired but happy arrived at 10p.m. But then a nightmare happened. The young girl at the reception didn't know anything of the booking and couldn't find our confirmed reservation. The manager wasn't there and couldn't be called to find a solution. So the young girl only offered us a room for the regular high price or to leave the hotel in the night. The regular price was about 3 to 4 times higher then the super 24hour offer and for this price we easily could stay at an airport hotel. As it was so late we decided to stay and told her that we wanted to talk to the manger the next morning. The room we were given was not that we had ordered - a quiet room away from hallway. It was just the first room next to the reception and the fitness room with loud television (as nobody was in there in the evening, we switched the tv and the light off). The room was a little dated, especially the kitchen. For a special rate it would have been OK, but for the high rate it was a joke. In the night we send an email to Germany where there was already the next morning and we got an answer that they would inform the hotel about our confirmed booking. Then we went to bed for a short night as the fitness area was loud again in the morning. When we went to the reception to ask for the manager there was an other woman (some older then the girl from the evening) and she said, the super offer we had booked was really cheap but they wouldn't charge us more from the credit card - not the high price the girl offered us the evening before. After returning home 3 weeks later we saw that this was true. so after all it was only a horrible start of our visit in the United States but at least not an expensive one. We think the hotel management should learn from this. For an english speaking person from the US a not booked hotel is quite an awful experience, but to give an foreign guest not familiar with the language and the rights as tourist only the alternative to accept the highest price for a dated room or to leave the hotel late in the night is really a nightmare.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "toby4484", "date": "January 24, 2011", "id": 94296010}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010", "text": "Fortunately this was the worst experience of our holidays what after this start was quite nice.

The room looked very nice when we first walked it, everything was new and modern. There was a full kitchen and well supplied with everything needed to live there for awhile. The fridge was an apartment size unit as was the stove, very useable. One complaint with the fridge was that it was very load and rattled when it was running. Once we started settling into the room we started noticing little issues. There wasn't really anywhere for the TV, it was pushed up against a wall and was completely unwatchable from the bed, I had to pull the stand away from the wall almost a foot to turn the TV enough that we could see it from the bed, then it was in the walkway making it difficult to sneak around to go to the kitchen or bathroom. The bathroom had not been completely cleaned, don't know if it was started or not? There was a well used bar of soap on the sink ledge, and I'm sure the sink hadn't been cleaned if the used soap wasn't moved. I informed the front desk about the bathroom and the loud fridge, they assured me they would get it fixed up right away. Half an hour later I was told there was nothing they could do about the fridge and the hotel was full so another room was not an option. We went out for dinner returning 2 1/2 hours later and the bathromm still had not been tended to. Sleep quality was so-so, the room was right next to an exit and the fire door was slamming steady for a good part of the night.
