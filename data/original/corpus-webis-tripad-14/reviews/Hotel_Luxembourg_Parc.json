It had offered CDG airport to hotel transportation for 120euros that was to be paid directly to the hotel at the time of the booking. I thought it was quite on expensive, but we were arriving in Paris very late at night and did not mind paying extra for the peace of mind. The driver met us right at the gate and drove us to the hotel w no problem. When we arrived, my husband stayed behind to help the driver unload the suitcases and I preceded to check in and head to our room first. Then the hotel receptionist halted me to say that I needed to pay the driver directly. I showed him the email I had gotten from his hotel saying that my card was debited for both the room plus the 120E for the transportation but he insisted that they never charge for the transportation. I just figured I can always check my credit card statement later to figure all that out and took out my credit card to pay the driver. Then my husband comes in with the driver and tells me that he told my husband that we owed him 60E for the ride. There's four of us looking at each other, then there was a brief conversation between the driver and the receptionist in French and the driver ran 120E on our credit card instead of 60E. If I wasn't so tired and totally jet legged, I would've insisted that we only should pay 60E instead of griping about it this morning on trip advisor. I did some research this morning on how much it costs on average to get into the city from CDG, it's about 50E if you take the regular taxi.
