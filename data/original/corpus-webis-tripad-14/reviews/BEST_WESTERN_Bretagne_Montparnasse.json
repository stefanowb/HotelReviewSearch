Great rooms (they are small, but all hotel rooms are small in Europe), the bathrooms are nice, and the staff is friendly. We really enjoyed the breakfasts. It's in a nice area in Paris and close to the subway. Avoid booking a boat tour along the Seine through the hotel. They offer it at the front desk, but you will pay an arm and a leg for it. Take yourself down to the river, and visit one of the boat places directly. The hotel quoted us around 60 euro a person for the boat ride; my husband and I went to one of the places on the river to book a ride and ended up paying 7 euro a person. Otherwise, this is a great hotel and I highly recommend it, especially for budget travellers who don't want to sacrifice quality and service.", "title": "Loved this Hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "maminshe", "date": "July 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5503136, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The friendly staff--they went out of their way to accomodate us.", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "We spent 3 nights at this hotel in March 2006, and found it to be decent for the money. It is 2 blocks up from the Pernety Metro in a quiet residential area. The breakfast is 10 Euro each, but if you make a sandwich to take away for lunch or a snack, that helps offset the cost a bit. Yes, the rooms are small, but most in Europe (at the price range of $100 per night)are going to be. One drawback is that the lights in the halls go out automatically so you have to open your door into a dark hall to turn the light on. The Air France bus drops at Gare Montparnasse, just 3 blocks away, so getting to and from the airport is very easy.

The three reservation desk clerks we came in contact with pretty much had the same attitude. They even found it a hassle when we asked were the nearest metro was. We also had one occasion where we stayed until 10am in our room because we had a late start that morning and the housekeeper knocked in our door and expected to get in the room and clean it.
