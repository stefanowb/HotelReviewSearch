We stay there when we go to Ft Lauderdale. This is our second stay at Vacation Village at Parkway in Kissimmee. Our first stay was so enjoyable that we decided to stay at Parkway on this vacation. Each time it has been Great. Check in was very fast with no problems each time we have stayed. The Staff is very friendly and extermely helpful. On this trip we had units in the new section. As in the older units, the new units are very clean and spacious. The only minor problem was that the units we stayed in faced interstate 4, and you could hear the traffic noise. After park hopping all day the noise don't bother you. Some reviewers complained about pressure from the sales staff, however if you don't go there looking for free meals you will not have any problems. No one pressured me at anytime to attend any sale talks. This is an excellent resort to stay in. I will stay again whenever I am in the Orlando Area.", "title": "Excellent Resort, I LOVE IT.", "user": "prfretscpo", "date": "September 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 77901930}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "When we checked into the resort, we were asked whether we wanted to attend one of the seminars where they would \u201csell\u201d us timeshare. We were told that all we needed to do was have a breakfast, then we would be given a tour of the new timeshare facility and that would be it and they would give us $100 for doing this. We reluctantly agreed to this. On the morning of the breakfast, we arrived at the facility for our breakfast and tour of the facility. We were completely shocked to learn that we had to be driven in the \u201csalesman\u2019s\u201d car to the restaurant where we would have to eat breakfast with him. We had just met this person and now we had to sit and eat breakfast with him. My 7 year old daughter was with us and the man proceeded to tell us that he used to be an alcoholic and a drug addict as well as was on his 5th wife. I was totally outraged. He then proceeded to take us on a tour of the area which we did not want. Finally after the tour and wasting 2 hours of our vacation, we returned to the facility. I then advised the salesman that we could not waste anymore time as we needed to return to our room as a relative was visiting us. The salesman started interrogating me as to who was visiting me and where did they live. Finally, I said that we wanted to leave and were not interested in buying timeshare.
