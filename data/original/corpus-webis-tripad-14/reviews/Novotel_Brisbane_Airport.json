When we told the check in clerk that my husband had had an accident whilst in Qld she arranged for a complimentary bottle of bubbly to be sent to our room. We had room service for dinner. Food was great and service amazing. We had booked a suite which was large and extremely comfortable. Only small complaint was shower in bath. Very difficult getting in and out of with arm in sling, and would imagine it would be for elderly people as well. Double glazing on windows works well.

We expressed this might be fine getting there but could be problematic getting home, to which we were assured there will be 3 constant lines of taxis at the event. Unfortunately this was not the case. We had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes in the rain after the show had ended to get our cab.
