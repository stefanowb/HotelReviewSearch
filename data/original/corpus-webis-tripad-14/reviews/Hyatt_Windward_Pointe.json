Instead we didn't even make it out to the pool because of the mind numbing noise from bulldosers, jack hammers, tractors, and any other road construction machine you can think of. We couldn't even sit on our deck because of the noise. It started early morning and continued into mid evening. We did orginally ask if we could cancel our 2 night reservation but because we booked it through expedia we were pretty much tossed around in a circle and although the Hyatt admitted that there was in fact construction going on, since it is not on their property they didn't feel as if they should grant us our request with out charging us for one night. So we did stay. Again very nice hotel, wish they had an actual resturant and a fitness room, but if you are looking for quiet and relaxation I would avoid this hotel until they can tell you the road construction is complete.
