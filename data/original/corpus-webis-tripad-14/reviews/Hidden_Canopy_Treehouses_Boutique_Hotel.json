He has lived here his entire life and keeps tabs on where all the birds and animals are based on time of year and food sources.

We weren't sure about going on it, since we had to drive to the beach that afternoon, but are so glad we went. Jenn had her right hand man, Olmand, take us to a local coffee farmer who has a tiny farm (2 acres) that provides just enough income for a family of four. Olmand took us around the farm, explaining the myths of fair trade coffee, and exactly what goes into growing excellent coffee, and why the majority of what we get in the north is crap. He roasted coffee on a tiny old stove, showed us how coffee is left out to dry and how it is sorted from its shell, and then he and the farmer made us coffee from his beans! It was a fantastic tour. My friend and I are bursting with opinions on coffee now. And we bought bags and bags of the coffee for about $8/lb to give to family and friends.

The breakfast was simply the best we'd ever had while staying at a boutique hotel. At 4:30 every afternoon, wine was served with some sort of homemade snack. Delicious.
