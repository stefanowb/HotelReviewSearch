I found the hotel from the local free copy magazines' ad. After surveying the place I decided to move out from my other hotel. Very close to shopping area (Night Bazaar) and have all the facilities that a world class spa should have. Love the spa treatments there as their therapists have very good skills. Eventhough the price is a little higher but it is worth to try.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "ryota", "date": "December 23, 2006", "id": 6484942}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Chiang Mai"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 10, "very good": 66, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 229}, "aka": "Rarinjinda Wellness Hotel Chiang Mai", "slim_ranking": 0.0613496932515, "description": "Come into RarinJinda Wellness Spa Resort Chiang Mai, Thailand and experience entering a different world.
