We stayed in an oceanfront cabana, complete with outdoor shower. The grounds are lovely, the staff is professional and kind, the yoga was wonderful as were the instructors. I enjoyed my spa treatments and the food, while not out of this world, was good at every meal. We did the mbs package which was a great deal as we could eat from the buffet and/or the menu. While this is a place where yoga happens it did not have an overwhelming yoga vibe- there were all levels in the classes (both my neighbor and I are beginners). My favorite part? not wearing shoes for an entire week!!!

Thank goodness it's air-conditioned, because my latent claustrophobia would have kicked in. Not so relaxing. The Yoot-kene was a nice belly rub, and the Maya Clay massage was fun because you get to rinse off in the ocean (imagine the looks as I walked through the resort like a terracota soldier!).

The yoga was fantastic and I did every single class so I really made progress. The new manager (since 02/06) really hussled to make sure we were taken care of and we were very lucky as the place was not very full. We booked a beach front and I'm glad we spent the additional money since the rooms are larger and you can dress with your windows open since people aren't walking right in front of them. I thought the spa treatments were rather steep for Mexico (although I had 2 50 minute treatments included). An 80 min. deep tissue massage was $100 and I did not even get the full 80 minutes which I felt cheated on. The waiters are leisurely but I made friends with quite a few and if you're in a rush, you just need to remember the menu (it was the same all week for us) and order as soon as you sit down and also request the check. I did not mind the leisurely pace at night, but I wish there was a fast buffet at breakfast and lunch since although the dining room is quite pleasant, I would have rather been sitting on the beach. Actually, on my last day, I just requested lunch to go and lounged on the beach and ate it. If you want to take a walk, definitely walk on the beach since the road has a ton of trash on the side. The suggestions I have for MT is they need an Assistant Manager to handle with interacting with the guests and a buffet for breakfast and lunch (and more non-dairy/fish options for lunch). Also, you have to feel comfortable with the person you're rooming with since the toilet and shower are open to the sink area and over the wall to the bedroom, so you can't be shy with your bodily functions. Also, they didn't seem to be able to give us a separate bill so I ended up paying for quite a few of my roommates' drinks. Anyway, a really great vacation and a beautiful spot.
