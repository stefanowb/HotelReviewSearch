We even got into Cinderella's castle for breakfast (which you normally have to book months in advance). Check in was flawless, the staff was very attentive & we loved getting a quick bite before heading to the parks early. We'd return around 5:00 & have a nice 'snack' before eating a late dinner. They had soup every night, the BEST peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, vegetables, cheese & crackers. It was nice to come back for that afternoon break & then return for another round at the park later in the evening. We found our room very clean & quiet too. Our room overlooked Stormalong Bay (pool area) which closed at 9:00 p.m. and we could watch Epcot's fireworks from our balcony too. The transportation to all of the parks was very efficient & we had no problems at all. I also suggest if you have a young child to book the character breakfast at Cape May restaurant located at the Beach Club (which is attached to the Yacht Club) on your departure day. The breakfast was GREAT. They had really good food & you get to dine with Minnie, Goofy, Chip & Dale. We did several character breakfasts & this was the loudest but not unbearable.

At the time that we booked our vacation, a big decision was where we were going to stay. We read a lot of reviews, and from the reviews and talking to our travel agent (Yacht Club allows 5 to a room), we decided on the Yacht Club! It was one of the best decisions we made about our trip, and will stay again when we go back to Disney World. I don't know what other traveler's EXPECT when they go on vacation, but the hotel and rooms are very nice!!! For 5 people, we felt very comfortable. 2 queen beds and a day bed perfect for our 7 year old. They keep the hotel VERY clean, and are constantly keeping it that way! Our room was more than adequate and the maid service did an excellent job providing towels, and cleaning up the room each day. If you get the chance, take advantage of a day at the hotel. Our children insisted to skip an afternoon at Magic Kingdom to go back to the Yacht Club for a few hours to swim in their awecome beachside pool, and relax at the hotel. We are so glad we did. That was one of the best parts of our trip! Also, we recommend going to the \"Market\" at the Beach Club just next door for snacks and drinks for your room or to take along to the parks! We ate breakfast here almost every morning, and saved $$ because we decided NOT to take the dining plan. Also, the character restaurant at the Beach Club is well worth the money, but book as soon as you arrive as it fills up fast. We also recommend taking an evening to spend around the Boardwalk in the back of the Yacht and Beach Club Resorts. There is always a lot to see and do that is entertaining, and we highly recommend taking a family bike ride on one of the Boardwalks bikes for 4 or 5. We had more laughs with this then we did all week. The staff is very friendly, and we were welcomed \"home\" every day after a full day at the parks. What a nice way to end the day.

The pools are great for kids, however the hours the pools open in the morning could be earlier. It was nice that they provided buckets and shovels for the kids to play in the sand. The boat that provide transportation to the boardwalk, epcot, and MGM are an added bonus. The biggest complaint is the quality of food you receive for the amount you pay. For an example: My son (3) went to the character breakfast which was a buffett style. Cost $20 for myself and $12 for my son. We had scrabble eggs, bacon, and cereal. I never had bad scrabble eggs till I ate their. The food is bearly edible at all locations on the resort including the \"5 star\" steakhouse. By no means is the steakhouse 5 stars dont waste your money eating on the resort including the boardwalk. The only other complaint is that the rooms are small and the service of turn downs and cleaing your room was horrible. Some days they didnt show up till after 12 to clean your room. For example one day we called at 9 am to have someone clean our room why we went to Epcot we came back at noon it still was not done, we called the hotel manager an was told the crew was on lunch break. Having a 3 year old and 1 yr old with you you have to time your events around naps, lunch and to be out of the room so the crew has the space to clean. When I called an complained about the service the hotel manager bascailly said he would address it, no apology, no special threatment. For the price the hotel met my expectations however was expected to leave having them exceeded. I would go back to the hotel its much better then the other resorts I have stayed at through Disney. Also bring allot of singles as ever employee in the resort expect tips for even speaking to you it seemed and they let you know it. For example: My son was sick the first day we got their and my wife was with him in our room while I was out with our daugter. The luggage folks dropped off the luggage while my son was in the middle of being \"sick\" the guy that dropped the luggage off actually waited for my son to satop being sick so that the my wife could address him and give him his $5 tip. That was my biggest issue is that everyone their wanted a tip for ever little thing and let you know it. That needs to be addressed by Disney. You get exactly what you pay for with Disney now, no extra perks it seems no \"special threatment\" your simply another guest that dont make you feel \"special\"", "title": "Jan 2007 family of 4 stay", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "matttristan", "date": "January 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6710334, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, trasnportation", "disliked": "\u2014 tips, food, price"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We are a UK family who stayed at the Yacht Club over Thanksgiving.
