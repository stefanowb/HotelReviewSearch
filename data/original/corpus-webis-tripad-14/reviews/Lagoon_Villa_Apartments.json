The apartment is spacious, spotlessly clean, modern and well equipped. The garden and outdoor areas likewise. Tha local shop is only a minute's walk out of the back gate and the taxi rank for a lift into town just 2 minute's walk. Fi and Toby, the owners, are so friendly, helpful and welcoming-also Fi's parents who were helping out whilst we were there. All emails prior to our visit were replied to very promptly and booking very easy and straight forward. Transport for our transfers to and from Sharm airport to Dahab was arranged by Fi and could not be faulted and a reasonable price too. Fi and Toby are very knowledgable about the area and more than willing to give advice and help with arrangments for any excursions.", "title": "Fantastic Apartment!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HolidayHunter64", "date": "January 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 94217685}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with family", "text": "This is our 5th visit to Dahab this year and we love the place. It is so peaceful and laid back if a nice quiet holiday is what you are seeking, but there is also all the watersports on hand, if you wish, which Fi and Toby can help you with. There is nothing more relaxing than sitting in one of the restaurants along the sea front. \"Shams\" is our favourite restaurant where we have spent many an hour or 3 at a time just having a quiet drink then maybe a meal. The lads who work there are so friendly and never hassle you to hurry up and leave, even after 4 hours of being there just chatting with friends.The Egyptian people we have met are so friendly, pleasant and polite. Yes, they will ask you to come and have a look around their shop because that is their living, but a polite refusal, if you do not wish to browse, is all that is needed, to which is normally replied \"OK.

Toby and Fi were amazing, really friendly and especially helpful and supportive when we were stuck there a few extra days due to Volcano ash problems. I would recommend it for family with kids without hesitation. The garden is really safe for them to run around , the so called Jacuzzi is big enough to be used as a pool by them. The shop is only 100 meters away and has everything you might need (even nappies, wipes, baby milk and food). We used the beach at Panda Hotel every day. They charge 25LE per adult (nothing for kids) and the food in the cafe is great so we had lunch there everyday. The beach attendant was really friendly and played with our kids most of the time. We also let them use the playground at the next door Ibeya hotel where they made friends with other kids. Fi and Toby's recommendations for restaurants were all really good. All in all, we thought that Bedouins and Egyptians there were really chilled, loved kids and were very welcoming. Even shop keepers were friendly and not trying too hard to get us to their shop. Taxi drivers really friendly as well.

My girlfriend Andi and I found this gem of a place on the internet and it more than lived up to expectations. We had previously travelled together to Dahab and stayed in a number of the generic, German fiddly clad large hotel complexes, which whilst they do what they say on the can, offer little more than a convenient location and extremely overpriced water and beer. We stayed in the smaller of the two apartments (Seahorses I think) and this was exceptional. We had a double bed, and a back up single as a spare. This was not your typical backpacker Egyptian accommodation, more a western oasis situated just three or four minutes walk from the beech front. Walking in from the dusty street into the private enclosure you are greeted by green grass (imported from Cairo!), flora, fauna and an extremely friendly little kitten (unoriginaly named \"Puss\") and a sun heated jacuzzi/plunge pool which is fantastic for cooling yourself down in after a few minutes lying in the sun. All of this and a western style bathroom (we had two showers and a bath!) , a kitchen which was small but perfectly formed and functional and free wireless internet! If you want to save yourself money, there is a supermarket within 1 minutes walk of the apartments so you can cook, and also an off license (yes, in Egypt!) The beers and the water being a fraction of the price charged by the behemoth hotels on the front.", "title": "A remarkable oasis of beauty", "user": "windyadam", "date": "December 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 50646099}], "location": {"country": "Egypt", "region": "Red Sea and Sinai", "continent": "Africa"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 47}, "slim_ranking": 0.1, "description": "The Luxury Lagoon Villa Apartments offer brand new, modern, and unique self-catering accommodation minutes walk away from the main hotel area in the Lagoon.Relax in the secluded grassy gardens with outdoor Jacuzzi or on your private terrace.
