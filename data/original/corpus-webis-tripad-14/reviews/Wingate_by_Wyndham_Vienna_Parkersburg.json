Actually, it sits behind a strip shopping center and next to a Lowes. Obviously, being new, it is an extremely clean property with very nice appointments. Service was quite helpful and the pool area and exercise room were more than acceptable. Bathrooms were large and well lighted and quite frankly I cannot think of anything negative to say about this hotel. However, if you want a historic hotel experience, the Blennerhasset, in downtown Parkersburg is superior. Fine dining and Starbucks there too... but pricier than the Wingate.

It was everything I could ask for. The best part about this place was the location. It proved to be perfect for all my needs since it was located close to many restaurants, Walmart, the Vienna mall, etc. Facility wise, this place has what is expected such as a gym, a 24/7 coffee machine, a business center and a laundry facility. However, the treadmill in the gym was not in very good shape. The complimentary breakfast is satisfactory but it gets repetitious for long stays.
