Unni-Marie is one of the most accommodating hosts in the travel industry. Originally scheduled to arrive from Flam at 5pm, we decided to take the early ferry and arrived just before 8am. We only hoped to leave our bags and head out for the day, but Unni-Marie went out of her way to check us in early and even had us take breakfast while our room was being prepared. Everyone in the family works hard to provide an enjoyable stay. There is a car sent to meet the ferries in order for guests to avoid taking their bags on the short walk to the hotel and they bring the luggage back to the docks when you leave. Unni-Marie is very knowledgable about the ferry schedules, hiking options, and nearby attractions.", "title": "Superb Service and Attitude!!", "user": "coachlmb", "date": "August 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116380211}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Rooms are basic, but clean, and the heated bathroom floor was appreciated after a long hike.

The breakfast was good. The staff were very accommodating. We especially appreciated the pick-up and later, delivery of our suitcases to the dock.
