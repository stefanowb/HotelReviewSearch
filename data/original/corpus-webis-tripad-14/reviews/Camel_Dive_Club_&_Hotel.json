The room was very clean, excellent shower with hot water and good water pressure, its not 5* luxury but I had absolutely no complaints & I thought it was very reasonably priced. Breakfast was very good and the coffee was very drinkable (I get very miserable if I don't have reasonable coffee to drink, I had packed my own but ended up not needing it) They don't have room service here but I ordered Pizza from the onsite Italian restaurant and it was delivered to my room! I found the service to be great and everyone I dealt with was really helpful and friendly.", "title": "I wasn't diving but I loved this place, already booked return visit!", "user": "BrixtonPrincess", "date": "February 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 152808032}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My favourite things about the CDC are the location, its very close the beach and everything else is on the doorstep, the second thing is the size of the hotel, its really small, only 38 rooms I think, so during the day time when people are diving the pool is really quiet, you wouldn't believe that you were in the centre of Naama Bay.

Overall we were happy with our stay. The web price was 392 euro each for B&B and 10 dives. We really could not fault the hotel staff at all - friendly and eager to please. Ehab in the restaurant was just delightful. The receptionist in the dive centre might benefit from a course in customer relations. No smile, no niceties, no hello, just a 'what's your name?'. There are no planned dives so each day we needed to check what was availalble. We really wanted to go to the Thistlegorm and Dahab. We were told we would have to wait and see if there were enough people to go on a trip. This made it difficult for us as we didn't know whether to book these 2 trips with another dive club. In the end it was all OK. The staff are only paid when they take divers out so there was competition with guides trying to get business for their trips... not terribly professional. The guides we had were all great but Sven was particularly good at ensuring everyone was safe. Boat staff were absolutely brilliant and the food they provided was wonderful. One day I was unwell and didn't dive, however I accompanied my partner on the boat. I was charged 38 euro for the pleasure. If I had done my 2 dives I would have been charged 40 euro! Thistlegorm is a must. It was a real experience - even if it was a bit scary. Definitely only for very experienced divers. I have never experienced a current like that. Ratios on dives not great - Dahab was one guide to 9 divers. but then that's why you pay 20 euros a dive! Bit of a shock when we came to pay the bill. The extras were nearly 500 euros on top of the 400 so not as cheap as we first thought. Can't complain about the room in the hotel, it had everything we needed and we were only woken one night by music. If you have the air con on you can't hear anything.
