My husband, 27yr.old daughter and son-in-law, and two single daughters, ages 26 and 24 investigated the South Beach Hotel Group, as my youngest and I had stayed at one of the properties last January. We fell in love with the rooftop pool at the Catalina during our last visit so investigated this hotel first. From the moment we made our reservation, our stay could not have been more ideal. Yvette booked our rooms (3 in the same bldg) - perfect. The rooms have been updated with wonderful mattresses and great bed linens. And I must say that the free shuttle from the Miami airport to the hotel, is an extremely nice amenity. The shuttle arrived at 11am to the minute in Terminal G, second level - plenty of room for luggage.

From the decor and class of the Dorset building to the hospitality of the management and staff, you get complete value for money and an experience that compares to more expensive hotels in the neighbourhood. The hotel is superbly managed by Linsey Harris and every member of her staff that I encountered treated us more like friends than guests. I stayed in the Dorset building which would easily compare to any 5 star hotel. The rooms are large and beds comfortable. The corridors are so quiet and you would hardly believe that you are staying in one of the USA's most vibrant areas. The hotel reception/concierge staff were always courteous and were well connected with the local nighlife and always seemed to produce guestlist passes to the hottest clubs when we asked. The drinks bar in the Dorset building is pure class and a must for any visitor especially at happy hour. The location is perfect in the fashionable part of Collins Avenue and in the shadow of more expensive hotels. This was quite useful as some great parties were held in the larger hotels and we got in past the velvet rope with ease due to guestlist priviliges. The Catalina also has some great events from time to time such as Shecky's Girls Night out, which is great for girls that shop and guys that want to meet cute single ladies. The hotel pool is always a great place to chill when you want a break from the beach and the pool drinks are always pretty strong - especially Honey's Mojito.

They said it was Miami's \"best kept secret.\" The food at both restaurants was to die for. Another thing I really liked was how the hotel was not too big, but not too small.

I loved the eclectic look and vibe. the entrance to the building we were in smelled a little musty but you didn't notice it for long. the whole building is dark, its their way to add ambiance I guess, hall ways are very dark. My room was very cool with a large white bed dark wood floors large mirror, mini bar fridge. No problems with our room and no odours, air conditioning worked fine. there was a safe and hair dryer. It's apparent that they have been renovating as its an old art deco building, bathroom was renovated but water from the shower went onto the floor due a design flaw, so don't put any clothes on the floor and lay a towel down. it has free wifi. free designated drinks, usually rum or vodka, they were good, got a few in inthe hour because were were there sunday/monday which was nice and quiet. I did find that the walls were very thin and it can get noisy when people are coming in from partying, it is a partying town so beware of this. I recommend ear plugs to help with the noise, as it can get annoying if you are tired and trying to sleep. You are close to Lincoln Mall Rd (2 blocks)which there is alot of shopping there. You will also find a CVS where you can get some food and liquor . drink before you go out because its very expensive. there is also a Macdonalds on this road. Beach is across the street and you can walk down towards south beach. If you are coming from the port, it cost us $25 to get to the hotel and to the airport it cost $32 flat rate. There are people on the street trying to sell tours. We went to Gator Park and did the Everglades. This was a excellent tour $39 each. We also did a city tour with a bay cruise, this was also interesting and you get to go by all the stars houses out on the island. They pick up at hotels.
