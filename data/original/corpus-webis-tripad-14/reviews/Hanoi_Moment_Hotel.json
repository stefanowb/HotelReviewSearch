This was our first stop in Vietnam for a 4.5 week trip and they arranged a series of tours to Sa Pa and Halong Bay - both were reasonably priced and provided true 5 star levels of service, accommodation, and food quality. A definate highlight was the Indochina Junk boat tour Tom arranged - the food was excellent and the boat upon which we toured the bay on was exactly as Tom and Kim showed us in pictures.
