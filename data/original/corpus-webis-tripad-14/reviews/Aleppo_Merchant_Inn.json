We had driven up from Tintern Abbey and were looking forward to lunch having found the pub in the Good Pub Guide 2012 . When we arrived the barmaid greeted us warmly and asked had we wanted lunch? We said yes and she asked the kitchen and they agreed to give us anything off the lunch menu. We had two cheese and had ham toasties with yummy well- cooked chips and two pints of Sunshine Ale from Monty's Brewery in Montgomery. A perfect lunch! Thanks very much to the charming barmaid and cook who stayed late to make our lunch.", "title": "Welcoming lunch stop ....after lunch!", "user": "JeanneAlbi", "date": "October 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142724756}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Aleppo last weekend (7-9 Sept) and stayed in room 4.
