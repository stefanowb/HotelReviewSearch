The beach is top notch and one of the nicest in Bermuda. The service is very good and the staff is very friendly and attentive, but they have really have no choice. This hotel is very dated and the rooms are old. They claim to have renovated rooms out of the main hotel, but they are more like mildew smelling cabins you would see in a Friday the 13th movie. After viewing the so called villas (which really do not overlook beach) we chose to stay in main hotel. At first glance the room was better, however the hot water did not work and we had major plumbing issues. On day 2 we checked out and said goodbye. They did credit us substantially and the hotel was well aware of several issues with many rooms. The food was ok, but nothing great. The Brunch on Sunday was really good though.

I had read reviews and knew it was going to be expensive. I choose to stay in a premier room in a seperate cottage type room not in the main hotel (I had heard main hotel was still dated and premiers were updated). It was $600 a night but I must say the room was beautiful. It was large with a huge vanity area and the shower was big a fabulous (great temp and pressure). I heard the water tasted bad so I brought a few mini bottles of water with me and used it for brushing my teeth. I saw only one ant in the room the entire time. The beach is beautiful and it is so nice to go down there and have a towel, lounge chair, and umbrella available. The pool was nice too. The food was good that I ate. It is expensive but I expected that. Breakfast buffet at seahorse grill was $26 per person. It was good. In the states I would expect alot more for my $$--but I knew what I was getting into. We used the bus system and you can have the conceirge help you with that. We rode the ferry as well--it is a very nice ride. We went to the aquarium -- it was nice. It's not like a huge big city aquarium but nice enough. We went to St. George and took a tour with a horse/buggy and the man gave us history of the island. I enjoyed that. Tobacco Bay is there -- we saw it but didn't have our suits with us. It look like a nice place to snorkle and hang out. We went to the perfumery -- it was interesting to hear the history and see how they make the bermuda perfume.
