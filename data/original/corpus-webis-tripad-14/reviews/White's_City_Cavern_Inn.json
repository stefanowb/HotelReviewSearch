Unfortunately there is no other reason to stay here, and in fact we regretted being suckered into the convenience argument. This is a dump and they charged us $79. For that price I have had better motel experiences. It really should have cost $55. The room was very old and damp and had little flies in it. Everything seemed so old. Because it was so deserted, it felt unsafe, too. The hotel is like no other Best Western I have ever seen - it is worse. It consists of a few strips of single-story buidlings - like a motor inn. The hotel complex is deserted and looks like a movie set for a Wes Craven \"The Hills Have Eyes\" type movie. The \"water park\" is much advertised but was closed and ruinous looking - your kids would have a better time in any McDonald's playhouse. The complimentary breakfast was ok, but the restaurant looked like it had not been renovated since 1950. It was old, but not quaint. The staff are very nice and I feel sorry that they have to work at this desolate spot. Don't go there.

The girl who checked us in was extremely friendly, as was the Best Western girl, who had a longer line of people to help. We were able to get a room for 83 dollars that was clean and very large. It had a coffee maker, hair dryer, and ironing board with iron. One of our children slept on the inflatable sleeping bag mattress only because they wanted to, and there was plenty of room to walk around. The sheets and towels were clean, but the whirlpool tub did not work. The air conditoner in July was cold, VERY nice, as it was hot outside. When we checked in, they gave us writstbands for the water park and meal tickets for breakfast. The water park was really fun, even for we parents. Take sunscreen. Tickets to the water park if you are not staying in the motor hotels are 8 dollars a person, so being five of us, we saved 40 dollars there, and the breakfasts cost 5.50, so we saved 27.50 there, for a total of 67.50 in perks, so one can stretch it and say the room itself actually cost us under 25 dollars...can't complain too much at that price. So I didn't complain that the whirlpool tub in the room was not working, although that would have been icing on the cake. We heard no complaints at the pool or the restaurant about the rooms or food. We did not eat lunch or dinner, as we packed our own ice chest and food with us, which was good because the grocery store is really small and limited to mainly snacks.

When we checked into our room, the air conditioner did not work. We then checked into another room, and it did not work either. We then asked for a room in the old wing (the \"new\" wing was at least 40 years old, the \"old\" one looks like it dates from the 1930's). In the old wing, that air conditioner did not work either, only hot air was blowing out. Finally, a nice maintenance man came by, and deduced that \"they must have turned the compressor off for the winter.\" This being New Mexico in February, one does need cool air. The rooms are sealed, so without the air conditioner, there only blew a bit of hot air, causing the air conditioner to screech this high pitched sound. Obviously, the young man at the desk had no idea whatsoever if the air conditioners were working or not.

So whether you stay at this BW or the other one or the White City Resort, it's all the same and it's all mediocre. The only benefit of staying at this run of the mill hotel is that you are not 10 minutes from the Carlsbad Caverns, you are right at the entrance of the Carlsbad Caverns park. Which you may think is great, but the caverns are only 20 miles outside of Carslbad which only takes about 15 minutes to get to. We stayed at the Guadalupe Inn for 1 night in December and the room was fair. Although it appeared as if the furniture was new-ish (only a few years old), the bathroom was kind of dated and dirty (I would not have taken a bath in that tub for a million dollars) and the toilet reminded me of the kind of toilet you would find in an elementary school bathroom. Our television was partially broken (some of the channels didn't get sound?). The only restaurant in Whites City is the Velvet Garter which is terrible but their breakfast is there as well and it's quick and usually included in the rate.
