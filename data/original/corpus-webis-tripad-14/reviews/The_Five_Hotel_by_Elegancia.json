The staff is very kind but 'problem solving' it's another thing.

We booked the suite since we were bringing our two chihuahuas and needed the space. We too knew to expect a smaller than usual room, but even so were still surprised at the size, even with the suite. The bathroom was a great size and the lights and fixtures were beautiful. It was nice to have a separate little seating area with a great flat screen, also very pretty. The bedroom however was so small I actually woke up in the night feeling a little panicky. I also woke up due to very loud and continual banging from the other side of the wall directly beside my head, both nights. I believe it was from the building beside or perhaps behind the front desk. The hot tub and terrace are cute, but totally not private with about 50 windows looking right down on you. The hot tub has a curtain so we still enjoyed it, though not allowed after 9 pm. The door to the room is right in the lobby, a little awkward but convenient to walk the dogs . The best part was the staff!! The girl at the front was SO helpful, made perfect suggestions for restaurants as though she knew us personally. I must suggest Marty's Oyster Bar, absolutely fantastic food and service, and about a 7 minute walk away. The area is totally un-stereotypical Paris, so if you want eiffel tower views you'll be disappointed. We loved it however with great open markets, pubs and cafes, which is needed since there is no room service or bar in the hotel- but good for getting you out to experience Paris!", "title": "Stayed in suite, good, not great, but super staff.", "user": "JLS813", "date": "November 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 22177161, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Design and staff.", "disliked": "\u2014 Size and noise."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008", "text": "Stayed one week in a Standard Room on the 5th floor.
