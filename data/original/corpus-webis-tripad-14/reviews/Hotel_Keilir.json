Everything is very modern and chic, the rooms starkly white and well lit. The room my friend and I stayed in had 4 beds and was plenty spacious. It also had a balcony overlooking the main street, and the location of the hotel is right smack in the middle of the town. We were there on a Thursday and got to witness the actual runtur, which is so incredibly quirky and funny to behold.

After drinking Thule and taking shots of Brennivin and Opal (which I think is a horrendous mixture between Jagermeister and Listerine) on the balcony, we hopped across the street to check out the local scene. A homely Irish pub, they were having trivia night, and every single question involved American pop culture. Some cute local girls invited us to join them in their booth and they translated what the announcer was saying so that we could help. Witnessing the Islanders guess at the trivia was a trip, I suppose I'm somewhat glad that my impression that people in Iceland watch a ton of American TV was partially wrong. The prize for winning each round was a six pack of beer and for winning all three rounds was a case of Heinekin.
