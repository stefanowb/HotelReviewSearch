First of all it is very close to major attractions, especially the central caf\u00e9 which is very nice and elegant.

The room was very spacious and large. The only problem was that there was another door almost immediately behind it. Unlike KKMT the doors are very heavy and thus much better noise isolation. KKMT was not disturbing but you could hear people walking in the hallway. The two heavy doors however made going with stuff very difficult. For instance when I had room service one night and I wanted to leave the tray outside, it proved very difficult to manage this alone. The doors were also a problem, they did not open easily as I had to try many times for the electronic key to become activated. The ceiling was very high and nice. The views from the room were great.", "user": "Miruna_R", "date": "February 25, 2010", "id": 57055003}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "great location, excellent service", "text": "It did snow a lot when I was there but SHHW does not provide umbrellas like KKMT.", "user": "Jumuju", "date": "February 1, 2010", "id": 54935419}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Extraordinary Service", "text": "This hotel is wonderful. Expedia completely messed up our reservation - i.e. after airline delays we arrive at almost 11pm and there is no reservation for us, even though we'd already paid through Expedia! To make matters worse, the hotel was completely full so they couldn't accommodate us. This had all the makings of a disaster weekend trip. But, the manager on duty was called in and took charge. We were sent to sit in the lounge while she talked to tried to sort out the error and tried to talk to Expedia. Expedia was useless. But, the manager arranged a room for us at another hotel AND arranged a taxi to take us over there. The next day they had space so we would come back then. They even upgraded our room for the night we were with them. Remember NONE of this was their fault!!
