Arriving very unfashionably early, we\u2019d booked for 5:30 as we were going to a performance at 7:30, but because it was cold and starting to rain we actually turned up just after 5. Expecting to be told, \u201csorry we aren\u2019t open yet\u201d which would have been perfectly reasonable on a Sunday afternoon when the last stragglers from lunch were just leaving, instead we were welcomed warmly and apologetically, and offered a seat at the bar. The restaurant manager explained that they normally didn\u2019t open till 6 on Sunday but that she had asked the chef to come back on duty a bit earlier because of our booking, but until he arrived would we like to have some oysters, and maybe a glass of sparkling wine or a pint of Guinness?", "title": "Exceptional Service and Attitude", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Intrepidtoo", "date": "June 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 164110193}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited June 2013", "text": "We spend a very pleasant half an hour sitting up at the bar, chatting with the expert oyster opener who confessed it was his last day as he was off to join the circus tomorrow, and sampling the different varieties.

The Cliff House stands on a late 17th century site that was once the home of the Earl of Shelbourne. Marine references within reminds one of its stellar sister and Michelin starred restaurant overlooking the sea down south in Ardmore. The restaurant is a stunning room, lovely and graceful with parquet floors and Georgian sash windows looking out over the exquisite 22 acre St Stephens Green designed by Wm Sheppard and opened to the public in 1880. The food here is outstanding, crab starters are sublime, Dublin Bay Prawn Tempura is classic, in fact all Chef Sean Smiths seafood is as good as it gets. Service is faultless, presentation is creative and the wine list is extensive and well chosen. Breakfast is elegant starting with authentic fruit juice, a proper fruit salad accompanied by West Cork Glenilen yogurt and a lovely selection of eggs cooked with creative style and skill. The full Irish of course is available but I was surprised that an establishment that prides itself on its wonderful seafood has no fish on the breakfast menu.", "title": "Coolest address in town", "user": "DCHPORTVENDRES", "date": "April 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 159261911}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful Hotel, Perfect Location", "text": "We just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at The Cliff Town House Hotel.

It's one of those hotels that you wake up in and know that you're in Dublin, unlike a room in a major hotel chain.
