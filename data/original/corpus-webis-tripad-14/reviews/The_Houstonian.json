The territory of the hotel is very green and it feels like the hotel is located in the middle of a big garden where a lot of wild squirrels, birds and rabbits live. No need to mention the fantastic sport club which belongs to the hotel with a couple swimming pools (including an Olympic size pool outside with a warm water during cold days). The Spa is great. I had a facial and was very satisfied with the job that was done with my face. The hotel is located next to Memorial park and it's walking distance to the park for those who like to exercise.

If you have kids and don't really want to leave the property but want to save some money I would recommend the club level. It also has tea, coffee and sodas all day. Forget using the hotel fridge, just go down to the club room and snag some sodas for the room, which is what I did.
