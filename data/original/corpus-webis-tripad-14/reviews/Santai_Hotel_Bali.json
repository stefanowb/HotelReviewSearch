The restaurants all serve identical menu items and the food quality and preparation are poor as relates to the rest of the island. Santai has nice grounds and they try hard yet the room had maintainence issues that were brought to Managements attention and not repaired over a 4 night stay. Normally Balinese service is excellent and attentive yet the general malaise from all the staff was ever present. They seemed tired and bored with a heavy dose of indifference. We paid $us80 from the internet and arrived to lower offered rates and when we tried to check out early were told not possible and they would bill our CC. We did agree to cancellation policy fine print! You can get much better for much less if you have to visit.", "title": "mediocre Santai experience", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "dreemin2", "date": "February 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 24268605}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Stayed for a week with the family, two grown-ups and two kids (1\u00bd and 3 years old), as a first stop on a months stay on Bali. Very nice hotel with lush gardens just next to the beach. Bungalows (63 US$ per night incl breakfast, not seaside) on the small side for the four of us although there is a loft which we could have used if the kids had been a bit older. All in all not ideal for small kids, but the pool worked well and the beach was very convenient for playing with toys in the sand and evening walks before dinner.", "title": "Quiet place on the beach (in Amed)", "user": "sigsap", "date": "January 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 23228669, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Ambiance", "disliked": "\u2014 Beach could have been better for swimming..."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "underwhelming hotel but excellent snorkeling", "text": "Food was really good, both local and western dishes although the supposed Finnish meat balls tasted suspiciously similar to Swedish meatballs\u2026", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "youngconiseaur", "date": "June 1, 2008", "id": 16576298}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Great arrangement with pick up from the airport and drive to our next hotel in Lovina, even included children seat in the car.", "title": "NOT in Candidasa!", "user": "SWTTRAVELS", "date": "May 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 16526582, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Really, everything was wonderful", "disliked": "\u2014 The bathroom"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Santai Hotel - a treasure", "text": "What else\u2026", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Harrier", "date": "March 12, 2007", "id": 7014781}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "Despite the heading, this is not in Candidasa.", "title": "An oasis of calm", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "ferretbanana", "date": "October 13, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4018848}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2005", "text": "We loved this little hotel.
