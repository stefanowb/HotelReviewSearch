It is a great little boutique hotel on a residential street, not far from the beach promenade. Some wonderful restaurants and cafes are right around the corner, and Jaffa is about a 30 minute walk. The lobby is very welcoming, and I loved the contemporary '70s vibe they've created. The front desk staff were all very pleasant and helpful, and went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and had anything and everything I could need. I was traveling solo and my room was a tight fit, but everything in the room (spotless black marble bathroom, clean linens, super comfortable bed, complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates, flat screen tv, air conditioning, huge windows) made my stay all the more enjoyable. If you want to get out of your room, the rooftop offered unbeatable views of the city, the Living Room was comfortable, and the terrace area off of the front desk are all good alternative options for spending your time. If you are going to breakfast at the Cafe Birenbaum, make sure to go early. I made the mistake of going around 11 and the place was jam-packed. I ended up at the Rothschild Cafe across the street (on the corner), and was able to get a great Israeli breakfast there. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my short visit at the Brown, and cannot wait to return on my next visit to Tel Aviv!", "title": "Great boutique hotel in Tel Aviv", "user": "Chi_travelgirl99", "date": "July 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133702296}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012", "text": "enjoyed our 3 day trip back in israel tel a viv, this time in a beautifully located modern design hotel!!! loved the ambiance & it's compination of modern touch with vintage furnitures, giving a spectacular relaxation !!! service fantastic and amazing design in rooms with black touch and dark brown wood.... the top roof outdoor lounge bar as well as the exterior ground floor lounge are giving an american way of living and relaxation.... really fantastic hotel to stay in tel a viv and close to shabazi best shopping area as well as the best restaurants and cool places of nightlife in sleepless city of israel!!!!", "title": "Let's go modern & vintage !!! in heart of tel a viv!!", "user": "kikola12", "date": "July 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 133439528}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Chic hotel with very friendly and helpful staff.

What makes Brown TLV stand out are the little touches that leave a big impression. Outstanding staff that take an interest in their guests on a personal level. Breakfast included at nearby trendy cafes ( instead of the run of the mill hotel breakfast buffet). WIFI , 24 HrTea/coffee service in lobby, Cava flowing, The list goes on...
