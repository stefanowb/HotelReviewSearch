To say it was perfect is an understatement. The house is delightful with a decent lounge/dining area downstairs with a loft main bedroom upstairs. The fridge was well stocked with local ingredients but I would highly recommend dining as often as possible at Matt & Lisa's restaurant next door. The staff were exceptionally lovely and the food was very good (and I tried a few of the well known restaurants in the area).", "title": "Perfect!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "shonky", "date": "August 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 19312193}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Highly recommend!", "title": "The best break ever!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "SASTrainer", "date": "November 19, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10914768, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Romantic seclusion with great food.", "disliked": "\u2014 Absolutely nothing to dislike."}}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 4, "very good": 6, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 30}, "aka": "The Foxhunter Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.222222222222}
