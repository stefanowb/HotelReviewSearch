The hotel reception staff were first class but this is where this great level of service stopped. The hotel rooms and hall ways are brilliantly decked out but the rooms are a little quirky (but I should have known this from the hotel pics) the floors were not clean i.e. Dusty. This was not a major issue though, that was the restaurant service!!! Great cut of meat in the rib eye steak but the service was terrible and this continued through breakfast which I would never book or pay as much as \u00a311.50 that they charge for a cooked or continental. Black pudding was terrible. I am not a hotel snob but for great service and food the thistle just round the corner is spot on.", "title": "Not sure how they got 4 dots!!", "user": "Wishiwasitalian14", "date": "January 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 149157006}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Abode is situated in Manchester city centre, around 5 minutes walk from Piccadilly station where there is a frequent train service to and from the airport.", "title": "Great value, great location", "user": "Fifejim", "date": "January 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148967311}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We found the staff very helpful and the contemporary designed room very comfortable, especially the extra large bed.
