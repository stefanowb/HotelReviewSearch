On arrival they tried to charge us alot more than the rate we were first given after speaking to the manager the rate was reduced. Suite was large with a nice balcony but still overlooked the construction site. The workers started at 7.30am till 7pm and they could see us sitting on our balcony. We had alot of issue with noise from the guests upstairs and had to call reception 4 times one night and early morning to get them to tell the quests to be quiet these particular guests were also throwing bottles over the balcony. The staff did not seem to care. When we asked to be moved thet said they had nothing. Overall we found the staff very unhelpful and just seems to speak spanish among themselves and ignore the guests. Until this hotel gets its act together and the construction is finished i would not recommend anyone staying there.", "user": "caz1949", "date": "September 3, 2008", "id": 19719135}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Place", "text": "Beach is nice but loungers are given to non guests so none left for guest and are put away by 5pm", "user": "rdeanr", "date": "August 30, 2008", "id": 19554942}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Hilton Nightmare - Stay There Literally At Your Peril!!", "text": "Beautiful hotel, great rooms, very friendly staff.

The next morning to our horror we found out that the workmen started at 8.00 a.m. sharp (kango hammers working flat out) and worked through until 5.00 p.m. We also found out that the bar and restaurant in the hotel had been closed for several months.

We had to run down to reception with our daughter even then it was the person who set off the rocket who had to use their cell phone to call the emergency services. I followed my wife and daughter to the hospital after giving a report to the police \u2013 the hotel kindly organised a taxi for me (wow)!!

Upon check-in we were giving a different room than was previously booked (one of the girls husband booked the room for us and they had a room for him. when they saw it was us they moved our room...still didn't know where they had originally put us) to one that would barely fit 2 people. The view and balcony were a nice touch though. The room would have been great had it been only 2 of us. We asked for a roll away bed only to get it 5 hours after we checked in and having to call 3 times.

Our overall experience was good, but we had to work at it. When we booked we noticed that the Hilton website stated that there was construction next door. We called the hotel to check on this and they said there wasn't any construction. Anyway, when we checked in we say the rather large condo being built next door so we requested a room away from the construction zone. The front desk fiddled around for a while on an \"upgrade\" and eventually gave us our room key and off we went. Anyway, we were in a tiny \"suite\" about 10 feet from the contruction site. Our view was of metal beams and a construction dude, which is not really why you spend a decent amount of money on an oceanfront property. The condo being built is a highrise condo literally 10 or 20 feet from the Hilton Bentley. If you have that view it's not going to be the same experience as being on the non-construction side of the property. Anyway, we called and compained and they moved us to our original room...which was literally a bed, a TV and a bathroom. It was one of the smallest hotel rooms I have seen in a while. We complained again (we are not habitual complainers at hotels but it was very bizarre) and eventually they moved us to a really nice suite on the other side of the hotel - marble bathroom, nice kitchen, etc. (others have written about this and they descriptions are accurate). The difference between our final room and the two others we saw was VERY dramatic and made the difference between a really nice stay and one where I would have felt thoroughly ripped off. The pool is small but nice and warm and not crowded and the beach is just across the road. The kids loved going back and forth between them, so from that perspective it was great. We didn't mind being on the quiet side of SOBE but if you want to be in the center of things this is not the hotel to be at. They have a nice fitness center with bottled water, etc. and also give you bottles of water at the pool. It was a nice touch. The wireless internet was down most of our stay- something about cut wires. Anyway, that was repaired after a few days. Overall I don't think I would stay here again because there are many other options that don't have the risks involved (i.e., construction site, some very undesirable rooms, etc.).", "title": "Hilton Bentley Beach is cool...if you get the right room.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "louiskie", "date": "April 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15230188, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and our room (in the end, after seeing 2 other very undesirable rooms)", "disliked": "\u2014 Construction next door; chances of getting a really bad room (clean but tiny)"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008", "text": "We stayed here on points for four nights late March.

Our room didn't have a tub, and the lighting in the bathroom is terrible, my wife said she couldn't see in the mirror to do the make up thing. Also the AC was loud when running, affecting sleep. Prime One Twelve across the street is a very good restuarant, as is Big Pink. Noise from construction next door was not a factor, you hardly notice it.

The hotel is about 15 mins away from the cruise port or the airport. It is at the END of the Ocean Drive Strip. I did not particularly like this although its quiet, it is more deserted and required more walking/cabs/shuttles. The Suite was magnificent! It was very large with a living room and dining room area, a full kitchen with a full fridge stocked with evrything you could want. The King sized bed was huge and the sofa bed was very comfy. The bathroom was very nice all marble with a jacuzzi tub but no shower curtain so made for a very wet floor after showers. It had a long wraparound balcony with access to the hot tub and a mini pool. The weather was not really nice when i was there so i enjoyed soaking in the hot tub all day. They have complimentary internet access in the lobby and a nice and affordable(compared to SoBe prices) restaurnt downstairs.
