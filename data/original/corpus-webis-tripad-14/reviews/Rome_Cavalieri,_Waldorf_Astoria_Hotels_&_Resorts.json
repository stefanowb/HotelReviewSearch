Rome, Italy was the vacation that I have been dreaming of ever since grade school. I was finally able to fulfill my dream this year, so I read tons of hotel reviews and decided to reserve my room at the hotel with the best 5-stars reputation based on comments from other people who stayed there. I was not disappointed. First I was greeted by some very friendly staff as soon as my taxi pulled up to the doors. Their friendliness was beyond what I dreamed it would be. The concierge and door man greeted me as if I were royalty that day. Other days I was treated as if I were one of their beloved relatives who they were happy to see again. And the first-class service didn't end there. All of the hotel personnel were gracious and wonderful. The hotel is in a quiet spot and my room had an awesome view of several places I have only seen in pictures, on tv, and in the movies. I spent my first evening sitting on the balcony at looking the Vatican and thinking, \"I can't believe I'm Really Here doing This\". I even slept with the balcony doors open that night just to breath and feel Roman air. The free hotel shuttle to the city was timely, and the drivers were very kind and helpful about letting us know their schedules. Breakfast was included with my room and there were snacks provided throughout the day. My favorite evening snack during that week was curry chicken like I have never tasted before. The flavor of it was perfect and amazing. Every day I rode the hotel shuttle to the city and did my tourist thing. Bank of America has a branch location called BNL with an ATM just down the block (and on the same side of the street) from the shuttle drop-off spot. BNL is cross from the American Embassy. I used my ATM card to get Euros there a couple of times without any trouble. I was back at the hotel in the evenings. On the days I didn't feel like waiting for the shuttle to bring me back I caught a taxi. taxi stands are everywhere in Rome and there's one just across from the shuttle bus stop. There are also Metro Stops all around the square where the hotel shuttle dropped us off. Everything aspect of my trip to Rome either met or exceeded my expectations.

The hallways are covered in marble, the chandeliers are magnificent, and the views of Rome are amazing. However, there are a few things we did not enjoy about this hotel. First of all, they make you pay for the gym facilities. We were very excited to lift weights and perhaps use the treadmill after weeks of carbs....but once we found out that the gym cost 25 euros a day, we decided to ignore the urge to exercise. Also, the hotel is quite far from the city centre. The hotel does have a shuttle, but it is generally full...and it does not operate late enough to catch a ride after dinner and drinks. So, expect to drop some cab money. One day, we decided to ride the bus to the train station, then ride the train to the city centre...but it took some time to walk to the bus stop, wait for the bus, ride the bus to the train station, wait for the train, and ride the train all the way to the city. Though we really enjoyed the beds, we also would have enjoyed the beds at the St. Regis, which is right inside the town. I'd definitely recommend getting a nice hotel in the city centre...since they are no more expensive than the Hilton.", "title": "Luxurious with a bad location", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "michaelmelton1", "date": "December 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 11225460, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The amazing bed", "disliked": "\u2014 poor location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "First some background, I am a Hilton Diamond Member.
