By the time we were done eating, our room was ready...and it was worth the wait. She provided us with a room key and a building key, so we were able to come and go as we pleased. We were assigned to the \"Amber Room\", which came with a comfy king size bed, private bathroom with shower, and balcony with a view of the canal below.
