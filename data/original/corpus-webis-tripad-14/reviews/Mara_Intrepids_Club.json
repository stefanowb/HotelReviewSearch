He is Maasai and was happy share his knowledge and answer our millions of questions about the animals and the Maasai people. The landscape is so vast, with so many animals! We enjoyed every minute. He is very thoughtful and passed out Maasai blankets on the chilly mornings. He is also a gifted photographer. He made sure we were well positioned to get the best photos possible.

One was Mara Intrepids, which I loved just as much as then. I like it in particular because in August, it still has the long grass - not the short cropped yellowing grass. We had the best guide we've ever had -- Joseph, a Kikuyu (there are 2 Josephs there) -- and we saw a leopard in the broad daylight, a caracal, a wildebeast crossing, everything. Joseph was such a wonderful guide, gentle, quiet, and extremely intelligent and informative. The food was better here than at some of the other camps we've stayed at over the years, and they made the most delicious thin crepes for breakfast.
