While this hotel is one of many motels immediately off the freeway in the western side of Billings this one stands out. First of all upon entering the hotel we were warmly greeted by an older woman and man who were working the front desk on a late Saturday night. They made sure our accomodations were proper and were also willing to change the room to a higher floor. The room itself was modern and clean. There was a refrigerator in the room, a nice touch since most of the hotels in Montana do not offer such a service or if they do at a higher price. The tv remote control did not work but when I asked the front staff about it they immediately gave me a new remote without returning the old one. The bed was comfortable and contained upgraded sheets and blankets. The staff were also helpful in giving us directions and recommendations at what to eat at a restaurant we had picked out in the area.

The granite countertops in the bathroom and kitchenette (w/sink, dorm-size frig, and microwave) areas, the cherry furniture, the classy artwork, the pillowtop mattresses and beautiful linens all make this such a comfortable place to stay. It's basically more like a small condo than a hotel room. Although it doesn't have a restaurant, next door are Hu Hot Mongolian BBQ for lunch and dinner as well as Texas Roadhouse for dinner. Other than that, you've got to drive for meals but there are numerous selections within a mile. The free breakfast is pretty much standard fare but sitting in the beautiful surroundings, who cares?
