We booked it last minute and I must admit I hadn't had much time to research the hotel but it was a cheap deal and decided just take it as we found it. We got a room on the fourth floor with a balcony and with a view of the side of the hill which was great as the sun shone there in the afternoon. The room was spotless and I mean spotless the bathroom was large and the corridor had the smell of fresh carpet so I don't know whether all the rooms had been recently refurbished. The breakfast was also very good with a hot and cold buffet selection. I managed to lock myself out of our digital room safe and went to reception to request assistance. Reception advised me to return the room and I no sooner had gone through the door when a member of staff arrived and sorted it out.
