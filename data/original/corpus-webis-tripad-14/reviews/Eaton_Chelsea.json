We are a family of 4 - my daughter and I went to the Taylor Swift concert while my husband and son stayed at the hotel. The City was extremely busy with all of the events going on so hotels were filling quickly. We had stayed at the Delta when the kids were very young (they are 12 and 11 now) and not much had changed. I knew ahead of time that the lobby was undergoing construction so that was not a suprise. I had called the morning of our arrival to put in a second request for a cot, and was assured I would have one. When we arrived at approximately 2:30, I was told that our room had been upgraded to a room with 3 double beds - which I was very pleased with (no arguing about who woud sleep on the cot). Unfortunately the room was not ready and I was told to come back between 3 and 3:30. At 3:30 the room was still not ready. At 4:00, after requesting access to the pool so the kids could swim, I called from the pool and asked if it was ready. I was told that it was not because of my \"special request\" for a room with 3 dbl beds. I quickly clarified that I had only requested a cot - the 3 dbl bed room was THEIR idea. And they still could not tell me when the room was ready. By 4:30 I put my husband on the phone and a very perky Ashley told him the room was ready, so we gathered all of our belongings from the pool area and headed upstairs. We were in the old part of the hotel, with no balcony or fridge. But the 3 dbl beds were definitely better than a cot and 2 dbls, and the room was bigger. The beds are extremely comfortable and you are given an abundance of pillows. Kids liked the free Wi-Fi. The bathroom was outdated but that was to be expected. All in all, the room suited our needs and we were not disappointed. We would stay here again for one night if the need arose. Two nights would likely be too much.
