This lovely, charming residence is very well located overlooking the Seine. The rooms are well sized and beautifully decorated. I would say that the house has been restored in a loving and careful way. We ate supper there which was lovely after a long day travelling. Isabelle speaks very good english which was helpful. The breakfast was excellent and provided in a beautiful garden room. Our son loved watching the ships go past just across the road.

A somewhat faded beauty, (slowly and lovingly being restored by the owners) this pretty, tranquil residence with comfortable rooms and beautiful grounds, overlooks the Seine. The generous and delicious breakfasts (shirred eggs, back bacon, fresh pineapple, cheeses, yogurt, croissants and homemade jams, etc.) cooked to perfection by charming owner Isabelle, are served in a sunny breakfast room, on a table laid with white batiste cloths, and French doors open on to the property and the Seine beyond. Good little restaurant \"La Gastronomie\" in La Bouille (be sure to sample their Normandy cheeses and Tarte Tatin with thick cream), is a pleasant 15 min. walk along the Seine from the B&B.
