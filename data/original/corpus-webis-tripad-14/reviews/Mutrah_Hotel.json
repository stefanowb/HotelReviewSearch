So I have experienced quite a lot of Hotels in the country and I have to say that NONE of the other hotels could compare with Mutrah Hotel in regards to value for money, location, friendliness and helpfulness of staff and spaciousness of rooms. Altogether we stayed there for 4 nights and although the only thing I can critisize is the slightly loud AC I have to say that even in the 5 star Crowne Plaza in Sohar, which was 3 times more expensive than the Mutrah Hotel the Air Conditioner was always making noise. I thought that the staff was very friendly and helpful, the room were incredibly spacious, the location in Mutrah, very close to the Corniche and Souq, was great and if you are lucky and get a room on the 4th floor you also enjoy a great view thought a nice, big window.
