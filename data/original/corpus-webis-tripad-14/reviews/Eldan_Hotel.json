We stayed for five nights, the fourth night was free! The lobby is very small but pleasant. There are free newspapers and a decent breakfast is included daily. The staff is friendly and tries to accommodate. The biggest drawback for me was the lack of closet space. There is hardly any hanging space, my husband had to hang his clothes on the chairs.
