Our room was perfect for us (1 bedroom luxury) and the main bathroom even fit the crib so at night we still had full use of the bedroom, kitchen, living & powder room while the little one slept in bathroom (perfect sleeping conditions, really - no window!).

Also, there was a basket of beach toys that our son loved to rummage through each day.

Kathy was the best person to ask for help. Otherwise, we made our own reservations/research. Breakfast was \"continental\" but sufficient. Antoinette ensured every guest was satisfied and went the extra mile to make everyone's day start off right. Her morning smile was contagious! Diner service was the other downfall but for a new resort, this is one of the \"bumps\" in the road. Limited items and they would benefit having a real chef and experienced/knowledgable staff. Room service and extended hours in the daytime would also be beneficial catering to families.

It is my understanding that many of the staff on front desk were new, but the fact that they lacked any professionalism and courtesy is a poor reflection on management. When we asked for advice on what activities to do, car rentals, prices etc they seemed very unknowledgeable. The dive shop I went diving with (Caicos Adventures, which I highly recommened by the way) recommended a day boat trip with a company called Outback Adventures, which had been doing the boat trip for the past 15 years. However, when I asked one of the girls on front desk if she could book the boat trip for us, in spite of her claiming to have 4 years experience in the tourist industry on provo, she'd never heard of Outback Adventures! Nor did she know how much car rental prices were! Or how much taxi's would cost from the hotel to the restaurants we wanted to go to! In fact, whenever we asked a question that you would expect a front desk person to know they hardly ever knew and furthermore nearly always gave off an attitude and seemed indifferent to providing any kind of service in helping you find the answer...as you would expect from a luxury resort.
