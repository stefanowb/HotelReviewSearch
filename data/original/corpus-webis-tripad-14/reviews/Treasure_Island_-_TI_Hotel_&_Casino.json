So, this trip was more to treat & expose them to Las Vegas than it was a true \"vegas vacation.\" I had been to Las Vegas several times before and have stayed at Flamingo Hilton, Excalibur, & Paris-Las Vegas. We chose T.I. because of its central location on the strip; but most of all because of the great room rate. At the time of our stay, the temperatures were between 110 - 115 degrees. We arrived at the hotel around noon-ish on Friday, July 13, 2007. The check-in process was very quick, efficient, pleasant and our room was ready at the time of check-in. The room was VERY nice with a GREAT view of the strip! My wife took advantage of the \"Wet\" Spa and was treated to a color, cut, & style from an extremely experienced, knowledgeable and outstanding stylist. The pool at T.I., as other reviews have stated, is somewhat small, but keep in mind, folks dont come to Vegas for a swimming pool. However, they could benefit by having a larger pool. Although the breakfast buffet was rather pricey, it was very good with plenty to choose from. As mentioned, T.I. is pretty central to everything. It is located next to the mall, which was nice. Across the street is the amazing Venetian. For your convenience, there is a tram that runs between T.I. to The Mirage. During our short stay we ate the buffet breakfast at T.I., had a late lunch at Margaritaville (at the Flamingo Hilton) and an early dinner at America (inside New York, New York). The meals at Margaritaville and America were OUTSTANDING and both were reasonably priced! We took our kids to the top of the Stratosphere for a \"bird's eye\" view of Vegas! Its truly an amzing view from the top! We also took an indoor Gondola ride. This was nice, but short. I'm still not sure if it is worth the money. Overall, we really enjoyed the trip!

Next incident occured as soon as we entered the room and wanted to lay down in the bed. There were black hairs everywhere in the sheets and pillows.. long ones, short ones, curly ones etc. Maid service came up, barged in the door w.out knocking, never once apologized for any of it. I could go on and on at this point about the rude horrible unbelievable service we got from the staff in the on-site diner and the fancy restaurants too but i will just leave you with this advice: Go to Vegas it is great but***********do not stay at TI *********** you will regret it They are horrible from management down to maintanence. By the way, i submitted two formal complaints to the \"president\" of the hotel 4 months ago (yes the service was that bad that i complained formally and extensively) and have yet to hear a reply.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 20, 2004", "id": 2760239}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2004", "text": "We thought the TI was fantastic! We were treated excellent from the moment we checked in to the day we departed. The last time we stayed in Vegas we were at the Bellagio, which was fantastic. So I was a bit wary about staying here. I can't say enough great things about it. Money talks in Vegas, keep this in mind throughout your vacation. If you want a nice room, then dig in your pockets and upgrade. Be realistic about your expectations and what you are willing to spend. We also looked into the possibility of getting a cabana by the pool. The staff there was fantastic, took us on a tour of the area, and recommended that we *not* get a cabana due to sun locations at this time of year. They were honest and kind. All dealers were friendly, helpful, and engaging. The room was spotless and the customer service was phenomenal. We enjoyed a complimentary bottle of champagne because we mentioned my husband's birthday. Anytime we had questions regarding activities outside the hotel, the staff was more than accomodating. The restaurants at the TI...eh. We went off-site for dining. Kahunaville was one big loud headache, we went for a drink, we turned around and walked out. We ate at the 24 hour cafe once- pretty blah, but again, you get what you pay for. There are plenty of excellent restaurants in Vegas, do your research. My only complaint is the Sirens show is really loud- so if your room overlooks that area, be prepared for some noise.", "title": "Will Try Other Hotel Next Time", "user": "Golfer919", "date": "October 18, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 2756322}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2003", "text": "Went to Las Vegas this summer,last time was 32 years ago.It has changed.
