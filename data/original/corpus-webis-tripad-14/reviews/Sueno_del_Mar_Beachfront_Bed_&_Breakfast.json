Our night at Sueno was amazing and we certainly wished we had stayed longer. The hospitality and friendly staff add to the amzing ambience of the B&B. The honeymoon suite is like nothing we had stayed in before...ythe loft room has the feel of almost a tree house as you are surrounded by large screened in windows and trees. The sound of the ocean waves all night was hypnotizing. We saw howler monkeys in the trees while using the outdoor shower. It was an enjoyable 20 minute walk along the beach into Tamarindo and a 10 minute walk in the other direction to the other beach area (I have forgotten the name) Great swimming in the surf!", "title": "Sueno Del Mar is a must!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "twoepps", "date": "May 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7552716}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Suneo del Mar is definitely on our \"must return to\" list.", "title": "So amazing we came back", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "KristiandJay", "date": "May 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7489416, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, hospitality, knowledge of the area, cleanliness, attitude, atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything was perfect!!!!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Unbelievable and magical are the two words that come to mind about Sueno Del Mar.

Our hosts could not have been more personable and charming, and they let their guests set the pace and amount of privacy they're looking for. We alternated between being active for a few days, and then secluding ourselves to work on a manuscript. The staff is meticulous and genuinely warm and caring. They take great pride in their work and it's obvious that they are very well treated by the owners. There is an overall \"sweet\" vibe to the place.
