We really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were clean, well-accommodated, and comfortable. The house itself and the surrounding vineyard are really nice. Breakfast was phenomenal. We've stayed at many B&Bs and it was one of the best we've had. They even serve some of their wine with breakfast which was an extra special treat. The hosts, Warren and Nora, are extremely pleasant, friendly, and helpful. On our last day, Warren gave us a tour of the vineyards and an overview of his winemaking. We got to sample some of the wine as well. All in all, a very relaxing and enjoyable stay. This hotel is a great location if you're visiting Foxwoods or Mohegan Sun. There are a few restaurants locally, but not a lot.

Warren immediately set up two chairs for us and that became my morning rendezvous with my tea and book. We stayed in the Claremont room.
