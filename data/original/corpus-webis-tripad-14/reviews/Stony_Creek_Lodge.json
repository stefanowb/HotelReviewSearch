The room had two queen beds and a twin which aptly accommodated us and the kids. The room was very clean and while it overlooked the parking lot, it was quiet - even with folks coming in and out of the lodge. A continental breakfast was included - coffee, juices, cereal and packaged muffins. The lodge is located in the national forest and roughly 20-25 minutes drive from Lodgepole and Grant Grove villages. The rest of our group stayed at the Stoney Creek Campground, so this lodge was the perfect base camp to spend the day with them and visit the two parks. The staff at Stony Creek were phenomenal. They were cheerful at check in and throughout our stay. They even went the extra mile to trek to Grant Grove Village in order to overnight a camera we left behind. We will stay there again.", "title": "Excellent service and location make this a perfect national park base camp", "user": "capturedplanet", "date": "September 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 178160243}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "What a dump!", "text": "We booked Stony Creek Lodge via the internet. We received an e-mail with directions to the lodge Nowhere did it say that the lodge office closed at 7:00 PM and the pizza restaurant (the only food in MILES) closed at 7:30. We drove for over an hour on climbing switchback roads in the dark. The directions were very poor,but we finally made it! It was closed up tight! Our key was taped to the door. We wandered around and finally found some outside stairs to our room. We are on a 30 plus day trip to the west and have stayed in hotels/motels/lodges/B&Bs for 3 weeks. This was absolutely the worst! There was a double bed and space around it to walk. Everything was very spartan and dated. There was a note apologizing that if you got up early, it took 15 minutes for the water to get hot for a shower. There was,of course, no air conditioning and the day had been very hot. We got up in the morning and decided to get breakfast and drive to the General Sherman tree. The office and restaurant were STILL closed at 7:45 AM. They didn't open until 8!! If we had paid $50 for this room, we wouldn't be complaining so much, but we paid $119!! It was certainly not worth the money.

I read so many negative reviews about the lodge, I was really scared when we pulled in, that I had made a horrible mistake. I was pleasantly surprised to find such a comfortable and inviting place to stay. Our room was tiny but clean. The pizza was great, and being able to take our own food and drinks to eat on the patio was just awesome. I had read someone's comment that there was nowhere nearby to hike, and I just can't figure out what they could mean. We hiked across the street, and also down the hill from the parking lot. It may not be the Ritz, but it is a perfect place to rest your head at night in the middle of the beautiful mountains. Seeing the people lined up for hours to take a shower made me very grateful for the clean shower and toilet we had. I think of it as \"glamping\". The staff were very friendly, and gave us some great tips about the area. They knew I was really wanting to find a bear, and they were very excited for me, when I came back and told them we had found one, (high 5's and all).

Had a nice experience . The room though basic was clean and quiet. The pizza parlor had some very good thin-crust pizza. Plenty for leftovers the next day. The gift shop also had a nice selection of wine. The hotel staff was very helpful, maybe a little overworked, but still very nice. The location of the hotel is centered in park which is nice.If your looking for a hotel to hang around all day, this is not the place. If your looking clean quiet room to rest up after a day of hiking this is the place.P.S. Had dinner at Watsuchi Lodge. 100 dollars. Nice. The pizza parlor 25 dollars.

We saw they had pizza. So we thought we'd treat ourselves and save cooking on the grill for one night. There was only 1 table seated, eating. A couple in from of us waiting for a cashier. After 5 minutes, I told them to ring the bell (they were German I think). They did. Up until this point I was fairly patient. I'm on vacation. I'm relaxed. And I realize there can be staff shortages. So a few minutes later a very disgruntled employee comes from the back. She rings up their order (just a beer and a water!!!). She hastily took of the bottle cap from the beer, handed it to the guy. Three the cap in the floor in disgust and went to the back. Yes, we were in line. We would have liked to order pizza. After 7 more minutes, we just left. No one wanted to take our order!! Ridiculous! As we left, the lady at the cash register for the store said everything ok? I said the lady never came back to take our order. She said what? She left?! We said yes, and left.
