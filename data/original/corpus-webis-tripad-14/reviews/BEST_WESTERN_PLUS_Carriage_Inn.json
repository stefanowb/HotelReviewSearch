The first night we got there at 1:30am so parking was a little tight. The desk clerk was quick to come out and help us find a spot to slide into for the night. The rest of the time we had no problem finding a parking spot. The room was clean. It had 2 sinks which is a great plus. The beds were super comfy. We didn't have any problem with traffic noise. The pool and spa were well kept. Be sure to visit the Galleria just down the street. You can eat at The Cheesecake Factory, El Torito (happy hour is from 3-8 with cheap drinks and appetizers) and others. A Target store is also just down the street from this hotel. The only negative I could find was the shower head was old. No biggie!

Now the negatives: The fan in the bathroom didn't work. The hair dryer produced a little puff of air that was a little warmer than room temperature. My hair usually takes five minutes to dry. Here it took half hour. The worse was a loud pounding in the wall that we assume was caused by a water pipe that wasn't wrapped or whatever they do with them so they don't pound when someone turns on the water. It pounded intermittently until about 1 am, then began again about 6, meaning we had very little sleep. Parking is extremely difficult, as the lot isn't large enough.
