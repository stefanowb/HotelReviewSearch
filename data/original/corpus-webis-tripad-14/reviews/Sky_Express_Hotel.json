Big, comfy bed. Aircon was working well. Nice pillows. Hotel is right in the centre of anywhere i wish to go such as BB, BTS and bus station. There is also a nice indian restaurant next to the hospital serving cheap and good food. The downside is, hotel receptionists are unwelcoming. Especially this fat chinese lady who told me that i have to follow up on my ironing board request. I requested for it on day 2 of my stay, it didn't came. So upon checking out, i told the lady and that was the reply i got. I just politely informed her about the ironing board but she sounded sarcastic as if i must follow up again because the staff must have forgotten because they have alot of things to do. Your staff forgots guest's requests. So is that the guest's problem?! No apology made. Gave us a stucked face. I wasn't complaining. I am just letting you know. That's all. Same goes to the hotel staff by the name of Zamri, if i'm not mistaken. Please educate your staff to smile more and be polite. The ironic thing is that the security guards are way more helpful, showing us the directions and friendly. Overall bad service. Good hotel. Clean and huge rooms. Strategic location.

My main concern with the hotel is that after paying the bill we went to order a taxi to the airport and the hotel's transport person in the lobby said he would take us for the same price as a taxi. 90RM was clearly agreed and that is the price we had been quoted by taxis. When we got to the airport he put the squeeze on and charged us 98RM and kept the doors of the car locked until we paid.
