It does have some kind of musty/moldy odor about it. It took three tries to get us a room that was (barely) acceptable: in the first, the automatic key didn't work; in the second, the door didn't lock from the outside (!); in the third, the air conditioning didn't work well, but I managed to take off the front cover and jimmy around with a couple of vents, and got it to work ok), Housekeeping is so-so (at best), and far from thorough (lots of dust in the corners and along the edges).
