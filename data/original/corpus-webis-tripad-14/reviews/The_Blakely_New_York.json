The negatives are that we exepcted a more up-to-date room for $315/night but I am aware that we may not be adequately comparing it with other rooms in NY city and instead with San Fran rooms at that rate a night. The room has older (but beautiful) carpets and older-style furniture and we are used to more contemporary rooms. The other minus was that during 'rush hour' the elevators can take a good 5-10 minutes to arrive and so we ended up taking the stairs on more than one occasion.

Given we had booked in advance, directly with the hotel and paid full asking price, I felt they could have done a better job accommodating us.

Depending on which waiter you got made a huge difference. Sometimes we got coffee, sometimes we didn't.... The choices were basic and never changed, but it was ok. On our last morning, given we were flying from JFK back to Sydney, I wanted everyone to eat well, so asked my husband to order eggs (while I was finishing the last minute packing). I rushed to get downstairs, thinking the eggs would be going cold, but they had not arrived......and did not arrive! After watching another patron receive her cooked breakfast, my husband enquired if ours would be long. We were completely unimpressed when the Waiter apologised that he had \"forgotten\" our order. My husband was still relaxed about the situation, thinking he would fix it, but I knew what was coming....sorry the kitchen is closed now (because we had waited so long), so bad luck, there's a restaurant down the street.... On a previous occasion, we were all really tired after a very long day, and just wanted to go back to the hotel and use room service. I asked the lady who answered if there were any kids meals - \"no, we don't do that\". She suggested pasta with butter if we wanted something plain, and also advised they had pizza with diced tomato etc on it as a \"special\". When I enquired if we could just have ham on the pizza (ham was on the menu in some kind of sandwich) she sharply stated, \"we are busy with theatre patrons, so the kitchen won't do anything not on the menu\", so after agreeing to the pasta, she basically hung up on me! It was the worst service we got on our entire trip. The spaghetti arrived, swimming in butter and was awful. Thank goodness we had gone to Wholefoods and stocked up on fruit etc. If you want a decent breakfast go to Carnegie Deli.

While space comes as a premium in Manhattan, along with a premium price, the Blakely was a great value. Our suite gave us a way to have separate rooms with a generous bathroom and microwave and fridge as well (though half the fridge was full of mini bar temptations). The two TVs, comfortable beds and furniture provided us a very nice home for the week. We had to ask once to have the TV remote batteries replaced and for extra towels, and the hotel staff responded promptly and in a friendly manner to our requests. There is a breakfast included every morning at the hotel's restaurant Abboccato,. It is only a continental breakfast of bagels, small pastries, cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit, which served us just fine. I would like to see an additional offering of protein; even if it was hard boiled eggs or some cheese. The breakfast service is a little confusing in that much of it is self-serve, though the waitstaff appear to be in charge of pouring coffee and hot water, but at busy times are struggling to keep up with busing dishes and restocking foods. They are friendly and competent, but sometimes leaves the guest to wonder which items are self-serve and which are not. The 24/7 concierge service was very helpful and everyone went out of their way to provide us with personal service.
