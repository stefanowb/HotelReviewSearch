This was a typical Embassy Suites in terms of service (i.e., adequate, not excellent), but for the price, I think it was what I expected. The suite was very clean and nicely decorated, with plenty of room for all of us. The breakfast each morning was very good, with lots of selection. The hotel was very crowded, and the staff did a good job keeping things stocked and clearing tables. We never had to wait for a table. We attended the cocktail hour once, which was nice. We also went to the Italian restaurant once for dinner (Saturday night -- -we had not made reservations anywhere becuase we tried to go to ESPN Zone, but the wait for that was over 2 hours, so we decided to try the hotel restaurant). It was a bit over-priced, but the staff was friendly and everyone enjoyed the food. Not the best meal to be found in DC, but if you find yourself without a reservation, I would definately suggest trying it. As I said above, the hotel was very crowded, but I did not notice any noise once we were in our suite. The location is great -- a short walk to two different Metro lines, which gave us flexibility. Walking distance to Dupont Circle, where we ate a few meals and did some shopping. Really, the only negative that I can think of is that every morning the maid opened the door without knocking (the chain was always on, so she never came all the way in, but it was a disturbing way to be woken every morning!).
