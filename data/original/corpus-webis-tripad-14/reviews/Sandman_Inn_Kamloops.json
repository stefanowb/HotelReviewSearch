Our rooms were in a separate building over the way from reception in what looks like an apartment block, with external and internal access to the rooms. The rooms were hot (temperature outside was 32 degrees) but cooled down once the noisy window-mounted air conditioners were turned on. The rooms had reasonable facilities - the usual big TV, big comfy beds and a kitchenette area with fridge. For some reason only one of our rooms had a microwave and the cutlery/crockery in each room was limited and inconsistent; for example one room had a can opener but the other did not. No restaurant at the Inn; a diner adjoins the car park but we ate elsewhere.", "title": "Basic hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lucem", "date": "May 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5207421}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Noisy", "text": "OK if passing through but if doing the trip again would be tempted to look at some of the other travel inns nearby to see if value and customer service any better.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 3, 2002", "id": 710169}], "location": {"country": "Canada", "city": "Kamloops"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 31, "very good": 18, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 2}, "aka": "Sandman Inn Kamloops Hotel Kamloops", "slim_ranking": 0.698113207547, "description": "Motor Hotel located 4 blocks from downtown."}
