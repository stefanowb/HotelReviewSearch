From the moment I walked in I thought Wow! The lobby is modern and beautiful. We booked a premium room which guarantees a view of the bay. I thought the guy at the front desk was very professional and friendly. Our room was really nice and the bathroom was spacious and trendy. I will have to agree with the other reviewers on the sliding bathroom door. It doesn't close all the way, so it's slightly ajar. It was a big problem for us. If your shy it might be an issue. Even though we were on the 20th floor I heard the trains passing by. It was terrible, but I don't think it matters what floor your on. You can't get a way from the trains. Unless, maybe you book a room that faces downtown. Not sure. The view from my room was spectacular and worth the extra we paid. Since the hotel is right next to the convention center, you never know what's going on there. Thanksgiving morning I was woke up at 7:30am with bluesy music playing really loud. I thought maybe it was the people next door. I called the front desk and they said it was a concert going on at the convention center. I felt like I was about ten rows back from the stage. They apologized and offered ear plugs, which I gladly took. Thank God I was able to go back to sleep. So check the convention center schedule and maybe let that determine which side of the hotel you book the room. Again everyone was really nice. Oh, the beds are to die for. It was super comfortable and more soft than firm. I usually prefer firm mattresses but this was pretty nice. Slept really well except for the situation I mentioned earlier. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants. Everything is in walking distance of the hotel. Bars, restaurants, movie theaters, shopping. We didn't get into the car once. We parked across the street instead of valet which was $24. The parking structure was $8 per day. So if you're going to stay longer than two days with a car.

We had signed up on their website as a \"Select Guest\" which gives you a choice of things in your room such as extra pillows and choice of room preference and type of newspaper. If you sign up take advantage of the free beverage service in the morning and you can order a bagel or muffin for a few dollars extra. Everything we asked for was in the room upon arrival.

The location couldn't have been better for a visitor to San Diego; we were right on the edge of the Gaslamp quarter and we just needed to cross the road from the hotel to come across a wide variety of bars and restuarants which served great food and drink at quite reasonable prices. We were within easy walking distance from the shopping district and Seaport village which is on the edge of the bay and has lots of shops and cafes. Walking along the front of the bay in the sunshine was a delight! We were also able to walk to Balboa park and the zoo (which is spectacular and well worth a visit) - this took a bit longer (maybe 30-45 mins) however there is a tour bus which operates near to the hotel which does pick up/drop off along a lot of the tourist routes including the zoo.
