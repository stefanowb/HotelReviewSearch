Much of that is correct. Unfortunately in recent years \"discovery\" of the island has led to overbuilding, crowding and murderous traffic. Much of it is exciting, but to truly enjoy the experience of Bali, one must find a beautiful, serene corner which reflects all of the charm which Bali still possesses. That corner is without a doubt to be found at Villa Semana. Everything here fits well. From the custom designed villas, which are modern, but not too modern, to the wonderful, thoughtful and considerate staff, to the delicious food and above all to the glorious setting in a small valley over looking the river, with rice paddies on two sides. The hotel was designed perfectly for its setting, with lush vegetation and just the right sort of stone paths which lead you from building to building. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, but also distinctive, with refreshing private pools. . They could not be at a Four Seasons or whatever. They are local culture at its best. The Spa is delightful and outdoor massage above the river is enchanting. The The location is a 15 minute drive to Obud with a friendly and punctual shuttle service. Finishing one's stay at Villa Semana is never to want to leave. I have read most of the reviews and note that they are virtually all enthusiastic. The one or two which are not must be from people who do not understand the importance of taking part in a local culture. This hotel will not remind you of Miami Beach, and for good reason. It will give yo the complete Bali experience. There is no other option in Obud but this one.", "title": "Bali as it Should be", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "fordson61", "date": "July 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116067872}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed recently at Villa Semana for 3 nights for our 'babymoon' after having a negative experience with another villa close by. We were lucky enough that Semana had one villa still available last minute, and from the moment we arrived there, we couldn't have be happier. It is a gorgeous setting by the river, there is a feeling of peacefulness everywhere on the property. One of the main highlights of the place was the food, the chef was unbelievably talented, every meal was a delight visually and the flavours were incredible. The staff went out of their way to accommodate every request we may have, they truly understand how to look after their guests, nothing we asked for was too much for them. After often hearing 'sorry' at the 2 other places we had stayed at in Bali , where we had experienced many many misunderstanding and mistakes from staff, it was just so refreshing to see the high communication level by staff at Semana. Everything was done correctly the first time. I was also fortunate enough to have an incredible private yoga lesson on the deck next to the river which the resort arranges, the teacher is fabulous. The villa itself was nice. The villa pool was quite small, more of a plunge pool really with a little sun. We used the gorgeous main pool overlooking the river to relax by and swim laps which was ideal as we were the only ones doing so. We would highly recommend Villa Semana, and will certainly be back.", "title": "We loved the food, the staff and the serenity", "user": "JustMarried4", "date": "July 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116004845}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Villa Semana during the last 4 nights of our honeymoon and it was the perfect way to wind down our trip.

Villa Semana was the last and it made for a fabulous send off! Their spa is right on the river and hearing the river run while breathing in the fresh air during a massage is luxurious - a definite must do if you stay there. The staff (waiters, chef, drivers, owner, EVERYONE) was delightful and very happy to help. They had wonderful suggestions of sites to see and visit; we had something exciting to do every day and then we would return to our relaxing villa for the evening. The private pool is a great touch, though the water was a little cold for us. We did their cooking class with the executive chef, that was phenomenal - highly recommended.
