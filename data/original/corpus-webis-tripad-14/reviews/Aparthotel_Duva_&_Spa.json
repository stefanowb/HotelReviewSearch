The food was nice in the hotel and the staff are really nice too! we went all inclusive and it was really helpfull. Matt&Jen(the entertainers), they was lovely.

A few days in to our holiday we discovered the 'quiet' pool which is located across the road from the Fitness Centre. The pool is small with about a dozen sunbeds and three or four umbrellas however it was far from quiet with an abundance of children having a great time jumping in and out.
