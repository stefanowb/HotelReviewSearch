Room was OK, clean and comfortable. But I found it rather difficult to get some information from the front desk because he (only one person) was always busy doing something else. If you are not a first time visitor of Milan, it would not be a problem.

The one or two poor reviews proved to be completely justified, and left me questioning the reviews praising this hotel, espescially the one from India which was only last week. Upon arrival we were glad to see the proximity to the central station, and always remembered to bear in mind that we were paying very reasonable prices in contrast to other Milan hotels. The reception gave us a warm welcome and check in was smooth, until we were told our rooms wouldn't be ready for another hour! We were then told there was no Diet Coke, which amused me after reading the other review that also said this. Finally our rooms were accessible after an hour. SHOCK! I booked two junior suites and was given two twin rooms, small, cramped, one with a slanty-loft-style ceiling and windows 8ft high! the other with a bad smell and masses of scaffolding and construction outside! I couldn't believe it! I approached reception and experienced rude, poor replies. First they insisted our room was a junior suite, when i asked to see a double room they refused! Then finally they agreed to move our room with the construction and smell - during this room change i happened to notice housekeeping cleaning a room, with wooden floors and popped my head in - i wanted to scream - the photograph of MY junior suite, on their website was in front of me on a piece of paper - and i was standing inside the same room! SPACIOUS, wonderfully furnished, and huge bathroom - JUNIOR SUITE! Did i receive this room, that i was paying for and BOOKED ? NO, instead another pokey room was given to us. We decided to leave it and get on with our day, after all we only had two days. Location was good for the prices, and breakfast was ample - service receives no marks, except for one bell-boy who kindly ran out at 9pm to get us some pizza and other food as the restaurant offering room service was closed for refurbishment till september. In general i would only go back to the Andreola once they have reviewed customer service and satisfaction levels, and finnished all their extensive refurbishment - this hotel has great amounts of potential, they are half there. Unfortunately I am left disappointed.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "crave_mercury", "date": "July 12, 2004", "id": 2290689}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Start to Italy", "text": "Andreola was a great start to Italy. The hotel was a very pleasant surprise. For the price, the room was fabulous, nice and warm. The buffet breakfast very good (hot buffet including bacon and eggs).

The room was small and clean but the view from the window left a lot to be desired. We were treated to a view of a back court which was covered in scaffolding. Breakfast was good, however, the waitressing staff could look a bit more pleasant. One lady, with blonde hair, must have practised looking miserable because she did it so well! We saw several residents trying to communicate with her, and we can appreciate that she might not have spoken any English, but a smile is a universal barrier breaker. Food was beautifully fresh and replenished regularly. Orange juice was ok, but this is the usual in hotels abroad.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "CLEVERCLOGS", "date": "June 29, 2004", "id": 2228489}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2004", "text": "The bar man ran out of Diet Coke on the first night of our visit.

The only noise was from the local streetcar and it was minimal. The room was more than adequate considering the price which was much less than others in the area I had researched. The breakfast was very good with many options. The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. Our skis did not make our connection and the desk manager called and faxed British Air to make sure they would reach us in Switzerland ASAP. This was extremely helpful, as I did not speak Italian. This is not a 5 star hotel but more than adequate for our needs while in transit in Milan. I'd definitely stay there again. The cost of the room was as advertised -no surprises. Easy access to the trains as well as the shuttle to the airport and lccal subways. The restaurant the desk recommended was just a block away and was excellent.

It was a great little hotel! The room was small but nicely decorated and had many convenient features. The huge windows opened up into the center courtyard with those classic Italian style shutters. unfortunately, renovation was going on so it wasn't much of a view. Breakfast was included with our price and it was great! All kinds of really, really delicious pastries, prosciutto and other thinly sliced meats, all kinds of juices, excellent coffee...
