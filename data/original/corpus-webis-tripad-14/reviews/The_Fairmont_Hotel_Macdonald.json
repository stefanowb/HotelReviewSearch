For a real executive plus spouse, the layout of the rooms would have been great. However, for a family, I\u2019d look for something different next time. The room the kids were using had no cupboards, which made for clothes strewn all over (oh well, you\u2019d get this anyway) and they had to go thru our bedroom to get to the bathroom.

The hotel has a beautiful exterior-didn't see anyplace that looked near as regal driving through Edmonton. We stayed here with our young children and thus got a suite(can't remember-think it was called a jr suite. I called ahead specifically to confirm that the bedroom was separated from the living area by a door/wall and was assured it was. To our unhappy surprise, when we checked in our room (although it had a huge living room area) was not closed off from the bedroom-there was just a wide open arch. Since it was late and our kids were exhausted we kept the room. When I asked about my previous assurance I was told that some rooms do have a door but they were \"out of them\" for the night. I will say that the next day they moved us to a nearby suite that had glass french doors with sheer curtains that closed-much better. The rooms are elegantly furnished and our bed was very comfortable. The sleeper sofa in the first room,however,was very uncomfortable. Our small kids complained and we wound up padding it with a blanket-not what we expected for the price we were paying. Ate dinner at the restaurant on the patio and food was very good but service was excruciatingly slow. We ate breakfast at the hotel as well. The buffet was very pricey but very good and the staff very attentive(on our 2nd visit they carved little fruit baskets to look like flowers to the delight of our little girls).
