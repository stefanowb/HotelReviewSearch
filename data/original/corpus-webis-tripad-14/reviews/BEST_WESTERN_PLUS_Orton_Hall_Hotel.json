Dinner was good, and so was breakfast, and at first glance, our room was very comfortable and spacious. It was only at 04::00 that we discovered there were drawbacks to its location in the new block. Rowdy Scots next door neighbours with an addition to smoking arrived back their room tanked up on alcohol, and proceeded to go in and out to the exterior through the variety of doors, to light up and to chat. Every door closure, every movement, every (foul languaged) word was relayed to us in our own room, as if they were right there with us sitting on the bed. Whilst we don't blame the hotel for the nature of its residents, they do have a duty of care to ensure their guests have a night's sleep, if that is they want, and are not kept up through poor attention to acoustics, by those who don't want to sleep. Bleary eyed we made our way to the Duty Manager the following morning, who obligingly listened to what we had to say and considerately knocked \u00a325 off our bill.
