I had read all the reviews on Tripadvisor, and was only mildly concerned that our room would smell of cigarette smoke. However, when we checked in the woman at the reception desk asked if we wanted smoking or none, so obviously we took non. I didn't smell a hint of smoke the entire time we were there. We got the room with two queen beds and a pullout couch and it was HUGE! We had a full bathroom plus another countertop, mirror and sink outside so that 2 people could get ready at once. The television was huge, and we got lots of stations. There wasn't a fridge but we didn't need one. Ice was available upon request. We were on the inner courtyard so the view wasn't great but it was quiet at night. We didn't hear a thing from other guests. You could tell that it was newly renovated, but they kept the old feel with actual keys for the rooms instead of magnetic cards. We didn't fly out until 9pm on the 30th, so they stored our luggage for us at no extra cost, and called a car to take us to the airport. Slightly more than a cab, but it was much less of a hassle. (Too bad the flight was cancelled but that's no their fault :) ). The hitch was that when we got back to the room at 11:30 one night, there were posters in the elevator saying that by order of the New York public works the water was shut off until 6am. I think it was the whole block, so not the hotel's fault, but it was still an inconvenience. As far as location, we walked to Battery Park, South Street Seaport, and Ground Zero. The Subway to Times Square is literally right outside the front door, so that's easy. The Metrocard is $24 and good for a week.
