My French comprehension may not be the best, but we couldn't understand a single word the waiter said.

I was leery about eating at our hotel\u2019s restaurant again because I was sure the waiter would be spitting in our food, but he wasn\u2019t there. Instead, the waiter who served our wine was completely inept -- he only twisted the corkscrew twice and, of course, couldn\u2019t pull out the cork. It broke, then he tried to remove the rest of the cork with great effort and finally succeeded. He was so flustered that he put the bottle in the ice bag without pouring a taste or serving.
