We reserved and were charged a deposit for a small suite which is one large room, kitchenette, good sized balcony, etc. There are several buildings on the property. We booked over the phone and were assured of a beach front room. Upon check in we were offered a mai tai or glass of wine which is a nice touch. When we got to the room we were disappointed that it was directly overlooking the pool, not the beach. Called to request the room category we reserved and were told they were fully booked and no other rooms were available. We stated we expected the room category we had reserved and already been charged a deposit for and she said she would call back. She called back and offered us the exact same type room 3 floors above. We again stated we expected what we had reserved. She again stated she would call back. She called back and offered another room (strange since she had told us the first time nothing else was available) in a different building and it was beach front as we had reserved. The room was very nice but had some maintenance issues. A light fixture on the wall of the balcony was not only missing a light bulb but also missing any type of fixture that would cover the bulb so we were looking a metal electrical box. Some of the base molding in the kitchen was also missing. We were paying well over $300 per night (due to the holiday weekend) so these types of things should be maintained. Also,this is Florida in July and the rooms really should have ceiling fans. We checked out on July 4 and that morning requested a late check out. Same woman we dealt with over the problem of wrong room category at check in immediately informed us that they were fully booked and it wouldn't be possible. Seems to be her initial response to any request. We might possibly stay here again but would definitely have lower expectations. Like so many hotels they charge a \"resort fee\" which includes parking, internet access, daily newspaper, etc. A bad practice that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. None of these things ruined our stay, but it would have been more pleasant without them.", "title": "Nice at first glance", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Westshore", "date": "July 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 115185809}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Whilst the hotel was average but acceptable we are moved to warn of the very poor restaurant facil;ities within the complex.", "title": "A Real Rip Off'", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "sparjon", "date": "July 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 115120379}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We visited the 'Sands Pointe' restaurant which is the only restaurant on the main complex and situated beside the reception area.

We had a club-suite, overlooking the pool; recently renovated I'd say, with everything that you would need for a week in the sun. You'll probably go there by car, so shopping in the Publix supermarket a couple of miles up the road will be no problem. We did eat in the restaurants; light-bites were really good although limited choices, breakfast was fine but not special. Pool service was non-existent, but no problem finding somewhere to lie. The pool itself is weirdly deep - half of it out of my depth and I'm 6 foot. Beach was very nice, a few steps from the hotel, clean, loads of shells and you swim with the fish. Bicycles available to borrow, and plenty of other stuff to do if you get fed up with doing nothing. Not far from Armands Circle (a roundabout, in the USA!) which was a bit underwhelming if you are used to shopping UK-style. It is definitely NOT Florida's answer to Rodeo Drive!
