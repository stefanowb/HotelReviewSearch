The management was gracious and friendly and kindly agreed to let us leave our luggage until our room was ready. The room was immaculately clean with a comfortable bed, fresh linens, and an adorable balcony looking out onto a charming street in the Parte Vieja, very close to the beach, the hills, a 31 calle de agosto, the main strip for tapas-hopping. There were several excellent bakeries close-by as well as a convenient internet cafe a few blocks from the pension. The bathroom was clean and enormous and very close to the room. The fire alarm unfortunately malfunctioned and went off while we were having an afternoon nap - and as a result, the manager discounted our room to 30 euros, which we thought was very classy. An excellent find and I would recommend it to anyone.", "title": "Great value and location with friendly management", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PT1976", "date": "November 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6091208, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 price, location, cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "Great little pension in the middle of the old town in San Sebastian.", "title": "Great location", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "OrlaMcD", "date": "October 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4022620}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Really great location, and accomodation.", "text": "Our room (large) had a bathroom (large) and was very tastefully decorated.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 16, 2005", "id": 3570533}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nicely decorated, great location", "text": "It was also clean and the staff were extremely friendly.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Hdot", "date": "June 12, 2005", "id": 3545962}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Basque Country", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 19, "very good": 46, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 34}, "aka": "Pension Edorta Hotel San Sebastian - Donostia", "slim_ranking": 0.176470588235}
