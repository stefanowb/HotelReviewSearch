The staff were friendly and helpful. Honestly the only disappointment is that breakfast was supposed to have been included in the rate I booked, but the hotel would not honor it, saying that the rate was currently unavailable even though I had already booked it. A relatively minor thing, except it turned out the only other option for breakfast in the hotel was an omelette at NoMI that cost $40 with tip. That being said, it was a delicious and pleasant meal, and service was excellent. I look forward to returning for dinner. Getting back to what's important, though, the room was very large, modern and clean. The climate control worked well. Nice touches that were appreciated included electric window blinds; wifi (I still can't believe any reputable hotel would charge for it, and the Park Hyatt did not); a very large, clean and comfortable marble bathroom; a large bathtub and separate enclosed shower with two nozzles. The seventh floor fitness facility was excellent. It offered a surprisingly nice selection of good equipment and supplies like clean towels and fresh ice water with fruit and mint infusions. The locker room was also a very appropriate space. There was an overall clean, modern and luxurious feeling to the entire hotel. I wish I'd had more time to spend and hope I'll have the opportunity to visit again soon; next time for pleasure.", "title": "A beautiful Chicago hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Yatrik1", "date": "July 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134873719}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011", "text": "Stayed here for a medical conference.

As far as I could tell this is a normal room. The windows were enormous and had electronic controls to open and close (that were located next to the bed). All of the lights were electronically controlled too. The TV was large and in HD. It really felt like home. The room did not have a coffee maker, but in the lobby there was a pantry room with Nespresso machines and pots of coffee. The lobby itself was gorgeous\u2026Modern but with elements of understated art. The location of the hotel simply could not have been better. Turn down service each night was fantastic. Room service was prompt each morning and the food was well prepared. The restaurant NOMI (on the 7th floor) had a great view, but the food and service were not impressive.
