Its location wasn't the best as you had to walk over the hill to get into the town of Ibiza but there were lovely views from the street (you could see the Ibiza airport). We stayed only one night. It was odd that they handed you the remotes to the AC and TV (which didn't work in our case). They're not particularly helpful at the desk either. Surprisingly, the room we got had its own kitchenette (which we didn't use at all). The bathroom lighting is very poor (as was our room lighting). Luckily, we only stayed one night.

It is part of a much larger complex comprising two or three apartment blocks all grouped together.The (studio) apartment we were allocated was much larger than usual but with a side view balcony overlooking the run-down private apartment block next door and, through the solar panels on the Hotel Los Molinos opposite, a glimpse of the sea. There is a buffet restaurant and bar which we did not use and a small unsheltered swimming pool without any parasols that we could see. The Reception staff were uniformly friendly and helpful even though very busy with large parties of guests who seemed to be arriving day and night.The street and the rest of the buildings on it seem a bit run down and scruffy and there are a lot of empty properties which add to the vaguely derelict air. However, you are minutes from the Paseo Maritimo and the nearest beach is 150 yards away.The town of Ibiza is a 10 minute walk away over some pretty rough terrain, through a tunnel but iyt must be visited. There are still a large number of brilliant restaurants in Dalt Vila - fewer in the port area and the bars along the Calle de le Virgen are also good for a visit.There is a superb new restaurant on the Paseo Maritimo in Figueretas called Fusion which we would say is a must.All in all we felt that the Luxmar needs a bit of tlc but the location makes it worth considering for a cheap and cheerful break.", "user": "LeedsHelen", "date": "October 19, 2007", "id": 10135567}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "At first i was not impressed however we managed to upgrade to an Apartment with wonderful seaviews and a huge balcony.

Lots of things in the room didn't work although fairly trivial - a light, tv, hob ring. I found that because it is a large complex with people checking in and out constantly, the reception staff were not that friendly as they wanted to deal with your query quickly and move onto the next person. I heard one other English guest complain about the noise and the receptionist did not believe her. Believe me it is noisy!
