Stayed 3 nights - the 1st breakfast was $67.00, the 2nd $54 and the 3rd $47.00. This rate booked a standard Fairmont room, but at check in we were upgraded to a Deluxe room without even asking.

The Princess has everything from shops on the property to a centrally located pool. I stayed in one of their condo suites seperate from the main building. If you're a couple looking to get away from everything and everyone, the suites are fantastic. Enormous living room with fireplace, couch, dining table, and tv. The bedroom was huge with private balcony. And the bathroom was so big it was almost the size of the bedroom. Oh, almost forgot. The location is perfect. Right down the street from TPC Scottsdale (golfers) and shopping on the main drag is a 1 minute car ride away.", "user": "Dornoch22", "date": "August 2, 2006", "id": 5540267}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Another great experience with some reccomendations", "text": "We stayed at the Fairmont Princess July 10 - 12 to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary.

They also have a grassy lawn with crochet, badmitton, volleyball, and other games. They have a catch a release pond loaded with fish. You rent the pole for $5. And of course, there are several lovely pools. The pools were never crowded at all. We visited during the week, I expect they would be more crowded on the weekend.

I was glad we did not. The casita section is newer, but the casita section was a bit isolated and a short walk to the main resort. The pool at the casita area is very small, and felt crowded. The casita pool did have better complimentary amenities, water as well as lemonade and tea, as well as reading materials. The main pools are much larger, and only have drinking water. They do have poolside food and beverage service though. At the casita pool, you have to order through in-room dining. I did not like how the casita rooms patios were not covered. The standard room is NOT oversized, but was plenty of room for us. The room configuration is a bit unusual, the bathroom, closet and dressing area are at the front door, then there is a long hall way that leads into the bedroom and wet bar area and balcony. The room was very clean, and in good repair. The bathroom was roomy, dual sinks, separate tub/shower. I disagree with the other reviewer about the shower size. We were both able to fit in it just fine :) Our bathroom had a double set of towels on the towel racks and then a 2nd double set of towels folded in a nice basket. Our room had a lovely veiw of the lagoon and lawn area. In the evening we had a great view of the city lights.

We also sampled the pool caf\u00e9 food for a quick lunch, which as we expected was not as nice as the Bistro, but was good (especially since it was pool food).
