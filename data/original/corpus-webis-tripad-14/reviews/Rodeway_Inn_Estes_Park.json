There are not may hotels in Estes Park, CO. You have to book far in advance in the summertime or they have a 2-3 night min. stay. This hotel is over priced ($120.62 a night with tax) but your paying for the location. It is ok place to stay if your just staying one night and are not spending much time in the hotel. The beds are worn and we could feel the springs when we layed down on them. The carpet needed to be cleaned. The hotel was very busy but we didn't hear any noise. It is in a quite section of Estes Park and there are mountain views to the west. There is a dog park in Estes Park with lake access.

What another wonderful experience! Lil and her staff were awesome creating a relaxing environment for my players to enjoy the sites, relax in the pool and hot tub, and even get a little competitive on the pool and ping pong tables. The town shuttle took our team throughout Estes Park and the Rodeway staff was extremely helpful in explaining the sights and sounds of Estes. Susie and her husband gave us hints on which trails and roads were best at driving into Rocky Mountain National Park. What great hosts they were! They even opened a spare meeting room for my players to leave their bags after check-out time. You will not find a better location, better price, better accomodations, and the most charming town in America. Top this off with a caring and supportive management like Lil, Susie, and her husband and you will never want to leave. Last year, Team USA won the Colorado Basketball Tournament. This year, Team USA won the championship again. We are sure that, thanks to Rodeway Inn, three will be a charm next year!!! Thanks Lil and Rodeway.

We tried another hotel that told us they did not have any pet friendly rooms available for our date and asked that we check back in a few weeks (I asked what was going to change and got no response) While I appreciate the hotel for allowing pets, they need to spend some capital on room and facility renovations and not landscaping as it appeared they were doing. There were ceiling tiles falling out, the exterior entrance to the room did not work and the toilet tank was leaking water because the ball float was out of adjustment (I fixed it myself) Furnishings were very outdated. The grounds were unkempt and unfortunately other pet owners did not clean up the droppings. The AC unit was extremely noisy. Could not wait to get out of there.

Great value. They offered us buy one night get one half off. It looks like several hotel upgrades had taken place. The lobby was being painted. We had a room with a balcony and view of the lake. We watched deer right outside the balcony crossing the street. There is no elevator. The room was fine with two queen beds, tv and dvd, wireless internet access, microwave, fridge, coffee pot, and hair dryer all in the room. The first night we did experience another room nearby with a smoke detecter chirping in need of new batteries. It was quickly replaced and fixed prior to our second night. The indoor pool and jacuzzi is nice compared to other hotels in the area with outdoor pools. The water was heated but it was still a little cool. Still the kids enjoyed it all. There was also a game room with air hockey, pool tables, foosball, and video games-needed a race car video game though. I think a bar would be a nice feature at the hotel either in the game room or breakfast area. The continental breakfast was good. There was make your own waffles with batter, bagels, toast, cereal, oatmeal, and pastry choices. Orange juice, milk, and coffee. I would have liked to see fruit too, bananas or something.

I will say the staff, while polite, is not all that great. When we checked in, the phone reservation I made for one room was made for two rooms in the computer, but the lady fixed it right away with no problem. For the next two nights we had trouble with the electronic keys. On night #2, neither key worked. So I went to the front desk and waited behind two other parties. No clerk came (it was approx 9pm and I was very tired). Finally, I used the desk phone to call someone up, which is fairly ridiculous to have to do. The next night, more key trouble but at least one of them worked. The key thing was quite aggravating.
