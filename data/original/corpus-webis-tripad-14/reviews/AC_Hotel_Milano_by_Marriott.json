The experience was not bad but the hotel is not for fusspots who would not be very happy. This property in particular is one of the very fee high rise ones in Milan and is next to the Porta Garibaldi Station. In fact it is right next to an underground passage leading right under the rail platforms so for us it was perfect as we were leaving for Paris from the same station. Check in was swift and being a Platinum Elite card holder one of my rooms was upgraded to a suite. The decor and furnishings are modern style and the suite had a separate living room and a bedroom with a large bathroom having separate shower and a jacuzzi tub. Interestingly the soaps were football shaped ones - typical of AC Milano! The bathroom had toothbrushes, shavers along with anti fatigue creams and serums too. The minibar is complimentary and the free drinks were replenished at anytime if you ran out of the supplies. Buffer breakfast having hot and cold items was served for all free on the first floor. Internet access is not free but being Platinum Elite, I was given a voucher to use for an economy package and not the faster package. Nevertheless well appreciated as it was a 18 Euro voucher. The staff are so nice and helpful and nothing seemed difficult for them as it was their aim to make life easy and comfortable for the guests and they did an excellent job. There is a very good restaurant just next to the hotel called Grani & Braci which had fantastic Italian food at reasonable prices. I highly recommend this place. Although the location is a bit out of the city center but you could simply hop into tram 2 in front of the hotel and in 10 minutes you were in front of the Duomo. Also you can walk to the railway station through the passage and there you will find lots of shops, mini markets etc. Overall a very nice property and excellent staff. The only drawback is that the property does not have any connecting rooms at all which was an issue for me with my family.", "title": "22\u20ac for use of internet for 24h", "user": "Affirmation87", "date": "December 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 122299314}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lombardy", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Milan"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 67, "very good": 240, "terrible": 10, "excellent": 162}, "aka": "Ac Hotel Milan", "slim_ranking": 0.205069124424, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 3.5}}
