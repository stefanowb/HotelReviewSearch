Before I was in the top floor bungalow, and the bathroom was really bad, but the room was okay. This time, the cost was obviously more, but I stayed in one of the new rooms, not in the cottage bungalow section near the pool. Bathroom was much nicer, but the room was exactly the same, and so I was left disappointed at this. Breakfast was the same (even after 10 years), and so average.
