This hotel is beautiful, just 3-5 minutes from the train station and most of the restaurants and sports shops (and so a bit of a walk from the lifts). Most/all rooms have large balconies, with at least half having beautiful views of the mountains. Our rooms was clean, though not large. There was a full set of towels, including washcloths, and two good-sized bars of soaps (in contrast to what seems to be common in Europe). Our room was extremely quiet. The only negative was that the single blanket in a case, no separate sheets/blankets (this seems to be the standard in Europe). The \"continental breakfast\" was fantastic, comparable only to the best \"full American breakfast\" I have had in a hotel (Hampton Inn downtown Nashville).", "title": "Fantastic hotel", "user": "nehiker", "date": "July 6, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 34011952}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a beautiful hotel with a friendly, helpful staff.

We stayed here in mid Jan 2009 on our first family skiing trip. Two daughters (13 & 16) and my parents.Firstly and mainly the reason for writing a review is that this was possibly the friendliest and most helpful hotel we have ever stayed in. We generally stay in 4* plus accomadation but have never been treated so well as we were here.We are all vegetarians and this is always tricky wherever we go but not here. The waiter Arnaldo could not do enough for us.We had a five course menu which despite been set was tailored for us exceptionaly well with fresh pastas,risotto and vegetables on our menu every day.The chef is Italian which is great for us.There is little point in me expanding too much as there is nothing bad I can say about this place, read the previous review (12 Jan) as I agree entirely. The bar area is also excellent wth a relaxed atmosphere and comfortable sofas.

The hotel is in a remarkably quiet part of town, even though it is only 75 yards from the main street, the Bahnhofstrasse.
