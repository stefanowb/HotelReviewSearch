Part business, part leisure trip. The hotel is located in a quiet area but is within a 10 minute walk to Tottenham Court Road or Covent Garden (from there 5 minutes to Leicester Square, 10 mins to Piccadilly). Russell Square tube is 5 minutes walk away, Holborm tube is 8 minutes away. Took advantage of a 3 for 2 deal on a suite. Stayed in room 114 which on some of the previous photos looks horrifically over the top but, once we got over the crazy wall furnishings and managed to get the air-con to kick in (it was hotter than the sun in there when we first arrived!), was one of the most comfortable rooms we have ever stayed in. By no means was it the most spacious but the split-level arrangement suited us: VERY comfortable king-size bed, wardrobes to fit decent-sized cases in, television and a drench shower room on the upper level; on the lower level was a fair-sized sitting room with sofa, chairs, desk, coffee table, tv and mini-bar and wc with bath and shower. The room was at the back of the hotel looking out onto a private garden (unfortunately no access to this) but did mean a lovely quiet night's sleep. Also, you can log on using the hotel system or use your own laptop for free wi-fi access with this deal. Just a couple of gripes - breakfast was mediocre at best. We had arranged breakfast for the 3 days when we booked but after the first morning decided it wasn't worth the money (\u00a316.50 each for full English, buffet-style) or rushing to get down before it finished at 10am (in our experience, quite early for a London hotel catering for business and tourists). There are so many cafes within a five minute walk that will serve prepared-to-order food and allow you to watch the world go by. To give the hotel their due, when we checked out I pointed out that we had only taken breakfast once and they obliged by deducting 2 days charges off the bill. There is a little inconsistency with turn-down service and house-keeping. Not every evening were \"treats\" left at turn-down, tea and coffee supplies were replenished sparingly and towels seemed to disappear without being replaced. These are little gripes that aren't essentials, but for the hotel rating and tariff should be expected as the norm.

When we arrived we were shown to our room which was nothing like what had been described on their website. It was perhaps the smallest room I have ever stayed in, in London, and I have stayed in a number of 4 and 5 star hotels within the same area. The room did not have a separate sitting area as descibred on their webiste and there was barely enough room to put the cases down and be able to get out of the door! We therefore asked whether we had in fact been given the room grade that we booked and were told that this room was indeed a deluxe king, in which case, I can only presume that the rooms below this grade are only just big enough for one person. After some discussion, it did transpire that we had been given a king room not a deluxe king and there were no other rooms available for us to move to because we had arrived so late.

Of all the hotels chosen, the Montague was the only one that didn't fully live up to expectation. However, there is nothing really wrong with the place: the service was top-notch, and the location is very convenient. The public areas are attractively and elaborately decorated - no \"hip minimalism\" here! We walked everywhere (except to/from the airport), with the West End, Covent Garden, and the Holborn area all being easy walking distance. Rather, we felt slightly let down by the room we were given, which, despite being a Bloomsbury Deluxe King, which is supposed to offer more space, was surprisingly cramped. The fact is that our room (#203) was large for London (in this price range I have yet to find a spacious room in inner London), but a lot of the space in our room was occupied by an internal stair-case (cute on first viewing - bit of a nuisance thereafter), and a day-bed which we had to use as a place to put our second suitcase since there was nowhere else to put it. As an example of the tight nature of the room, we struggled to remove the hot-water jug from its shelf under one of the bedside tables: the tray with the jug, cups, etc. seemed to have been placed there via the 4th dimension. There was only a single, small-ish wardrobe for clothes storage, with no drawers. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was well-appointed and strangely spacious, and the view of the private courtyard garden behind the hotel welcome. There was free internet connectivity, and an in-room safe shoe-horned into the wardrobe. As we know London quite well, we didn't need to ask anything of the staff, but our brief encounters suggested that service wouldn't be an issue. Breakfast was OK, without knocking our socks off ... Perfectly adequate, but for this class of hotel, it would have been nice to see a little more imagination and variety in the offerings. There is an on-site gym, but it is secreted in the basement, at one end of the hotel, and is pretty small. I would consider staying here again, but I suspect the search will continue for our perfect London hotel. (I should add that I did raise the issue of the room size via e-mail with hotel management after our stay and they responded promptly and explained that there are a variety of rooms with varying configurations in each class.

M y colleague and I had to find suitable accommodations for a group of five while attending the Farnborough Air Show in July and searched Tripadvisor to point us in the right direction. What a treasure we stumbled upon. We arrived 3 hours before the official check-in. Upon arrival, some of the rooms were available for immediate check-in while a couple of us had to wait 30 minutes. We enjoyed the few minutes while chatting in the charming sitting area outside the breakfast room where we were offered a lovely cup of tea. Once I was shown to my room, I felt like I had just entered a room fit for a PRINCESS. Ironically, in jest my friends and family refer to me being a Princess. What a dream come true. I got the room that I fell in love with while surfing The Montague's website. My husband and I travel to Europe frequently and know the hotel rooms are typically small -- especially in London. I was mildly surprised to be shown to a cozy room with a queen size bed & two sitting chairs. Perfect! My room was on the main level facing the street (Rm 44). At first i thought it was going to be noisy outside due to the cars, but there wasn't a lot of traffic and the heavy curtains (once drawn) kept out the light and any street/sidewalk noise. A delicious breakfast was served every morning starting at 0700. Fresh fruit, yogurts, cereal, and bakery breads for those wanting a light fare. For those who had a hearty appetite, you could enjoy scrambled eggs, bacons, hashbrowns, sausage and pork-n-beans. The fresh coffee, tea and fresh-squeezed orange juice were divine. The staff greeted you with a warm smile and were very efficient. One evening we decided to go to the bar for an after-dinner drink. The outside space was a little too smokey (I have asthma), so we went outside in a very small courtyard where you can look at the \"kitchen herb garden\". There was no sitting area, but the young lady from the bar brought out three chairs and a small table from the sunroom area and served us drinks . How thoughtful!! She endeared herself to us from the get-go and during our week stay, we went outside to the quaint sitting area she set up for us. Every person we encountered during our stay was delightful. The only small item that detracted from my stay was the exercise room. I am a gym snob and am blessed to have a fully equipped gym in my home. The hotels exercise room had one treadmill, one exercise bike and one elliptical machine--all in one row. That's it. Some free weights, exercise balls, and a little extra space to perform yoga moves would have been nice as my bedroom was too small to perform any stretching exercises. That aside, I would stay at The Montague in a heart beat. Great location to Russell Square (The tube) an adorable park is just down the street where you can enjoy a picnic lunch or just lie in the grass. Plus, the number of GREAT restaurants just around the corner from the hotel was awesome. I can't wait to return and will definitely stay at The Montague.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 28, 2010", "id": 72751976}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights and i would certainly stay again. The location is perfect, Russell Square is a very quiet and safe part of the center of london. Tube and bus staions are a 5min walking distance. The decoration of the hoter gives you a very good taste of a traditional english house. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated, the beds are huge and you can sleep fine. Personally i would prefer a smaller bed so as to have more space to move in the room.
