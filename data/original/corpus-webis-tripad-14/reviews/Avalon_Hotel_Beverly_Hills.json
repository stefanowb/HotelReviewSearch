The $31 a day valet was a bit steep but the hotel staff was very accommodating bringing the car around anytime of the day or night. Wonderful service, great members of the staff, very accommodating. I feel valued at the hotel because they learned my name.

I was really blown away by the front desk staff that were down to earth, gracious and happy. So often you see front desk people who seem barely alive. I did not book direct as I used HotelTonight so I was concerned I might get a tiny room. They treated me like a VIP guest and actually gave me a couple of options between the two different buildings and went through the pros and cons of each. I choose the quieter building with the larger room. The front desk guy (cant remember his name but he was from CT) actually walked me to the room while telling me about the hotel. Again, great service. Its a converted apartment building but its very hip and cool without being pretentious. I didn't have a view; however, the room was very spacious and the bed comfortable. When I came down in the evening I was called by name and asked if I needed any help for restaurant ideas or directions. Just very nice to be recognized. I highly recommend this for a business or leisure trip for adults. Probably not great very young kids but older kids might like it. Also, the restaurant by the pool was excellent. Try the Kale Caesar salad if still on the menu.", "title": "Serene mid century perfection!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Gmabitt9", "date": "June 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 165691904}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Beverly Hills"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 30, "average": 57, "very good": 131, "terrible": 28, "excellent": 188}, "aka": "Avalon Beverly Hills", "slim_ranking": 0.642857142857, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Distinguished by its novel physical space, this Beverly Hills California luxury hotel is set around a dramatic pool terrace with private cabanas and the chic Oliverio restaurant- all just steps from shopping at the finest boutiques, galleries and restaurants nearby.Avalon Hotel Beverly Hills offers luxurious amenities, stylish accommodations, and creative meeting and event space in the heart of Beverly Hills, California.Inspired by the relaxed \"patio lifestyle\" of mid-20th Century Southern California, Avalon's 83 Beverly Hills hotel rooms, suites and penthouse studios offer guests comfort and style in the heart of Beverly Hills.Custom-designed and classic furnishings by Kelly Wearstler.
