A relaxed atmosphere, accomodation with the pool literally outside our door,(which we utilised nearly everyday) and a fantastic view of the mountains when we opened our kitchen window.The locals (being four legged kind, feathered kind or the meow kind) they added colour to the place, even the rooster at times needed more choke to get himeself going in the morning.The views at the beach was fantastic, the grounds were tidy & your staff always had a smile and a greeting. To your driver (Nga) when ever he was around always had a tale or two to tell (What a character this guy is, always a laugh with him.). To your kitchen & bar staff (especially Mata) she was just fantatic the whole time, ensuring the the needs of eveyone was taken care of. Happy hour on Friday nights is a really relaxed meet & greet all the other guest atmosphere, I really enjoyed not having to move as the ladies kept topping up your drinks as the moved in between guest.(Cheers!). Sunday BBQ's, if you decide to stay or book for this on a Sunday, you have 2 choices, steak or fish. Beware if you order steak, I'm surprised there is no health warning for the size they serve, I believe that 500 grams of steak is more than ample for 1, let alone my wife, who struggled to eat her steak, so I ate 1/2 of her steak so I had about 750 grams almost a kilo of steak.( In my eyes, that is a side of beef). I could go on and on, but, there is no need. I would just like to reiterate once more thank you Betsy, Nga and especially Mata and the staff in the bar & kitchen who were absolutely fantastic.
