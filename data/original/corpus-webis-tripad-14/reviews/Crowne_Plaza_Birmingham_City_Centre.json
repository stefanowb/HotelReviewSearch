I can now assure you that I will NEVER be back at this hotel. Our bed was FILTHY. Covered in short black curly hairs, crumbs, it was a mess. We called reception to have someone come look at the bed, and had a gentleman arrive at our door a few minutes later. His response upon inspection of the bed was \"the sheet shouldn't have come off..\" Excuse me, but your bedding is filthy so do not try and justify this by saying that the sheet shouldn't have come away from the bed. He then left us saying he would see if reception could change our room. We changed rooms, the manger who assisted was very apologetic and helpful, and we thought the worst of it was over. How wrong we were! This bed was even worse, covered in stains - I hate to think what the cause of these stains was! It makes my skin crawl. Again we informed the reception and the manager came back to the room with two members of house keeping staff to strip our bed and replace the linen. We appreciated the apologies however did not feel the \"I'd rather be anywhere than here\" mood from the house keeping staff was necessary. After our bed was changed, we thought we would venture along to the club lounge and enjoy a cup of tea before bed (it was already after 11:30 by this point, NOT how we had wanted to spend our Friday night there changing rooms), and when we entered the club lounge, my what a sight! Dirty wine glasses on every table, no cups, saucers or clean glasses available for drinks..
