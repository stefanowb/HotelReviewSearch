They had a nice little continental breakfast with the price of the room, which was only $75 for us. The location was perfect. We enjoy doing Bourbon Street and then getting away to a quieter place to sleep. Very short walking distance to everything the French Quarter has to offer.

Its location is very good- just off Jackson Square and within an easy walking distance of many neighborhood highlights. (Note: For people unaccustomed to sleeping in an urban environment, a St. Ann Street-facing room may be a bit loud.) The rooms were clean, adequately appointed but a bit inconsistent when it came to the details. For instance, weak water pressure in one room, an air conditioner that never got truly cold in another. Not deal-breakers but worth mentioning. What impressed me most at the Place d\u2019Armes was Lyn at the reception desk. My husband and I travelled with friends for this trip, and they made the hotel reservations. We didn\u2019t realize they reserved an interior double-bed room for us until check-in. (This interior room also had no window, which made it feel too cave-like for me.) We wanted a king-bed room but the hotel was booked solid for an orthopaedic surgeon convention. Lyn was proactive and accommodating. She searched the system for a room at the Armes, then called the Armes' sister hotels to check for availability (there wasn\u2019t any), then placed us at the top of the list for a room change. When a room became available the next day (at 8:45am!) she called us immediately and gave us the switched room at no extra charge. Real, quality customer service has turned into something of a rarity. Lyn at the Place D\u2019Armes is a terrific example that customer service is alive and well. Thank you for making our stay so pleasant. One more thing, their restaurant and bar suggestions (The Green Goddess, Eat and Port of Call) were all spot-on.

You get a lot of noise from the other guests as they leave their rooms, hang out in the courtyard talking and laughing ect. We found it a bit hard to sleep late in the mornings due to the noise. The other thing we noticed was the condition of the furnishings. Most of the items in the room were well-worn and could use replacing. The mattress was comfortable but the head board was pretty beat up. The TV was an old model with reception you would expect to find without cable, although it WAS cable TV. We didnt spend much time in the room anyway but the lack of clear reception and the lack of a flat screen were noticable.

It is wonderful to be so close to the beignets both in the morning for breakfast, and late at night for a bedtime snack. The hotel's courtyard is one of the best (maybe even THE best) in the Quarter. It is huge, and divided into several sections which gives an opportunity for private enjoyment. The pool is bigger than most in the Quarter as well. There are full-grown magnolias surrounded by lush landscaping, which lends a perfect connection to nature after a long day exploring the city. The morning croissants are wonderful, and I have a sneaky suspicion that they are procured from another Quarter favorite, the Croissant D'Or. Personally, I love the windowless rooms, for the same reason that I prefer interior rooms on cruise ships--- they provide complete darkness for sleeping, and after a typical late evening on Bourbon Street, the darkness can be a welcome friend. Also, these rooms tend to be very quiet. I haven't stayed in a room overlooking one of the neighboring streets, but the hotel is in a quiet part of the Quarter, a full 1.5 blocks from Bourbon Street. But even that part of Bourbon Street is much quieter than the area between Canal Street & St. Peter. I can't imagine street noise being a problem at Place D'Armes. It is only 1.5 blocks to Cafe Du Monde, with access to the the riverfront only another short stroll, and the French Market begins only a block past the Cafe. The amazing new restaurant, Stanley, is only a few steps from the front door of the hotel. Muriel's is next door. The treasures of Royal Street begin 1/2 block away.

Our rooms were on the main floor courtyard level. When we walked in, we found our room to be a (2) room suite. The bedroom had a king bed and beautiful exposed brick walls and high ceilings. A large bathroom was in the hall which lead to a large sitting room, again with exposed brick walls, couch, chairs and desks. My sisters room was one large room with a large bathroom. it was a king room with high ceilings and the most beautiful exposed stone wall I have ever seen.

The bed was extremely comfortable, as was the pillow. My room was on the 3rd floor in the rear left corner, I think 323. This room had no windows. Some may think that this bad, I loved it because my room was pitch black and I had the best sleep!!! The court yard is very old and cozy, you can tell the bricks have been here for a long time and have seen many travelers and history. The pool is small but good enough for cooling off and was sipping a drink in. I do study up on hotels in NO and know that this is a haunted hotel, even though the staff denies that there are ghost. I was hoping to hear something or see something strange, but nothing on this trip. This was a school for boys at one time and burnt during one of the fires of NO. Several children died as well as the school's headmaster. There are many stories that refer to people hearing noises of children or even seeing the headmaster. As for location you are steps from Jackson's Square and 2 blocks from Bourbon. There are a few other hotels that have a slightly better location, but this one is slightly off the main road to avoid hearing the noises of people partying yet close enough to make it to Bourbon with out your drink getting warm in the process. The bell hop was very nice, and worked hard for his tip, the front desk lady was polite and nice, as was the one who check me out. For the price <$140 you get a very charming and quaint hotel with a nice courtyard for relaxing in. The parting was $30 but you will be hard pressed to find cheaper in a secure location so don't worry too much about it. Now I could not connect to the wifi with my Ipad, but I was not too concerned with that due to the fact I wanted to disconnect and walk the Quarter. I am sure that I could have went to the front desk and they would have walked me through the connection process if needed.
