Hallstatt is like a magical fairy land, with the most spectacular views imaginable, and I was lucky to have a room at the Heritage with its own little private terrace, where I could sit with a book and a glass of wine and take in the beauty of the lake and mountains. I had the handicapped suite on the first floor, so the bath was huge. The bad side of this is that the room was right by the bar, and there was some laughing and singing into the late hours that kept me awake. A minor inconvenience compared to the great view.

We stayed at the Heritage Hotel in Hallstatt for three nights earlier this month, in a Junior Suite on the 5th floor (really the 3rd floor... but that's another story). We had a lovely view of the lake. The hotel was pristine. The people remarkably friendly. Breakfast was included and was a really nice spread. We were there for three nights, but I really wish we'd stayed a night or two more. Hallstatt itself is a pretty little town with incredible history, and there is a lot to do around there, even with our nearly-4 year old daughter. We went on the Salt Mine tour and also an ice cave tour, and spent a lot of time just wandering around the little village. There's not much there, which is just perfect.
