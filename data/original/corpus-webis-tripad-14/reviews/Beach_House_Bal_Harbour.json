I was a bit nervous after reading the spotty reviews, but it was all fine. The common areas of the hotel are fabulous - great places to read and hang out, cool bar, lots of sofas, amazing beach/pool area, and right on the ocean. Staff was really nice and accomodating, for the most part - valet guys are particularly great. The food at the restaurant is good and decently priced - the pool bar drinks are really expensive, but it's a vacation hotel so that's to be expected. The rooms are smaller and not super luxurious, but they are perfectly adequate. This hotel is older and is not what most people would expect at a four star place, but - at least when we booked - the prices aren't four star either. We got a standard room and were upgraded to a suite and paid about 90/night, including taxes. Overall, it's a fine hotel - not super new, but perfectly clean and pleasant. What makes the hotel great, though, is the physical location - on the beach (literally) and couldn't be better for people who don't want the craziness of south beach (which is a 10-15 minute drive) but who want a beach vacation. We had a great time and it was a bargain at what we paid.", "title": "Great Deal", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "sara_em", "date": "May 19, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3487412}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "amazing place!!", "text": "Why the bad reviews people??? when I stayed here the building next door was being demolished from sunrise to sunset but it didnt ruin my holiday at all!!!

The unhurried pace of the place left me feeling replenished at the end of my three night stay in an oceanfront suite, which for $199 per night is unheard of in South beach or other areas of miami beach. We found the place simply wonderful. From the moment we checked in, the staff treated us as I have only been treated in the caribbean. They were courteous and extremely helpful in making us comfortable. As a matter of fact, I felt that I was in someplace other than the tourist trap of Miami Beach. I forgot I was in Miami at all. Yes, the rooms arent luxury, but the plantation style, Ralph Lauren- designed furnishings make you really feel as though you are in someone's beach house in a relatively quiet part of the beach. In one of the large hotels on the beach, you dont feel like you have retreated, only that you have traveled. This is one of the few times that I have returned from a vacation relaxed!!!! At the beachhouse, I felt like I was at home. I could walk from my room to the beach in bare feet and a towel and feel comfortable. The place is small and intimate enough that I had no reservations sending my pre-teen kids down to the pool and the beach unsupervised. The rooms were very spacious and airy. There is a supermarket across the street where we bought fruit ,cereal, and juices for the kids. Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Tiffanys are just a short three block walk north. Bal harbour is the ritziest part of Miami Beach. No bumper to bumper traffic and the crowds found in the over-rated south beach. Shopping and fine dining are all within two to three blocks.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 1, 2005", "id": 3728749}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "WONDERFUL!", "text": "The staff are wonderful especially the bartenders and waiters.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 27, 2005", "id": 3706186}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "It's a shame that the hotel has been sold and will be torn down for another of the monstrous high rise glass condos that are going up all over Miami.
