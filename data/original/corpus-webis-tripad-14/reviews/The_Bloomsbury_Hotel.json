We are both able bodied. We booked a superior room and were allocated room 319. The bathroom is kitted out for disabled guests (good point generally) which means the bathroom is a wet room for ease of access (good point again). Unfortunately, when you use the shower it is difficult to contain the water within a reasonable area (bad point). There is also no view as the room looks into a small inner courtyard (bad point again - why should disabled people not have a view too?). However, what really killed this room was that there is some sort of air duct/vent that runs directly above the ceiling and it is very noisy. We rang reception just before midnight and they sent someone up who told us it would eventually switch-off - it didn't, which made for a very sleepless night (very bad point). On the other hand, by the time we went to reception the next morning we had already been allocated a new room (422) and were offered many apologies (but nothing else - even a complimentary glass of wine would have been appreciated ). Our new room was much better (although even here there was another noise coming from something mechanical in the ceiling but which was less intrusive and only intermittent). Great Russell St is not in itself a pretty street but the overall location is excellent for West End theatres, shops and restaurants as well as accessing all that Marylebone, Camden etc have to offer. Generally, everyone at the hotel was very polite. There is an elegant reception/foyer that exudes a real \"upmarket\" feel (as good as, for example, the Goring Hotel). Although there was a Christams party being held on Saturday night we heard nothing of it from our room. Breakfast is not cheap (\u00a315 for continental and \u00a321 for English) but what you expect to pay in this location. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. Would I stay again?

Another average 4-star London hotel, neither great not poor. On the positives: Very good location, just next to Tottenham Court Road station and a few minutes by cab from Covent Garden, the Strand, Oxford Street or London St Pancras station. The bed is fine and clean. Good eggs Benedict at breakfast. Free WiFi and newspaper including the Financial Times. On the less positives: Small room, no view, noisy room fridge, clogged sink in the bathroom (as reported in a previous comment - that is just unacceptable). The bar and breakfast room are located on the lower ground floor, meaning no window / natural light. Staff is OK (95% international, mostly from Eastern Europe), but not exceptional and not passionate: just doing what they need to do.
