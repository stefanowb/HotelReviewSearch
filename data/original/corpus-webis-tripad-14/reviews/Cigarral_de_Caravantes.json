The highlight for us was the private terrace offering a marvelous (if a bit distant) view of old Toledo (see photos). Each room has its own terrace with the Toledo view. The room itself was average size (not tiny), with a comfortable bed and modern bathroom (shower only, no bath). The small pool was very refreshing following the mostly uphill walk back from old Toledo. The hotel also has 2 or 3 large terraces with tables and chairs, but we\u2019re not sure if they have service. (So you can save money by bringing your own snacks and drinks?) There is small bar in the (nice) lounge, but again we\u2019re not sure about the service \u2013 we didn\u2019t see any.
