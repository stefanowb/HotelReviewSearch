The location is very good, a short walk from St Stephen's green and if you don't like walking the tram is on the doorstep for a very reasonable fee (1.60euro during our stay). The rooms are clean, comfortable and a nice size for a standard room, the toiletries are nice and toothpaste and brushes are available from behind the front desk which the staff were more than happy to get for us. Breakfast was delicious a great choice and definately worth the little extra you pay. Complimentary apples and ice are available in the hallway of each floor which was a nice touch. We very much enjoyed our stay, it was a real highlight of my trip and I've stayed in a lot of hotels. The only thing I would change if I could would be to put a sachet of hot chocolate on the tea tray in the room but that is all.
