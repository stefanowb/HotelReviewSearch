The toilet in one of the rooms sprayed water all over the floor and shower when flushed and the wall paper in one of the bathrooms was peeling off.

Fast forward seven years and I discovered that the Saga has new owners/management. They gave us a room at the front of the complex near a busy street - the wonderful sounds of traffic! The room seemed fine at first, but there was a draft. Ah, there looked to be a one inch gap between the bottom of the front door and the door sill. Good thing it wasn't winter! I then took a walk to the bathroom - Yikes! It looked as if the bathroom had been remodeled about 50 years ago. It was grungy and ready to fall apart - tile falling off the shower area, stained sink, rusty fixtures, etc - I was afraid to go into the bathroom again! Sheeeesh, this room was definitely not ready for motel guests.

At first the room was fine not the best ever but not the worst so I thought. Having a two year old she spilled chocolate milk on the bathroom floor being that you only get white towels in a hotel I wiped it up. The next morning I find ants all over the bathroom floor okay I say no problem I will call the front desk and ask for them to come clean up. I am then told that they do not come clean the rooms, they tell us to bring our dirty towels to them and they will give us clean ones. My husband brings them the dirty towels and the lady YELLS at him for the towel having the chocolate milk on it. He then informs them of the ants and they say I will spray. They come into our room and spray raid on the bathroom floor mind you I have a 2 yr old and a 7mo old who crawls on the floor. Then they give my husband a broom to sweep the room out himself to rid the room of any other ants, And then they YELL at us again for not bringing the broom back to them. We then decide since they do not clean that we will put out our do not disturb sign. They still enter our room several times unannounced. We would come back from being out on the town and find things in our room missing such as our alarm clock (yes it is theirs but they just came and took it from our room). We have come back several other times to find the room has been entered with the DND on the outside of the door. and they did not do anything in our room other then dumb the garbage and put grocery bags from food that we bought back in the trash can and pick our dirty towels up off the floor and hang them back up. One day we are outside with our children playing on there so called playground and they ask my husband to do some work in the parking lot for them telling him that they would pay him. He did the work but never received any pay for it. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND STAYING HERE TO ANYONE!!!!!
