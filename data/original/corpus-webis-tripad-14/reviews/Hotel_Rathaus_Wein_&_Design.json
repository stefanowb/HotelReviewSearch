I was concerned that it would not live up to the reviews/online description but it did. The service was excellent with warm and helpful staff--available 24 hours--who seemed to think a step ahead of you to make your stay comfortable and easy from local recommendations to providing train tickets to arranging airport transfers. I was very happy with my room--spacious, well-lit with large windows, very well air-conditioned during a quite hot summer week, and of modern design. Importantly, the room was also very quiet helping me quickly get over jet lag. The wine bar in the evenings is a lovely space to wind down at the end of the day while sampling local wine and the breakfast spread is really wonderful as others have described. The lounge also has a great collection of tour books for guests to use. I was traveling for business but the location is ideal for both work (close to many different subway lines) and for leisure (short walking distance to the museums and a pleasant 15 min stroll to the city centre monuments).", "title": "stylish and comfortable boutique hotel in vienna", "user": "leonine76", "date": "July 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 72272163}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I would look forward to staying here again.", "title": "Loved this top hotel", "user": "meph", "date": "July 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 72214565}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "just getting ready to check out of this fantastic hotel..", "title": "Great hotel with excellent staff", "user": "howard0928", "date": "July 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 71237928}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled on business", "text": "- very quiet and comfortable room overlooking the courtyard.", "title": "great service, great location", "user": "johan_belgium", "date": "June 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 68858401}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "- service we experienced as excellent: all our questions are requests were replied promptly, efficiently an with a smile. the girls give you the impression that you are a valuable customer and not just a tourist passing by", "title": "Exceptional Service", "user": "GC_AED", "date": "June 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 68827555}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "- beds and pillows: good quality", "title": "Great Value, Great Services", "user": "LuvtoTravel514", "date": "June 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 68347894}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "- A/C worked perfectly", "title": "Superlative stay", "user": "Chattatraveler", "date": "June 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 67367648}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled solo", "text": "- wired internet, very fast.", "title": "Love this hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "failler", "date": "May 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 65968265}], "location": {"country": "Austria", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 16, "very good": 94, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 440}, "aka": "Hotel Rathaus Wein And Design Wien", "slim_ranking": 0.0136239782016, "description": "An unusual hotel concept in Austria\u2019s capital, Vienna.
