We opened the door to the most beautiful 2 bedroom suite!! This entire place was floor to ceiling windows looking out on the most beautiful views of the mountains and golf courses. The room had tvs everywhere, in each bathroom (along with phones). The tubs were deep and large with jacuzzi jets and a water jet for your neck. The showers were large and the master bath even had multiple heads with a variety of settings. I had 2 nozzle continually oscillating back and forth and you could adjust their speed and intensity. The furnishings were beautiful, all the wood dark and attractive and there was a bar that sat 8 people. We could not have been more excited and we had booked for 50 dollars. I did not want to leave, it was just so beautiful, especially during the day staring out at the panoramic view. Some people want to stay on the strip, this place was wonderful and seriously not more than a 10 minute drive from the strip and they have a free shuttle to take you there and pick you up. The casino downstairs was a nice size and I played a little down there also. i was continually amazed at how everyone I dealt with from the check in clerk to the woman I purchased my bingo game from were just consistently nice and helpful.
