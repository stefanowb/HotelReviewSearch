In any case, the White Barn does not deserve 5 diamonds or 5 stars for either cuisine or accomodations. On this occasion, we took a suite in \"Mae's Annex,\" and though it was priced at the top of the range, it was the most junior of junior suites -- one room with a sitting area, plus bath. I would agree with the reviewer who found the accomodations poorly maintained. The wall-to-wall carpet in our room badly needed cleaning or replacing, and no amount of faux-elegant over-decoration-distraction can compensate for things like a deafening A/C and a TV visible from only 1 side of the bed (and not at all from the sitting area). The wood-burning fireplace was badly in need of a chimney cleaning -- the heavy odor of the dirty flue assailed us whenever we walked between the fireplace and the A/C, and by the end of our stay, our respiratory systems were distressed.", "title": "Kennebunkport's White Elephant", "helpfulness": 24, "user": "ThreeRosettes", "date": "July 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5492891, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 This property is vastly overrated.

To put this restaurant in the same category with a place like Jean-Georges in New York is laughable and makes me wonder how ratings are acquired. The dinner tasting menu, which we had with wine pairings, lacked the least subtlety and its presentation was far from artful. (We had to request to see the current tasting menu; the waiter said that they were \"so busy\" that they weren't putting it out in all the menus, but that we could have it if we really wanted it [$190 each].) I wish we had just left at that point. The sauces were among the most heavy-handed I have encountered anywhere and there was no magic to the tastes, no pleasant surprises. The \"included\" breakfasts were grudging -- the spongey quiche was the worst I have ever had, and the omelet was no omelet at all but a rubbery, heavy, steamed egg pancake straight from the steam-table, barely able to fold over to enclose a tablespoon of lobster ($19 surcharge). Two things any first-class restaurant should be able to handle are quiches and omelets, and the White Barn can do neither. To return to the White Elephant in Kennebunkport would be throwing good money (and a lot of it) after bad, something we will not do and will discourage for anyone considering a visit there.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 7, 2006", "id": 5040108}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "above par", "text": "I went to Breakwater Inn hotel with my husband just for a night, as we were travelling through the USA on vacation.
