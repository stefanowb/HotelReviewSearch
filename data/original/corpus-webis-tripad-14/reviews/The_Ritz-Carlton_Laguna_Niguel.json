I was greeted warmly by the bell staff and front desk. My room was a 1st floor room overlooking the pool. I was not disappointed at not having an ocean view, since another company was picking up the tab for my room, but I did have a problem with the apparent lack of privacy! My room only had a very flimsy see through curtain. I felt as though I needed to change clothes in the bathroom so the pool patrons did not get an eyeful, and the outdoor security lighting, moon, and morning sun made it nearly impossible to get a quality night's sleep. The bed was very comfortable, however, but I wished for a dark curtain to get that \"black out\" hotel-room sleep! I'm not sure if my room was just missing a second curtain, but my attempts to find out why were met with perplexed staff, some of whom said that the morning sun waking up guests was part of the design..
