However, the door had been forcibly busted in and the door jamb was broken at the lock area. Also, there was no strick plate mechanism in the door jamb so the deadbolt was simply in an empty large hole. Absolutely no security with the door locked. Fit so loose that you could see day light around all sides of the door. A 3 year old could have kicked the door open. The clerk was sheepish when we complained about the broken door but no other rooms available. I complained to the manager the next day but he just laughed and said he would send someone to fix the next day. I let them know I didn't believe him, because the door had been broken for many weeks, if not months. Also, the wireless internet didn't work. I complained to the manager, who was apparently lying when he responded that he had never had any complaints about the non working internet.

The owners told us when we made the reservations that could leave our trailers there while we traveled on our bikes. When we arrived we were told differently. So, we went to the police department across the street to find out what the street parking laws were. We were told we could leave our bike trailers in the street for six days. When we informed the owner our intentions he became rude and told us this was his parking. He actually thinks he owns the streets! We left the vehicles and trailers there for two nights because the police went and spoke to the owners and told us they would keep an eye on our vehicles and trailers. Upon our return our \"confirmed\" reservations had been cancelled by the owners because one of the women we were with had an accident in the bed due to her monthy visitor. The owners had actually called the police and said we were leaving them a sign of sorts, so they took the liberty to cancel our rooms. FYI: The Hurricane Police department actually has a special task force to deal with the motels and hotels there because of the customers being harrassed. I will never stay there again. The rooms do not look like the pictures listed. The harrassment ruined our vacation and the owners never contacted us even though the corporate office said they would within 7 days.
