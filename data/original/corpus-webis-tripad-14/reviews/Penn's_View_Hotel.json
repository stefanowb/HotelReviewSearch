The service and staff were excellent and views of Penn's Landing were great. This hotel is in the perfect place to visit and see the history of Philadelphia. The attractions are right outside the door. The bar was fantastic and so was the breakfast. The room was just as the website described and much more sound proof than expected. We both had a good night sleep and really enjoyed our room. I would recommend taking a Sunset sail cruise about 3 blocks away (American Sailing Tours) and if you like adventure try the Detour Segway tour through Philadelphia, both were very fun and exciting.", "title": "Philadelphia, PA", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "rkemske63", "date": "June 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 163388246}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The only disappointment was the parking for the hotel.

Be advised that Penn's View is also situated next to I-95, but the double-paned windows and thick walls make you forget that unfortunate proximity. The staff is attentive and obliging, the restaurant is deliciously indulgent, and the speciality cocktails definitely worth sampling.
