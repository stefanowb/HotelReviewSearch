There was a TGI Fridays built on the side of the Doubletree hotel we did eat in there a few times & the staff got to know us & we had a good laugh & joke with them all, the staff at the hotel were very nice & the hotel itself was very clean, but the carpets in the hallways do really need changing as they were old & worn, but we really enjoyed our stay in this hotel & would not hesitate to stay here again.", "title": "Would stay here again........", "user": "RickyTutt", "date": "August 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 74142827}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Location was downtown but had to pay extra $ for parking.

Above that shower area was a noticeable water damaged area on the ceiling.
