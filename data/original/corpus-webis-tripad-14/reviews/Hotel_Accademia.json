We did not have a reservation and walked there from the train station. Using Rick Steves book, we chose this hotel. We were pleasantly surprised when the desk clerk said it would only be 80 euros, but then we were put in room #2 overlooking a busy street. We thought we could handle the street noise, but around midnight, the samba club directly across the street started picking up. Around 3:30 am, my husband and I got up to look out the window because the noise was getting louder and louder. There were probably 100 or more partiers in the street directly under our window. Music, sirens, singing...it never stopped. The next day we moved to the delightfully quiet Residenza Il Villino and then wasted our first day in Florence napping at our new hotel. The Hotel Accademia was not on the side of the tourist area I would have preferred to stay on - Florence is nicer closer to the river or north of the duomo. The bed was uncomfortable. Things were clean, but the bedding was old and we had a hard time trying to figure out how to turn off the light in the bathroom. The staff was very nice, however. Not the worst hotel ever, and if you had an interior room it might be okay, but I would not stay here again.", "title": "Noisy - could not sleep at all!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "lewishogs", "date": "March 21, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3291712}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Okay for the money...", "text": "Stayed at the Hotel Accademia for 3 nights in mid November 2004.

However, the room was among the most plain-looking of those we stayed in, and the bathroom left something to be desired. It was the only in this price range in which one shared the shower with a toilet. The floor plan, as Rick Steves mentions, is boggling and a little annoying for the tired traveler.
