The deal included breakfast, unlimited golf, and a 20% off coupon for dinner at the resort. We (my husband and I) stayed Sunday Sept. 2nd and left on the 3rd, which was Labor Day weekend - surprised this wasn't blacked out for the deal. We golfed a round of 18 holes on Sunday afternoon and again Monday morning before we left. The golf course was probably a 3 on a scale of 1 - 5.The grounds were really nice; felt like I had stepped back in time to the 1950s. The resort consists of an inn and cottages. We stayed in the Inn. Our room, Room #24, had a beautiful view of the harbor. It reminded me of a B & B room - nicely decorated, big, comfy bed,lots of closet space and hangers, good AC, and huge soft towels. Two negatives - no fan in bathroom and no full size mirror. The room was a bit outdated but that's part of the ambience.Right outside our room, you could go out on a balcony which again overlooked the harbor. There happened to be a wedding reception right out side our room Sunday afternoon - kind of fun looking at all the guests. Another negative about the inn was there were no ice machines; you had to go down to the lobby and it took forever to get ice.The lobby and sitting areas throughout the inn were neat. lots of historic pictures of the resort and antique furniture. We were also invited to a welcome reception Sunday evening where wine and hors-doevres were served for about an hour. We enjoyed walking around the grounds and also found a path that goes around the lake a little ways. Enjoyed a beautiful sunset - very romantic.", "title": "Depends what you are looking for \u2026", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Puggy_2005", "date": "July 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 8230510}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Don't miss this unique opportunity to relax with your family & pets.", "text": "We had a fantastic July 4th holiday at Basin Harbor.

They set up a large tent next to the lake, plus tables near the lake, for a wonderful dinner. The property has beautiful flower gardens, which my wife enjoyed on a flower tour.
