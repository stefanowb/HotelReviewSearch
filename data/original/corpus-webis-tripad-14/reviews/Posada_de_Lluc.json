You get one glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, and if you choose coffee you get one cup of that too. We heard one guest ask for more orange juice and the response he received was not the most enthusiastic. To eat, breakfast consisted of two small slices of meat, two slices of cheese, a croissant or Danish pastry, a bread roll and a small piece of dry bread. Yogurts, fruit and cereals were also available. In addition to the above, eggs were offered on a daily basis, but they alternated between being fried, boiled or scrambled.

When we approached the manager, Joana, in her office, asking if we could pay the bill, the response was downright rude. She made it very clear that we were intruding on her \u201cafternoon off.\u201d She turned off her TV, slammed her paperwork and books down on the desk and very rudely shoved the credit card slip under our nose for signing without saying a word. At no time during our stay did she ask us if everything was ok. Upon leaving she did not wish us a pleasant journey or thank us for staying. She made it very clear that she did not want to bother with pleasantries but just wanted to take our money. In our opinion, Joana did not make a very good hotelier in this respect.
