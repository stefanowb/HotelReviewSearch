The hotel is an easy walk from Termini rail station and is convenient to central Rome at a great price. The outside of the building makes no mention of the guesthouse/pensione on the inside other than a small nameplate next to the buzzer. Three buzzes and three floors later I was there! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, going out of the way to get me settled in and ensure that I was able to meet up with my friends. The room was basic, but spotlessly clean with satellite TV and remote control thermostat. If I were spending all of my time in the room, I would have chosen another hotel, but for a clean, comfortable place to sleep at a great price, I'll be sure to return when I'm in Rome!", "title": "Great for the price!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "paubri", "date": "December 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6341072, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great staff and service!
