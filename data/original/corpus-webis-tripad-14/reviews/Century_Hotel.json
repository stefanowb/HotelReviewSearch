There were some good things such as the complimentary breakfast, a large room, nice view of the lake, a decent exercise room and close to where we needed to be for business. Unfortunately I think the not so good outweighed the positive aspects. The staff was ok but definitely did not go out of their way to welcome us or be helpful. Our room was dated and the bathroom was in major need of renovation (the bathtub, sink, floor tile and laminate counter were all cracking and chipped as well as rusty towel bars). I found it a little unsettling when we had a housekeeper cleaning our room as well as other rooms who was not wearing any kind of uniform what-so-ever. She had on sweats and a t-shirt and I didn't know she was working there until I saw her entering rooms with her housekeeping cart. There are not any snack vending machines (there is a drink machine) in the entire hotel so when we arrived late and needed something to eat we had to leave the hotel and drive around looking for something that was still open. The worst part was the extremely thin walls and the slamming of doors and loud conversation by the housekeeping and maintenance staff.
