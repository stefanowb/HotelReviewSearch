It was what was available for a meeting in the area. I read the reviews and cringed at the thought of staying here but just hoped for the best. Check-in was quick and easy. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We were directed to our room and upon opening the door to the hallway of rooms, noticed that there were several blowers on down the hallway. Apparently, the hotel cleaned the rugs in an entire bank of hallways and rooms and the carpets were still soaking wet. Upon entering our room, our feet squished into the rug and upon feeling it, realized it too was soaking wet. We had to walk around our room with shoes on. No need to change rooms - they were all the same. With the wet floors came the wet smell. Not pleasant. We had wallpaper falling down due to a previous water problem in the corner of the room and the caulking in the bathroom was all moldy. It is dated and in desperate need of repair.
