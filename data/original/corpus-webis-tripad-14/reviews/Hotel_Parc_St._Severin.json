It took me months to research this trip, taking everything into consideration (cost, location, amenities). If your aim is to absorb as much of Paris in a few days, this is the location for you. The Louvre, Musee D'orsay, Notre Dame, a boat ride on the Seine, the Pantheon and of course the Saint Severin Church are pretty much in your doorstep. Not to mention Cafe's and restaurants on the side streets around the hotel. The staff spoke English and were very friendly and helpful. They had umbrellas for us when it rained one day and helped us find our way around. I just told them where we were going and they plotted out our walking plan and the occassional bus and metro ride. Our room had 2 balconies with cascading flowers, a clean and modern bathroom with a tub and shower, a safe, anda small refrigerator. Basically it was clean and simple and roomy enough for Paris standard. It was elegant without going over the top. I'd been to Paris a couple of times before and knew not to expect a huge elevator or ice machines around the corner or even a shower curtain in the bathroom (I guess Parisians like to take baths and not showers).
