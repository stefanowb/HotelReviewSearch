The Hotel is sited in a protected cove a short distance from Store Bay, and looks out Westward towards the Island of Trinidad. The Sunsets are just fantastic. The beach offers full sun or shade either under Palm Trees, or thatched sunshades. Swimming and / or snorkelling in the lagoon is both safe and interesting with large numbers of tropical fish constantly all around you.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Travel-Fan-Sussex", "date": "January 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12836043, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Well appointed, clean", "disliked": "\u2014 No negative points"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved every moment of my stay would go again", "text": "We found our room to be very well appointed - King size bed, satelite TV, great shower in the bathroom, nice furnishings, and cleaned twice a day.

The food is exceptional, French style, with a different a la carte menu each day. Lastly the staff - To us, they absolutly made the holiday. There was nothing too much trouble - A friendly, happy team who's simple aim in life was to make sure you had a good time. Would we go back? - absolutely yes. Would we reccommend our friends to stay? - Without hesitation.
