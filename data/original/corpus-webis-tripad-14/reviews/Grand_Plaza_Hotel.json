The staff could not be more helpful and friendly. They all spoke English. The hotel was very clean and was to 4 star standard. Our room did not have much of a view, but the location of the hotel is right in the city centre. The location of the hotel is only a few hundred yards away from the Cathedral, shopping areas, restaurants and underground trains which are easy to use and cost only one euro for a trip to another area of town. Next door is a bar which laid on snacks (hot and cold) throughout the evening. Don't be put off by the fact that the bar is called \"Scottish Bar\" as it was actually a decent place and was frequented by Milanese people rather than tourists. We had heard that Milan was expensive to eat out, however we found this to be untrue. A litre of house wine would cost 10 Euro and a pizza, approx 6-10 Euro depending upon toppings. We will definitely be returning and staying in this hotel. We stayed Friday - Sunday and so the rates were cheap. The hotel was quiet - but apparenty mid-week the prices are higher and the hotel busier due to buisness bookings.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 16, 2005", "id": 4245320}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Superb Location, Great hotel.", "text": "This hotel is really located only 150m from the Duomo on a quiet piazza.
