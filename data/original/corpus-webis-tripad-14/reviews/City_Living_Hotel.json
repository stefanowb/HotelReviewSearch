It wasn't a great start! We didn't wait too long - about 10 minutes - before a member of staff appeared and made us welcome. However, we were advised that the only rooms they had available were standard rooms - not what we had booked! Upon seeing the confirmation that we had printed and brought with us the receptionist said the only rooms they had available were suites and they would have to ring their boss to see if we could have one. This they did and we got the larger room right at the front of the hotel on an upper floor. The room consisted of a living area with tv (only 1 english speaking channel) a small bedroom, a well set out kitchenette and a large bathroom with underfloor heating. As it didn't get above -6 or so the heating was fantastic. The bed was quite solid, but thats the luck fo the draw! The hotel is really well situated very close to the harbour and close to a few supermarkets. As other reviewers have mentioned, Norway is extremely expensive - nealy \u00a310 for a pint of local beer. This hotel was very clean and the staff that we seen were very nice and helpful. You can also buy breakfast from the hotel to eat at a Thon hotel opposite - this was the only good value meal we had. Buffet style, including cold and hot food, costs about \u00a38 per person.
