Both rooms were lovely, spacious well equipped and spotlessly clean. Only downside was the matrass on the double bed is incredibly uncomfortable. We like a firm matrass but this was rock solid with quite a few hard lumps that did make it very painful to sleep on. My parents were stopping at the same time in room 3 and that again was a lovely room with sea views and they had no problems with their matrass. Breakfast was excellent, self-service buffet and lots of choice. Quite a few people (me included) had major problems with the toaster. You have to do your own toast but it doesn't pop up when done as would normally happen so a lot of burnt toast and by the time people had actually worked out how to correctly use it there was very often a queue building up. This did seem to be a major problem and they either need to get a new toaster, put instructions up or better still if toast could be done in the kitchen and then brought out to each table as normally happens in hotels. Food in the restaurant on a night was excellent, good choice and well cooked. Ask to sit in the conservatory if possible and enjoy the fabulous views. Hotel has its own car park which is just around the corner and there does seem to be plenty of spaces. What made the whole experience so special though were the staff. Everyone goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Reception, waitresses, bar staff, housekeeping staff - all of them so pleasant.", "title": "Lovely hotel, excellent staff", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Cakesy", "date": "August 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173679638}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "After my earlier review in May, I would just like to say that we went to a wedding in the Isle of Man last weekend. We stayed in the Falcons Nest Hotel as the wedding reception was held there. The rooms were clean and tastefully furnished, and the food and service was a very big improvement to the previous time. Everybody was polite and helpful and the room the reception was held in was very nice. The only downside was that the bedrooms were a little cold at night and the heating seemed to be turned down, otherwise it was a very pleasant stay we stayed there three nights. There was a large variety for breakfast, including a hot buffet and fruit cereals yogurts fruit juices etc.The hotel is situated close to the seafront, and a number of rooms have a seaview. It is nice to have an evening meal in the conservatory restaurant overlooking the bay.", "title": "Wedding reception", "user": "Brenda J", "date": "August 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172868261}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here in 2008. The hotel is in a nice location and if you are lucky to get a room with a sea view then its good! However I got just that, but a bad nights sleep due to the rooms being above a bar and dinning room, so the noise went on into the early hours. Overpriced in our opinion, but the staff are friendly enough and you can always buy ear plugs which we did!", "title": "Overpriced!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Rob F", "date": "August 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172200502}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Dinner in the conservatory area of the restaurant in this hotel offers one not only a great meal but a superb view of Port Erin bay.
