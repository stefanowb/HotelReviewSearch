It was so beautiful. The window with exposed stonework was gorgeous, the wood flooring amazing, and touches like shelving built into the wall with a glass door and rope lining the stairs were fantastic. The bathroom was inside what used to be the chimney. Sounds odd but it was quite unique. The door to enter is shorter than many adults. There are some kitchen facilities which we didn't get a chance to use but it was nice to have an option. Jaan Parn is a welcoming host. It is his brilliance that designed the room. He is also a jewelry designer and he designed a beautiful piece for me. I have gotten nothing but compliments on it and everyone notices it. Staying here also gives you easy access to the Meistrite Hoov (Master's Courtyard) which is filled with artisans making and selling glass, ceramics, wool, leather, jewelry, wood, etc. Many people come to the courtyard as a tourist sight so we felt kind of exclusive getting to to stay here. Be prepared to spend money with the various artisans because there are many awesome items to choose from. If I return to Tallinn I would definitely stay here again.", "title": "Extremely unique and beautiful", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SJNK", "date": "September 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141702638}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I booked this hotel based on recommendations in a couple of guidebooks. I guess it would appeal to people that want to stay in a unique place or in the center of old town, but we found the room to be pretty cramped and the stairs steep. The bottom floor of the room (number 1) had a small kitchen with a fridge, a sink, a hot plate and a table and two chairs. Not much room for anything else. There was a set of dishes for two people, a few pots and a coffee maker. There was a fairly good-sized bathroom. You climb up a rather steep set of stairs to the upper floor and there are twin beds there, which were reasonably comfortable. The upstairs is also pretty cramped with the two beds and the sloping roof. There is only one window, a skylight that opens in the roof. It was warm while we were there, so we wanted to keep the window open. However, immediately below is a restaurant that plays music until late at night. We closed the window (not easy to do) and used ear plugs and slept OK, but if it was warmer you\u2019d have to keep the window open as there\u2019s no air conditioning. There is a supermarket a few blocks away where you can get food and other items if you want to eat in. Jaan can show you where it is on a map. The room is not serviced daily, but if you need anything, just ask. The place has positive aspects (good bathroom, good security, a kitchen, helpful host) but for us senior citizens constantly having to climb up and down the steep stairs to the bedroom was a little too much.", "title": "In the center of old town and a good value; otherwise, not so great for us", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jspace63", "date": "August 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136230422}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were very pleased with our stay at Villa Hortensia. The Master's Courtyard is charming, and relatively easy to find, right in the middle of Old Town. Our key had been left at the restaurant for us to collect. The room is up a very steep flight of stairs (not for the faint of heart, but handrails help). The room had a very comfortable bed, modern kitchenette and full modern bathroom. The tiny balcony has wooden doors to help darken the room or keep courtyard noise out if you happen to be staying in the summer. Although the room does not have a fan or air conditioning it was quite comfortable. We would recommend Villa Hortensia for anyone who likes a very central location and has good ability to walk.", "title": "Villa Hortensia- good base to explore Tallinn- step back in time", "user": "Mommarazzi", "date": "July 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 135507931}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for 3 nights over New Year. The location is second to none - these 6 restored and characterful appartments are tucked away in the cute, cobblestone Masters Courtyard right in the heart of the old town. We opted for one of the small appartments for 55 Euros a night (a really excellent price for this location). The appartment was very compact - it had a small and basic kitchen - with fridge, hotplate and 2 person table/chairs. We chose not to cook while we were here as the restuarant choices locally are plentiful and excellent value for money. There was no kettle in the kitchen which would have been useful for a cup of tea/coffee however the thoughtful owner had left delicious gingerbread and oranges as a welcome gift. The bathroom was adequate with shower, toilet and sink. The bedroom was on a small mezzanine above the main room up wooden stairs leading from the kitchen. We had 2 single beds which were comfortable but there wasn't much floor space on the mezzanine level - the only hanging space for clothes was in the entrance hall downstairs. There is access to a communual lounge with leather sofas and a library. There are two larger suits which are more expensive but are meant to be very nice - balconies, TV's, spacious kitchonettes etc.but we didn't get to see them for ourselves. I would recommend staying here if you are a young couple on a budget, looking for good value (if a little basic) accommodation.
