However, when we got to our room around 2 a.m. the airconditioning didn't work and they had to come move us to another room. They came pretty quickly and moved us to a different room, but it was TINY, much smaller than the one we had been in, and the shower didn't work hardly at all. There was barely enough room for two people and our luggage. I've seen closets that were way bigger. There was no window and the bed was not comfortable, but at least the a/c worked this time and we were too tired to argue for a bigger room like the one we had. The carpet in the halls is dirty. Also they didn't want to give us a key to our 'new' room even though we had to give the other keys back. The man that came to let us in the new room didn't bring us keys and when we asked for them he told us we could just go to the front desk in the morning to get one. Really? They sent an email after our stay and asked how it was. I responded and told them and they told me they had no record of our stay there. However, they certainly did charge our credit card. I sent them all the info including the credit card info and NEVER heard back from them. No customer service at all and it's overpriced and they charge for internet on top of that.
