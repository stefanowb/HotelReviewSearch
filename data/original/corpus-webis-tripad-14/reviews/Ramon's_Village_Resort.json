If you get a garden room, ask for a second floor room since the balcony is nicer. We found the dive shop a little expensive, the same for the bar (especially if you're just coming out from spending time on the mainland as we were). We live in New York and the prices for drinks were on par with what we pay here ($10 american for a mararita etc. Belkin is still inexpensive). The resort had a good mix of familes, 20s and 30s sets.
