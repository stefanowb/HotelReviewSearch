My husband and I had a wonderful 3 night stay at Antica Residenza Cicogna. We stayed in the suite--one room with a large, super comfortable bed, all lovely antique furniture. The adjoining room has a desk and two single beds--we used this room to spread out our luggage--how nice to have room for all of our stuff! The bathroom was spotless. It felt more like an apartment than a room! This suite is located in the same building as the rest of the rooms, but around the other side of the building with a separate door and entryway. It was a great price. Breakfast was very tasty and plenty to eat. Best of all was darling Elisa--she could not have been nicer. She is wonderful at answering any questions by email or phone. Elisa has furnished her B & B with beautiful antique furniture, keeps everything spotless, is really the perfect hostess. All of her rooms are wonderful, but if you want the feel of being in your own apartment, try for the suite--we loved it!!
