The staff were very friendly and provided excellent customer service. The location was very good with all taxis knowing where the hotel was and most attractions (Gardens by the bay, Singapore flyer) only a 10/15min taxi trip away. We (3 people) stayed in a deluxe room and were very happy that they provided 3 single beds instead of 2 doubles. The room was very neat and clean and the complementary water added a nice touch, especially with Singapore's weather! The bathroom was clean but a little outdated but that didn't really matter to us. We booked the room with breakfast which was very good with a wide variety of foods from all around the world. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely stay at Furama Riverfront again.", "title": "Furama Riverfront Hotel Experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "D A", "date": "February 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 152772518}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled solo", "text": "I stay at the Furoma for two nights.

The gawdy fake flowers \"decorating\" the lobby look like they have seen better days as does a lot of the decor and furnishings. I agree with many other reviewers the beds are extra firm; which is better than suffering through many nights on those terrible saggy beds, but yes, I had sore ribs and hips. We stayed on the 12th floor unrenovated and the shower was pretty awful. One had to be pretty dexterous to climb over the bathtub and be careful not to slip as the skinny tub tends to drain too slowly and fill with water. In addition, one tends to end up with a very wet bathroom floor afterwards. When toileting one gets a close up view of all the spots the housekeepers miss in their cleaning; under the soap shelf in the shower and around the basin were covered in mould. And it was hard to see out of the windows because they were so dirty. But hey, it's an old hotel at a reasonable price, maybe they can just pay a little more attention to detail. The breakfast buffet was okay, but once again, just a little more attention to detail; spoons in water, soggy pastries, and bad coffee. As an Australian I love nothing more than bacon and eggs for breakfast but I could not warm to the funky flavour of the \"Beef Bacon\". I assume this is for their many Malay and Muslim customers. So I tended to go for the Malay breakfast of curry and rice. The chefs always seem to do their local food the best; I recommend stick to that.", "title": "A bit tired and a bit grubby, and I don't mean me.", "user": "Dogmadonna", "date": "March 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 153666638}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not so nice", "text": "It might be nice if the lobby staff were a little warmer and welcoming, as in most hotels you do get a good feeling walking in but not the Furama.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Vita D", "date": "March 2, 2013", "id": 153498264}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Average hotel.", "text": "On the upside the hotel was pretty close to Chinatown (about a 15 minute walk) and we found the taxi services cheap easy and reliable.", "user": "Tahnya110", "date": "March 1, 2013", "id": 153422543}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "It's just so-so in every aspect.
