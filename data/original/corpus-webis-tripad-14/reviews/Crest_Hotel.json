I've known about the Crest for years but this is my first time staying and it hasn't disappointed. Quality furnishings and amenities are always on my check list when rating a room and the Aveda products, walk in glass enclosed shower and huge soaker tub all deliver. The king size bed was very comfortable and I could have slept longer but chose to leave my window open to enjoy the early morning view. If you can, upgrade to one of these amazing view rooms.
