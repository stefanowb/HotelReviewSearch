Our double room was spacious, spotlessly clean, with lots of hot water and a power shower.

Breakfasts are ample and served in a wonderfully eclectic room in which Sally Bowles might have held court. The staff are unfussy, but very friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel is on the bus route from Tegel airport (nearest stop 200m ), between two U-Bahn stops (for lines U1 and U2), and a short walk through an up-market residential area (with plenty of bars and restaurants) from Savigny-Platz S-Bahn station. So, with Berlin's excellent public transport system (a travel pass is a great buy), anywhere in the city can easily be reached day or night.
