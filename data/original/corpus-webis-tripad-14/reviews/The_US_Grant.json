It is a very grand hotel and everything is very tasteful. We had booked the romance package and included in the price was champagne in the room, a flower arrangement with red roses and breakfast each morning. Our bedroom was lovely with a kingsize bed and top quality linens. The bathroom was spacious and again had excellent amenities. The situation of this hotel is excellent . It is across the road from the Horton Plaza shopping centre and also the Gaslamp Quarter, which is very lively in the evenings. It is also within walking distance of Petco Park and we attended our first ball game whilst there. The trolley bus for the sightseeing tour is just across the road from the hotel. The food in the hotel was excellent and all staff gave excellent service. Nothing was too much trouble for them.
