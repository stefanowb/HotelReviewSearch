We are small business owners and have been in the area a lot during the winter of 2007/08. The price is great, the rooms are very clean (we have stayed in several different rooms and all of them were very clean), the staff is extra friendly and the property has a safe atmosphere. The breakfast served includes cereal, waffles, donuts, toast, bagels, fruit and juice. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning to stay in the area. Like a said before, we have been staying here because of business but we will also stay here when we vacation in the Smokey Mountains.
