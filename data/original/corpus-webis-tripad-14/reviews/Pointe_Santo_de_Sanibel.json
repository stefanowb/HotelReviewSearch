Yes, there was the algae on the beach, (2007), during some of my stay and yes it stunk but the complex and the city are working on this, they don't want this to effect the tourism. The islands are beautiful and there are numerous places to eat. I recommend Doc Fords and Keylime Bistro. Watch the sunset, sit and enjoy the quiet of the evening or the laughter of other guests.

Just walk down the beach and the you'll see that the other complexes just can't compare to this paradise. Our days were filled with relaxation by the pool, playing volleyball each night on the beach and then we'd go back to the unit and up to the private rooftop sundeck for cocktails and appys while watching the sunset into the gulf. The view of the gulf from this unit is simply gorgeous - there just isn't any word to describe it. It far exceeded our expectations. We opened the wall of sliders in the living room that overlook the gulf and welcomed the gulf breeze. Paradise at its best! This unit is an end unit and is one of the nicest we saw (we visited several during both our stays). It was well decorated, very clean, had everything we needed in terms of amenities, plus more, but the view from the unit is what will keep us coming back. The shelling was awesome and dinners were fantastic especially at the Mad Hatter (very romantic), the Island Cow (great food for the whole family), Sanibel Bean for lunch was great, the restaurant inside Jerry's grocery store has to be the island's best kept secret for breakfast, lunch and dinners (very reasonable - great kid's menu and the adult food is very good). Renting bikes was one of the best things we did. We rented them for the week and Finnegan's delivered and picked them up right at Pointe Santo.

We loved the property so much, we chose to tough it out for 2 nights without air (which wasn't that bad because it was April, and we opened all doors and windows and used ceiling and floor fans). Royal Shell brought us fans and checked on us and on the third day of our stay, the air was working again. I compliment Royal Shell on their quick service, attention and care for us as their renters.

As the week went on I noticed that the master bath shower had a significant amount of mold on the ceiling, the shower doors in the 2nd bath were off the track, molding in the condo needed a coat of paint to freshen it up, repairs that had been done had not been finished off, ie. a towel rack in the 2nd bath had been moved but the brackets were left on the wall, the toilet paper holder was about to fall off , the top rack of the dishwasher was worn down in several places to where rusty wire was exposed and the worst one was the bird poop/ dead insects that had collected between the outside rail and the screen of the lanai. I called VIP Realty and they immediately sent someone over to fix the shower door and get the model # of the dishwasher.
