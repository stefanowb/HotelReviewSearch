The staff are friendly, smiling and helpful which is unusual in city centre hotels . As for the location it's perfect, smack bang on the Museum Quarter, Spittelberg and the Kuntshistorisches Museuem plus the U bahn and the trams .

I mean right across the street from it. That's great and so is the service and the breakfast and the bedding, but that's all. I have a couple of big problems and a couple of small problems. BP1: to lock the door it takes a key. So when leaving the room one needs to lock the door, ok, but if your spouse is in the room, she's locked in and cannot get out unless the front desk gives you two keys on check-in, and they do not; BP2: breakfast is WAY over priced for anyone (like me) who has coffee and a pastry, and maybe juice (liquids are free, BTW, all day long). So, the doughnut in fact costs 15 Euros. That's too much. And small problems: SP1: the room was not aired out upon our arrival and so it smelled; SP2: it is not air conditioned; SP3: it's noisy on the street below because the artsy-fartsy folks are young, drunk, and clueless.", "title": "Quirky 3-star advertising as a 4", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MarkGrove", "date": "May 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161539273}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The location is good - not far from the metro station (2 minutes on foot) and the city centre (20 minutes on foot).", "title": "Good place to stay in Vienna", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Tania M", "date": "May 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 160724364}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Free WiFi is a benefit but you need to regularly renew the pasword at reception.The staff is very polite and helpful.", "title": "Amazing location and value", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Taisia K", "date": "May 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 160565328}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room is very small (we stayed at standard room), it seemed that the bathroom is of the same size.
