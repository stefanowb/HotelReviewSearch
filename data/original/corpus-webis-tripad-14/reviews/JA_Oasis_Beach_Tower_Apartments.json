The problem is at the end of our stay our bin was completely full, and lots of sand on the floor. No cleaning at all during the day (even if we were out all day ). The cleaning lady came every time after we've arrived and asked if we needed something. Of course you don't want the appartment to be cleaned while you are inside, so we've just asked for the towels. The first day it was surprising, the second day it was annoying. But it was our last day and we didn't make any remarks. We've asked for some sandwiches for the last morning since we had to quit the hotel at 6am. It was impossible, even if we were premium guests (I still don't know what they mean with premium, we haven't seen the lounge since we were not informed before the check-out). We've asked for a taxi for our arrival, we didn't get any confirmation, so we took a taxi and arrived at the hotel. They called 30 minutes afterwards to say the hotel shuttle was waiting for us at the airport since the transfer was included. We've asked for the shuttle to leave on the last day. One lady said no problem, another guy said we have to pay like 280 dirhams. The guy never called back. Luckily the lady confirmed us the shuttle and we had it. The person who was supposed to come to pick our luggage and bring them to the shuttle just called at the precise time when we were expecting him and asked if we needed assistance !

We opted for the views and had an apartment on the 42nd floor. The apartments themselves are beautiful clean, and so spacious. We had a two bed apartment and we actual had 4 bathrooms We had fabulous views over the Palm and the Arabian Gulf.. The kitchen included a small selection of starter groceries , excellent for just having been on a night flight and it included, tea, coffee, milk, jam and cereals. The kitchen was well equipt with all the right thing you should find in an apartment including non stick pans. There was even a washer/dryer and ironing board and iron. The apartments also have very high standards of appliances and general crockery, the china was Villeroy and Bosch. You were also given two complimentary bottles of water everyday . The hotel has a free gym and a pool, on level 2, i used the pool which had very helpful staff, you can borrow toewls , beach mats and umbrellas for the beach. The hotel is situated on the walk and there are lots of places to eat and drink . Also near by is the Dubai Marina Mall which has a Waitrose and other english retailers. If you need a supermarket there is one in the mall next to the hotel and another on the upper level of the walk. The Hotel also provides shuttle buses to the Emitates Mall and the sister hotel. I would recommend a visit to the sister hotel as it has a private beach and was really nice with brilliant service. The public beach is just across the road and is really nice, lots of families and the sea is very clear. The hotel is really well situated, so close to the beach and with lots of cafes and restuarants , and there are some really nice markets in the evenings too.

It was better than having 4 individual hotel rooms since we had the very large living room, dining area and kitchen for socializing in our group. The staff at Oasis beach were wonderful- Galina was in touch with me months ahead of time. She was able to find out info on where we could watch camel race practices (a highlight of our tour around Dubai) and made dinner reservations for us at Mango Tree so we could watch the fountain show from our table. We were celebrating my 50th birthday and the hotel sent us a delicious chocolate mousse cake that was devoured by our group. The apt was very spacious and we were glad to have a balcony that overlooked the tourquoise Gulf. The front desk staff were very helpful and the hotel arranged for us to have a 12 seater van with driver for a day tour. We booked our desert safari with Arabian Adventures who have a desk in the hotel. The breakfast package in the apt came in handy since we did not have to waste time going to breakfast in the morning . We were able to buy more eggs at the grocery store in the bottom level of the building. We did not have time to use the pool but we hope to come back to this great hotel someday soon.

The pool rarely gets the sun as they have \u2018cashed-in\u2019 and built an office block which blocks the sun apart from maybe an hour or so and 2.

The Metro is about a 15 min walk. Lots of restaurants are just outside the hotel. The lady at concierge (forgot her name) was extremely helpful as well with lots of practical tips of when to visit Ferrari World & Atlantis & how to get there.Complimentary wifi available in the multiple sky lounges within the hotel.The hotel also has complimentary bus shuttles to the Gold souk and popular shopping malls. We understand the shuttles to the malls are not operated by the hotel itself so these shuttles can be full by the time they get to Oasis Beach Tower. We also spent an enjoyable day at the sister property in Jebel Ali which has magnificent beaches and pools- real island holiday feel at the Jebel Ali resort.
