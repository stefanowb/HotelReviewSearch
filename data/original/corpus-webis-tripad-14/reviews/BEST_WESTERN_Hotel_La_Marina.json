The hotel itself is very well turned out. Nicely decorated, very clean and wiith air con in the room which was very efficient. The pool area is great. We did not try the in house restaurant because of the good choices very close by. St Raphael centre is a very pleasant 15 minute walk and would actually recommend this hotel rather than staying more central. Only slight criticism is that the room is a little small but is compensated by a very comfortable bed! Go for a pool or Marina view out of preference.
