One block from the Reeperbahn and less than a 10 minute walk to the main Harbour area. Here you can catch all the boat and bus tours. Hotel has a nice restaraunt and bar area. Only negative was that my room faced the bars courtyard and it was a bit noisy until about 02:00 am (unless you close the windows). Would definetly stay here again. Payed 150 euro per night. Onsite parking garage, 12 euro per day if you pay at front desk (20 euro per day if you pay in the garage).", "title": "Perfect Location!", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "am79211", "date": "May 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5223659}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Superb design hotel, bad service", "text": "East is the best place to stay in Hamburg.

That is no problem if it was solved with one phonecall. But that did not work.... Something about wrong name on the reservation, bla, bla, bla.
