I chose Sandy Beach because the property offered absolutly everything I was hoping for without breaking our budget. We were not disappointed. We had a great time! When booking at the Sany Beach Resort, make sure that you request a suite in the Palmetto building. After reading the reviews, I called the hotel myself to ensure that my reservation was for a room in the newly rennovated building. When we arrived, there was a staff member there to greet us before we even got out of the car. The hotel lobby was clean with a very trendy yet welcoming allure. The staff was not as friendly as I would have liked but they were helpful. The room looks just as it is pictured on the company website. It was clean and spacious enough for our family of four. Just like most of the families we met, we cooked each day that we were there. The kitchen had everyhting we needed (full size fridge and stove, dishwasher, microwave, coffeemaker, plates, cookware, and utensils). If you want to grill outdoors, there is a grill by the pool. The hotel staff will even provide you with charcoal. The rooms also come with a washer and dryer. This added convience made our stay even better as we were able to keep our swimwear clean, dry, and ready to wear. The best feature is the view! Every room in the Palmetto has a beachfront view with a private balcony. The first night my husband pulled down the wall bed in the living area. We opened the door to the balcony and enjoyed the sound of the waves from bed. We made the most of the view by moving the dining room table closer to the sliding door to enjoy the view as we sat down for a meal. In addittion to the pull down bed, the deluxe suite offers two queen size beds in the bedroom as well. The beds are ultra comfortable. I took an hour nap and awoke feeling like I had slept all night. There is a bar located next door to the hotel. I was able to order drinks to bring back to the room for myself and my husband. They offer a discount to Sandy Beach visitors. We spent hours outdoors enjoying the pools and the beach. My kids loved the kiddie pool and the lazy pool. In addittion to the kiddie pool and the lazy pool, there is an indoor pool, three or four outdoor pools and three jacuzzis (one indoors). There is a gate leading right onto the beach from the pool area. When you get tired of the water, there is a family amusement park directly across the street (great for small children) and a family water park next door. Having to park the car across the street was the only inconvience. However, we never had to leave. There is a store across the street and a Walgreens well within walking distance. There is a coffee pot in the room and the hotel offers free coffee in the morning. There is also a Starbucks and Dunkin Doughnuts within walking distance. We had a great time. We have already decided to go back next summer and we will without a doubt or thought be returning back to the Sandy Beach Resort. At the Sandy Beach Resort, you will get the location and amenties you need and desire for a reasonable price.
