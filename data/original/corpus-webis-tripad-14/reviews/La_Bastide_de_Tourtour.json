The hotel building itself is magnificent and its location is fantastic, high on the hill top, with breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. The rooms we had were very spacious with a fantastic balcony and they were certainly worth paying the extra for. The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. Dinner was a gastronomic affair on their beautiful outdoor terrace. Be warned if you are travelling with children, there is not kids menu and definitely no chips! However the town of Tourtour is just a five minute walk away with several very good cafre/bistros which do everything from pizzas to chips. In fact I would highly recommend a visit as the town is very picturesque.", "title": "A wonderful French retreat", "user": "sjwoolnough", "date": "July 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115518581}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were staying at another local hotel without a restaurant and were recommended this hotel for dinner. We did not enjoy it at all. The food was very specialised and I have no doubt suited some, but for us it was far too rich and much too expensive for what we had. The service was also far too persistent. We like to be served and then left alone. We are quite capable of filling up our own glasses! The worse thing was that all evening we were pestered by flies who sat on the table and would have sat in our food if we had not kept flicking them away. We complained and were told that some tables had lavender on them to keep the flies away, but ours was not one of them. To their credit, they did realise that we really did not like the second course and they deducted an amount from the bill, but it did not take away from the memory of this the first night of our holiday.", "title": "Came here for a meal and were very disappointed", "user": "JanFr", "date": "July 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 114959329}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Location, location, location...a perfect one for tourtouring (excuse the pun) Provence in every direction.

The staff, special mention of Catherine and Karin, were very friendly and helpful for info and suggestions. It was so nice that we planned 4 nights and ended up staying 5. The pool was also a great cool down at the end of the travelling day.

The receptionist annoyed us my taking a private phone call while we were waiting to check in. We were given what must be one of the smallest rooms in the hotel (nr 10) even though only two other rooms were occupied. The room was reasonably clean and nicely decorated. There was an annoying humming noise from above. Avoid the hotel's own-brand shampoo and body lotions in the bathroom as they contain no less than five parabens. We tried the jacuzzi, but it did not work well and there was grit on the bottom. Instead of a sauna, there is a small heated cabinet for one person, which is insufficient. We had dinner both evenings in the hotel and enjoyed it. There were four courses of interesting, excellent food. The quantities are small and delicate, but sufficient at the end. The breakfast however was a rather poor affair. It was continental style, with no buffet and nothing warm; not even eggs were offered, just coffee/tea, fruit, fruit juice, a small joghurt, then bread/croissant and jam. We considered this insufficient considering the prices. The cooking course however was excellent. To my surprise, I was the only one in the course, but that was ok as he gave me his full attention and I prepaired a four-course lunch. It was my first time cooking in a professional hotel kitchen, so that was interesting. Not many guests get to inspect the hotel kitchens, but everything seemed clean and tidy with good quality ingredients - although of course they knew I was coming. The staff were all very friendly, not at all stuffy, maybe a bit too casual. It helped a lot that my parner is French, so she chatted to them. They really try and sock it to you with the extras when you check out. The drinks are very expensive. They charged us Euro 34 because my partner tasted what I had cooked in the cooking course !", "title": "Beatuiful hotel, stunning location, expensive", "user": "Zavya", "date": "February 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 57280959}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "The problem has some problems with cleanliness.
