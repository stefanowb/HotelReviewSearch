The owner was extremely friendly, caring, and helpful. He made us feel very welcome, gave us a map and recommendations of things to do and good non-touristy restaurants. He is always personally present. The breakfast was very nice - rolls, butter, jam, cold meat and cheese, and a soft boiled egg if you want one. Our double room was cozy and very clean. The shared bathroom was fine. The location was extremely convenient to both the train station and the old town. For the price, around 50 Euro, you can't beat this place.", "title": "Wonderful stay", "user": "pepoling", "date": "January 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6563228, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location and friendly owner", "disliked": "\u2014 Steep stairs w/ heavy luggage"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "the local is clean, friendly and has a good price. the breakfast was nice, delicious.... and the people who works there is friendly, really nice people. the local is close from main atractions of the city and so close from rail station, just 2 minutes walking. Me and my wife have spended 3 nigths there last june and just one little problem: the manager lost my insulin (i am diabetic) that he took with me to keep in refrigerator. Inspite he told me that he could pay for another one if i must buy, when i send to him the bill wiht fax and email he never had answer to me untill now (december, 2006). But, this little problem do not me hide that the place is nice, the people, including the Manager, was so nice and friendly. I really loved that place, that people there, and the city.
