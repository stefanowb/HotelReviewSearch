Staff is amazing!! Everyone, from the men that open the doors for you, desk clerks, room service (Avocado on toast with poached egg for breakfast) and concierge Ro Kapila who was a huge help to us with our shipping needs.The Lobby/bar is stunning. Our king size bed room was bigger than we thought it would be and the bed was so comfortable!! We had dinner at the Berners Tavern. Great meal, wonderful service. We also got to enjoy the Punch Room. The location is just off Oxford Street. So of course close to everything.

The staff were the nicest people I have ever come across in a hotel. The best thing about this hotel is the bartender. I think his name is Martel, but I do know he is Italian and watching him make drinks was impressive. And the chips were amazing! I loved every drink he made. As far as the room, I found it to be comfortable, with comfy pillows, and the bathroom was pretty nice as well. It did seem like a business hotel, but has a trendy vibe. With the pretty girls and guys opening doors, you felt as if you were going to a club when you entered the lobby. The area is in the heart of shopping and food but can get a bit crowded when leaving the Underground and searching for the hotel. Overall, this is a pretty nice place and would stay here again.", "title": "Trendy, Great Bar Tenders, and Comfy Pillows!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "GrlTrvlr", "date": "October 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 182395294}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Food was fantastic last night - we had the lamb starter and then the halibut with squid ink risotto and chilli squid topping.
