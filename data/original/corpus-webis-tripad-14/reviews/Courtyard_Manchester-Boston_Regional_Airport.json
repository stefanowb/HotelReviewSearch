I loved it. My room was on the third floor. I spent most of the evening on the balcony watching the airplanes take-off and land at the nearby Manchester airport. (not all rooms have balconies) you can ask if one is available. The Mall and Wal-Mart is close by. The hotel has an indoor pool. Airport service is also provided.
