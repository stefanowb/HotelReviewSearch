The first impression was the beautiful lush tropical garden in which the resort is embedded. Friendly reception and throughout my stay, every single staff member was very friendly and helpful without exception. The room was spacious and well equipped, with coffee maker, ironing board and free of charge mini bar. New flat screen TV with CNN and BBC. Also, the two beds were large and comfortable. A balcony provided additional space, and possibility to smoke, Anyhow, there was nothing to complain about the room or otherwise except that laundry service needed to be called twice. The breakfast buffet was good with various selections, eggs made to order, but bread choice or selection of cheese could be improved, but for the price more than adequate, the restaurants (upon reservation, visited the Italian and Mediterranean) offer good service, but dishes may be partially modest for European standards. The beach is beautiful, with white sand, and pleasant to swim. The pool is large. Something unique are the various animals that inhabit the estate. Most visitors will appreciate the flamingos and swans in the amazing waterways and pools integrated into the hotel, but the \"Quatis\", kind of anteater, do not meet the favor of all hotel guests. These animals appear in groups of 20 to 30 animals and are greedy to get food and e.g. jump into waste bins at the snack bar for getting disposed food. They are actually harmless, but some of the tourists were upset. We also spotted a Gecko. To comment is also the daily night show. The shows include a lot of choreography, dancers and partially live music. It is worth while to visit one or two of the shows, not to be forgotten that they are included in the all included scheme", "title": "Place to Relax", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "November 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144785099}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012", "text": "The buffet food is just not of good quality and it needs some serious attention for a 5 star resort.

I guess this just didn't have that special WOW factor. Our room was clean with a nice king bed. The room temp was a little warmer than I like but they lower it after 2 different requests. Mini frig was kept stocked with Coke Light by leaving a polite note. I don't know who our maid was but she did an excellant job. We had a ground floor room which we prefer. The weather was great.We had one day of rain that started with a thunderstrom during the night. Rained hard in the morning but by 10 we just headed to the pool anyway and enjoyed the day. Loved the pool and the water temperature.Nice and warm but not hot. We were always able to find chairs with shade and because of the time of year no towel,chair games. The beach was large with plenty of chairs and shade but this trip I really enjoyed the pool. Tried several different drinks but preferred their good cold beer. We ate at the main buffet and buffet by the beach and both were good. No problem with sevice. Iberostars always have good service. We ate at 3 alacarts and liked the Steak House best. We didn't do the shows, choose to have after dinner drinks at the lobby bar. The grounds were lovely and well cared for. There were peacocks,flamingos.swans and lots of coati. Loved the white peacock.I had never seen one before. There is some walking but we enjoyed it .We were in building 15 which is in the middle of the resort. The only real problem we had was we given wrong information about Catholic Mass.. We were told by staff there was one in their chapel @ 6pm Sunday but there was not one. We ended up taking a taxi into Playa for their 8 pm mass.Had we known we would have planned and gone earlier. My better half was upset about this. All and all it was the relaxing trip we needed .

The pool is salt water and the water was warm. Sometimes too warm. There are pool games that goes on each day. The chairs by the pool go quickly. We always went to the beach for the morning and then after lunch we would go by the pool. I have two things that I wasn't too happy with. The food at the dinner buffet was not that good. Personally I think the only place that the food was decent was at the restaurants and it was nearly impossible to get dinner reservations. For a weeks stay, you are only allowed to have 3 dinner reservations, so that left 4 nights that you had to eat at the buffet. No a good system. My second thing was that we were so far from the lobby and the restaurants. You had to rely on the trollys to get to and from your room to the lobby. It is about a 1/2 mile or a 15 minute walk.

After we checked in and upgraded our room we went to catch some lunch. I received a text from Verizon regarding global charges. I returned to my room to call the number Verizon provided regarding the text I received. While on the phone the door burst open and a worker quickly entered the room. No \"knock\", no \"hello room service\".....just entered real quickly. When he saw me he didn't say anything, just turned and ran out. I went after him but didn't find him. I called the lobby and explained what happened. They confirmed that a supervisor had just called the management to report that while he was doing room checks he came in our room not expecting us to be there. When I asked why he did not knock, they said he didn't expect anyone to be in the room. (in his defense, we had upgraded from our original room to the oceanfront room and only an hour and a half had gone by since getting into the new room). So there is the chance that word had not gotten to the \"supervisor\", who was suppose to be in charge of those rooms. When I asked management if it was customary to knock first they said yes, when I asked why the supervisor ran out of the room without trying to explain hat happened, she said that he panicked because he does not speak English. I bumped into the supervisor a short while later and discovered he understood English and spoke it well enough to be able to tell me that he thought the cleaning lady was cleaning in our room. After some discussion with management regarding what had happened, they were gracious enough to offer us three additional nights dining at their specialty restaurants. Again, this is just a heads up for everyone traveling to any resort. Don't let down your guard or believe for a second that your room is subject to entry.

We would highly recommend it to anyone who asks. The resort grounds and rooms are kept EXTREMELY CLEAN, with staff working non-stop to keep it that way. The staff are very friendly, and would go out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The pool was amazing, the best we've ever seen. The beach was beautiful as well, with white sand and turquois water. There are three swim-up bars at the pool, and one bar at the beach. Liquid refreshment was never a problem. There were plenty of lounge chairs at both the pool and beach, however as you would expect, the best seats are always reserved early. I still swear there were people reserving seats at both the beach and the pool, as many of the \"reserved\" seats would go unused for most of the day. Still, we never had too much trouble finding a good spot. The food and drinks were well above average for an all-inclusive resort. We never had any problem with ice in our drinks, and judging by the number of people with pina coladas in their hands, it appeared as though most would agree. We were still a little cautious with the tap water in the rooms though, just to be safe. There was always a large variety of food at the buffet, however due to our tendancy to eat pretty much the same things, we grew a little tired of it by the last day or two. Our mistake was not to make reservations at any of the specialty restaurants. We'll know better for next time. The Coca-Cola actually tastes like Coca-Cola, and the \"maple syrup\" is as close to the real thing that we've ever seen at an all-incluse resort, making the fresh pancakes and waffles a nice breakfast option. Oh, did I mention that they make fresh donuts every morning too? The ice cream bar near the pool was a nice touch, as was the bar fridge in the room, which was re-stocked daily (despite a sign saying it would only be re-stocked every other day). Based on reading several of the earlier reviews on this website, we specifically requested a pool-side room, and were glad we did. Construction of a new resort is under way on the other side of the buildings, and although not noisy, would not be as pleasant to look at as the waterfall and pool view we had from our balcony.Our only word of caution is that due to the layout of this resort, you better be prepared to walk, a lot. Not that it was a bad thing for us, as it allowed a good chance to exercise off the few pounds that surely would have been gained otherwise. There is a trolley that regularly passes if you'd prefer a ride. There are a number of day trips available (Mayan Ruins, snorkelling, etc...), taxis into town, a night club, cigar bar, pool tables, a kids club during the day, and nightly entertainment to keep things exciting.

We had a wonderful time and found the information on this site to be very helpful and accurate. Here is another person's perspective on the property:o Rooms -- Very nice. The depiction on the Iberostar web site was accurate. The beds were a bit hard though. Each room had a safe and a mini fridge that was regularly stocked with soda, beer, and water -- all included in the package. (Parents with little kids: the TVs in the room have Nickelodeon.)o Service -- Really top notch. Very friendly and helpful.o Grounds -- The grounds are magnificent and very well taken care of.o Food -- If my family had any quarrels with the hotel, it was over the food. There are a number of specialty restaurants at the hotel, but you must book them in advance. Our guess is that while they want to offer variety, they want guests to use the main buffet restaurant (which requires no reservations and is probably less expensive to operate) to the max. If you stay for 5 nights you are allowed 3 specialty restuarant reservations during your stay. The seatings are at 6:30, 7:00, 8:30 and 9:00. Make your reservations the first day; they are difficult to obtain.Having said that, I'm, not sure the specialty restaurants are anything to write home about. The Mexican offering was top-notch; quite delicious. The Japanese was awful. The \"Tropical\" restaurant (specializing in seafood) was mediocore at best.The buffet was not bad, but you did start to see some sameness after a couple of days. Breakfasts tended to be better than lunch or dinner. You can also get a llimites (and included) room service from 11 - 11 if you want.There also is an ice cream parlor open in the middle of the pool that is great for kids.o Pool -- Really lovely. It is quite huge and has a very nice \"waterfall\" at its start. A tip for parents: the pool has tons of lounge chairs, and most are covered. However, there are five little \"cabana\" structures by the pool. They are completely covered and several kids (or two adults) can nap in them comfortably. This is a wonderful offerinbg if your kids are small. However, people will literally go out at dawn (if not before) to claim them.o Beach -- Again, really lovely. Tons of lounge chairs, but unless you get to the beach early, you may not be able to claim one that is covered. There are lots of hammocks under shade at the beach and there is a bar and waiter/waitress there as well. The sand is soft and the water is great, but it can be rough. You really cannot snorkel there because of the roughness and it may be too tough for little kids. o Spa/Gym. My wife did not go to the spa, but she said it was quite expensive (not unexpected). The tennis courts have a weird surface and there are only two of them For a facility this size, you would think there would be more. As for the fitness center, I have been to an Embassy Suites outside Detroit that has better equipment. Lots of people do job around the facility, and it is a pleasant jog.o Side trips. If you did not book one through your travel agent, you can book one at the hotel through one of their reps. We went to XCaret, an eco/heritage adventure park. We had a good time but, particularly if you are going with kids, I suggest that you plan to spend the entire day and leave early. There is a lot to do/see. o Ground Transportation -- If you booked yourself (not thru an agent) and don't have an airport transport nailed down, just take a cab. It should cost you around 300 pesos.o Final Note -- As noted in other postings, the Paraiso Beach and Paraiso del Mar are essentailly the same hotel, just on different sides of the pool. I'd stay at Paraiso Beach as there is construction adjacent to the del Mar side and it can be kind of noisy (though I did not hear anyone complainiang about it).All in all, we had a very nice time, would go back, and recommend it to anyone traveling with kids.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 21, 2003", "id": 922068}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Vacation of a lifetime", "text": "Our Christmas vacation was spent at the Paraiso Iberostar.

While it is a big resort, it is not to big to get around. There was plenty of space on the beach and the star friends do a very nice job of providing things to do. Our only complaint, which would cause me not to return to this resort was the main dinner buffet and the limiting of ala carte restaurants. The dinner buffet was the worst I have seen in the six resorts I have visited. There was no quality and everthing seemed like it should be a side dish. This was a big turn off. The ala carts were ok but much better than the buffet. This resort should seriously consider upgrading the buffet and increasing the ala carts or change the ala carts to what they do at Dreams where you just show up and if you have to wait, you get a pager. We have been to Dreams twice and this is a great feature. The shows were very good and the entertainers work very hard. The ice cream and crepes were fantastic as was the gym. This resort should also revaluate the smoking policies. I know they cater to alot of Europeans who smoke but it was very annoying to sit on the beach with smoke blowing all over and cigarette butts all over the sand. This resort could be so much better with a few changes. Overall, we had a good time but would not return do to the food as described above.

The paint was chipping off of the walls in both of our rooms... we got moved mid-week as a \"comp\" due to being locked out of our room (the key card reader broke) and we had to wait a long time for a response from the hotel. There were bugs in the rooms and we were NOT on the first floor in either room. The water temp in the shower changes on you without intentionally changing it. The beds are old and you can feel the springs in the mattresses. We asked for a foam pad which took three days for them to deliver and it only covered the area of the bed from the hips to the shoulders. Some of the sheets had stains and holes in the sheets. The toilets clog VERY easily, even with a little bit of toilet paper and the response to unclog... HOURS. We called to report a clogged toilet at 9pm and they said they would send someone \"right away\", we called again at 10pm and I walked down to the front desk at 11pm because we were tired of hanging out waiting for them to arrive and I wanted to get my shower. The beach is groomed daily. Be careful going out in the water as there are a lot of rocks in the water but if you walk up the beach towards there high-end, no kids, hotel, the beach is nice there. The food is mostly greasy to pack stomach meds. Bottom line: I think this hotel is probably great for spring break college students that will be drunk the entire stay and will not notice, or care about the above items. If you are going here to drink your week away, this is a great place for you... there are bars everywhere and it's all-inclusive. They did a nice job with my friends wedding on the beach and that is the most positive thing that I can say about it. I would not go back even if I won a free trip there.", "title": "In USA star ratings: 2 star hotel on 5 star grounds", "user": "NittanyLionLuv", "date": "October 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 85149027}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Before going we did a lot of research because we had been in the area several times and came to the conclusion that this was the best option for a family retreat booked through apple vacations.", "title": "Huge!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jdocarmo", "date": "October 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 84815432}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The resort is immense, endless pools, activities from early morning to evening by the pool. There is nightly entertainment, which is themed every night, not Broadway shows, but mostly musicals and comedy mixed. The rooms were extremely clean, bathrooms impeccable, every day maids would leave a different towel sculpture on our beds. The pool could use a little updating and my son got a cut from a broken tile, but overall very enjoyable (Salty water), and there is very little to no chlorine smell to it, water fall is nice, but the jacuzzi is moldy. There are several swim-up Bars and they mostly keep imported licour hidden for you to ask or upon a tip they may serve you, a few dollars will get you great drinks all day long. The lunch at the snack bar is great and has dozens of options, from meats to salads, fruit, ice cream, all help yourself. The gourmet restaurants are okay, but don't expect 5 star food, the buffet is huge and has a different menu everyday with very healthy options, breakfast is complete and plentiful they also have 24/7 room service. Service is great all around, extremely friendly staff, and very helpful. The beach has swimming spots but also a lot of rocky areas. Over all I think this was the best resort we stayed in Mexico so far. The only observation I would make is that everything is far, and there is a lot of walking to and from everything, which I appreciated after huge meals.

The hotel grounds were beautiful. The pool was great, the beach was unbelievable. The room was upgraded to a junior suite. Basically the same as you get at holiday inn. Not the greatest of rooms but was comfortable. However the rooms were not cleaned and restocked very well everyday. The little frig only had water, soda\u2019s and a couple of beers. But the sad part of our trip was the food. We were there 7 days and with 7 day stay you get to pick 3 restaurants to have dinner, \u201conly 3\u201d the rest of the time you had to eat at the buffet. Everyday your food was pretty much the same thing. Their deserts were rally bad. The room service was hot dog or hamburger very very poor chooses. The restaurants basically was like eating at the buffet but you had to chose off menu and you were served rather than getting it yourself. The place is gigantic in size so you have to walk a lot. The shows were fun several nights but you have to watch were you go because one night the show we went to would not serve us because we had the wrong color band on. Same with beach bar even though they were right there together. The staff was very nice and friendly and tried to make everyone feel welcome. As to if we would return the answer is NO. We have been to several resorts and even thought this place was beautiful it was not up to the standards I would expect for the price we paid. If you have kids it would be a good place for them they have lots of events kids would like just not a place for couples.", "title": "Wonderful resort", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "cbrzez", "date": "October 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 84522435}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A bargain when on sale", "text": "Just returned on 4/17/2012 after 7 days Apple Vacations all inclusive.

Beach was white sand and moderate surf, with some spots of rocks, but plenty of clear areas for swimming and snorkeling. Acitivities and animation staff were energetic and friendly, but a bit too loud for our old ears. Evening entertainment featured a lot of audience participation and was a lot of fun, but also very loud. The complex is big, so bring good walking shoes. The weather was mostly sunny and in the 80's.
