I booked this inn 6 months in advance and paid in FULL for two rooms for a 5 night stay. Never saw the place, never received so much as a call or email from the owner (see other review from fellow cheated traveler \u2013 at least he had advanced warning). My three sons and I showed up at the airport and were shoved a packet of information with a letter from the \u201cproprietor\u201d saying that she was putting us at an adjacent property because she had overbooked. When someone books 6 months in advance and PREPAYS, you would think that would GUARANTEE ROOMS. Obviously the driver was in cahoots with her because he started blathering on about how she wasn\u2019t going to charge us ANY EXTRA for this upgrade.

But it was the private home of someone who lived on the property and also had dogs. For many who don\u2019t enjoy the bed & breakfast atmosphere and may be allergic and fearful of dogs this could have been disastrous! The proprietor never ONCE called to check on us, never once came by to apologize, and never made any concessions at all for our inconveniences. And on top of all this, I have now discovered two erroneous charges on my credit card from her \u201cestablishment\u201d since I have been home \u2013 3 weeks now! There are uglier details to this story and I would be glad to share them if you care to email me. This is a VERY DISHONEST woman and business.

I must say that if you want to stay on this beautiful city and feel as you are at home, this os the place to be. We have loved the property. The rooms are big and huge for europeans patterns. The toilles are beautiful, the property gardens gorgeous , and the staff fantastic. Leanne treated us as kings, and if we could we would tale Mr Vicent home. But since Brazil is far from Durban, we surely can't do this. There is allways someone supervising the car Park, all very kind. I have the impression that kwala zulu people are the most polite and sympatetic popullation in the world. The house is gorgeous and the decoration beatiful. Sorry for the bad taste of someone who writed down here. Essenwood road, very near, has excellent restaurants like the unforgerable SPICE. Leanne arranged an. Extra stay in one of the other properties for two extra days, and the house was also fantastic. We just have to thank all the staff , mainly Mr. Lionel, who treated us as their sons.

We stayed in two different rooms (our doing, not theirs, as we booked two non-consecutive nights) and both were clean, beautifully decorated, and of an appropriate size. Each had its own private balcony and outdoor seating area and offered in-room cookies, Amarula liqueur, tea, and coffee. The grounds were very lush and well-manicured. We were especially impressed with the quality of our free breakfast (although this was the case all over South Africa!). Our hosts were so friendly, asking us if we needed anything and if we were comfortable. The only downside to the guest house was the location- neither of us were big fans of Durban and were surprised to find armed guards at each house. We didn't feel particularly safe walking around.
