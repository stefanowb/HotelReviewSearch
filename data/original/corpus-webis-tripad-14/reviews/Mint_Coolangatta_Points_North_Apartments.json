It has a worn, faded glory which they are only just starting to correct 20 years later (Oct 2011) by big renovations. When we visited they were working on corridor and foyers and the indoor pool. Unfortunately the serviced apartments are privately owned so it's a roulette deal as to whether the owner of the apartment you are allocated has dumped all their own crap furniture into the apartment, taken all the new tvs and appliances - or not. Luckily in this case the owner (of North Xanadu tower apartment 105) had recently purchased a new furniture package (sofa, beds, dining setting, 47\" LCD tv etc) so we did fine. The furniture closely matches the publicity shots so hopefully all owners have had to shell out and buy this package (and not take it home).", "title": "Good family value", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "tm007", "date": "October 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118922314}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The apartment itself is big compared to most Gold Coast apartments.
