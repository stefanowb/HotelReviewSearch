I arrived at 11pm on a Sunday and had to catch a 6:30 am flight the next morning, so I chose the hotel specifically because of the shuttle. I waited 25 minutes and then the shuttle drove right passed me, not even stopping at terminal 5 where I was waiting--and it was NOT full. I called the hotel and they said they would send it back \"the quick way\"....another 20 minutes later it showed up. I would have rather spent an extra $100 and stayed at another hotel....almost all had 4 shuttles go by while I was waiting for the Holiday Inn....except for the Courtyard Marriott...a couple was waiting even longer than me!", "title": "Don't stay here if you need to use the shuttle!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "msprincipal", "date": "April 26, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3415781}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Reasonable for the price", "text": "Stayed at this hotel for one night during January 2005.

Clean, big rooms, friendly staff. I am not sure what else you need! This is not a hotel for a vacation after all it is a business and stay overnight kind of place for LAX. Hotel restaurant was very good both for dinner and breakfast (Landings) and medium priced. Did not check out pool or fitness center. I am not sure what the complaint was about the shuttle to the airport. It ran every 20 minutes 24 hours a day. Driver courteous and helpful. Desk staff very friendly and helpful. Being just off Century Blvd and the 405 freeway there was a lot of traffic noise all through the night and if you are a light sleeper ask for a room on the opposite side. I would expect any hotel near the airport would have the same problem as most are on Century Blvd. Beside the traffice noise, the business center was very expensive to use so there is an internet cafe across the street at much better rates (although crossing Century blvd was hazardous!).
