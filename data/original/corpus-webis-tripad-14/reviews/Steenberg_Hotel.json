The complimentary bottles of wine were of high quality and I only wish we had time to golf on the very beautiful course associated with the hotel. There were a couple of very minor issues. The room where we stayed was closer to the laundry facilities than we would have wished and then there was the issue of the TV. Another reviewer noted the dated TVs. I opened the cabinet, agreed that it was not very modern, closed the cabinet and never opened it again. We didn't endure our long flights to watch TV.
