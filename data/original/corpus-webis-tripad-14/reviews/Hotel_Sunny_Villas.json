Within minutes, we were at the hotel bar enjoying a beer and the gorgeous view of the caldera. We stayed in a standard room the first night and a superior suite subsequent nights. The rooms were both beautiful. Note, these \"cave\" rooms are not for the claustrophobic. Bathrooms are a little dank, but you are in the side of a mountain! The pool is small, but most we saw in Santorini were as well.

I went travelling with a very good friend of mine for six weeks, we stayed at Santorini for only three days but it was just unreal. The view from our balcony/terrace was awesome.... the hotel is right next to the cliff and all you can see when you look out is the ocean and the sky. You can see so far that it seems like the ocean is touching the sky at the end.... The sunset from the balcony is also breathtaking. I'm not really a sunset person but I must say that sunset was magic.
