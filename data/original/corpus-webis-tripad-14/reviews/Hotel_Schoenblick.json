If you get a room with a balcony (ask for room 8) you'll be happy just to sit on the balcony, drinking a glass of wine or beer and enjoying the fantastic panorama; it gets the late evening sun so you can enjoy until dark. The name of the hotel really does apply in this case; it overlooks Pfronten with the mountains and Austria in the near distance.", "title": "\"Room with a View\"", "user": "disleksik", "date": "July 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 70017220}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Room was comfortable and had everything we needed. A very good buffet breakfast and good (but limited) evening menu. For 2 nights that's not a problem but you might get tired of the choice if you are there for much longer. Meals can be taken on the sun terrace but you might find yourself competing with the locals for a chair, it's obviously very popular with the people who live there, always a good sign. Owner/chef and wife very friendly, you won't be disappointed. We speak german which might help but the previous review in no way reflects what we found!
