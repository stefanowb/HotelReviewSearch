Never being to Sorrento we were concerned about the hotel's location as some reviews made us think the hotel was located walking distance of 20 to 25 minutes from Sorrento town and on a very dangerous road. We were pleased to find out that the hotel is located at most 10 minutes from shopping and stores and 25 minutes from a very busy Plazza Tasso. Yes the road is narrow but the sidewalk only requires you to walk single file in one area approx 50-60 feet long. I should add that we were travelling with our 15 month old daughter and she was in a stroller, but found the navigation of the sidewalk a very slight inconvience.", "title": "A Great Stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "lemonaid", "date": "October 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5979279}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Since we had booked quite late the hotel had only a room with a Sea-view available.

Our room had a leaking toilet for the entire 4 days we were there. We reported it to the desk the 1st morning since my husband's sleep was disturbed by the noise. They had their parking valet/handyman take a look, but he said a plumber would be needed to fix it. The hotel never took care of the problem. We kept the bathroom door shut each night, but could still hear the noise. The staff are definitely \"uninterested\" as stated in the Rick Steeves guidebook.
