Dynasty Suites is listed on the Glen Ivy web site as one of the hotels in the area. We booked a two bedroom suite and expected it to have a living room area in addition to 2 bedrooms but the door opened into a room with a king size bed, large desk, small table & chairs and armoire with TV. A second bedroom held another king size bed and access to the bathroom. Big points for the mattress being the best hotel mattress I've slept on and the bath towels were very thick and absorbent. Breakfast in the morning had fresh made-to-order waffles and a variety of cereals, bagels, fruit, etc. The hotel also offered complimentary cocktail coupons for the nearby Cask & Cleaver restaurant which we used at dinner. We would stay here again.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "DianeRD", "date": "June 26, 2005", "id": 3613148}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect family set up", "text": "Stayed here January 2, 2004, had their 3 bed family suite, just perfect for 2 adults and 3 kids.

I can't say enough good things about this little hotel. Awesome staff for one. I checked in and told the front desk that I was giving up my Hilton points to stay here and they upgraded my room for free. When you arrive they have hot chocolate, tea, coffee, brownies, cookies, soda, water, fruit, all for you in the lobby. They also have this great little lounge area thats open 24/hours a day with a huge Samsung Touch of Color LCD. The beds are AMAZING! Bath and body works products in the bathroom. Tons of extras in the bathroom such as toothpaste, toothbrush, etc... Loved this hotel for the price, only wish my work would have booked me the jacuzzi suite :) It looks too cool!", "title": "This place is so awesome!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "teena192", "date": "October 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 21078215, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 bed, staff, lobby area, decor, parking, freeway access, bath products", "disliked": "\u2014 it's in Corona"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled with family", "text": "TIP- Blowdryer is in ironing board cabinet.", "title": "Great Service", "user": "JoniSanJose_CA", "date": "May 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 16423697, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Service and great towels, beds and bedding.
