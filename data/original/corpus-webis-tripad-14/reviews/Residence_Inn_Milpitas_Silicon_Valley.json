Very impressed with the comfortable queen bed, 1/2 dozen pillows with snappy new pillow cases... oh can't forget to throw a shout out to what seemed like brand new towels also.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Rich a", "date": "February 6, 2006", "id": 4418120}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "Here's how far my $100 - out the door - got me and my family...", "title": "Great Hotel for a Family", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "wacko", "date": "January 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4319126}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Home away from Home", "text": "STAFF - Offered free shuttle* services within a 5 mile radius of hotel, which we took to the Great Mall of Milpitas and connecting light rail station.
