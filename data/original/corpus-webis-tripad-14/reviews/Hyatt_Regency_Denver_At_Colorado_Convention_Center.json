The staff was so pleasant and accomodating and the location can't be beat. As previously mentioned you can walk to many good restaurants. The trolley which runs down 16th street runs every five minutes and is free.

I stayed on the 30th floor and had to take a special elevator (second set of elevators) to get to my room. The lobby is huge, with lots of seating. The room is spacious with a flat screen tv, work station, and chair. Granite counter tops in the bathroom with plenty of room to spread out. You have to pay for internet even in the business center. Which was very expensive. When you are on business travel, internet is a must. You can print your boarding pass. The gym was available 24 hours and has the nicest gym that I have seen. You can walk to plenty of places to eat from this hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MaloneV", "date": "April 27, 2010", "id": 62589398}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I was very pleasantly surprised by this giant chain hotel. They have added local flavor in their decor, such as the GORGEOUS light fixtures in all of the main areas and large ballrooms and the fantastic rock climber sculpture in the lobby. The lobby bar is open and bright and a natural gathering space. I never had a chance to go up to the Altitude bar/restaurant, but a local friend told me that the view is fantastic. The hotel gym was the best I have experienced, open 24 hours with lots of natural light, the person that designed the gym is clearly a pro. They had every free weight, band, kettle ball, and machine one could want, plus a pool and hot tub. I would stay here again any time for the gym alone! The staff in every part of the hotel is at your service and super helpful and polite. They really go out of their way to ensure you have a good stay. They also had recycling bins in the hotel room, which is a huge plus for me. Normally I am a boutique hotel traveler, so giving this hotel 5 stars is a great surprise!", "title": "Beautiful hotel, could be even better", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "GetTheBestForLess", "date": "April 26, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 62482642}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled on business", "text": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel while he attended a work conference at the Convention Center next door.

The elevators are quick and effecient, and have this cool tv screen in them that runs video of calming nature scenes, complete with sound (like the dusk pond scene with crickets). Everytime you got on the elevator, there was a different scene, very unique concept that I think I miss! 24 complimentary fitness center was good. Our room was quiet and it was nice in such a tall building to have a window you could crack open for some fresh air.
