The staff are personable and as friendly as you want to be. We ate in all the restaurants and as a veggie was well catered for including the Japanese/sushi restaurant. Our favourite place was the bar with its lovely big comfy sofas and a menu that suited us. We did need to change rooms due to being given an interconnecting room so we did hear next door but the room change was swift and painless. We were there for a rest which we got and the spa was just lovely with the garden well worth a chill out in afterwards.

First, the staff is extraordinary in the care with which they meet their guests' needs and expectations from the moment you enter the lobby. And they do so without being obsequious. Second, the facility is superb--the room, the outdoor and indoor pools, and the restaurants. Third, the grounds are gorgeous. I would like to say a special word re the Club Floor on which we stayed. We paid the extremely reasonable rate which included enjoying five \"meals\" during the course of the day. I am still marvelling at the quality of those meals and the superb ratio of value to that quality. Breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, hors d'oeuvres, and nightcaps/dessert were the \"meals\" served over the course of the day. And they truly were meals. A huge array of cheese, cold meats, salads, breads, fruit, soups, stews, pastries and cakes, flan, and so on and so forth greeted us every day. Moreover, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) flowed all day. It was a wonderful way to learn about Portuguese wines (both still and sparkling). Finally, the staff on the Club Floor were extraordinary. Without exception, they were charming, helpful, and knowledgeable. They were extremely solicitous of our daughter which made her feel very special and increased her enjoyment (and thereby ours) of our vacation. Bottom line, I cannot recommend this resort highly enough and would definitely suggest that if you go to the resort that you stay on the Club Floor.", "title": "Penha Long Is Perfect", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "MKCNyc", "date": "October 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10113457, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Unevenness of the Kids' Club"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "I cannot rate them highly enough and I will use this hotel as a benchmark in the future!
