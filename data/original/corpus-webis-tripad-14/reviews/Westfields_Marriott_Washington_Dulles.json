We stayed there two nights while visiting D.C. and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious enough for the four of us without ever feeling crowded, the beds were super-comfortable, and the outdoor pool was large and really nice! We almost forgot how close we were to a major international airport (Dulles), which you cannot hear from the hotel -- or how close we were to the City itself. Our only disappointment with the hotel was no in-room refrigerator! Even my daughter said \"Mommy, can't they just buy one, they're like 60 bucks.\" My guess is they don't want you to have in-room food but instead want you to eat the hotel food, which would be fine if the snack shop was ever open! It was closed the entire time we where there. The mini-Starbucks in the lobby is a nice amenity, though, and fortunately Target was only a five-minute drive so we ran out for snacks and drinks and kept stuff on ice in the sink. Only other mention: ask if you will get free internet or you may end up paying $13 a day for it. Other than that -- a really nice, relaxing hotel with a resort feel. Oh, how could I forget?!
