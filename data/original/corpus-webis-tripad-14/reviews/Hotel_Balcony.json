They provided a good breakfast of cereal, fresh fruit and buns and an automatic expresso/ hot chocolate machine that actually made really good cappucinos! I saw people with young children and they were very helpful and engaged.

The staff were excellent and so friendly and helpful that they made up for some problems. The a/c did not work and they did not have another room for us so they apologized and asked if we didn't mind propping our window open at night. It wasn't too warm yet so that was fine except that our room looked out directly onto the huge \"Balcony\" and they allowed it to be open all night. Guests were there drinking wine and enjoying the evening air at midnight and by 12:30am we called down to the front desk and said we can't sleep because of the noise. He came up to double check the A/C and could hear the people and said that it was still TOO EARLY to ask them to leave and I said we just want to sleep and it is not our fault that the A/C does not work. We told him that we had an early booking for the Uffizi at 8:30am and probably alot of the other guests were in Florence to sight see as well. He agreed and said he'd talk to the guests on the Balcony and explain and ask them to try to keep it quiet. It only worked for 30min and they were loud until 2am. The reception guy was nice and asked us how it went in the morning but I said in the end we had to sleep with our window shut so we were uncomfortable but he meant well and it is really the Hotel that sets the policy. I am going to write them a letter and let them know my concerns since they try so hard and seem so friendly trying to make your stay enjoyable. The other thing that is a problem here is that even though there are no smoking signs posted everywhere in the hotel, smoke wafts up and it is pretty strong.
