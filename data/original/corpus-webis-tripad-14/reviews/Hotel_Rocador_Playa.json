The rooms are very traditional Spanish - heavy dark furniture, ours was actually painted green, red and silver! But the room had air con, was close to the pool, cleaned every day, fresh linen and towels and we had a view onto the beach and sideways onto the sea. No noise at night. Little bit in the morning as we were close to the dining room but nothing to worry about.", "user": "Javea03730", "date": "August 19, 2013", "id": 173013899}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Worthy of a 3 STAR!!", "text": "We used the Rocador Playa pool on the first day as the Rocador pool had no loungers left. The Rocador pool area is nicer - better loungers and the pool shower works. After that, we always found 2 loungers available and there was plenty of shade if you wanted it.", "user": "Ironbridge2000", "date": "August 14, 2013", "id": 172247452}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Great location - go for room only", "text": "The pool bar was great and all the bar staff were lovely. The food and drinks are good but a bit pricey. You can buy cheaper ice creams, drinks, snacks, etc at the supermarket at the end of the road but it is nice to have the bar there if you feel like staying put all day. Very nice pizza, salads and sangria!", "user": "schna11", "date": "August 13, 2013", "id": 172116499}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "I was worried about reviews too!", "text": "The reception staff were very nice and helpful, except for the blonde woman with glasses.
