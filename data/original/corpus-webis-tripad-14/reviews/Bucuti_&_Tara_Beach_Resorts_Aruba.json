We stayed in April '07 with friends and recently in Sept. '07 by ourselves. The hotel personnel are congenial and always willing to assist in any manner. The problem with Bucuti is the management and specifically the Resort Manager. Unfortunately this individual does not subscribe to the motto \"the customer is always right\". My wife and I had been ordering the same drink in April and again upon our recent return. Same drink, same price..................until one time, this visit, when the pricing was different. I simply asked the bartender to check with our usual bartender. Instead the Resort Manager came over and proceeded to give us a lecture on the size of the drink and make us feel totally uncomfortable. She asked \"how many shots did you order?\" I said I didn't order by the shot. I said I had been ordering the same drink 20 times over. The Resort Manager even came back with a martini glass to show me the level a shot came to. Needless to say this episode has squashed any desire to return to Bucuti.

The Suites are quite spacious and well-appointed, with a sink, microwave, minibar that has space for extras, a sitting area, and a bedroom with sliding doors that open to the sitting area. There is also a balcony that looks out over the beach and ocean. The bathroom is very good and about what you'd expect as far as size is concerned. The beach is the best in Aruba, and is perfect for those who want a beach that is spread out and feels uncrowded. The Bucuti is meant for couples who want a quiet, romantic retreat. The high rise hotels are meant for those who bring their children or want a party atmosphere. I will unfortunately have to agree with those who give the Pirate's Nest Restaurant at the Bucuti a less than glowing review. Although the restaurant is well located on the beach with a sunset view, the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare we each ordered was very poor. The menu suggested that it would contain shrimp, scallops, and calamari. What we received was spaghetti with salad bar tiny shrimp that you can buy in a can, a few scallops, and filler white fish. No calamari to be found. There are many great restaurants a short cab ride away, so you don't even need to eat there. The South American steakhouses like El Gaucho are excellent, as are the Italian restuarants like Hostaria da Vittorio. Pizza Bob's is just in front of the hotel and is a good place for lunch or an informal dinner. Otherwise, the Bucuti is a great place to stay for a relaxing beach vacation.

This hotel would be considered smaller in comparison to the other high rises on the island but that is part of the beauty. You do NOT have 500 rooms with 500+ guest all packed onto the beach like sardines. It all seems very private and there is always room on the beach with palapas (umbrellas) and lounge chairs for the guests. The beach is huge meaning deep from waters edge inland, not this strip of sand right along the water. The rooms are fantastic, we have always stayed in the Tara Beach Suites which include a sink, refridgerator, dishes and silverware so if you wish to go to the grocery store and get some food you can. Having lunch on the beach is great but can get pricey if you do it every day, so making sandwiches can save a few bucks as well as getting sodas and even making some mixed drinks yourself. If you do not stay at the Suites or in a \"ocean view\" room... as one other review pointed out there was no view, well they did not pay for a room with a view so you can't really compain about it. Although it may not be \"oceanview\" no view would be bad at this resort. If you are thinking about renting a car for the duration of your trip I would highly recommed AGAINST it. There really is no need, spend the money on the upgraded room. Take the time to understand and use the bus system! It is very cheap and easy, $2 round trip per person, there is a main road that runs from town all the way the way down which ends at the highrises. So the Bucuti is in the middle somewhere. Take advantage of this you can do all your eating and shopping this way at a VERY low cost. If you want to explore rent a car for a day which the Bucuti will help set up for you. We have not done much exploring so I can not comment on what to see. The staff is awsome, sooo helpful. We liked some art they had hanging and they found the artist and the name and addess and phone number on where it could be purchased... which was not liked to them at all, now thats service. They are always helpful and genuinly interested in how you are and if you need anything. The only downfall to this place is the Pirates Nest Restuarant (for dinner) it is fine for a burger etc at lunch, so just make other choices for dinner, unless you want the dinner on the beach.
