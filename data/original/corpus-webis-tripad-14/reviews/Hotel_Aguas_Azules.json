It was the first time for both of us . At the beginning we were worried about this hotel after reading some nasty reviews but to be honest I had little to no complaints at all. The beach was beautiful (cristal clear water), our room was clean with a great view, the people who worked there were always friendly , we met people from all over the world and going into town was fabulous(double decker bus can take you every hour into town). I had heard a lot of complaints about bugs but the only time i really saw ants was if we dropped food on the floor. The room and hotel was always clean though. I also heard a lot of complaints about noise and parties but to be honest that was never a real problem for us. Some nights were louder but you have to realize that you will find this anywhere. There were also lots of families and older people there so it is not a hotel that is just filled with teenagers on spring break. The only complaint I really had was with the food but it wasn't as terrible as people say ; just a little different and not much variety. As far as \u00e0 la cartes go though we went to two and the Cuban one was by far my favourite. The chicken was to die for. My last little comment is there are many people out there that are never satisfied but if you go there with an open mind and with the idea that it is a new country you will be fine !

You can always find something to eat, but food at times was cold. I have been to Cuba many times, but this was my first time at a 3 star, If price is an issue, I would say spend a little extra and upgrade to a better hotel.

There were many areas in need of serious repair, and not much to look at in terms of decoration, etc. The hallways were dark, and the stairways looked like underground parking garages. Even the main lobby was on the ugly side. Our room was really nice though, and very clean which is way more important than how stuff looks. The beds were comfortable, the shower worked great, we had lots of hot water, and no toilet issues. We had requested adjoining rooms, which we were given, and we had a balcony over looking one of the pool areas. As people have mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is very large, and it is a bit of a walk to get anywhere. It is also hard to find your way around at first, as there aren't really any directional signs, and the ones at are there don't make any sense.", "title": "Best beach, friendly people", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Wfamily3233", "date": "March 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 101048940}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "RESTAURANTS AND BARS", "title": "Pros and Cons", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Logger1", "date": "March 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 101025702}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 174, "average": 285, "very good": 375, "terrible": 139, "excellent": 106}, "aka": "Resort Aguas Azules", "slim_ranking": 0.661016949153, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 3.5, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}}
