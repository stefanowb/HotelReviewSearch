The room was large and very comfortable. The staff was very pleasant. The hotel has free parking out front which is a rare commodity in the old clifftop section of Arcos. They'll even let you double park if you are at the hotel and move the car for you if needed. Be warned though the streets at the top getting to the Parador are very, very narrow (flip in your sideview mirrors at some points) and it can be a bit nerve wracking, especially for Americans used to a bit more room on their roads. The last night we gave up and parked in a pay lot at the bottom of the hill and walked up. For such a nice hotel the room rates are reasonble. Breakfast while good, was fairly expensive.", "title": "nice hotel, challenging to get to", "user": "arcoonetoe", "date": "September 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5731852, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Balcony and view", "disliked": "\u2014 Road access"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006", "text": "The white knuckle drive straight up a mountain is quickly forgotten once you open the shudders and take in the eye-popping views from this cliffside parador.

Likewise, the restaurant was good, even if the menu is rather limited and the service dis-spirited. Getting up to the parador by car is a real challenge and not for the faint of heart. The trick seems to be to drive with authority and to never actually stop moving. Remember to tuck in your side view mirrors or you WILL lose them. These streets, if they can be called streets, define steep and narrow. Parking is a nightmare. In our case, when we arrived we were told to double park behind another vehicle and to leave our keys with the front desk.
