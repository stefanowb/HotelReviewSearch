Mini-fridge was provided, and air conditioning worked well--not always true at *** hotels. Excellent view of ocean with small patio (if ocean-view room is booked). Busy road between hotel and beach (hotel has underground beach access), but excellent soundproofing in room. Staff was courteous and helpful. Excellent breakfast included, but avoid the restaurant otherwise. Other meals at the restaurant were truly bad, a rare occurrence in Spain. Parking is advertised as available at a cost, but the garage was full. We got very lucky with street parking.", "title": "Entirely satisifed - except the restaurant.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "hcajones", "date": "June 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 67702918}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "We (2 rooms, 3 adults also with 1 child and 1 baby) stayed at the hotel for a night on the way to Andorra.
