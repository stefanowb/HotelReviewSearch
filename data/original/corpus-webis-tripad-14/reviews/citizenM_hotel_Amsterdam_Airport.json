The check-in is amazingly quick and can be done without talking to anyone, if you choose. The computer guides you through the system; however, two guest service personnel stand by for your convenience. The lobby is beautiful. The room is small (the width of the room is the length of a kingsized bed), but it is so well laid out, you would hardly notice the size. The pod toilet is private enough that you don't feel awkward about utilizing the facility with another person in the room. The TV and the room remote control is awesome. Now, the only negative about this room...the shower. Since the pod shower only works when it is closed, it is not possible to get warm water flowing before you step into the pod. This burst of cold water from the roof of the shower is quite the wake-up. The check-out from the room is just as easy as the check-in. The hotel is immediately adjacent to the airport and it is perfect for early morning departures! Also, I will seriously consider this as my base hotel for visiting Amsterdam in the future, despite the fact that it is a brief train ride from the center of town.
