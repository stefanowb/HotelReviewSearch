We did so in July for October and the place was already booked. I kept emailing them and finally there was a cancellation. It was a suite - - the Teolinda Suite to be precise. It was a bit pricey for the area (who knows about Varenna except Rick Steve's readers) and double the price of a room in the lower level area of the hotel. It turned out our money was well spent. Situated between the lounge/restaurant level (located on the top floor) and the check in/cafe area on the lower level, our room was very private. There were no adjacent rooms on either side, though there were two rooms on the floor above us. We never heard any of our neighbors -- t.v., voices, footsteps, nothing. The suite has it's own private entrance from the outside. The suite itself was very large comprised of a sitting area, a large bed that was a bit soft but not uncomfortable, and a sufficiently-sized bathroom. Based on some of the reviews, I was expecting to find a monastic-type decor (i.e., sparse), but our room was decorated very nicely. It also was very clean. The balcony was amazing. Very expansive. Enjoyed several evenings drinking wine and watching the sunset. Overall, we really enjoyed Eremo Gaudio. It was a unique hotel experience. Additionally, Varenna turned out to be a really charming town. I was concerned that there would be nothing there, but they have some really good restaurants. In fact, one of our best meals of our entire trip was at Vecchia Varenna. Superb food and not outrageously expensive. Lakeside views are available at the restaurant. We did some hiking around the hotel and took the ferry to Bellagio. Better shopping there, but very touristy. Liked Varenna better particularly after all the hustle and bustle of Rome and Florence.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "clairann2000", "date": "October 4, 2007", "id": 10040299}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Amazing View!!!!!", "text": "One last comment. It really is a hike from the train station to Eremo Gaudio. With heavy bags it's a real workout if you're not in reasonably good shape or use to doing regular exercise. It takes about 30 minutes lugging heavy bags. You also have to walk along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the center of town. (The hotel is past this area.) It can be dangerous as cars travel pretty fast and there are some bends in the road. Then there's the road leading up to the hotel. It's a real killer with the luggage and bags. On the other hand, it's downhill going back to the train station. If you stay in one of the upper level rooms, you have to take the funicular/tram.
