A quiet location with good transport links via the tram into the heart of the city. We purchased a 24hr ticket for up to five people approx \u00a39. We had booked what we thought was a self-catering apt with air-conditioning through booking.com, however when we arrived we were given a suite with two bedrooms and a bathroom - no kitchen facilities or air-conditioning. It was explained by the member of staff that there was some confusion between their website description and what booking.com offered. We were offered complimentary breakfasts for our stay, which went a long way to solving our self catering needs. There was a small (bar size) fridge which we used to keep drinks cool in the room. The room was clean and had a tiny balcony for one person to sit on. The breakfast area was very pretty with an outside area to eat in, which was very comfortable given the high temperatures in August. The usual breakfast was available, cold meat, cheese, cereals, boiled eggs, bread rolls. The hotel has a comfortable lounge area and a lovely covered outside seating area. A separate smoking area is provided in the corner of the garden. The staff were very friendly especially the night man who spoke excellent English and found us a fan to help alleviate the very hot temperature of our room also the lady who sorted out our booking problems. The only negative to this hotel is the man who we believe must have been the owner...he visited the hotel everyday, but never smiled or spoke with the guests.", "title": "A good find, would stay again", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "FamilyTrav11lers", "date": "August 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137004007}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled solo", "text": "If you choose to stay at this place, remember, you get what you pay for.

It has won the 'Best small hotel in Budapest' prize, and is immaculately run by a small and devoted staff. They exhibit a warmth of welcome that is positively infectious \u2013 guests frequently talk to each other! All rooms are doubles, some have sitting-rooms, some have balconies, and there are a number of 'apartments' with self-catering facilities. There is a well-served breakfast room with a very pleasant terrace, and coffee, drinks and other refreshments can be had at reception. Beatrix has no dining room, but there is no shortage of good restaurants within a few minutes' walk \u2013 and for those that want country walks as well as city facilities the forests of J\u00e1noshegy and H\u0171v\u00f6sv\u00f6lgy are also just up the road in the other direction. I have stayed there more times than I can tell, and in Budapest would never go anywhere else \u2013 I have on occasion turned down city centre five-star accommodation at other people's expense and asked to be put in Beatrix.", "title": "Excellent small hote with good service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LongtimeEngland", "date": "January 14, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 53449769}], "location": {"country": "Hungary", "region": "Central Hungary", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Budapest"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 2, "very good": 3, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 18}, "aka": "Beatrix Panzio Budapest", "slim_ranking": 0.332335329341}
