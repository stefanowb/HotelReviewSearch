We stayed in the Mexicana Suite which was perfect for us. The beds were very comfy! Despite rain & drizzle , the kids still had a great time. We took raincoats so they could still play outdoors in the rain. The TV had Austar which helped keep us all happy during wetter periods! The kids were a little timid at first but soon became more confident and comfortable with all the animals. The dogs, chickens, frogs,peacocks and kangaroos were a big hit! Canungra and Beaudesert are close by if you need supplies and the location to Tamborine is perfect. We were very comfy and overall had a great time. Great spot for weddings or family gatherings.
