Beautiful rooms with hand-carved furnishings and tiled bathrooms. The staff was friendly and helpful. The one drawback would have been the street noise. I had an exterior room and the noise from the street below was quite loud until about midnight. After that it was relatively quiet, though when I wanted an earlier sleep, I needed earplugs. If noise is a concern you may want to request an interior room. Another suggestion, when I arrived in Taxco at the bus station, I decided to walk the short distance to the hotel, figuring the exercise would do me some good after sitting all those hours. Though the hotel wasn't far, Taxco is built on a steep hill with narrow, winding, maze-like streets. As I dragged myself up the hill and through a narrow, crowded market, with a hockey bag that felt like it was becoming heavier with every step, I regretted not taking the taxi ride up. Do yourself a favor, don't be a tough-guy (or gal) like I was and hire a cab for the short distance. Believe me, you'll get plenty of exercise just sightseeing and shopping in this town!", "title": "Gem of a Hotel that's Close to the Action", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Grizinator", "date": "February 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 13876278, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Ambiance and Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Street noise"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled solo", "text": "This is a quaint hotel right by the central square.

It wasn't much good as there was noise from people in the Lobby until past 1:00 a.m. - thankfully she was tired and slept fairly well.
