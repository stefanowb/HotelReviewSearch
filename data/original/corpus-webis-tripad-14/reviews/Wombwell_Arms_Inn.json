I was warmly received by the proprietor from the bus from York, which dropped me at the door. My room was spotless, best cotton sheets, and very comfortable with an excellent though compact bathroom. My breakfast was perfect in every respect (now that's not easy) and when I found that I had lost a button from my shirt and asked for needle and cotton, the lady of the house very kindly insisted on sewing it on for me! A friend and I had Sunday lunch outside in the courtyard - which rated ten out of ten for us both - served by a most courteous local lad who had clearly been trained to the highest standards. I am a well travelled person - due to my business - and lucky enough to be used to staying in the best hotels around the world.
