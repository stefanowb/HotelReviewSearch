The hotel is in a great location in the old lower part of the city, and is within easy walking distance of all of old Quebec City. Our room was average size but very pleasantly decorated (see photos). The bed was the best hotel bed I've ever slept in, including the beds at the chain that has the \"heavenly bed.\" The biggest plus about this hotel for me was how quiet it was. I'm a light sleeper, and I slept well in this hotel. The hotel had a very attractive lobby, with comfy couches and chairs all near a big fireplace. There was complimentary coffee and tea in this area, which is where breakfast was served every morning as well. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful, without being overbearing. Overall, I'd say the Dominion 1912 was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in, and I'd return if I ever get back to Quebec City.", "title": "Peaceful Dominion", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "CosmoC", "date": "June 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7955333, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pleasant atmosphere and the bed.", "disliked": "\u2014 Nada"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at!", "title": "Best hotel!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Gregan", "date": "June 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7780488, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The bed!", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing at all"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled on business", "text": "The staff were friendly, the room was lovely, the toiletries were fantastic (Aveda) and the bed and pillows were so comfortable.

The concierge was willing to help with dinner reservations and did an excellent job in securing my requests. For dinners our favorite was Ristorante Michelangelo. It is a bit out of the area (about a 15/20 minute drive), but they send a car for you and return you to the hotel with no fee for this service.

I was debating between this and the 71, but opted for the Dominion and would look no further. In fact I am planning a summer golf trip just to go back. A boutique hotel, unpretentious, the first superb characteristic is the service. I am sure I could have ordered a camel and they would have found one. Polite to the extreme, attention to detail and made us feel so welcome. The lobby is fabulous, featuring comfy, plush chairs and sofas. Perfect to sit in front of the roaring fire and have a drink or to go over the many menus they will provide you with for nearby restaurants. So simple in design but truly elegant and warm. I was afraid the modern aspect of the rooms would be cold, but far from it. The rooms are immaculate, large, you could fit 6 people in the shower. Put it this way, when you walk into the room, your radio is playing soft music and there is a square black dish on the swing tray beside your bed with two green apples in it. When you go back to the room for the night, your bed has been turned down with wonderful robes awaiting and the dish is now on the window sill and in its place is the tv guide opened to the day with the tv converter on it. Detail..detail..detail. The breakfast in the lobby and adjoining room is a continental and everything you would want, hard boiled eggs, granola, yogurt, fruit, croissants, pain du chocolate, breads, jams. There is also a 24 hour wonderful cappuccino/espresso maker and also available is hot chocolate and tea. In the morning, our skis which were secured in the hotel were place in our vehicle, and the car was de-iced and warmed for us. (sigh)Can you tell I didn't want to leave.?
