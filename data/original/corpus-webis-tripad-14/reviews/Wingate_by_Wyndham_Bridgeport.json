The hotel is great for business travelers and families. The rooms are clean and spacious; the hotel staff friendly and professional; and the breakfast buffet has a good variety of foods and lasts from 6am-10am everyday. The hotel is within 5 minutes of a large variety of shopping centers and the scenery in this area is absolutely breathtaking. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "fishfry", "date": "June 3, 2006", "id": 5296283}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very nice hotel", "text": "New hotel on a hilltop in an area being developed.
