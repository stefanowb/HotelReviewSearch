It is in a nice location just a few minutes out of Cle Elum. Cle Elum is a small town, so you can walk to basically anywhere from the hotel. When we checked into the hotel, the desk clerk there (very friendly) gave us some excellent restaurant suggestions for dinner. We ended up eating at the Sunset Cafe, which had fantastic \"famous\" raveoli. After dinner we went for a swim in the lodge's outdoor pool, which was very clean and refreshing. The rooms were nice, with a large bathroom and a sink/vanity outside. The complimentary continental breakfast in the morning was also a nice touch, and we really enjoyed the waffles. We had an extremely pleasant stay, and would stay there again if we returned to Cle Elum.", "title": "Great Stay for the Price!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "dogbone1002000", "date": "June 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5405945}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Cle Elum"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 11, "very good": 12, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 3}, "slim_ranking": 0.857142857143}
