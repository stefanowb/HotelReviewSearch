We enjoyed the hotel. The room was nice and spacious, the hotel was very clean. We did not hear any noise from the freeway. Used the pool and hot tub and they were fine. Breakfast was okay about what you get at any hotel breakfast bar. We paid $125.00 per night and felt that was a good value for the money in the area.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Sassycruiser", "date": "March 22, 2005", "id": 3294354}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Place is Tacky", "text": "We would recommend this hotel and would stay there again if we were in the Seal Beach area.", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "globalTapir", "date": "February 6, 2005", "id": 3166179}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fantastic Hotel", "text": "I think people writing the reviews are responding to things like cleanliness, breakfast, everything new etc. But what a monstrosity to look at! Really fake-oh cheap-oh nouvelle riche furniture in scary burgundy colors. We walked into our room and were extremely disappointed. In fact we were frightened. The headboards look like giant carved pineapples from WalMart or something. And the artwork is very phony pretentious. It basically looks like some no-taste executive decided to build a chain of hotels using the same phony \"upscale\" furniture everywhere, every location, every room. It's like cookie cutter ugly. It really gave nightmares. We ended up staying anyway and didn't like it at all. The pool was okay, the breakfast mediocre, the staff friendly but this place really was a huge let down. It doesn't look like the photos at all. Also they make a big deal about no smoking and THEN all the smokers congregate around the pool (prohibited) and it is ridiculous. If you have good taste, this is not for you. If you want a calm, relaxing vista, this is not for you. If you hate cookie cutter airport lounge feeling, this is not for you. If you think this is anything like a \"European Boutique Spot\" - run, fast, in the other direction!", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "djy1", "date": "November 16, 2004", "id": 2829392}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Unbelievable!", "text": "Someone in my company suggested the Ayres Hotel to me as it was near the company that I was going to work with in Cypress, Ca.

It is gorgeous European Boutique hotel. Very nice professional staff. Try the two restaurants across the street Spaghettini and Kobe's (the sushi at Kobe's is best Ihave ever had). Spaghettini is not an Italian restaurant even though the name sounds like it. I was told it was one of the most popular restaurants in the county!

The front desk staff really made us feel special. If you want to stay in a hotel that has fresh baked cookies waiting for you at check-in, and has the nicest rooms in town, then this is the hotel for you.
