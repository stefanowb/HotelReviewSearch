That has become an expectation that bears little discrimination among good hotels. The real goodness of a hotel is measured by its personality. Staff are the most important element of any good hotel and the DoubleTree at Old Town in Istanbul sets the bar. Consistently, I have been treated well here. Burak, who runs the food service section, is sociable and a gentleman. He will welcome you and make you feel at home. The restaurant staff are attentive. The location of this hotel could not be better. A one minute walk to the tram. Five minutes you are at the Grand Bazaar. Ten minutes you can be at Sulyaname Mosque. Without question this hotel is excellent. One downside - but this is true of all the Hilton properties - is the internet service. I do receive it complimentary as a Diamond member.

Staff was extremely friendly from the moment we arrived. I would request a corner room if available as I believe they may be a bit larger from reading some other comments about the rooms being small. Our corner room was a street front room but if you close the windows and use the A/C it is not bothersome at night. The breakfast is amazing and the in room wifi is very reliable, both are complimentary for gold level and above. The spa and workout room are also both well equipped. You cannot beat the location in the Old Town as all the major sites are within walking distance and there is a tram stop right out the front door if needed.
