We arrived late off the ferry on the first night and its only a 15 minutes drag your cases up the hill to the hotel. (10 minutes on the way down!) They were so organised and welcoming to us. The next day we departed to Corte on the train (again within easy walking distance) Go on the train - it's wonderful! We arrived back a week later for a couple of days relaxing. There are two beaches near by - keep on walking to the far one past the exercise area (Plage Trottel) - it's much cleaner than the main one. The Musee Fesch is well worth a visit, although closed when we went. Plenty of restaurants and bars near by. We ate in the Place Foch area - quite expensive but good sea food. There is a supermarket (Spar) just around the corner on Av de Paris which is the road running opposite Place Foch. A really good pastry shop opposite. Much cheaper to grab a picnic and eat and drink on the beach or in the lovely squares! So you can do Ajaccio on the cheap! Hotel has really good breakfasts - as many pain au choc, croissants, bread, cheese, fruit as you want, and you can probably guess us cheapskates got some for lunch as well. A big bag down to breakfast works wonders! Rooms are small but really clean and the air conditioning is fierce. Bathrooms were fine if not a little quirky but again very clean. Not fabulous views but this hotel is really good value, well positioned for everything, very clean with good staff.", "title": "Good value", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Chorleyreview", "date": "August 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 18738348, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Parking is a challenge", "text": "The Napoleon has one thing going for it -- it is one block from the city center. After that, I am not sure what makes the place so highly rated. The rooms are really small, and the bathroom must be seen to be believed. The tub / shower is one of those European death traps - -you step up to get in, there is no way to sit or recline in the tub (far too small), and, here's the unique feature, the tub bottom is partly humped and partly recessed below the other part. There really is no way to stand in it. The soap they give you is so small that when I dropped it, it went down the drain (no kidding). And the toilet itself -- well -- let's not go into that, but if you are a midget, this is the place for you. There really is no public area of the hotel -- the lobby is small. They do have an elevator (small). The staff is kind, and they have a sense of humor about the whole thing. We had a rental car, and we selected the Napoleon because it has parking. Well, the parking probably was designed by the same guy that designed the tub. The 'Hotel Napoleon Parking' sign on the Course Napoleon ('Main St.' of Ajaccio) should be ignored. It points down a one way street in the wrong direction. Ignore the next street to the west also because that puts you in a very narrow alley that can not be exited. Then take the next street to the West, go two blocks, and turn back toward the airport -- this puts you to the Hotel Napoleon Guarage -- which is unattended, and has a chain across the entrance -- and a microphone where you call the front desk. The lady at the desk tells you that you are in the wrong place, so get back in the car and continue down the street (you can not make a u-turn anyway), and this puts you onto Rue Vero (near to where the first parking sign was), then left into a dead end that is very narrow indeed. No guarage in sight? Not a problem, look at knee level for another microphone and this gets you the same lady at the front desk - who magically opens a guarage door. Hope you rented a small car -- the guarage has a single space, and like everything else, it is small.

The views from the front balaconies are a delight i.e. views of the old town rising up the hill are spectacularly bathed in sunlight. The beach private beach and restaurant is not attached to the hotel - but over the main carriageway and a short walk to your right. Because Mention is near the border with Italy, there is a carriageway where traffic can be noisy and scooters race up the mountain road. This added to our 'people watching enjoyment' There are two train stations, one in town, and Garavan five minutues walk to the left, where you can ride to Italy and Monaco , Eze mountain top village etc., in the other direction. Take a local bus (near the main station) up to the hill top villages of Gorbio, St. Agnes (where there is a Maginot Fort and spectacular views) for a few euros. It's hair raising but worth the ride and the views over the bay are magnificient. These villages have excellent, expensive restaurants.
