If you are skiing or taking advantage of the activities on and around Lake Louise, it is a nice base. We did not try the restaurant unfortunately, as we have heard it is good. The room is on the rustic side, but for the price in that location it was fine. Hallways are a little noisy due to wood construction.

It is breathtakingly beautiful and I didn't tire of looking at the scenery. It is a very short walk walk to the Fairmont which has a bit more to do there..ice skating, snow shoeing etc. We ate at the restaurant at Deer Lodge and the food was wonderful especially the Christmas dinner.

The location is perfect. you dont have to spend the crazy amount to stay right on the lake with the Fairmont, when you can stay a 2 minute walk away, maybe even less at this hotel. The room that I stayed in with my mother, had 2 single beds. It was quite small really, only had the beds and the bathroom and a desk. But then i went over to my uncles room and saw how big it was. It had a nice little sitting room, and a lovely queen bed. So it all depends on what room you are looking for and how much you want to spend. Dont get me wrong, i loved our room, it was cute, but if you want something bigger it is available. We ate breakfast at the hotel as well, and it was not included, but was delicious. I had a meal that had a whole bunch of different meats to try. Yum. One thing to remember is that they always have coffee available free in a different room, so dont waste your money buying it at the restaurant. also, one of my favourite things is the hot tub. It is located on the roof outside and gives you a view of the mountains and lake.", "title": "Family travels", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "jenna t", "date": "December 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 147976145}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Quaint Mountain Lodge", "text": "This place is a gem!
