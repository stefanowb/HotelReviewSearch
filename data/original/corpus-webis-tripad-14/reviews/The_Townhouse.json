Free parking and a great location and we had the top floor room which was spacious and tastefully decorated with lots of nice touches. I notice a reviewer had said it would have been nice to have ice with their water we certainly had a note next to our jug saying that ice etc could be brought up no problem, if requested along with fresh milk for tea/coffee. Loved the little petite fours and the room was very spacious with a huge bed; lovely en-suite bathroom which was immaculate with lovely fluffy towels. Breakfast in the morning was amazing and a relaxing affair with a great choice with fresh food home cooked which was delicious - loved the little dishes the condiments were on.

It was easy to find, on the way in to Perth and with handy off-street parking in a private road around back. We came as a couple with our grown-up son, to spend a few days in Perth before moving on to other parts and were given two rooms at the top of the narrow 4-storey house (probably not ideal if you have mobility problems, but perfect for us). Lovely, clean, spacious rooms with everything you need, including a nice, big double bed and an efficient shower. And the breakfasts were something else - starting with a red fruit salad with mint (delicious) and then everything from cereals through to a full Scottish breakfast, done exactly - and deliciously - to your requirements.
