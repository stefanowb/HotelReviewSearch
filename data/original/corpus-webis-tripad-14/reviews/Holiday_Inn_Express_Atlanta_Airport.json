Room was very beat up and musty smelling. At about 3AM we heard a sound coming from the bathroom as if the faucet was on - we though it was only the shower leaking.

Immediately packed our stuff and went down to the desk to complain. The lady behind the desk was not helpful nor apologetic and only offered a $30 discount off of our bill.
