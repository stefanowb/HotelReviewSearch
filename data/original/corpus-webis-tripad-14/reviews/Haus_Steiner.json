To start with, Haus Steiner was pleasant, comfortable, interesting, and convenient. The pleasant atmosphere began each morning with Frau Steiner greeting us at morning coffee and breakfast. We talked about what we did the day before and what we planned to do the coming day. She added information about the area and provided ideas of what to see and how to see it.
