It was our 6th trip to Dominican Republica. This trip was by far the most outstanding resort of all the resorts we stayed at. We enjoyed the VIP section and VIP ammenuities. The pool area is small, extremely clean, quiet and the service at the bar was excellent. The VIP restaurant is simply oustanding. The food is excellent. If you consider that this is a VIP restaurant, we felt that there was one waitress in particular who did not understand English well enough. She was mainly serving breakfast and lunch. What I recommend is that you learn how to say in Spanish what you would like to order for breakfast. The supper meals were outstanding. The rooms were extremely beautiful and clean. There is a huge bath in the rooms, but it is not a jacuzzi (which would have been nice). My boyfriend and I enjoy a quiet and small resort, which is exactly what the Catalonia Royal Resort is all about. However, should you feel like participating in the daily activities, or feel like listening to loud music and so on, you can go to the regular Catalonia Resort Section, which is just beside yours. You can go for a long walk on the Catalonia Section, which is really beautiful. We didn't watch a lot of the entertainment, but it looked allright. The Specialty Restaurants are simply outstanding. We met acquaintances of ours who stayed at the Catalonia Resort Section and they were not too impressed with the Specialty Restaurants, but I strongly believe that depending on the colour of your bracelet, you get different quality of meals/meat (if you stay at the Royal, you have a specific bracelet). We would go back in a heart beat to this resort. The only downsize to this resort is the beach. If you are a beach lover and are spending every minute you have on the beach, you may want to think twice about this resort. I found there was a smell as you got closer to the water. The Royal Section has a private section on the beach, but the smell is still there. There are a lot of weeds in the water; coral at the bottom of the sea where you swim. Way too much weeds on the sand where the water hits the sand. It's too bad, because the rest of the resort is outstanding. As for my boyfriend and I, we spend most of our holiday by the pool, so it didn't really impact our holiday. The food is definitely a 5. The accommodations are a 4.5/5. The pool is 5. The service is a 5. I can't rate the entertainment. The beach is a 3.5/4 (sorry). The Royal Resort is for quiet adults who enjoy reading, swimming and so on.
