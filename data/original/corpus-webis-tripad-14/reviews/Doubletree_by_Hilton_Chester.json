Since the last time we visited they have given some of the rooms and corridors a lick of paint and fitted nice cladding around the outdoor spa pool. On the last couple of visits we have also used the restaurant and have been impressed with the quality of the food and the service. There seems to be a new bar/restaurant manager who is very efficient. The only slight downside when we last visited were quite a few children in the spa pool - IMO they should limit them to certain times, particularly as it is marketed as a place for relaxation. We also had a problem with the air conditioning in our room which meant it was quite hot (although I should add it didn't bother us enough to report it). Bit of a tip if you are room only and don't want to pay for a full breakfast - they serve lighter bites in the bar (bacon sandwich/scrambled eggs) and the price is reasonable.

It feels and looks luxurious and not dated like so many UK hotels. After a full day in Chester shopping we made our way to the hotel by car and before settling down for night I had a double brandy and my wife had a Malibu and lemonade in the comfortable bar where the waiters were very attentive. On awaking the following morning after breakfast we headed to the spa area which is brilliant (been there before on a spa day and enjoyed excellent massages) with several cubicles/rooms for Sauna, Steam, Perfumed, etc; The pool is a good length (though not the widest) so you can really get a good swim in. The area with the jaccuzi also incorporates a great and powerful bubble bed and leads to a small but enjoyable outdoor pool area with waterfall. There are several relaxers to lie on though they are not flat and have a concave at the region around the small of your back and therefore tend to be less comfortable because of that. There is also a lounge type seating area with glowing fire effect if all the beds are taken. Our room was a King sized bedroom with Samsung TV, radio, telephone and a modern ensuite amongst other features and was very comfortable indeed. My wife and I did not try the Marco Pierre White restaurant in the hotel as we had a good days shopping in the nearby lovely old walled city of Chester and ate out in the city throughout the day. We did have a continental breakfast in the hotel's brasserie which we enjoyed, I would have had the full english but did not particularly like the way it was set out - looked as if it had been put out earlier and the eggs and black pudding etc looked to have dried out too much for my liking. Instead I had fresh orange juice then my choice of cereal after which I made a wholemeal sandwich of ham and cheese followed by toast and marmalade with coffee. My wife had cereal, croisants then toast and jam with tea. The breakfast we chose came to approx \u00a38.50 each. The full English would have been around \u00a312.50. The restaurant seating was comfortable and after 4 hours or so in the Spa on our second day we had a light lunch of a Gormet sandwich for my wife and a hot beef baguette for myself plus 2 pots of tea, again, very enjoyable and in comfortable sofa seating within lovely surroundings. Overall we had a great weekend and the Hilton Doubletree Chester helped to make it that way for us so I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to chill out and de-stress. If you want to be nearer to Chester in order to simply walk into the centre then I would suggest 'The Mill' hotel and spa. The spa at the mill isn't as good as Doubletree's but it is only a few minutes walk into the centre of Chester and is a fairly good hotel. Often both of these hotels have offers on one or more of the offer sites such as Living Social/Groupon/etc; So look out for these ... usually they are for day spa and treatments rather than overnight stays though!", "user": "L33WAK", "date": "October 8, 2012", "id": 142310029}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 50, "average": 143, "very good": 323, "terrible": 32, "excellent": 543}, "aka": "Doubletree By Hilton Chester Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.25, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Set on the outskirts of historic Chester surrounded by twelve acres of landscaped gardens, this elegant hotel provides luxurious accommodation only a few minutes from the city centre.
