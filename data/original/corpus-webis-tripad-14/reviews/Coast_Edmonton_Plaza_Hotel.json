The bathroom was ok but could have been cleaner and we were puzzled why there was a bottle opener screwed on to the wall next to the toilet roll holder??

My room rate was $154 a night. Overall the hotel is good and probably appropriate for the price I paid. I got the overall impression that it was an old hotel with recent renovations, but that that they cheaped out a bit when doing them. For example, in the halls you can tell the walls are old and the doors look a little dated. That being said, the room, TV sheets etc were very nice and I was very happy with the room, witch I guess is the most important thing. I was a little disapointed with the pool and Hot Tub. On their website the photo makes it look look really nice, but in reality it is a little old and run down (but not bad).
