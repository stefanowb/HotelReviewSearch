I have a window but it appears I am on the interior of the hotel looking out into office space. The W is one of the many hotels that no longer put a coffee pot in the room, which is incredibly annoying if you are like me and require a cup to get the day started. They do offer coffee in the lobby, but I'm not usually presentable when I want the first morning jolt. My flight was delayed and I arrived after midnight. The appearance of the hotel is really not that of a normal hotel. No drive up, check in area. I drove around the block several times before calling and asking where the main entrance was, it's the appearance of an office building and the valet was nowhere to be seen. It was late, and when they appeared they were very cordial--albeit I was cranky from being late and wishing to get a workout in before bed. I made it to the gym and was sorely dissapointed by what they offer. It's better than most Hilton gyms but offers a few free weights and cardio--not as much as I had hoped for. I am a fit traveler and would gift the gym 2.5 out of five stars. The room does have a DVD player, so I'll use that for my evening workout w/a DVD I brought from my fitness collection. I also went in search of some hot water for tea an hour ago. I found a bar but they said they couldn't help me--I guess they don't have hot water to go ? I went to the front desk, but they were too busy. I called and asked if someone would bring me a pot of hot water, it seems like it should be easier. They said they'd send it up. That was over an hour ago----really tough to find hot water for a cup of tea in this hotel. I really hate it when they don't leave a coffee pot in the room--I probably wouldn't have been driven to type a review otherwise.", "title": "Not worth it", "user": "stacymac", "date": "January 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 94527154}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011", "text": "It's overpriced for what you actually get.
