Also, the A/C didn't work quite as well as we would have liked - it was hard to keep it on, it would just cut off.

(Best Westerns are pet-friendly.) I have found Best Westerns to be a consistent brand -- usually delivering adequate rooms for a mid-range price. This particular hotel pleasantly surprised me! Upgraded rooms to include new bedding and pillows, flat-screen TV, and in-house amenities like a tall dorm fridge, microwave, etc. It was very clean, with one small exception (we did have 2 flies in the room which were a bit annoying). There was a dog run area close to the room (and even marked on the hotel property map). The room was quiet, even though we had neighbors on both sides. And the complimentary breakfast buffet was particularly good -- your normal fare of waffles, eggs, biscuits, etc. But because the buffet area was staffed, the items were fresher and always replenished. When we stayed, there was a tour bus of people in their 60s and 70s going to Opryland or somewhere, and they looked perfectly comfortable. That should tell you something about the cleanliness and decor of the facility -- pretty standard. But, what else do you need?", "title": "Surprising bargain - clean, safe, quiet, and filling!", "user": "Gemutlichkeit", "date": "November 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 50334980}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "For those of you who mind, the owners are apparently Christian and there is a faith-oriented pre-printed note left for you in the room, on your bed.
