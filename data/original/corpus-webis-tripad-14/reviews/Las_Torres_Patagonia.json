I have read the other reviews and I think this hotel/experience is really better than some are giving it credit for. This hotel is in a very remote area. It is expensive to get food and supplies, so naturally the cost of the hotel is going to be expensive. Many equate that price to mean it should be a luxury experience, but really, in Patagonia, paying a lot of money gets you a solid experience because of the costs of the basics.

The guides are really fabulous and know a lot about the flora/fauna/geology of the area and are just generally fun and patient.

It is true that only 1 person can set up the wireless access on your computer, so sometimes you have to wait, but again, for me, that wasn't a big deal because I was there to hike and not use my computer for the most part.
