This is one of very few places that you are able to see the active side of the volcano (atleast active side during the dates we were there) During that night we would wake up hearing the grumbling of the volcano and see some lava flows. In the moring we road some horses with a guide on the property for only 7/hr per person. This was an awesome ride. You were able to see a lot of the property and it was very adventurous. They had us going up and down steep banks and through water and mud. Their is also a waterfall on the property we hiked to and a hanging bridge, both were very nice. Their is another path that takes you to old lava flows, but was closed for our safety. Their are numberous hummingbirds on property, monkeys right outside the door, either a sloth or something in the racoon family, tucan's. and other varieties of exotic birds.
