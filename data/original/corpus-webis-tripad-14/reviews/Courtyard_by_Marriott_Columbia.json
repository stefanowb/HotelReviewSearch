A quick 20 minute (if that) ride to the inner harbor was very convienient, as the hotel is right off of Rt 95. Only 30 minutes to Washington DC. The hotel was very clean, and we were impressed with the housekeeping service. One day, we didn't leave the room until after 2PM and wasn't expecting housekeeping to visit our room, but when we came back at 9PM, our beds were neatly made, and new toiletries were added to the room. There was 1 couple, one single, and one teen in our room, and the room was large enough to accommodate not only the 2 queen beds, but also a roll-away bed (for the teen) without overcrowding the room. There's a nice indoor pool and jacuzzi that is open until 11PM - which our teen was happy about. Our only complaint was that the AC was in the corner, next to the computer desk, so the airflow was not optimal, and the room got very warm around 3AM. Breakfast was included on Saturday and Sunday. It wasn't anything special, and we skipped it on Sunday so that we could eat on the road to DC. You will definately NOT be at a loss for dining options within a 5 mile radius of the hotel. Our favorite was the Greene Turtle on McGaw Rd. We are planning to stay here again next year when Sox are in town.", "title": "Nice hotel for the price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mellifera75", "date": "August 14, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8418919, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, Value and Service", "disliked": "\u2014 AC located in weird spot, indoor pool only"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I am always worried about these chain hotels, and reading the reviews didn't really help.

Cons: We were supposed to have a refridgerator and didn't, so that was annoying.
