We had a junior suite which was spacious and comfortable with a separate sitting area down a step containing a day bed, chairs and a dining table leading to a balcony looking directly over Kata Noi Beach. We were particularly amused by the \u201cmattress menu\u201d which allowed you to change mattresses and pillows if you were not comfortable with the ones provided. The air-conditioning was very over-enthusiastic: no matter how much we altered the settings, the room was always just this side of refrigerated: great when you have just come in from the beach, but rather chilly in the morning.

That said, the food on offer was very good indeed. Of the hotel\u2019s several other restaurants we ate in only two: good fresh fish in one and Thai curries in the other \u2013 nothing exceptional but greatly over-priced. In fact we found much in the hotel to be overpriced \u2013 perhaps because of its relative isolation, they felt that they could jack the prices up. A beer from the beach bar is charged at 125baht (we never paid more than 70 baht in any other hotel) which is way over the top, when you can walk down onto the public beach and buy the same thing for 60 baht or cross the road to the local mini market and get one for 30 baht. Snack lunches were similarly over-priced, so we soon took to having a larger breakfast that we would usually have done and missing lunch. The hotel laundry prices were a rip-off: the afore-mentioned minimarket did an entire week\u2019s worth of washing and ironing in 24 hours for the same price that the hotel would have charged for two polo shirts.

There are a couple of decent local restaurants in Kata Beach (if you can avoid the insistent and annoying Indian tailors \u2013 why do they assume that every tourist is only there to buy a cheap, badly made suit?). One night we ventured further out to beyond the enormous Club Med and had a good meal at the Kata Garden.

We asked to be on the top floor and if we could have a sea-view room when we first checked in. We got to be on the top floor, but were told that the sea-view rooms in the Thani wing are for smokers. We were a little disappointed, but we discovered that our wing was much better anyway because of the VERY noisy birds that were in the trees on the other side of the Thani wing! Our room was ALWAYS clean and smelled pretty good (no dampness to report). It was a good sized room for two people, it wasn't huge but it wasn't claustrophobic either. The bathroom was a little tricky to negotiate for two people who were just friends =) But after a few days we got used to it and didn't mind (one could always go out to the balcony and enjoy the scenery while the other was in the bathroom). By the way, the minibar's prices are pretty reasonable (one bottled water was 40 baht), and you get two bottles of waters free everyday. However, these are in glass bottles and not convenient if you want to take them with you when you go out.

The room was of a very good standard; and reasonably large, with sea views. This resort is essentially two separate resorts within one. The Thani section is comprised of the Grand and Junior Suites. It has a fantastic location with lawns sweeping down to the ocean. This is by far the more upscale section of the resort. The Bhuri section is separated from the ocean by a road. Each of the resorts has its own swimming pool/s - the swimming pool closest to the Grand Suites is the nicest of all, but open to all hotel guests regardless of their room choice. The outstanding feature of the hotel is the beachfront location - a far more relaxing alternative to busy Patong. Although it was low season, the pools were seemingly quite busy, with some heated moments over the reserving of pool chairs. There are several restaurants in the hotel but they are all very expensive by Phuket standards. However there are many cheaper local alternatives in Kata, that serve delicious food at very reasonable prices. Kata also has a reasonable range of tailors and market shopping including sarongs, pirated DVDs, copy bags etc etc. Although the trip to Kata is only 2 mins away by taxi or tuk-tuk, the hotel as well as the local taxi company runs a local rort on tourists with set prices to all destinations around Phuket that far exceed the usual prices you would pay on other parts of the island. The moment you step out the front door of the hotel, the race is on to secure you transport. Overall the service met our expectations. Staff were always pleasant and obliging. They did however become more animated when trying to sell you transport, a tour through a friend or a massage....all part of the fun.
