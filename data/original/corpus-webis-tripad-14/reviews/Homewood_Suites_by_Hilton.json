While the business is located adjacent to I-35, and you can see the highway flyover from the window, traffic is inaudible in the room. Unfortunately, my upstairs neighbor's every move is audible. The only other disappointment is that there is not a \"full kitchen.\" There is no oven. If you were staying without a car, you might also be disappointed that you cannot walk to drugstores or grocery stores. Nonetheless, you can walk to Chuy's and the Hillcrest Hospital. There is a walking trail that encircles two ponds with fountains. Let me list the other pluses: friendly staff, immediate attention to guest requests, spotless room, neutral and appealing decor, comfortable bed, attractive bath, interior corridors, free parking, free wi-fi. In terms of suite size, this room is smaller than a Best Western Premier suite I had in Lancaster, PA, and an extended stay suite I once had in Phoenix, AZ. I haven't viewed the laundry facility but should note there is not a washer and dryer in the room. My trip to Baylor University is only ten minutes by car, and this location is also ten minutes from the Waco mall. I am always looking for a place to stay that has a bedroom that can achieve total darkness. Sadly, I didn't find that feature--light comes into the room from the top of the window treatments.
