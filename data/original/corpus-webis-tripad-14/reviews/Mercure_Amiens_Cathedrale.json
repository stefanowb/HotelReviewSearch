Our Privilege Room with 1 king-size bed room was ideal with a view of the Cathdral. Located close to the restaurants. The only downside was the lack on-site car parking. We needed to use a closeby car public car park. Make sure you take Euro cash or coin to pay for the parking. With my limited French I could not read the instructions to use credit card or cash card. The drop off and pick up car parking in front of the hotel is limited. Word of warning: Even though the car had a GPS we fortunately used our faithful Tom Tom (with downloaded Europe map) to guide us around. Highly recommended for non or limited French speaking Australians! Also the challenge of French toll (\"P\u00e9age\"). They vary in cost and some are manned and others are cash or credit card. But expect delays and look for the correct symbols for cash or card. We mis read one and it was for a pre paid tags only - had to back out of lane.

Amiens is a beautiful and interesting town, with a magnificent cathedral and pretty canals. The hotel is ideally located in the centre of town, right by the cathedral, restaurants, shops and canals, but quiet for a good night's rest. Our room was large and very comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly. We strolled a couple of hundred yards to an excellent restaurant for dinner, where we sat outside with a lovely view of the cathedral. We called at the Tourist Information Office next to the cathedral, who were very helpful in giving us a free English guide to the Somme battlefields - well worth having if you are interested in visiting these.
