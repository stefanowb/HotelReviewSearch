The package included 2 tickets to Second City which is an improve stage comedy club which was also awesome. The Hyatt was easy to find with lots of underground parking. The hotel is modern and clean with 2 bars and private elevators. After 10pm they have security outside the elevators to make sure only hotel guests are allowed inside. We felt very safe! The shower in the washroom was beautiful with glass doors and limestone tiles, while the king size bed boasted at least 6 pillows and the flat screen tv was really a focal point of the room. Add the awesome view of the CN Tower outside my window and this hotel completely outdid my expectations! I'd recommend it to anyone and I'm sure I'll be back. Oh ps the neighbourhood is safe and fun with over 150 restaurants within walking distance!

Check my profile I'm a tripadvisor senior advisor .....I can tell you that this is a fantastic hotel...boutique rooms....spotless and staff that goes beyond the expected. Very nice so far with one exception The Internet connection sucks ....worse than dial up and i need a quick or at least a normal connection in order to stay here again The Internet 3rd party connection is so spotty I may have to change hotels and lose out as Im here on a 3 day prepaid priceline deal", "title": "Fantastic.

Ours in particular would've been perfect except for the lighting poles and utility balcony that was obstructing the view (although I cannot blame the Hyatt for this because certainly not every room can have an unobstructed view). The decor is a modern/contemporary style and the hotel carries a subtle elegancy. The room I stayed in could use a detailed cleaning though (cobwebs, large number of marks on the walls, bathtub had some sort of film in it). The staff is courteous and friendly, and was very helpful in giving us ideas for how to get around the city as this was our first time visiting Toronto. As many others have mentioned, the parking is a stiff at $29 per night. I tried to ask the parking attendant in the basement deck about just paying them directly and they told me \"If you are checking in at the hotel, you must register with them\". I did, however in retrospect I suppose I never had to even mention the hotel to the parking attendant and should've just kept my mouth shut so I could just pay the $15/day. If you are a AAA member I recommend getting the breakfast package because the breakfast offered in the restaurant, although very good and beautiful plate presentation, is grossly overpriced.
