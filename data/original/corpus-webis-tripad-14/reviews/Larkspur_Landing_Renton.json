Check-in was a breeze, and my husband and I were given the option to upgrade our room for free. The hostess was friendly and pleasant. Our room was perfect -- a small, stocked kitchenette with a refrigerator, microwave, stove, and dishwasher. The bed was comfy, with down pillows and comforters. They even give you the option to pick your own pillow type: wedge, neck forms, body pillows... all were available at the front desk. The room also had a DVD player (you could pick a free movie from the front desk) and CD player. The bathroom was nothing special in and of itself, but the sample Bath & Body Works toiletries were wonderful. All these great things for around $100/night? What a dream.

The bathroom was the worse with long black hairs on the floor. The other floors obviously had not been vacumed, and there were crumbs on the desk and chair. The next day I left a note asking that the floor be cleaned. We returned to find that nothing had been done. The desk and chair were still dirty and the coffee pot was still in the sink, along with the used coffee cups. However, the worse surprise was when I pulled back the sheet to get into bed and found long black hairs there, too.

I made a reservation at the Larkspur for two reason: 1. The Hilton Garden Inn gave away my room during my previous stay, and 2. I'd stayed before and liked it. To my surprise, when I went to check in at 9PM, they told me they didn't have a room for me. I'd made my reservation two months prior. I was angry and tried not to take it out on the front desk clerks, but this was the second time in as many trips to Renton that this happened. Why do they do this? I will NEVER again stay at Larkspur or the Hilton Garden Inn in Renton. The last thing anyone wants to have to do after traveling all day, especially if you are not familiar with the city, is to have to get back in the car after dark to go look for a hotel room.
