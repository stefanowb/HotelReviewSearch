In particular, Ajith in the restaurant. I am a vegetarian and he was so helpful each night informing me of suitable dishes and even offered to prepare me something else if I wanted.

The room was a good size and clean with tea making faclities. The manager arranged for us to have adjoining rooms which was a bonus with 2 small children. Although in the centre of Protoras you wouldn't know it. The hotel is directly on the beach and restaurants etc a few minutes up a road which has a slope. Although not steep and only short it could cause problems if you had a wheelchair etc but still is accessible and shouldn't deter anyone with a wheelchair. The pool is lovely and not having to \"find\" a sunchair each day is an added bonus as you are allocated one on arrival. Perhaps a benefit would be 1 or 2 playpens in the pool area for those with small children. There are plenty of highchairs available for breakfast which has a lovely selection of food. We can honestly say we really couldn't find anything negative about the hotel - this was our second visit and we certainly hope to return in the future.", "title": "Fantastic Sunrise Beach", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "swales00", "date": "September 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117871267}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We chose to stay at the Sunrise Beach Hotel for our Honeymoon in June 2001 as we saw the wonderful reviews on this website and we were not disappointed!! When we arrived at the hotel at about 4am local time we were told that as we had arrived to the hotel so late, we could have full-board the next day. We had booked half-board for our Honeymoon so this was such a surprise and very much appreciated! The room was wonderful and we had a complimentary bottle of champagne, bottle of water and fruit waiting for us in our room when we arrived -what a wonderful way to start our honeymoon! The Manager at the hotel had also written a personal letter congratulating us on our wedding which was a lovely touch. As we were going for such a special occasion we booked a sea-view room. The view was amazing! The rooms were great and as we upgraded we had a King-size bed, plasma TV, minibar, tea & coffee making facilities and air-conditioning which is included in the price of the holiday. We also had a safety deposit box which is only 2 euros per day \u2013 such great value! We also had dressing gowns, slippers & complimentary tea & coffee throughout our stay and the minibar was replenished (if used) every day. Maid service was also excellent. They always did a great job. The bathroom in the room was to a very good standard and if required you could have clean towels changed every day. Another great thing about this hotel is that they give you allocated sunbeds which are then yours for your whole holiday! This should be compulsory in all hotels as it gives you the freedom to go to your beds whatever time you like without having to worry that you won\u2019t get a bed. We chose to have sunbeds on the small private beach, but we could have chosen to be by the pool or on the grass - there is so much selection! You also get clean beach towels everyday so no need to pack any which is great!! The service at this hotel was 5 star!!! The staff just couldn't do enough for you and were always so friendly and polite. The food at breakfast was lovely and there was so much choice at the buffet, whatever time you went down! You could choose to have continental, toast, fruit, cereal or cooked breakfast. The food at the evening buffet was also lovely \u2013 really fresh and a great choice! The salad bar was always fresh and desserts were delicious! I\u2019d recommend going to their \u2018Greek Night\u2019 if you stay at this hotel. It was such fun and get every involved! The waiters and manager at the restaurant were always so polite and couldn\u2019t do enough for you. We were also given another complimentary bottle of champagne on our last night to celebrate our Honeymoon \u2013 so generous and kind of them. The hotel is right in the middle of Protaras with shops, bars and other restaurants right on your doorstep. The 'strip' can be quite lively at night, with bars playing live music but that did not bother us. As the hotel is right on the beach, when you walk back into the hotel you can't hear a thing - well we didnt anyway! All in all we had such a wonderful Honeymoon at the Sunrise and will definitely be coming back to this hotel again. We recommend it to anyone who is thinking of going to Protaras.
