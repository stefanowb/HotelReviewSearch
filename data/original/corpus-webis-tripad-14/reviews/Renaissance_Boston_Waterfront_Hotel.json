I was a little worried after some of the reviews here but was pleasantly surprised from start to finish. Quite nice inside, great bar area, large rooms and great location--the T stop is only about 100 ft. away (and it's the first stop from Logan airport, something I did not realize when I caught a $20 cab). I found it a great place to stay with one minor caveat. The runway at the airport is just across the water, and if the wind is right, planes take off almost directly overhead starting about 6:30 a.m. If you're there for work and have to get up anyway, no issue. If not, maybe this is not the hotel for you. Out of our 3 morning there, we heard planes overhead 2 mornings. But other than that, I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.", "title": "Very Nice.
