The room we stayed in was OK but not 'overly roomy' but it did the job for one night....a bit more of a traditional French hotel. However the Restaurant by far makes up for the room. As it was a Sunday evening we were not 100% sure what restaurants would be open in the town, so we decided to eat at the hotel...what a great choice that was. The food throughout the meal was outstanding very tasty and the presentation was first class. The 'walled' town of Montreuil-sur-Mer is a lovely place to visit, full of character and a variety of restaurants and bars to choose from. In the past we have stayed at Hermitage Hotel (part of Best Western), but I think that the character and the food of Le Patio gives it that 'french feel'", "title": "Lovely food, customer service poor", "user": "Welshcwmtravel", "date": "August 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 116716270}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stopped here by chance for a place to eat which did not have meat as it's main course.

It was followed by cod fillet with roasted vegetables served in a chefy piled up style. We asked for them to leave out the chorizo which they were happy to do. The meal was completed with a lovely strawberry tart served on a neat slate platter. We had a small carafe of red wine and the bill came to \u20ac37. A real bargain.

Breakfast was the usual bread, croissants etc but in a very pleasant room and with good coffee. Were sorry we couldn't try the restaurant as the surroundings look very good.
