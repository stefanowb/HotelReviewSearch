When we arrived it was a construction site. I think we were the only people on our floor and the entire floor was covered with cardboard boxes which make wheeling our suitcases very difficult. No one offered to help and we were left to find our own room. Somebody started using a vacuum cleaner outside our room at 9.30pm making it impossible to sleep, I rang reception and they stopped him only to have him start up again a few minutes later. The kitchen in our room didn't have any water connected to it so was useless. Breakfast was very average and they had run out of most things by the time we went down at 9.30. Catching a taxi was very difficult as they couldn't stop outside the hotel and we had to wait quite a while for one that would stop.

The hotel was under re-construction, there were workers everywhere who were painting all the walls around and making noise.. The employees there were everything but kind and helpful. No one knew if we were staying at the hotel, neither our room number etc. As per the rooms.. OMG! Awfull, just awfull! Broken walls, a blue dirty carpet (with chips on it), towels that were smelling like dead people and very very noisy plumping! All furniture were very old (probably since early 60's-70's) and a fantastic view to the workers outside..! No one ever informed us that the hotel would be under re-construction and when we sent an email before our arrival - just to confirm our room and reservation - they simply never answered us!

The hotel is very conveniently located less than five minutes walk from the Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps. We were able to walk to all the great sights of Rome, the Colosseum, the Vatican, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Jewish Ghetto, Trastevere, etc. We were welcomed by very helpful English speaking staff. Our rooms were very spacious - we travelled with our 20 year old son and both our rooms had a sitting area (with sofa bed) a dining table and chairs, a two ring hob and small sink, a large refrigerator, crockery, cutlery and pans so that we could \"eat in\" if we chose. The very large beds were firm but comfortable, the rooms were airconditioned and very peaceful - no traffic or any other noise! The hotel was in the process of some refurbishment whilst we were there and the rooms we had were certainly a little faded so maybe they are due for redecoration? The TV only had one English channel - BBC world news. There is an internet room for guests use in the lobby of the hotel. 5 euros for an hour or 10 euros for 24 hours. The breakfast buffet was generally good - fruit juices, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, scrambled egg, cereals, pastries, bread rolls, cakes and hot drinks. Our only criticisms of the hotel would have to be that neither of our rooms had any view whatsoever - they looked out onto a rendered wall. If we were staying there again we would ask for a room with a view of the internal courtyard which was well tended and a nice place to sit, having chairs and tables with parasols. The other disappointment was that the roof terrace was rather neglected - much of the planting was dead or dying through lack of water and it seemed to us that it was a really useful space which could have been made much better use of by the hotel - a plunge pool would have been good and perhaps a bar or cafe - but there may not be sufficient demand? We also thought that the hotel bar/restaurant should have opened longer - it seemed to close by about 7.30 p.m. - we would certainly have gone into the bar for a \"nightcap\" had it been open when we got back into the hotel after dinner at one of the many local restaurants. The transfer time from the FCO airport was about 25 mins. by city taxi (white cars) which operate at a standard rate of 40 euros each way - don't get persuaded into another type of taxi at the airport (there are lots of touts) as it will cost you a lot more!!", "title": "Lacks style and charm but sleeps well", "user": "RAG976", "date": "August 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 76867640}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lazio", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Rome"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 18, "average": 41, "very good": 96, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 126}, "aka": "Residenza Di Ripetta Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.214680347277, "description": "Right around the corner from Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps is one of Rome\u2019s most charming secret hideaways: Residenza di Ripetta.
