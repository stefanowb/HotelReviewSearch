Yes, it is not the typical \"inn\" - but my husband and I found it nice to have so much privacy. The room was large with an amazingly beautiful view of Tomales Bay. If you enjoy peace and beauty - this is what you get here. The room was clean, the bed comfortable and the small fireplace added a nice touch. Having breakfast in the room was great - and the food was very good as well. Enjoyed the extra touches too- backpack (thanks! that helped for all the hiking!), games and books in the room.", "title": "Perfect View - Pleasant Stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "daisymay1", "date": "August 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 38387712}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This place is not bad. The good. It is spotless and the bedding is comfortable, breakfast service in your room.The view is nice. The inconvenient. It is far from Point Reyes, so we drove around a lot. .

Nicely furnished room and breakfasts great - nothing too much trouble for the innkeepers, Bob and Lynnette. A great location for exploring Point Reyes and beyond. Loads of great walks and not too far from San Francisco either - the best of both worlds. Anyone who does not rate this place must be mad. Rooms are very clean and nicely furnished and guest towels white and fluffy putting most hotels to shame.

The living area, which has been used recently by smokers, is locked when the innkeepers are away. Quite minimalist in all respects - room, amenities, linens, breakfast.
