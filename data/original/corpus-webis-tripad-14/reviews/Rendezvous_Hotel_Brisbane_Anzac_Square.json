The only downside of the hotel is the lack of paytv, but this shouldn't be an issue in Brisbane as you should be wondering what you are doing inside (Beautiful One Day, Perfect the Next).", "title": "Grand old building", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "shonky", "date": "May 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5038835}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006, traveled on business", "text": "Classic old building in the city center that has been converted in a hotel, easy access to everything, train opposite, city cat within 10-15 min. walk, Queen Street Mall 2 blocks away.", "title": "A Good Choice", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "allanmc", "date": "March 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4589350}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great way to finish a trip", "text": "Very professional check in staff, pleasant and friendly.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "TravelingwithTandM", "date": "February 1, 2006", "id": 4406877}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "I had a standard room with contained a microwave and an actual kitchen sink, (amazing how handy a kitchen sink becomes in a hotel room) much better than filling the kettle and washing the coffee cups in the bathroom sink.", "title": "Nice motel, good location", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "kruzlady", "date": "December 24, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4299199}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "No Comment", "text": "Rooms have high ceilings that gives a feeling of space and are nice and clean and plenty of natural light.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "DSCF", "date": "December 7, 2005", "id": 4217182}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2004", "text": "We stayed at the Rendezvous Hotel Brisbane in 2002 and will stay there again this year.

We have found it very affortable as the hotel offers specials through their own website. The location was excellent, very close to the CBD and a train station. Even with it's central location the rooms were very quiet (my husband is very sensitive to noise). The one bedroom apartment came with a kitchen, and a washer/dryer (new).
