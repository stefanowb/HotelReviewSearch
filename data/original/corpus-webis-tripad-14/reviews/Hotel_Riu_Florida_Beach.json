I got the room at a Hotwire discount rate of around $105 plus tax per night. Much lower than any other comparable hotels I could find in Miami Beach. We found the hotel to be very charming, especially the lobby. It had a very classic 1930s feel to it. The staff at the front desk always seemed swamped but treated everyone fairly and friendly. Definitely worth giving specific credit to their service. The rooms were very standard. One oddity, we were given a room with two double beds. I phoned down to reception and was told that the entire hotel only has 3-4 rooms with king size beds. Finding this odd, I went downstairs personally and asked a different staff member, but was met with the same answer. Not a huge impediment to our weekend, but odd nonetheless. I also noticed that half of our floor was blocked off for renovations, so it would appear that the property is taking efforts to update. The view from our room at one angle was a lovely view of the ocean, but at the other angle was the shell of the building next door that is under construction.
