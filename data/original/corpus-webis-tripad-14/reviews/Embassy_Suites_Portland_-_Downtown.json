The pool and pool area were awesome. The located and price were also very good. Overall, this hotel is on par with any other property, including the high end name brands such as Marriot, Hilton, or the Ritz. The $199 price, which included a fabulous made to order breakfast or buffet, a manager reception every night with beer, wine, liquor, and snacks, and there was also free in/out parking cannot be beat (special package). The only area for improvment is related to the hotel's Internet, which was very slow, and with the hot tubs because some of jets needed fixing (which just broke on the second day out 5 party group was there). Would strongly recommend this property to anyone becasue of the room size and ammentities, location, service, and cleaniness.", "title": "Perfect", "user": "bonniebee1", "date": "October 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119187880}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Portland"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 18, "average": 53, "very good": 264, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 474}, "aka": "Embassy Suites Portland - Downtown Hotel Portland", "slim_ranking": 0.0538461538462, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Located in the heart of downtown Portland, the Historic Embassy Suites Portland -Downtown features large two-room guest suites and a well-known foyer adorned in grandeur and architectural beauty.
