Bathroom is totally separate from the sleeping area. I am curious who designed it? Perhaps the separating wall was a structural one. Also one of very few hotels that still have a fridge that guest cannot use. This is problematic if you have an extended stay here and want to keep some personal stuff in the fridge (special drinks or such).
