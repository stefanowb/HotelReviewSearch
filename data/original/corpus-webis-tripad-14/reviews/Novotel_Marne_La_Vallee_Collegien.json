This novotel is very much in this theme, mostly families visiting disneyland over the holidays, the usual efficient service, though perhaps not as warm and on the ball as at others we have used. It works very well as a Disney stay, once you have oriented yourself with the roads, the drive is only fifteen mins and very easy, and parking at Disney village easy and pretty good value at ten euros for the day (park at the Vinci Disney Village not the main Park parking which is more expensive and seems to be further away). I'd bet it may in fact be quicker and less stressful than squeezing onto shuttle buses from the main Disney hotels or Val d'Europe ones. But it's not pretty itself, and the area is pure business park, so you must have a car. Dinner is nice but expensive, might be worth trying the pizza place or buffalo grill just next door, if not eating at disneyland.", "title": "Good value Disney stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "twoplusonetravel", "date": "January 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 149009547}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed here 4 years ago and it seems to have gotten worse in that time, the furniture dated, filthy room and bathroom, paint all over the light switches.

The hotel off junction 11 of the E4 motorway east of Paris is straightforward to find and has plenty of available parking. The staff at reception are very friendly and speak good english. The family room we had was fine, although it was rather hot (outside temperature was 35 degrees). The room was clean and was just what you expect from somewhere to sleep. It was quiet and we were not disturbed by any other residents. The buffet breakfast was excellent - lots of choice, not busy and was always well stocked. All you could ask for. A great job by the staff. Disneyland is about 15 mins drive away. If leaving the hotel, turn left at the first traffic lights and follow the road round. Turn right at the next roundabout then follow the A4 and then left at the next roundabout. This will bring you on at the next junction of the A4 going eastbound.
