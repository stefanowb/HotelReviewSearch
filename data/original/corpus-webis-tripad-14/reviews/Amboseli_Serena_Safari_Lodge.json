They have a couple of PCs in reception that you can use, worth taking a couple of blank DVDs, CDs and you can back up your pictures just top free up room on the camera. They also had an evening BBQ meal which cost extra but was well worth it, inlcuded wine and Masai dance. As for the park itself, saw Lions, Lots of Elephants, Zebra, Gazelles, Hippos and lots more.
