But the hotel itself was of typical high Fairmont quality, directly across the street from the cruise terminal. The room was spacious, as was the bathroom (with those very north american \"extra wide\" shower curtain rods) over the tub. The bed was very comfortable. Even though my room faced the downtown area, it was quiet, and I slept soundly. Food at the meeting facility was excellent, and multiple temptations left out throughout the day had me constantly snacking.

We booked the hotel using the American Express FHR program. The hotel was quite easy to find and an easy walk from the water front rail terminal. The front desk staff were friendly and we had very little wait before we were checked in and on our way to our room. We stayed in the king waterfront room category and it was fine (clean and well maintained), but for $400 a night I was expecting more. We booked this category due to the fact that with the FHR the hotel is supposed to upgrade to the next category up if available. The view was nice of the sea planes landing and of the water. We order room service and the burger I ordered was very good my wife's chicken sandwich was dry and flavorless, but with the FHR come an $100 food credit so we ate and went on about or day. When we returned for the night the room was quite hot. We turned the air down to 60F and got ready for bed. We both awoke around 1:00 am with the room still burning up, now faced with the dilemma I calling the front desk, complaining and switching rooms at 1:00 in the morning or sucking it up and going back to bed which is what we did. All in all the stay was fine (aside from the broken air conditioning) for a $100-$150 a night hotel, but as I said this room was $400 a night!! We stayed at an all inclusive Sandels resort for $300 for our honeymoon to put this in perspective. Also the room upgrade, as I said, did not happen and around 11:00 pm we went online to the Fairmont's website and the next room catagory was still very available. Given that we booked this hotel as a \"Fine Hotel and Resort\" all of these factors and the cost for such made the stay very disappointing compared to other hotels through the FHR program. If you're coming to Vancouver stay in the Shangra-La. The rooms are 10 times more posh than the Fairmont, they honored the room upgrade, the air conditioning works, and the room was $100 cheaper!", "user": "lewis01utk", "date": "September 8, 2011", "id": 117848977}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "It doesn't get any nicer than the Vancouver Waterfront!", "text": "We have never stayed in a hotel that made us feel so much at home everyday of our vacation.

What else would we have done for several hours carring luggage around if this wouldn't have been one of their services. The Staff, service in the Fairmont Waterfront was amazing, from dinner suggestions, reservations to excursions and different modes of transportation to and from different sites.
