This hotel is older and the room I stayed in was basic and not renovated but it was very clean, lots of room, basic flat screen tv and a comfy king size bed. Seriously for the price what more can you ask for? The casino is old but just an ordinary casino with slots and tables. The restaurants are good, theres a McDonalds on the R floor and a Starbucks on the main floor. The view from the tower is amazing whether day or night and you get to go up as many times as you want when you stay there. Not to mention the rides on top of the tower are out of this world.
