It is very clean. The service is excellent. The free breakfast in the morning is really good and during the week there is also a light dinner served free of charge. You really can't beat that! The rooms are large and have nice sized kitchenettes. The location is great. Right in the same area as Target, Best Buy, the Frisco Convention Center, and a large mall. Close to two major highways as well.
