The suite was on the 17:th floor and had two bedrooms, workroom, livingroom, two bathrooms (one with shower, one with jacuzzi) and kitchen (though NO kitchen utensils, not even a spoon). The suite was a bit worn but nothing disturbing. The floor and furniture was dark wood. What I missed was paintings or something else on the wall, the suite felt unfinished. There were some english channels on the tv, but the view over the river was much better.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Gnopps", "date": "April 13, 2006", "id": 4971136}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great value for groups or leisure travellers", "text": "Reception desk seemed to be manned with one who could speak english at all times.
