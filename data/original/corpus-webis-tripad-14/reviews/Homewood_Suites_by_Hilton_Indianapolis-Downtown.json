It was two and check-in is listed at four, but most hotels will let you check in a little early. And being in downtown Indy we were really wanting to just park our car and do a little shopping. He said our room was not available and was not very helpful in explaining parking, etc. Fortunately a great lady from the back came running forward and told him he could switch us with another room and we could check in right away. He might have been new. But he did not seem happy at all with our being there at two. The room was gorgeous. The beds are amazing. The suite is huge with a full kitchen, a living area with a flat screen tv.

The valet was super helpful and even drove me to a meeting a few blocks away so I wouldn't have to carry a large box in a dress and heels. They all remembered my name! I've stayed at the Conrad at least a dozen times and they NEVER remember me. I have to use the valet quite a bit because I have meetings downtown and north so I'm always getting my car. Usually I have to wait 10-15 minutes at the Conrad. I never waited more than 5 at the Homewood Suites. I loved my room. It was large enough for me to practice yoga and had a great area for my laptop and work stuff. The bed was very comfortable. I enjoyed that I could also stretch out on the couch and read. The free breakfast was perfect for me. They could offer more fruit but I got enough to get my day going. Going forward I will always stay at the Homewood Suites.

Pros are 1) location - just blocks from the Circle with all the shopping, restaurants and clubs (consider Slippery Noodle for blues). 2) large rooms - not true two room suites with door between but quite large with two TVs. 3) relatively new and nice. 4) kitchenette if you need that. Cons 1) management inept - we were out of our room from 10A to 4P, returned for a nap before dinner only to find still no maid service. Apparently housekeeping starts on the first floor and works their way up (we were on 5). Hotel not near full (? 1/3 at most) so seems they could have gotten to stay overs sooner - maybe this is the most efficient/economical way to do it but unacceptable in our eyes, you may not agree, but major issue for us. 2) elevator very slow and no front stairwell. 3) Wood area in kitchenette sticky both days - ? mop. 4) Returned to room after maid left and dishwasher running - one water glass we had used in it total - so much for economical. 5) breakfast is included in room charge but other than ubiquitous self made waffles the hot portion was pretty rough sledding - plan on continental. 5) may want to rename it the Homeless Suites. Sadly on way to Circle there were 4-5 beggars all the time. Hadn't noted this in Indy before - ? maybe the time of year. Room noise others have noted not a problem on 5th floor but with the poor maid service and really slow elevator (can't imagine if it had been close to full) would avoid top floor.
