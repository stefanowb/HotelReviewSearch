Blonde lady at reception not very welcoming. Did not get up off her chair, sat looking at us without any expression whilst I explained we were early and could we check in and leave our luggage and come back later for the key etc. She said yes to everything but was very inanimate. The other receptionist who we saw for the rest of our stay was much friendlier and helpful. Our twin room was clean and a nice size. The bathroom was a good size but had a hand held shower which kept falling off its stand mid shower. Lighting in the room is dim..there are many lights but all of them seem to have 30w bulbs - sure that is not the case but I dramatised to get the point across! Free wifi and free parking was much appreciated; you don't feel you are being nickled and dimed as they say. Was also nice to be able to have the pub attached for meals and drinks without having to go anywhere. We chose this hotel because it was only a 20 minute tube ride into London which is the distance lots of London hotels are to the centre, yet at a much, much higher price. Also because of the free parking; was a big plus being able to leave the car while we did our sightseeing and not be paying an arm and a leg for that too. It is about a 5 minute walk to Hanger Lane tube station and the area is well lit...I would be worried though walking to the hotel from the station late at night because you have to go down a tunnel or underground access way to get below the road and across the street...it was well lit but could be scary on your own; on the other hand if you are not a female on your own, probably nothing to think about. We had dinner one night at the pub; was very nice and reasonably priced. Oh...and they had a vending machine in the lobby which had a large variety of snacks and chocolates and bottles of Wine...very impressive - have never seen wine in a vending machine and as you can tell, I am a fan!", "title": "Good value for money", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "natmicstef", "date": "May 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 161272247}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Stayed here for 2 nights to go watch Bradford City at Wembley. Fantastic location as only about 1 mile from the ground by bus number 83 which stops outside the hotel. We had a superior room on the 2nd floor which was really lovely. Fantastic super king bed, lovely wet room style rain shower, flat screen tv, fridge, a safe. The 'pub' side of the hotel is great, lovely food, real ales, very reasonable prices too. The breakfast was good, nice produce, well cooked. The staff are very nice, friendly & helpful. The tube into London is at the top of the road, it took about 15 mins to get into London. Ask for a room not overlooking the car park as the double glazing is not very good. Had a brilliant nights sleep though as its quiet at night despite the busy main road.
