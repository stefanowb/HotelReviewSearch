We arrived by a shared taxi from Marco Polo airport to the Hilton Molino Stucky. The Residenza is next door (a residential part of the refurbished complex) and half-price. What can be better than waking up in a corner apartment overlooking the Giudecca canal to the waking traffic on the canal as well as greeting and bidding adieu to grand cruise ships and others sailing past. The apartment was cleaned daily and a fine continental breakfast (parma ham, bread, cream cheese, milk, cream, cereal, coffee and tea ) was available daily which we enjoyed at leisure. We shopped for fruit and tomatoes at a grocery along the Fondamente San Biagio after visiting the Il Redemptoe church. Giudecca island is a quiet retreat from the madness of Venice in tourist season and allows for a sense of Venetian life. A free shuttle from the Hilton next door to Zattere and San Marco is available at regular intervals. The Alilaguna line stops at the Hilton on the way to the cruise terminal so we were able to take advantage of that easily for 7 Euros each at the end of our stay. The staff were very kind and helpful and charged our iPhone and camera as we had forgotten our European adaptor.

It is only a short boat shuttle trip from Residenza across to San Marco and all the tourist attractions, and at the end of a day battling crowds, wonderful to come to a relatively quiet area of Venice. Our apartment was on the top floor, so spacious, cool and beautifully furnished. A really smart well equiped kitchenette with everything you could ask for a delicious breakfast, allowed us to relax in the mornings watching the water traffic pass by. For dinner we sometimes opted to stay on the main island, but more often on Guidecca Island, because there are several lovely little restaurants in walking distance.

The location is on the island of Giudecca across the canal from the main parts of Venice. The views are probably the best in town and by being right next to the Hilton Molino Stuckey you have access to their free shuttle. This shuttle runs about every 20 mins and takes you to Zattere and San Marco Sqaure. The apartment was great with kitchen, breakfast items, air conditioning, etc. There are around 5-6 restaurants on the island itself that sit on the water and look at Venice. There are also a few small markets for fresh fruit and vegetables, but I would recommend going across the canal for any major grocery purchases. Venice is a very busy tourist area so it was simply great to come back home and relax with a bottle of wine and enjoy the great scenery. I would also highly recommend the sky lounge at the top of the Hilton as a great place for lunch or drinks at night with simply breathtaking views. Highly recommend this place. The vaporettos that are the water buses run 7 euro for one way trips and 24 hours passes are available for 20 euro, which is a great deal if you plan to visit a lot of places in Venice.
