Stayed at Jeremiah Inn because we didn't want to impose and because we wanted to be on the outskirts of the city, on the edge of the open desert. The inn fulfilled our wishes, and was more than comfortable. It is situated with a fine view desert and mountains and close to many tourist attractions, including Mt. Lemmon. We hope to stay again. Our hosts were more than accommodating and helpful and the breakfasts were fabulous. The room was spacious and comfortable. The only negative: they didn't get the TV channel that carried our SF Giants in the World Series so we had to watch at our friends'. That turned out to be a plus as they enjoyed the Series, too. We weren't there to watch TV anyway!

It's a beautiful, modern, immaculately clean, one-story bed-and-breakfast out in the desert, and Bob and Beth are the nicest, most helpful hosts you could imagine. Wonderful, healthy breakfasts kept us filled up till dinner, plus Beth gives you a little packet of homemade cookies everyday for later. The inn is located about half an hour out of central downtown Tucson, but well worth it for the beauty, peace, and quiet. Beautiful views of desert terrain and mountains. Large rooms, super comfy beds, couch and table; swimming pool and spa outside. We could hear howling coyotes in the distance at night, which we loved. Very, very nice, very restful. We did several day outings that we would recommend--the Desert Museum, Sabino Canyon (take the tram up, walk down), the DeGrazia Museum in the Sun, the drive up Mt. Lemmon. (Much more we didn't have time to see.) Would go back to Jeremiah Inn in a heartbeat!
