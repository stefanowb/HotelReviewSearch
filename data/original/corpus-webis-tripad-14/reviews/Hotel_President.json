The Hotel is clean and safe. Good resting place. The rooms and bathrooms are small, but they are ok compared to what the other Italian hotels offer in the area. The elevator (lift) is the smallest one I have seen in my life. We had a baby stroller that we had to fold everytime we had to use the elevator. Just a few negatives, but overall, it was a great stay. Good price for the stay, we paid 89 US Dollars per night. Found parking at the Hotel and did not move our car for the three nights we were there as we used the Bus to get to Venice every day - Bus can be taken from a stop that is about three blocks from the hotel - short walk. Recommend you buy the 24hr bus and vaporetto ticket at the Hotel's front desk - its about 12 Euro per person, but well worth the investment. The Bus you should take to Venice is Number 4 or 4/. The hotel offers a small cold breakfast (ham/salami/cheese/cereals/bread). We did not leave hungry in the mornings, though. The front desk staff was very helpful, especially Giovanni who gave us information about Venice, provided us with a map, and told us all about the bus system (24hour pass), and vaporettos. Overall great experience. Venice is beautiful. We departed Venice after three days and made our way down to Florence and Pisa. Have a great trip, enjoy yourselves! And if you havent already, visit Mexico - beautiful land with great people, sights, and plenty of good food.", "title": "Great Hotel - Good Experience", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Oscarito", "date": "December 17, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6451892, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean, good staff, great location, close to public transportation", "disliked": "\u2014 size of rooms and elevator (lift)"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Ciao!", "title": "My family and I were very pleased with this hotel.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Hili", "date": "September 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5881641, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Comfortable beds", "disliked": "\u2014 At the end of an exausting day of sightseeing in Venice the walk back to the hotel from the bus stop seemed longer than in the morning!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "My family stayed 4 nights in this hotel in August 2006 and were very pleased with it.

I stopped, inquired and found their prices very reasonable considering the situation. I was surprised with the quality of the rooms. Breakfast was excellent. There is a promenade with plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes within walking distance (Galleria Barcella). The bus stop is about two blocks away (you can take a bus to Venezia and other surrounding areas). The bus ride is about 30 mins to Venezia depending of the time of the day and the day of the week. It is also near all the exits to all the freeways, the airport is about 20 mins away. The parking lot accomodates vehicles in a first come service mode.
