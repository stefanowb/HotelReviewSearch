We arrived late and had very little use of either. I just do not think they should close the pool and spa when people are in them relaxing. :( There were some mystery stains on the carpeting..Parking was a hassle.

I asked about parking and the garage run by a 3rd party put the gate up at 5 for the free weekends. Nope, not till really late at night per front desk. So I park there figuring I will leave to go to the bar at around midnight or fall asleep and leave in the am thus parking for free. So I ended up going to the car at maybe midnight and found the gararge had put a parking bill on the car. So I thought bad words and left. The gate was still down. I hit the button and the rep said to pay the bill and put the paid reciept in the envelope and place in the drop. It was maybe 5 bucks, not a big deal but sorta wish the check in had known what she was talking about. Also room was tiny. Bathroom so small not only do you have to choose to have door open or closed while on the pot, the sink has no counter. They did have aveda products. The bar soap seemed as cheap as any other brand and i got a pimple 2 days later. The shampoo smelled good, peppermint- not standard aveda smell--much better:). There are city sounds even on high floor. I had a headache at about 7 pm so went to walgreens down the street for headache med and treats. It was already closed...wtf. The hotel did sell in the mini shop by the desk and cost 2.50 for 1 dose, added to bill, was happy. Night staff also seemed indifferent-- they did have security--NPI (not known for quality). This hotel seem to like to find unskilled workers on the cheap rather than hire professionals. Elevator was tiny, if there is a fat guy with a bag you are waiting for the next one, although I found speed to be much better than what others said. Overall, not my kind of place, am silver, got free internet but no bottle of water or free breakfast nor anything else most chains provide to elite (even low level) members. If you are an artsy fartsy person or one that likes history it might be alright, or if you get an upgrade they have nice rooms. My counsin invited me over to party when she stayed here for free a couple years ago as she was a sales manager for marriott-- locations liked to butter her up with free stays and gifts in hopes corp sales mgr will book them business.
