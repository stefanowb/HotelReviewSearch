Then the dinner was superb and we particularly enjoyed canapes and aperatifs on the terrace. I didn't personally love the format of all the guests eating together and with 3 sets of guests with different first languages it didn't feel hugely sociable but that may have been unusual. It wasn't a negative though as it was lovely to talk and compare holidays and did fit with the fact this isn't really a hotel - it's an experience - just not my preference really. The breakfast was delicious - light, with yoghurt, cheese and pastries - a perfect French start to the day on the terrace in nice weather. Marie Anntoinette was a lovely hostess, happy to make recommendations for visits to other towns and restaurants and to talk about her stunning home. We don't know when but we do hope to go back. It was a perfect treat to ourselves.", "title": "A little paradise and out of this world experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Advocate7", "date": "August 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172011996}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We recently spent 5 nights at Chateau Clement. It was supposed to be a stopover between Italy and the Aveyron and turned out to be the best part of our trip...so we stayed several extra nights. The chateau is beautiful and perfectly maintained. The decor is absolutely perfect. Nothing is overdone and nothing has been overlooked. Marie Antoinette and Eric have put their hearts and souls into the building and the hospitality. Best of all, they make you feel comfortable and pampered. The breakfasts and dinners were all delightful and aperitif hour was a great way to meet lovely, interesting people from all over the world.", "title": "A gem in the Ardeches", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jonathan B", "date": "August 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 170950229}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Having travelled in all corners of the world, I was truly impressed and overwhelmed by the beauty of Chateau Cl\u00e9ment, by our spacious, artfully decorated room, by the extraordinary kindness and helpfulness of Marie-Antoinette, by the sumptuous dinner prepared by her husband Eric and by many more major and minor features of this small hotel (see the other reviews on TripAdvisor, most of which I share). But to me, the most attractive feature of Chateau Cl\u00e9ment is that it is not a genuine hotel. From the moment of our arrival to the moment of our departure, we were treated as good, old friends.
