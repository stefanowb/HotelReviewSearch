The staff were very nice and helpful when we asked about things to see & do. Our room was very big and quite comfortable (but dark) and the bathroom facilities were fine. The breakfast was lovely-lots of nice salamis, cheeses, etc. I would say it is a good value hotel as its reasonably priced-I have definitely stayed in nicer places but this was perfectly fine and suited us for our weekend stay in Amsterdam.", "title": "Good Value for Money", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mags81", "date": "January 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4322303}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Avoid at All Costs", "text": "I stayed at the des Arts for a couple of nights on the return end of a business trip. As other reviewers have stated, the hotel location is decent and the staff are friendly. That's the extent of the positives. The hallways and rooms are kind of dingy and smelly and my room was subject to a lot of street noise. The pictures at the hotel's website are misleading and make the rooms look better than reality. The hotel charges 4% to use a credit card and the advertised internet access (an old PC in a room adjacent to the lobby) is another fee. As another reviewer reported, I also was told that I couldn't get in after 2am or so. I didn't take the chance, but this sure seemed weird. Finally, breakfast was the standard Northern European fare of cheese and meats, but the selection and quality was a level below what you'd expect for the price of the hotel (although the coffee was good).", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 17, 2005", "id": 3675845}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Based on recommendations here, we booked a \"quad\" room for a single night in July to spend a day in Amsterdam before heading home after a 2-week trip in Europe. Upon arriving at the Hotel des Arts we found the location to be great and the staff was friendly and accommodating. Our room was up several flights of narrow, winding steps which was somewhat expected -- we didn't expect the smell of urine in the hallways though! Our room was a small with a fold-out couch and a single bed on the \"1st\" floor and an improvised loft built into the ceiling with a double bed (accessed by a stairway that was closer to a ladder). The room was not very clean and there was little air flow. That night the real trouble started -- the loft area was about 90 degrees and felt more like Panama than Northern Europe since there was no fan and only a small window. Our two children, who were excited about sleeping the loft, gave up after two hours of tossing and turning in the heat. I agreed to sleep upstairs and about 1am finally fell asleep \"in the tropics\". In the morning I awoke with about 20 mosquito bites that I guess were from mosquitoes that had flown in through the small window in the roof. We really are troopers and none of this would have mattered had this been a $50 a night \"roughing it\" night which we've done many times before. The room, however, cost us just under 200 Euro or about $240 so our expectations were obviously much higher. There are many, many better hotels in Amsterdam for that price.

The canal view room was very large, with high ceilings with wood beams, a fireplace(non-working), sitting area and a couch. Windows were floor to ceiling. Closet space was good and bathroom roomy. Hotel is centrally located between Centraal Station and the Leidesplein. Trams stop right outside of hotel which is two blocks from the Rembrandtsplein and the Flower Market. Breakfast which was included, was standard continental fare. Overall it was a good experience and fairly reasonable by Amsterdam standards. If you are looking for a quiet room, don't reserve the canal view although the noise outside wasn't too bad. Be advised that if you pay by credit card they charge you a 4% fee. Only problem we had was getting new towels daily, even though we followed standard towel etiquette. (Towels on the floor means we want new ones). This hotel does not have an elevator, but that is part of its charm since you are staying in old Amsterdam building.
