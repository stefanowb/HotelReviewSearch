We stayed one night, that was enough. I can't speak about the private Villas we booked a Lagoon villa, They looked great on the brochure from our travel agent in Australia and the website looked fantastic. What a disappointment.. Our lagoon villa was old and dirty. we were told there is a small kitchenette, Hell if you call a sink and 3 cups a kitchen ! We had booked for 2 weeks, it would have been a long 2 weeks. the only furniture in the villa, 2 cane chairs, and a coffee table. there is no lounge or any thing else to sit on just 2 cane chairs. The bath was a concrete trough rendered in some pretend finish, the taps and shower head had spots of rust on them. The toilet was stained with urine on the floor, and the curtains had water stains all over them. We complained to our travel agent but guess what ? This hotel will not allow refunds. I wonder why ? during the short time before we checked out there were Three more couples I know of ,trying to get a refund and check out. There is no glass in the windows in the Bathroom or the so called Kitchenette and we were woken in the morning by a stream of sunlight comming through the hole in our thatched roof, and i do mean a Hole. the skirting boards were covered in dirt and grime and there were water streakes running down the wall from the airconditioner.", "title": "Warning !
