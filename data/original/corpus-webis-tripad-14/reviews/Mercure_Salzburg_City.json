Our stay here for 2 nights was pleasant, we had lunch in the restaurant and went to a very highly rated Italian place around the corner. Although Salzburg is a small city this hotel is a little far from the centre of the city which means you'll have to walk up to 10 minutes to and from the hotel. This isn't that bad but given the size of the city you feel an element of being slightly out of the action so to speak. It's close(ish) to the train station which is convenient for travellers using the trains so take that into consideration if you want to book near the station. Overall a good hotel deserving of a 4 out of 5, but not amazing.", "user": "zippyzipster", "date": "August 28, 2011", "id": 117348393}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Ok hotel outside Salzburg's center", "text": "For a 75 euro charge, rooms are not equipped with air-conditioning. Rooms become extremly hot in the evenings in September when I visited the hotel. Very noisy when you keep the windows open. Staff is rude & unhelpful.

Hotel is at the edge of a residential area, takes about 20 minutes to walk to the old town across the river.The staff were all very nice especially Martin at the front desk. Everyone spoke English very well. Bikes are available from the hotel for 10 euro per day , a good way to see more of the city. Hotel was very clean. The weather was not exactly warm so the lack of air conditioning was not a problem. Parking was available in the hotel's outside lot for free. There are several restaurants within walking distance. The only complaint I would have is the worn out matress, I slept OK but my wife got a bit of a back ache, not sure if it was just our room or they're all like that. As for the noise in the morning, yes if you have the window open you can hear the tour bus starting up, I tend to get up early so not a problem for me. The rate we got was very reasonable so I thought the Mercure Salzburg City was a great choice! And a great city.

The walk into town is not long (10-15 min), but the surrounding neighborhood is not wonderful. There was an electric kettle and tea and coffee in the room, which was nice, but the tea and coffee used was not replaced (and there were no spoons). When I asked about getting more tea, I was sent to the restaurant to get it myself and treated as if my request was unreasonable. I don't mind if they don't want to provide these things for free, but, in that case, don't have the kettle/tea/coffee in the room in the first place. If you do have it, please provide spoons and replace what is used!
