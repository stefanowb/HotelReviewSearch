We booked with bookinhotels.com which seemed the best deal at the time we looked - \u00a3209 for 4 nights B&B. Upon arrival we upgraded to a marina view/pool view suite for an additional 14 euros per night and were given splendid accommodation which would have been perfectly adequate for 4 people. The internal d\u00e9cor is a very attractive marble and stone theme and the corridors have sensor lighting and are never dull and gloomy. There was a very spacious bedroom with an additional spacious lounge with two sofas (which would have been fine for beds for children). Along one wall was a fully fitted and well equipped modern kitchen with larder fridge, microwave, cooker and 4 ring hob as well as the essential kettle! The balcony was big enough to sit on (yes \u2013 it was often warm enough even in February).Digital TV with English channels.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "Candymiller", "date": "February 28, 2007", "id": 6891665}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The staff were friendly and helpful and breakfast, included in the price we paid \u2013 (but watch out - some booking agencies don\u2019t include this) was self-service continental and fine for our needs.", "title": "Spacious, clean, convenient, reasonable priced", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "edinburghandglasgow", "date": "February 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6842808, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Space, comfort, cleanliness, style", "disliked": "\u2014 poor breakfast value"}}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Algarve", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 15, "very good": 73, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 127}, "aka": "Marina Club Lagos Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.166666666667}
