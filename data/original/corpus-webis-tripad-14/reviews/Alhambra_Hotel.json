A few short steps and you are at Kings Cross/St. Pancras station. From Kings Cross, you can use the Underground to pretty much hit any section of London via the Tube. Eurostar is also located in this station. This was extremely convenient as we were going to ride the Eurostar to France after our stay in London. There are ATMs on the same street, a few fast food joints, convenience stores, groceries, etc. The British Library is also a short walk away. We stayed in Room 2, which is downstairs in Building 20 directly across the street. There is no lift, but this is nothing to complain about as the few steps are manageable. There is a computer with internet access in the reception area that guests can use, and free wi-fi is provided in the rooms. The room was a good size for London standards and at an unbeatable price - especially once you add their awesome breakfast! Their English breakfast consists of fried eggs, bacon, beans, sausage, tomato, toast, coffee, tea, juice, and many other choices. The breakfast staff was quick and efficient, always asking if we needed anything else. The hotel was great and the food was delicious, but the staff made the stay excellent! Bruno was very kind and extremely helpful with all our needs.
