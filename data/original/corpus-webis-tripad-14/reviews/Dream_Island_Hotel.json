We arrived on Easter Sunday before noon via SuperJet from Crete, and were promptly invited to join the family and staff for an Easter BBQ celebration. We naturally accepted and had a wonderful time with the hotel family and other guests like ourselves, with delicious food, music, dancing and cheery celebrations. The hotel is incredibly clean, beautiful and has lovely views to the east all the way to the sea. The rooms wrap around a lovely plaza area with a nice pool. Our room had a lovely balcony where we could sit and also where we could dry the clothes we chose to wash by hand. There is also a laundry located nearby in case you'd prefer someone else do your washing. It's a convenient walk to the center of the village, the bus station, and the shopping district on the rim of the caldera. We did not rent a vehicle, choosing instead to walk and use the perfectly adequate bus system. Via bus we toured to the black sand beach of Perissa all then all the way to Oia and back with no trouble. Breakfasts here are very nice. Of course the family and staff here at the hotel are absolutely marvelous. Completely helpful and full of great suggestions for how to get about and where to go. They also offer complimentary pickup service to/from the boat harbor and the airport. Just let them know when you need pickup / dropoff and they will take care of you. We booked directly with the hotel after checking here and at their web site. Oh, and the business center with free use of two computers and the lobby area are very nice indeed, and we used the business center to make several arrangments for the rest of our trip to Greece.

We rented a car one day and spent about 8 hours exploring the island, this island is an easy island to drive, not too much traffic in May and not too difficult to find your way around. For the dog lovers, you will be greeted by the owners dog Athena, a very friendly ball of fur! We all highly recommend this hotel we know you will enjoy your stay.", "title": "Family owned hotel run with pride of ownership, extremely friendly!!", "user": "Garlands1830", "date": "May 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 110647251}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had an amazing time in Santorini and loved our stay at the Dream Island Hotel.

We walked into a travel agency and booked the first ferry out along with the hotel special they had that day. We felt SO lucky to have ended up at Dream Island. The hotel is newly built and beautifully decorated by the wife/mother of the family. The father and daughter were waiting for us at the ferry terminal to take us there and even offered a ride to take us back the day we left. We ended up reserving an extra night we were so pleased. Breakfast is available each morning and it is quite the buffet spread. We got to have our scrambled eggs and sausage we missed from the US. There are not very many rooms so there is not too much noise and sometimes you feel that you have the place to yourself. I would visit this place again in a heartbeat.
