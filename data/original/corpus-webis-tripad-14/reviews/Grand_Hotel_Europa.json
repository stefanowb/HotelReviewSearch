We were impressed right away with how clean and modern the hotel is and were very surprised to see how large our standard room turned out to be. It was easily the largest hotel room in Europe we've ever had. It was about a ten to fifteen minute walk to the main downtown area and directly across the street from the main train station which houses a really nice grocery store downstairs (MPreis I think it was called). The front desk staff was very helpful in giving us directions and suggesting things to do. Overall it made a great home base for exploring Innsbruck and we really enjoyed staying here. The only downside was the confusing light switches. There are buttons labeled 1-4 and even after staying there for 3 days I still couldn't entirely figure out what each button turned on or off. There was a large lamp in the room that was supposed to be the main light except it had no switch on it and none of the buttons turned it on, so we had to do with \"accent lighting\" the entire stay.", "title": "Location, Cleanliness, and Space", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Mattpersico", "date": "March 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 154503919}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Had the pleasure of staying at Grand Hotel Europa for one night on our return from ski holiday. Our party consisted of four adults and six children. The staff were fantastic, rooms well presented and spotless and food superb. We ate in the hotels restaurant which was fantastic and certainly best food of our holiday. The children were treated like royality and were thrilled to be invited to choose a lovely chocolate truffle each at the end of the meal. The selection of breads were fantastic, appitizers mouth watering and my lobster main in particular was delectable. Would like to especially thank Amitab, Ibraham and Kohlalr in the restaurant who ensured that our dining experience was perfect they were so lovely with children. Breakfast the following morning was equally as good and could not be faulted. The hotel manager, Roman, is obviously passionate about hospitality and you can sense that guest satisfaction is the number one priority.
