Maybe it's the age of the hotel but in particular the furnishings seemed to be worn more than most Westin's I've stayed at previously. For instance the lamp shade on my desk had been taped together from the inside and since broken open. The service could not have been better both at check in and the room service as well but the furnishings just didn't seem up to the Westin standards I am used to seeing in their hotels.", "title": "Nice hotel but a little worn around the edges.", "user": "BFMCharlotte", "date": "October 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 46368224}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I completed the menu card and requested my breakfast be delivered between 6:45 am - 7:00 am.

When my order arrived, the delivery person emphasized that she was only three minutes late...again, no apology. At that time, the hotel offered to charge me half of the tab. Once I sat down to eat, I realized my order was not complete. I spoke to the main deskperson about the incident, adding that not only was my delivery late but incomplete, as well.

I hate when I stay in hotels and there is one bar of soap for the shower, separate bath, and sink area; this was not a problem here. Housekeeping left ample soap and towels for my stay.
