Our first several encounters with the desk staff seemed to support that conclusion, but as time went on, we increasingly came to appreciate them. When we checked out and were on our way, our limo driver received a call before we had gone more than a mile - Muguet had found my credit card still in the hotel safe!

It's the perfect location to base oneself and if you are into the food here, Cafe Constant (for dinner) is close by as is the Rue Cler market street.

The traffic noise is NOT horrible by any means, but there were a few times we were woken up in the night by trucks or motorcycles. We did, also, find the walls to be a bit thin. Our neighbors the last two nights left their TV on all night and we could hear it in our room, which was somewhat distracting. The breakfast is 10 euro/day each. It is cold cereal, hard-boiled eggs, meats and cheeses, a large croissant and a piece of French bread. There is also coffee, tea, and hot chocolate available.
