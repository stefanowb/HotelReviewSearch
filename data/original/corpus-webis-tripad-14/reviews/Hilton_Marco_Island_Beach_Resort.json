This is a beautiful hotel on the beach. We got a good deal on Orbitz (probably because this time of year is low season for Marco Island). We had a spacious room with a king size bed on the 10th floor, so the view of the beach and the island was wonderful, and we enjoyed watching sunsets over the water from our balcony. The room had a frig which was great for keeping the bottled water we bought at the grocery store cold. Our room also had 2 sinks- 1 sink next to the bathroom and 1 sink behind the bathroom door (along with the toilet and tub/shower). Having 2 sinks is very handy when more than one person needs to get ready at the same time. Another thing we really liked about the hotel was the shopping center across the street which has several restaurants; it was so nice to be able to walk to dinner, enjoy a drink or two, and walk back to the hotel. The shopping center also had an ice cream shop, which we visited and a movie theater, which we didn't visit. We will definitely stay at the Hilton again when planning future trips to Marco Island.", "title": "Fun on the beach", "user": "illinigal", "date": "July 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34880651}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton.
