We saw a play at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, visited several Shakespearean properties in the town and had great meals along Sheep Street - all within easy walking distance of the hotel. So location was a big plus for the hotel - just bring along your shades to shield off the garish corridor carpets and don't wear 70's checked brown for breakfast or you might merge with the restaurant carpets.
