Since my friend & I had never been to Aruba it was up to the other 2 to review. They had stayed at the \"high rise area\" in the past and found the beach @ the Divi \"far superior\". They were pleasantly surprised that the casino was so close by. Our rooms were oceanview (12 ft to the beach) and adequate. The air conditioning was not that great & ran constantly along with the ceiling fan...we were comfortable but it seems it could be more energy consious! The staff @ the Divi was awesome especially Filo (meeter & greeter). We felt very safe and well cared for. Millie (concierge) had an attitude problem. She acted like making a reservation was an intrusion. She improved with time however. The food @ Divi is OK. Breakfast was very good w/ vegetable omelettes, eggs benedict fruit etc. Lunch buffet was adequate w/ buffet & maybe a pizza and buffet dinner OK. Red Parrot was pretty good on 2 occassions w/ great waiters. Paparrazzi Restaurant @ Tamarjin is terrible...they need a real Italian chef. But I didn't go to Aruba to eat! My friend & I love to explore. We rented a Jeep for a day & loved the landscape of the Nat'l Park. Go to Flying Fishbones Restaurant in Savaneta if you get a chance. All in all a good experience. We met a lot of people who had been to the Divi on multiple occasions.

There are 4 restuarants you can pick from for a sit down dinner. The Palm Grill was our first dinner at Divi (located in Tamarijn) The staff was wonderful, they checked on you often, however the food was horrible. Plain, tasteless. I ordered a honey terriyaki chicken, the chicken came out plain, not marinated at all, i used as much soy sauce (on the table) as i could, but nothing could help that plain chicken. Also since you are cooking it yourself, we found the lighting the in restaurant to be too dark. It was hard to see if the chicken and fish was cooked enough before we ate it. The 2nd restaurant we ate at was Ginger (at the Tamarijn). It has asian style food. This place was full of problems. First off we had a 6:30 dinner sitting time. We were there 10min early, were seated right away, drink order was taken right away. All seemed well. Then once our food order was given no one came back for 45 minutes. I finally flagged someone down and asked where our food was because people coming for the 7pm sitting were already eating. They lost our order. When the food finally came out 60min later, I ordered the mango chicken. the chicken was tiny bits of boiled chicken placed around some noodles inthe center of the plate. Then it had a mago sauce drizzled over the top. I'd say this place had even worse food than the Palm Grill. No one ever came and checked on us, no one ever got us another drink. It truly was horrible. Paparazzi (at Tamarijn) was delicious. The wait staff always checked on you, refilled your drinks, and was awesome. The food was awesome too. By far the best at Divi. The Red Parot (at Divi) was also very good. We ate here twice during our stay. The staff at this restuarant always checked in on you, refilled your drinks, and all in all were very great. The food was very good here too. The mashed sweetpotatoes were amazing. We never had Buffet for dinner, we escaped 3 times for dinner off the resort. We went to El Gaucho's, and Pincho's. Both were amazing! El Gaucho's had better food and more choices, Pincho's had an amazing few of the sunset.

From what I understand, these are the last rooms to be renovated (the building next to ours...the single story Casitas were being renovated while we were there). So, with that said, the rooms looked old and a bit used. Once I was there for a day or two, however, I got over the plainness of the room, looked at the view from our balcony every day and night and was satisfied.

The other sections of the resort (the Casitas, the Villas, and the Vista buildings) are all close to the beach, with the Villas (which are the nicest rooms) being the furthest away.

Here's the breakdown: The Red Parrot at the Divi was our absolute favorite. We ate here probably 6 times an enjoyed it each time (you must have the Churasco a Moda!). This is the nicest restaurant between the two resorts and offers a nice sized menu. Paparazzi at The Tamarijn (which is the italian place) was very disappointing and reminded me of how I try and cook italian food (jar of sauce over pasta). The environment was nice, but the food was subpar. The Palm Grill was also a bit of a disappointment. This place allows you to cook your own food at your table; literally, the stove top is in the center of your table and you cook it with your tablemates. If you are a party of two, they sit you with another couple and then the four of you make your collective dinner. I found this experience a bit creepy and sitting that close to a hot surface somewhat uncomfortable. The buffets at both resorts were good...the breakfast buffet is great! Anything you can imagine as a breakfast food is available...pancakes, french toast, waffles, fruit, juices, eggs, made-to-order omeletters, cereal...everything! We were there for 8 breakfasts and I could have had something each day and not eaten the same thing twice! The lunch and dinner buffets were o.k., but better than your average buffet restaurant (like HomeTown buffet). The Pelican Bar at the Divi makes thick and thin personal pizzas as well as panini sandwiches, which my husband and I enjoyed on several occassions. Overall, I enjoyed the food and really liked the fact that between the Divi and the Tamarijn there were always a ton of choices...and you did not have to carry a wallet around with you. There's something to be said for ordering whatever you want, as much as you want (think appetizers with dinner and dessert), and not worrying about how much the bill will be. And for those who complained about making reservations for dinner, it was an easy process. You could always make a reservation a day ahead, and we did so each morning after breakfast. It became our routine and took very little time. We never had a problem, because we were making them for the following day.

Again, the Tamarijn was only a 2-minute golf cart ride away (the resort takes you back and forth whenever you want). Mostly, my husband and I layed by the pool and layed on the beach. A lot of folks save chairs and tiki huts on the beach each morning. Overall, we found tiki huts or just woke up early to place a towel and a book on a chair. I naturally wake up early and did not find this to be a problem. I recommend getting fresh clean towels from the towel hut each afternoon before it closes at 6:00 p.m. to have early in the morning; this way you can use a fresh towel to save a chair if it's a busy resort day. The resort gives you a towel card to use to \"check out\" towels. You are able to trade in wet or dirty towels all day long.

The casino is good-sized for a resort, though nothing close to the size of an Atlantic City or Las Vegas casino. Either way, we had fun gambling. We went to a time share presentation for the Divi Phoenix vacation resort plan (someone will ask you as soon as you get to the resort). Personally, I did not think it was worth it. You got a t-shirt, a tote bag, and a choice of another item. We selected a $100 voucher to use at the casino. The total time for the presentation was almost 2 hours and was more irritating than the \"prizes\" were worth. We went downtown two times and shopped throughout the downtown area. I especially liked the Royal Plaza Mall that had a store, which sold beautiful Dutch linens. Otherwise, I was somewhat unimpressed with the shopping. You do not get great prices on items compared to the U.S. There were many things I would just buy at home, like perfume and clothes. If you saved any money is was maybe a couple of bucks and then you saved on tax. Unless you wanted to buy that bottle of perfume before you came, for example, you weren't saving much by splurging while you were there. The jewelry is moderately priced, but you have to know what you are looking for. There is a lot of poor quality there. Remember that everything is negotiable, but be courteous and respectful.

I was pleased with the resort as a whole. Check-in was a simple and quick process. The room was a simple \"garden view\" king size hotel room. Actually, the view was the side of the hotel next door and the service roads between. Didn't matter to me because the only time we spent in the room was sleeping. Most importantly the room was clean, up-to-date, and in no need of repairs. Bar service was good. Bar tenders kinda \"expect\" tips, but it isn't necessary (ie: if you run out of waterlogged dollar bills in your swimming trunk pockets). Tipping one bartender very well at the beginning of your stay doesn't work because they rotate shifts and bars regularly. (I heard that technique works in Cancun) Restaurants: Red Parrot is great food and service. I could eat there every night. Ginger at the Tamarijin was glorified Panda Express. Don't order the sushi appetizer, 4 pieces rolled (2 vegetable, 1 fake crab, and 1 whitefish). Entrees were large piles of rice and inexpensive cuts of meat with rather tasty sauces. Papparazzi Italian was great service and food. My only gripe was my entree was only warm when served and quickly became cold. Palm Grill is a \"self cook Hibachi\". Mostly the novelty of cooking your own food. But wait, I'm on vacation. I don't want to cook. If you have your kids with you they will love it, just don't let them touch the cooking surface. The buffets were pretty standard resort/cruise ship, just smaller. The pizza ovens were great, especially for late-night snacks. Beach: beautiful sugary white sand groomed every morning. Crystal clear water, relatively calm. Just OK snorkeling. Easy to kayak on. Windsurfing is up to the watersports desk determining if the wind is going away from shore. The rock wall is only available when the guide is there, look on resort schedule. The \"Watersports\" tent on the beach between the two resorts is NOT part of Divi and costs money.

Curtis at the Sandpiper bar, David and Vanessa in the Pelican main buffet restaurant, Christina our room maid and the boys at the pool/beach towel hut all stand out as exemplary people with too many others to mention by name at the concierge desk, reception, Red parrot and garden staff etc. The Divi Pelican restaurant (breakfast plus buffet meals) is the best of all the AI hotels that we have visited anywhere. Breakfast 'eggs benedict' cooked to order being a particular favourite not to mention the 7 freshly prepared fruits every day (3 melons, pineapple, grapefruit, orange and papaya). Choice of breads was excellent plus all the usual American breakfast foods (pancakes, waffles, crisp bacon etc) with a pot of fresh coffee put out as soon as you arrived at a table. There were 6 to 8 different cereals available as well as all the hot food that was regularly topped up right until just before closing. Pelican staff were hard working and mostly always cheerful and sometimes singing through the service!. Yes we did manage to leave breakfast! and then the beach was fantastic, whether flooded or clear of water and cleaned nearly every day and so so white and talcum powder smooth. New sun loungers and more new beach shelters mean that there was always space and shade. On two days out of 14 the loungers, which are tidied up into stacks every night, where padlocked until around 7am ish, which was possibly to allow the beach combing tractor and machine to clean seaweed away from near the beach shades after the flooded beach days. Yes beach life starts early at the Divi, with some of the condo owners/timesharers from the Divi village, across the road being over by 6.30 am to claim some space. We met some lovely East coast American couples both staying at 'the Village' and staying at the hotel who had been visiting the Divi for as long as 17 years, which says something about the place and the facilities. We visited the 'Tam' next door on two occasions to eat at the Italian and Asian restaurants but preferred the Pelican and Red Parrot. We had one visit to 'Windows on Aruba' for a special occasion which I will review separately - but was really excellent. One small criticism - there was never a shuttle passing when we needed one but the exercise probably did us good! We both have some mobility issues but managed the short walks between different venues. As other Brits have reported, Sandra the Thomson rep was superb (if you want to find her from now go to Lanzarotte for the winter and somewhere in Italy next summer because Thomson have moved her away from Aruba - all that lovely local knowledge gone to waste) and the hotel reception staff checking you in on the coach (all 3 of them to about 20 or so guests) was a real treat. A real shame that Thomson can't fly from Manchester next year and don't provide a shuttle link to Gatwick. This will be a real loss to those Brits from up North and will stop us from coming back, which we would have done next June with family. Comments about the high rise Palm beach area are justified, unless you like samey samey concrete jungle don't bother and the beach doesn't compare. Best way to see the Palm beach area is from a distance on Capt Rene's boat 'Rendezvous on Aruba' (see the separate reviews on Snorkeling Aruba) or a De Palm catamaran. Druif beach (the Divi's beach) is miles better than either Palm or Eagle beach (which was voted number 2 beach in the world on Trip Adviser) and along with the Divi food, staff and service makes for an excellent holiday on 'one happy Island'.", "title": "Lovely", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "april2007", "date": "October 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144138903}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean", "city": "Oranjestad"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 82, "average": 177, "very good": 515, "terrible": 52, "excellent": 508}, "aka": "Divi Aruba All Inclusive Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.2, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.5}}
