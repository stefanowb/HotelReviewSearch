The Radisson was quiet, clean and would be excellent for business travelers that want to stay in a more touristy part of town. Staff speak English and do so well...better than at other hotels we stayed at during our trip. Rooms are not particularly large, but they are comfortable - and space comes at a premium in Europe. In a nutshell, the hotel is not particularly romantic, but the location is hard to beat for art lovers...or tourists who want a quick shot to Atocha station to catch the AVE to Toledo, Sevilla and other spots for the day.", "title": "Modern Hotel Across from Classic Art", "user": "SuiteLife101", "date": "February 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 151774004}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled solo", "text": "a only had a night there but i think i did a lot. don't forget to order a facial or massage, the downstairs pool is a relaxing place to wind down from a long day of travel. the hotel is very nicely located, walk out of the hotel and go left and you will find amazing restaurants and bars. i went to 2 different blues bars in that one night just a few safe blocks from the hotel.", "title": "was a great hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "GaryC_california", "date": "January 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150900519}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled on business", "text": "very well run hotel, would highly recommend and would absolutely return.", "title": "Good Service and frantic room design", "user": "TravelZeta", "date": "January 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150432607}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is placed in a cozy corner in the heart of Madrid.", "title": "Pleasurable hotel near Museo del Prado", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "312Paolo", "date": "January 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150280179}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The staff is helpful and service is good for this kind of hotel.
