However, this hotel was AWFUL! I would not recommend anyone to stay here. As we arrived the man on reception didn\u2019t even look up which was a bad start. When we got up to our room I was horrified, the smell was disgusting. I knew that the hotel was very old but that was a smell I will never forget. The first thing I did was to buy some glade to get rid of the terrible smell. We didn\u2019t let this ruin our stay, we just made sure we spent as little time as possible in the hotel. As people have said it\u2019s a great location, when you stand outside the hotel and look up you can see the Empire State building which was fantastic. It was an excellent price but next time I will pay a little bit extra to stay in a decent hotel and will definitely give the Wolcott a miss. The worst part of the trip was the last day when we had to use the \u201cshower room\u201d as we had an evening flight and had to check out at 12noon. We were given a key to a dirty shower, a stained toilet and a sink. We decided not to use the shower as it was so dirty and instead had to make do with having a quick wash. This was not ideal especially as we had a 7 hour flight and couldn\u2019t have a shower as the facilities provided were not clean. This hasn\u2019t put me off New York it\u2019s a great City and my time there was fantastic. I did read the reviews on here before I went and noticed they were mixed but I would suggest you do not stay here.", "title": "Definitely give this hotel a miss!
