When they promise something via email, they make sure they have it for you. No confusion and no excuses, unlike many other cities (Paris). If you are interested in a pilgrimage to Auschwitz, allow them to make the plans for you. It is inconvenient and the trip back is a time for meditation not stress. They will arrange it and take the stress out of it. I do not however, recommend paying the Auschwitz/Birkenau museum a fee for what is essentially free and a merely ancedotal or cursory tour.
