The room was a surprise how good the room was the beds were great and most comfortable, the tv was a flat widescreen which did not expect, very clean room and bathroom (which I'm very picky about) the room includes fridge and microwave no extra charge. Also the desk chair was very comfortable plus it had a reclining chair which is a nice bonus. The salt water pool was very nice and warm. Now the free breakfast I was not expecting such a large selection most free breakfast are just continent ones, but here you get scramble eggs, sausages, biscuits, gravy, warm cininamon buns, ceral, hot oatmeal, yogurt, bread, french toast(put in toaster kind), danishes, muffins,bagels, juices, coffee all you can eat also. So over all we will be back and I recommand this hotel to everyone. We stay on the first floor near the front lobby it was great location. close to pool, breakfast get in and out of hotel.

A little loud until things settled down after 10pm. (We didn't bother asking to move, tho'.) The bathroom door would not stay open. You wouldn't think that would bother you, but somehow it did. We just stuck a towel on the floor to hold it open. The beds were not the most comfortable. But I\"ve had much worse. At least they give you several pillows, both firm and soft, to choose from.
