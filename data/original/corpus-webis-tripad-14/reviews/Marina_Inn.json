The rooms are small but ok - if you go to SF you just need a bed to sleep and that is what is offered. For breakfast - ok - continental breakfast in the US means you have to find a nicer place but there are good opportunities around the Marina Inn. To be true - of course there are some \"negative\" things: The rooms are not always so clean (but give the usual tip to the chambermaid and it will get better) and the Lombard street is really loud. Hence, you should try to get a room that is not located on first or second floor.
