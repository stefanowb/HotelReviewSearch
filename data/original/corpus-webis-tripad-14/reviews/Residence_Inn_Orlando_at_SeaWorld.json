The standard studio suite is very spacious. The decor and furniture are attractive, and the queen bed is very comfortable. Also, the pull-out sofa bed is a queen, making this a very practical accommodation The outdoor recreation area (pool, etc.) is of good size. All the common areas are cheerful, attractive, and well-maintained. Complimentary breakfast is ample although the quality is nothing to rave about. One afternoon they had complimentary pizza by the pool--a terrific surprise! The staff is very pleasant. Housekeeping does a great job--the room was made neat as a pin.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Calif-FloridaBoy", "date": "July 7, 2004", "id": 2281649}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Family Hotel", "text": "Sea World is 10-minute walk.

The hotel was very clean and I felt very safe here. The rooms were nice sized, and gave my daughter and I room to move around. The breakfast was excellent. Yes, there is limited seating, but we usually took it back to our room, which was great. Grabbing an extra banana every day made for a nice evening snack! The money we saved eating made for extra spending at the parks.

As we were driving up I figured they must have some basement rooms that they sold at such a good rate. But no, we were given pool view 3rd floor and WOW we were impressed with our studio. Two queen beds, sleeper sofa, toilet/shower separate from the sink area. It had a dishwasher, coffee-maker, full size refridgerator/freezer, 2 cooktops, and a microwave. Very adequate utensils and prep-cookware. This is their cheapest room keep in mind. It very comfortably slept our family of 5. The zero-entry pool, pizza hut, basketball court and playground kept us all entertained. So entertained in fact that the oldest teens with us went to Discovery Cove in the am, hopped over to Sea World when they were done, stayed there an hour or two and called us to see if we minded if they came back to the hotel then to play some basketball and swim. The property was perfectly maintained, even the laundry room was spotless and only $1.50 each to wash and dry(1hour). An absolutely GREAT choice for your stay in Orlando.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MichiganGizmo", "date": "June 24, 2004", "id": 2220682}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2004", "text": "The important stuff was very good. Our 2-bedroom suite was spacious, much more so than at a Homewood Suites or at an Embassy Suites. The rooms were very clean and in great shape, and even the living room/kitchen had a window. Our room faced the freeway, but we were not disturbed by the road noise; it was relatively quiet in the rooms. The kitchen was fully equipped for 4 people, but we easily managed to stretch it for all of us. The Pizza Hut next to the pool was very convenient, as was the free Internet service in the room for the laptop. The hotel location is ideal; only a 10-minute drive to Universal, a Publix supermarket very close, Sea World almost next door, and Disney only 10 minutes away. All the staff we met were very courteous and helpful. The breakfast was fine, especially considering the convenience and the variety offered. Before 8am, it wasn\u2019t crowded at all, but the one day we got down there at 8.30am it was crowded but we still had plenty to eat. I have to agree the coffee wasn\u2019t good, about the same as in most breakfast restaurants, so I got around that by making my own in the room with the coffer the hotel provides. It\u2019s a large hotel and there were several large groups there during our stay; there was one large noisy tour group of teenagers from Brazil that started to play soccer in the hallway at 11pm one evening, but the hotel employees quickly came to put at stop to that. The swimming pool is on the small side for the size of the hotel, and it\u2019s especially appropriate for the younger kids under the age of about 12; it\u2019s not really deep enough for teenagers. But you don\u2019t come to Orlando to use a hotel swimming pool, so it wasn\u2019t that important to us. Elevators were not a problem for us; we did have to wait occasionally, but no more than in most buildings. All in all, a very good vacation hotel, a significant step-up from the Embassy Suites, and I\u2019d certainly stay there again next time.", "title": "The important stuff was very good", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "ats262m", "date": "July 17, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 2304249}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Value", "text": "A very good hotel at a great price, clean, well maintained, good breakfast buffet and good staff.
