Get the breakfast option unless you're hooked on Starbucks which is just a block away. The breakfast is plentiful and excellent. Service is top notch on every level. Everyone greets you and is outgoing. The pool bar is open 24/7 and we had a great late night snack / dinner under the stars. The pool area is nice but I agree not large enough for the amount of guests. Rooms were wonderful, spotless. Bed heavenly. The fitness area is very good with great machines.

We were therefore disappointed to get a fairly small room with insufficient cupboard space. We had specifically requested twin beds and got a single bed. When we complained at the reception, the girl said \"but we gave you a bed for three people\". It was indeed a king size bed but as the mattress is fairly soft (it would have been lovely in a single bed), we still disturbed each other when turning over. The air conditioning is very noisy. The view onto the sea was fine but there is a road in-between and before you get to the public beach, you have to cross a large parking area. Otherwise, the situation is fine, right where all the restaurants are. The bathroom is very nice, the entrance hall sumptuous. However, I have never seen a hotel where so much staff is just standing around - very friendly and helpful but what do they need all these people for? As mentioned by other guests, the pool area is much too small and squatted all day by the same people. Breakfast is a great experience though you can get neither butter nor milk from the buffet - you have to ask for it and then it is brought to your table. In the meantime, you wait. As this is a tower hotel, you often have to wait a long time for a lift.
