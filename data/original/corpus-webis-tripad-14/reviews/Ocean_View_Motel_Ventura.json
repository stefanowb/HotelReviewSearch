Then I inspected the bed and the sheets were dirty with hairs on it. The room was so dusty there was stuff hanging from the ceiling and there is absolutely nothing in the world that would get me to put my head on the pillows they provided. We had paid in advance and could not get any money back so just cut our losses and drove up the road towards LA a bit further where there are heaps of Comfort Inns, Days Inn etc for about $80 a night that are SO MUCH NICER - feels like the Hilton after the Ocean View Motel. Staff were also rude and smelly.
