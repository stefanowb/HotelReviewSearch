We were two ladies on our own, and had never been to NYC, so safety was of a concern. We arrived at night. Check-in was very quick and convenient, and we were really pleased with the room. Very spacious, up-to-date and clean, and we had a great view of the Empire State Building. Because it was already getting late, and the area was pretty dark, we decided to stay in and order room service, which is delivered from a nearby restaurant. The food arrived quickly, was very good and a reasonable price. We could hear the elevator in our room, but the sound wasn't bothersome, and didn't interrupt my sleep. One thing I will make note of -- the pillows are very narrow and almost round, nearly like bolsters. I thought they'd be uncomfortable, but I slept great every night. The doormen were perfect gentlemen, and always helpful. If you need a cab, they'll get one for you. If you order room service, they bring it up. I've read some complaints about the breakfast room, but we were very pleased with everything there. (Great bagels!) Just plan to take your food/coffee/tea back to your room due to space limitations. We walked everywhere -- the location of the hotel was very convenient to shopping, restaurants, shows, banks and parks. As everyone else has said, there are a lot of guys standing around on the sidewalks just outside, but we didn't have any problems with them. They are all gone at night. We walked back to the hotel late at night, and felt safe. I would stay at the Broadway Plaza again in a flash.", "title": "Great Hotel!

When we arrived we were fairly impressed though by no means overwhelmed! The entrance is small but re-assuring when you see a well presented friendly door security chap who was very welcoming. The staff at the desk too were fairly friendly. We checked in and went to our Room 802, upon entering my partner and I were very impressed. the room looked clean and tidy and well presented, with a large Old style TV (That Suprisingly had Signal, unusual for many Hotels in NYC) Our room was a corner room and for a Queen size room was a decent size with tidy bathroom. There was also a Drinks machine and Sweets,Crisps dispenser too on our floor. All Good so far! We then ventured outside at night to go to Maddison Square Garden to see AC/DC Play and were a little shocked at first, for about 500 metres strectch directly outside the hotel is slightly dodgy! Many groups hanging around doing well NOT much just hanging! my girlfriend was a little worried, but being honest they do not harrass or talk to you so don't worry, also after a little while it we were not at all bothered by it! BAD point - Ignore breakfast on the 4th floor! Tiny room and expect to que, though hell your in NYC go elsewhere and enjoy the delights of breakfast. EXTREMELY BAD POINT - The night we checked out the hotel - feeling happy enough with the Plaza, we entered JFK Airport and were ready to board our plane when my partner complained of bites on her arm, hey I'm telling you these were big bites, we thought nothing of it until flying home to Newcastle via Amsterdam, when I started itching on my back and legs, once at Schippal Airport I went to the Gents to find I had god knows how many bites on my back, pretty horrible. My Partner and I are pretty healthy 33 and 27 Year olds who have never had anything like this before and unfortunalty we both knew this came from our previous two nights stay at the Plaza!
