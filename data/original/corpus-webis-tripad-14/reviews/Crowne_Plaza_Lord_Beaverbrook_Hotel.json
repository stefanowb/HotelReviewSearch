When I got the confirmation, we were charged close to $10 more.

I was also very impressed with how seriously this hotel considers peace and quiet to be of major importance. Signs were posted with courtesy guidelines in keeping noise to a minimum and as a result we didn't hear a thing which is a big plus for the light sleepers such as myself. Ample free parking and fast wifi were also much appreciated. The hotel is also located close to many restaurants that were within easy walking distance. I also will mention that the Crowne Plaza is located right on the water and there is an excellent boardwalk right behind it if you feel like taking a walk or going for a run.
