We loved it. The front desk people were wonderful, and even when I gave them an attitude for no reason(I now apologize profoundly and publicly) afterwards they were more than helpful and courteous. The hotel was clean, spacious, safe and quiet. Our room was exactly what we expected and was not misrepresented on the internet. There were two large windows facing the Munt and we had a great view. Only thing, bring your own pillows and foam for the mattress (although they did have foam, I saw it in the laundry room). I sleep on memory foam every night so I am not used to a regular mattress and if you are like me bring foam. The trams ran right outside and there was a grocery store right around the corner, plus many inexpensive places to get dinner. There were even two coffee shops within two blocks of the hotel. We tried the breakfast downstairs once and it was well worth the 9 euros. We could have cooked, there was a stovetop and sink and fridge, but we were on vacation! We were even able to do laundry for free in the basement, allowing us to pack lightly for the week. I did not smell cigarette smoke or anything else for that matter. There were not any mice or any bugs of any kind (and I am a bug magnet, if there is a bug within a mile it WILL crawl on me). There was even a hallway between our bedroom door and the door to the rest of the hotel and that had the bathroom. So, if you go with a friend, they can shower and get changed in private (see photos). We liked it so much we booked a two week stay in may for the same room just before we left. New year's eve we were able to see the Munt and all of the fireworks shows put on by the people in the streets safely.
