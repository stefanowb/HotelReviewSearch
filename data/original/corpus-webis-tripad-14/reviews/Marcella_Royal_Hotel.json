We can only repeat the previous comments about the excellent, helpful staff behind reception who were always welcoming and friendly. We had some very good recommendations for restaurants - La Pentolaccia was a particular favourite. When we arrived at the hotel there was some confusion about whether the air conditioning was working in the room allocated to us and we were moved to another room. This was very small and next morning we asked for a change of room. This was dealt with very easily and we went back to the original room where it transpired that the air con was working fine. In the confusion of moving rooms back I managed to leave my husband's birthday gift at the back of one of the drawers of the small room. Luckily for me, when we arrived back at reception after a day out the receptionist handed me the wrapped gift to say that it had been found in the room. So, there is no doubt that the staff are honest (it was a rather expensive watch) and what could have been a disaster was just an embarrassment (for me). We agree that the only improvement would be prepared fresh fruit with breakfast instead of the tinned stuff, but that is a small criticism. We enjoyed the Piano Bar in the evening for a drink after dinner and we would definitely stay at this hotel if we return to Rome (to finish the sightseeing that we didn't manage to fit in during our 5 night visit).", "title": "Lovely staff, small clean rooms, residential neighborhood", "user": "Brymel", "date": "June 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16860130, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 friendly staff, cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 no iron available in room; some rooms quite small"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "just spent 3 days at this lovely hotel very clean ,and fresh sheets and towels everyday.Lovely comfortable room.
