The staff were amazing! We got a courtesy upgrade when checking in. We were put in the Ali'i tower. We had our own private pool and bar. The lounge chairs were awesome, It is pricey, but we knew that and planned for it. The concierge at the Ali'i Marc was amazing. He helped us save tons of money on excursions! The beds are so comfortable. I do not recommend the Hotels Luau though. It was a waste of money. You need to go to the beach and have a real Luau. Hiltons is on top of a building. Food wasnt that great also. This hotel has wonderful restaurants all inside. We did find a great breakfast place across the street called Wialanies (sp) coffee house. Decent prices. Also, a greek restaurant right down the road was good too. It is about 1/2 mile from the downtown Waikiki area, but walking is not a problem. Its so beautiful it wont seem like any time at all.

We had a fabulous experience from start to finish. The front desk coudn't have been nicer. They upgraded us from a garden view room to an ocean view room on the 11th floor in the Diamond Tower. After reading some of the reviews, I was skeptical when they said they were upgrading us. I was expecting to stand on my lanai and lean way over to be able to see a glimpse of the ocean. When we got to our room, you could see the ocean right as we stepped in. We never once shut our curtains. The view was truly breathtaking. The room was nicely updated, and the beds were very comfy. No charge on the use of our safe, and there was a mini refrigerator to store plenty of water or leftovers. Room service was very kind to us, always careful to leave us a plethora of towels, clean every grain of sand from the carpet, and always smiling and saying hello whenever we passed each other. The room offered free Kona coffee (with Starbucks type cups instead of mugs, so I was able to leave my room with coffee in hand), plus we got free bottled water for being Hilton Honors members. Renting an umbrella and two lounge chairs cost us about $50 (to be expected anywhere you go.) Worth every penny because it felt like paradise in the shade. Plus it prevented the imminent sun burns. We tried the Atlantis submarine tour which departed off the Hilton dock. It was fun and interesting, but I think you're paying for the experience, not for the views. Not as much to see as I would have thought. Go see the King's Jubilee on Friday nights. Tickets are only $12 a person, but it comes with a free drink (yummy pina coladas, mai tais, or blue hawaiians), and you get a great view of the show. It lasts about an hour and has a fireworks show at the end. It doesn't even compare to the show at the Polynesian Cultural Center, but it's definitely fun entertainment. Make sure to utilize the coupon book that the front desk gives you when you check in. It offers a lot of free goodies! Like anywhere else you go on vacation, prices are going to be high in touristy areas. The Wailana Coffee House across the street from the Hilton is cheap, but it's like a Denny's. We got all our cheap snacks and great chocolate (Hawaiian Host) from the ABC store within the village. Most other restaurants were a bit of a walking distance. It took a full half hour at a very brisk pace to make it to dinner at Duke's at the Outrigger. Good way to walk off some of the pounds that you inevitably will gain while in Oahu.

What a perfect hotel. We stayed in Rainbow tower, Room 2500 (25 represents the 25th floor). I strongly encourage everyone to stay in the Rainbow Tower. I think it has the best views of all the towers. Rooms ending in 00 or 01 are the corner units facing the ocean. Any odd numbers are great rooms as well, as they face down Waiikiki towards Diamond head. The even rooms face towards downtown, but you still have a partial ocean view. The hotel made this trip. Waikiki is very, very busy beach and Hilton has the best location at the end of the beach. It gives you a very expansive portion of beach (we had plenty of room), unlike other hotels that have literally no, or less than 10 yards of beach. Plus, you can easily walk down to Dukes (overrated in my opinion) or the Royal Hawaaainn (you HAVE to go here for Mai Tai's...simply the best on the island). Also recomend HY's Steak house and Michel's at the colony surf for two of the best dinners i have had. Hy's was one of the best steak places I have been, and it had the best ceasar salad. Table side cooking is great for some items. Michel's is the perfect place to have a 6pm reservation, as you get the sunset. The hotel looks out on the ocean (other end of Waikkiki). Also recomend the hike up Diamond Head, the visit to Pearl Harbor, and a nice drive around the island and visit to the North Shore. We hit diamond head early a.m (7) and it was fine. You have to get to Pearl Harbor early (we got there around 645) to beat the busses which show up b/t 645 and 7. We were back to hotel by 945 and had the whole day. Should get a car so you can drive as you want - we put over 500 miles on it adn still were on the beach everyday. Its great to drive to dinner, and you are not at the mercy of the bus, especially diamond head, pearl harbor, etc... Worth a day trip around the island - spend some time on North Shore (Cholo's mexican was great for lunch) and spend some time at beaches on east/southeastern side of island.

That was the main reason I was prepared for what others considered surprising. We arrived Aug 31 2005 and stayed till Sept 5 2005. We were in the Tapa Tower on the 13th floor. 1st let me point out that I have never heard of a hotel in the U.S. having a 13th floor-and every time we got into the elevator and pressed our floor -people always had a comment. However, it was the beginning of a great trip-with no bad luck whatsoever! Our room was of average size and although we booked a village garden view room to save some money-we had a great view on all sides (to the right was a park w/a lot of greenery, front view of Honolulu city, to the left a lovely ocean view) definately more than we bargained for. Also, the Tapa tower in convienently located with the Tapa pool right downstairs, the Tapa bar next to it with nightly entertainment, and the beach not too far away. There were no funny or moldy smells, the AC worked fine, and the beds are the most amazingly comfortable I have ever slept on. The room was cleaned every day, we had plenty of towels, and the sheets are changed only if you put the sign on the bed letting the maids know you want the sheets changed. Definately go to the ABC store, (the one across from the hotel, around the corner from Wailana Coffee House is a little cheaper than the one in the village, but either one is fine) and buy your coffee/filters/tea/sodas/water/snacks/etc. It is indeed outrageous that the hotel would charge for in room coffee (and so much!) especially since you can get it at the ABC store and make it yourself with the in room coffee pot. Other tips: Wailana Coffee House across from hotel for breakfast (from 4.99 to 9.00) lunch and even dinner. Germaine's Luau-below average food, but great show. Book the Pearl Harbor/Circle Island tour thru E'noa Tours w/the American Express Tours/activities desk next to the check in counter with Kit or Julie. An all day tour but worth it! Pearl Harbor, and short stops at Dole Plantation, and a macadamia nut farm, and you see the entire island-great photo ops.

Something that sort of bothered us was that they charged for EVERYTHING, even the coffee for the coffee-maker in your room! Considering you pay over $400 per night for an oceanview suite, you would think they could at least throw in some coffee. Even cheap-o motels throw in coffee for free. All in all, for the money, you get a gorgeous hotel, with multitudes of pools and beach, and wonderful gardens, but you could probably do better to stay at a cheaper hotel near by and just walk through the gardens once in a while.

Also, I agree with some of the other reviews of Waikiki hotels about the \"nickel and diming\" that goes on. The Hilton Village does its fair share of this practice, and it's almost a joke. Also, our \"oceanfront\" view room was \"partial oceanfront\" at best.
