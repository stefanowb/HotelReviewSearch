I think TA accurately describes it and we chose it first and foremost for value and positive reviews. Frank was as friendly as ever and took time to explain where to go and what to see and we were really impressed with the spacious room- really clean and the bathroom wouldnt look out of place in a modern 4 star hotel. Frank and his wife have taken time to invest in decent bedding etc and this all shows. Rome is an incredibly noisy city and although it didn't bother us, the traffic noise outside was relentless... it literally went on all night and the windows/shutters blocked some of it but if you're a light sleeper perhaps opt for the back room. It would be nice if there were some coffee/tea making facilities in the room perhaps ... and a pastry or two in the morning but its basically just a small apartment so there are no real facilities to offer breakfast. My main (and only) criticism is the location; I just didn't like the area which is no fault of the B&B as this is why it's so reasonable..so of course it's to be expected I guess but I certainly would not have felt comfortable without my husband there as there were lots of strange people hanging around/homeless ppl/dirty streets etc- but perhaps this is just Rome! To get to the main tourist areas was 20 mins on bus/tube so not bad but I wouldn't stay here as a single female.", "title": "Very pleasant stay", "user": "BigBird27", "date": "October 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 143759204}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "My sister and I stayed two nights at Frank's House in early October 2012. It's everything a cute, quaint place should be! We had the bedroom with our own private bathroom that was just down the hall from our room. We never felt uncomfortable with that situation! We arrived and Frank eagerly greeted us. He knew our time in Rome would be quick as we were travelling south in just a few days. He gave us a map and told us everything we didn't want to miss and told us he was there to help if we needed him. He got us a great reservation at a local place where the food was impeccable. The room was perfect, perfect weather (we even slept with the window open the entire stay). The room was air conditioned but I don't think we ever needed it. There was plenty of room in our bedroom and the bed was comfortable. It's a safe area and close to their Metro system and a great gelato place named G. Fassi!
