If you're travelling through Mansfield and need a place to stay, stay here. The motor inn is not new, but it is clean, very neat and tidy. The shower is large, which I love, and the hot water is wonderful. There is a front door and a back door to your room, so you park at the back, unload your car, and you can go to the pool area through the front door. very pleasant. The pool is nicely shaded and private from the street. There is a BBQ, but with all the great cafes nearby in town, why bother? The motor inn is only 5 min walk from town. Toaster and kettle in the room, and a small sink in the room, all clean. The owner is very nice and friendly. Overall, a very pleasant place to hang your hat for a couple days or just driving through. Definitely will be back...
