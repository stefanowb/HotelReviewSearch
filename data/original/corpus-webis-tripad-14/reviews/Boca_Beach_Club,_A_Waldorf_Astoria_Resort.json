The Boca Resort & Beach Club is quite exclusive. It is a massive property with several buildings, including a beach resort which you can take a shuttle to and it is located on the beach off of Route A1A. The landscaping on the grounds is absolutely beautiful.We stayed for 4 nights in the Bunglows on the property, which was very quiet and serene. We were in a first floor room that had two double beds even though we asked for Queen beds. But the room was very clean and well kept and the furniture was very nice. The bathroom was also very clean and had an exception glass and marble shower. We would have preferred a one or two room suite because those rooms have full kitchens with stainless steel appliances. We asked for an upgrade upon check-in but were not allowed to have one since we were staying as guests of a Hilton hotel employee (Hilton owns the Waldorf properties) and while we were very disappointed about that because there were so many empty rooms during our stay since it was the off season, we got over it. We also requested a refrigerator upon check-in because they say that regular rooms in the bungalows do not have them, when we got to the room we were happy to find out that there already was a refrigerator. But watch out, they will charge you $100 for a refrigerator if they have to bring one for you. The biggest disappointment regarding the property was no ice machine. I realize it's exclusive but a lot of people like to have ice for drinks, etc. If you want ice you have to call room service for them to bring a bucket. We also ordered room services twice and each time they came back within an hour to get the tray. We weren't even done eating. I felt a bit rushed and wasn't happy about that. The pool at the bungalows was fabulous. It was mostly empty except for a few other people here and there. They even had a snack cart driving around the property that would stop by a few times a day. However, two canned sodas cost $9. Ouch. Because the property is so large they have shuttles that take you from one location to another but only to buildings on the property. If you leave the property in your own car, you must return through a gate and show your parking pass. Not a big deal but I thought the security was a bit tight, including a guard with a gun at the back gate closest to the bungalows. He was very nice though. I thoroughly enjoyed the stay at this property though leaving and returning was a bit of a hassle. It made me want to stay within the gates. There were very few people staying in the bungalows and it seemed there was a conference going on at the main building. We also ate in the Cathedral dining room for breakfast. which was excellent though it was $54 for two of us. We then took the shuttle to the Beach Resort which is also quite beautiful. They have three pools right on the beach but definitely more kids were there. We had 3 margaritas and an iced tea for $54. Same as breakfast. Ironically room service was cheaper each time. I would recommend this place for people that like to be waited on hand and foot. There seemed to be a ratio of 3 staff per every person or more. But bring lots of money, it's expensive. it's also for the people that don't care to leave the resort and do all of their shopping, dining, and playing right in the same place. There are several very nice exclusive restaurants in the main building, which is a beautiful place in itself. For me it seemed like I was under lock and key too much. I prefer to come and go as I please. But that doesn't take away from the beauty of this place. It is one of the best. One more thing. parking for the other locations costs per day. However, parking for the bungalows was free.", "title": "Exclusive Property - Under Lock and Key", "user": "ardmoreflyer", "date": "October 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 46779830}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel was clean and neat.

We found the staff to be warm, attentive and welcoming, I particularly appreciated service from the bellman on check-in who reminded me that tips were included in the resort as he wanted to make sure I intended to give an extra tip, Sarah, our waitress for breakfast and dinner, and the Restuarant manager. The overall ambiance reminded me of a high end European resort. We are coming back in the Winter and will try the Resort.

Best decision ever - the only tip I would give is to stay away everyone - it might make the place too crowded for the rest of us that already know about it :) One additional tip for out-of-towners - bring the gym clothes - the Beach Club gym is the best hotel gym I have ever seen.", "title": "Great beach resort, but billing issue left a negative last impression", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Worktravelgal", "date": "June 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 131219442}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Boca Raton"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 29, "average": 51, "very good": 112, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 329}, "aka": "Boca Beach Club, a Waldorf Astoria Hotel Boca Raton", "slim_ranking": 0.0769230769231, "description": "Immerse yourself in the elegantly restyled The Beach Club - a completely refurbished Boca Raton beach hotel, providing ideal access to the water.
