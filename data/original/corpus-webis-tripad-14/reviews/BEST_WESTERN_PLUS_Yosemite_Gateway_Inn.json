The check - in clerk actually took about $30 off the price of the room, to make it reasonably priced. I was psyched. This hotel is set up in a variety of buildings on the side of a mountain. The rooms were reasonably clean and there was plenty of parking. It looked like there were a lot of extras like a nice pool, exercise room and laundry facilities there, unfortunately we didn't have time to use any of them at all.
