What we were after was exactly what we got: A clean (but not amazing) room with everything we needed, a good breakfast, a quick jaunt to the beach (out the back door and across a wooden walkway, and you're there!), and a price that made it worthwhile. We got oodles of drink coupons when we arrived and used precisely zero of them, but that would have been a nice perk. The concierge was helpful pointing us to various area attractions, as we'd never been there before. All in all, we had no complaints about, well...anything. We were on the 4th floor, but not beach-view side, and there was no noise to speak of. Everything seemed in good shape - comfy beds, nice little balcony, neat bathroom. Again, we had no complaints at all and would not hesitate to return to La Copa if we hit South Padre again.
