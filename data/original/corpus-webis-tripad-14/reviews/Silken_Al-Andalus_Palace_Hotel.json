There is taxi rank outside the hotel and a bus stop round the corner with regular buses into the centre, you can walk but it was rather hot when we were there! 38c when we were going out at 9pm!! The breakfast at the hotel was also excellent, so much to choose from, something to suit all tastes and diets. I would definately stay here again, hopefully sooner rather than later.
