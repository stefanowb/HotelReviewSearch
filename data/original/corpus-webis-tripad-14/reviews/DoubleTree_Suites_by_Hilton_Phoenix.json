We enjoyed having the separate sleeping area from the living room area of the room. It allowed for one of us to either stay up late or get up early without disturbing the other one. The light rail is located a block away. The surrounding area felt safe when we made the walk early in the morning and late at night. The $20 weekly rail pass was perfect. (Kids and seniors are 1/2 price) We were able to go to the Phoenix Zoo, Botanical Garden (1 mile walk from zoo), Phoenix Convention center and downtown area, Heard Museum and a Target Super Store. The grounds of the hotel were kept well groomed of leaves. Looking out our front window was the top of orange trees and a courtyard view of the pool. The pool has a 3' area perfect for little kids which gradually increased to 8'. The hot tub made all the walking we did during the day a great escape in the late evening until 11 pm. The gym with free weights an exercise bike, treadmill and elliptical met my needs. The entire staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Ray who provide our transportation to and from the airport, the front desk staff who allowed us to check in a little early and stay a little past check out, and the breakfast wait staff. The hot breakfast had a large selection that never disappointed us. There was always an assortment of fresh cut up fruit, fruit to go, yogurt, steel cut oatmeal, eggs, a type of potato, toast and either waffles or pancakes. Orange juice, cranberry juice, milk and hot beverages were also available. The business center was just outside the buffet, which was perfect to check email briefly or print out an itinerary for the day before heading out. In order to prevent virus' you just can't use the USB. So plan on bringing extra SD cards as you will want to take a ton of pictures. The hotel is about 20 minutes from the Phoenix Convention Center, Chase Field, and the downtown area. Being on the light rail and not driving in traffic or having to park, made the trip seem like 5 minutes. I highly recommend the hotel for its location and service, and for its lower prices than the downtown hotels. The added benefit of breakfast and close proximity to the rail/buses makes it perfect.
