I had originally booked the Best Western Red Hills, but after having done some more research, decided to go with Parry Lodge to save some money. I had originally planned on only staying one night, but I ended up staying five due to all the things to see in the area. The rooms themselves are not spectacular, but clean and more than sufficient. The beds are a bit old and soft. But for $36/night with a AAA discount, it sure beat camping in the sub-freezing desert temperatures. The heater worked well at keeping us warm at night, although hot water seemed a bit limited. There seemed to be enough for one person, but in the middle of the second person's shower, it would start getting cold. The complimentary continental breakfast was also quite nice - they had a variety of cereals, milk, coffee, OJ, mini muffins, and english muffins, and jelly.

I phoned the lodge and they had a \"family\" room available, two connecting queen bedded rooms with kitchenette, for $92 plus tax. Rollaways could be provided for $6 extra. We rolled into town about 9 pm after a long day at Zion National Park. Friendly helpful front desk staff. We got to our room and yes, not the Fairmont, but just as described, with plenty of room for all, full sized fridge, sink, range, two TVs. The bathroom was small and the shower went hot and cold, but who's expecting great water pressure in an old hotel? The room wasn't spotless. Pool was nice and right next to our room. We did not try the breakfast buffet, so can't comment on that. We really liked being right in middle of Kanab - many choices for restaurants and shopping within walking distance. We watched the 8 pm movie in the Old Barn out back (free for lodge guests) - Thunderhead, Son of Flicka, which was filmed in the area. If you want a spotless, modern hotel, this place is not for you.

Lots of education about the area). The pool was very nice and open until 10 pm which was a nice way to end the day with lots of people who only come together once a year. The rooms with the stars names on them were really fun. The nostalgia factor was at a 10 and the movie barn added to it. In a town where most of it rolls up the sidewalks (so to speak) at 8 pm, it is nice to be able to just walk across from your room and catch a free movie that was filmed right around the corner. The buffet breakfast was good and plentiful. Here is what made this trip really special. The staff. Very friendly! While eating breakfast one morning my 3 year old son refused everything. Just as we were leaving he spotted the container of Fruit loops cereal. He asked for some but we were leaving. One of the staff overheard our exchange and ran to get a Ziploc bag and filled it up for us to take along with us. I was thrilled that he would make the effort.
