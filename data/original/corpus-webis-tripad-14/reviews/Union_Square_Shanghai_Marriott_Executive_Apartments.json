This apartment offers everything and in a luxurious fashion. Rooms are very intelligently done so as to provide the sense of airiness while accommodating all the necessary items for the stay. For the pure vegetarian, it is difficult in Shanghai and hence the completely furnished kitchen was a big big help. While the cost is on the higher side, it is worth it. Remember to carry washing powder and shampoo (hotel one does not suit me!) along with you as it will be difficult to find in the nearby 7x11 stores. Wifi was not available in the room until the last day of checkout. As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no restaurant in the hotel. But the Pudong road by the side of the hotel has lots of restaurants including McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut etc. Breakfast can be quite boring as there are the same varieties everyday.", "title": "Home away from home", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "whizkid420", "date": "August 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116235533}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Experience of this apartment was excellent and will be the choice for the next visit.", "title": "The perfect place to stay in Pudong", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dragev", "date": "July 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115951003}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here for three months (April - July).

It simply reflects the generally poor standard of the hotel management. One thing which they are very good at though is collecting money upfront on most things.
