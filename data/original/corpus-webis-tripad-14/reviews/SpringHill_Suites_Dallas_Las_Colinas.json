Suites were spacious for two or three, maybe with a few kids it would be okay - but four adults in one suite would be too close for comfort since the bedroom and living area are not really \"seperated\"; just by short walls or angles of the room. We were able to get three rather than two rooms no problem on the spot and we were all next to each other also.

First of all, let me tell you that this hotel has only been opened for 3 weeks and that's why it hasn't been rated as a top rated hotel yet, but in my opinion, it is on it's way for the top ratings. This hotel is immaculate and refreshing! Very clean. You smell the fresh paint when you walk in to check in. Check-in was a little slow. I waited 5 minutes for the front desk clerk because she was apparently away showing off the hotel to another customer. She was very apologetic and friendly when she arrived. We had a brand-new, never stayed-in before, room on the third floor and I couldn't have been happier. All the decor was marvelous, granite counter tops in bath and kitchen area, 2 separate closets, microwave. The room is very spacious. Because it was soooo nice and clean, we broke our hotel rules and walked on the floor barefeet, we sat on the comforters, used their towels and pillows and even sat on the sofa. We NEVER do these things in other hotels. As you can see, I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to where I lay my head. The beds were extremely comfortable with feather downs, fluffy pillows. The maid service was great...very friendly maids. The indoor pools is just picturious and nice. I could have laid out there all day. The fitness room is very nice. The complimentary breakfast buffet can stand room for improvement, as everyone was waiting to use the ONE waffle maker they have, but the food was pretty good. The location is easily accessible to Hwy 114. We've really enjoyed our stay at this hotel so much that we have already made reservation to go back in June. Overall, we were very pleased at Springhill Suites Las Colinas.

The worst mistake was giving OUR room and key to another customer. The people bursting into our room was very frightening. (The dead bolt on our door was broken and had not been fixed).

It offers a hot breakfast buffet and has a small lounge. The indoor pool and excercise room are very nice.
