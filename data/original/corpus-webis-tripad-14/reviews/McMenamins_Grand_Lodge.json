We have stayed her before and did not have these issues, so I'm hoping it's a one time issue. We checked in at 4PM on a Fri. night and it took about 20 min. Once we received keys we took a short walk to our room #115 very close to the lobby (which I suggest avoiding at all costs if you want sleep), they keys weren't activated so I brought them back to the desk where the activated them, we went back to the room and opened the door to find the room completely in dissaray...the mattresses were in plastic standing up on end, the bunk beds were moved over top of the sink. I again trekked to the lobby and asked if it was normal to have to put together our own bunk beds?? The lady helping me really didn't give an explanation and said she would get it fixed. I then had a manager about 15 min. later say he was sorry and offered to buy me a drink from the lounge..I let him know I was with my 12 year old. 40 min. later our room was ready and they offered for us to go in before it had washcloths and vacuuming done...I said we'll wait until it's completely ready. Once he was done I asked what time check in was at and the \"manager\" said 3pm and that they had just completely dropped the ball on this one and offered to take 10% off my bill which totals a whopping $4.50. While I was checking in I heard them tell another customer that they had upgraded them to a queen at the same price and he had a room similar to ours booked. Needless to say the trip didn't get better, our food was delivered cold in the restaurant, my Spanish coffee was terrible, they were out of cherries for my daughter's Shirley Temple. When we went to the soaking pool there were tons of glasses and pitchers laying around the outside of the pool. I'm not sure when the last time a staff had been out there to clean up. Our room was right off the main entrance and extremely noisy all night long. I have stayed at several McMenamin properties and usually always have a great experience....but this one was nothing close to a good experience. When I checked out the next morning I purchased a McMenamins passport and gift card for a friend and mentioned it was a gift but asked if I could get a stamp for that property and the lady helping me said she couldn't do that if it was a gift. She was the same one that had known about my check-in experience on the prior day.

Their hotel staff is very accommodating and their rooms are always clean and comfortable. This last month (September) my husband and I stayed here in their King Suite and it was by far the best room at this location. It has a VERY large bedroom with a king size bed, full length mirror and beautiful artwork and furniture. It also has a separate living room the size of a queen room with a fireplace that comes with wood and firestarter. The only improvement I would make on this room would be the bathroom itself. It is ugly and does not match the rest of the room. It totally looks cheap and like an after thought.

The service is always good as well. There is a lady that runs the bar outside of the main hotel and she does a great job as does the guy that is in his late 20's early 30's. However, they have a very young guy that was working there last time we were there for a wedding and he seemed extremely overwhelmed with serving drinks to about 8 of us inside (but not all at once). His young girlfriend was hanging out at the end of the bar looking pouty like she wanted him to be off shift. We sat for about 20 minutes before we finally were able to get our drink (draft beer and a shot of tequila) poured and then he proceeded to tell us that he was going to close. There was another wedding party separate from ours (about 20 people) out at the fire pits outside who were still actively visiting and it was only about 1 a.m. Most bars do not stop serving in Oregon that early and for this particular bar that is REALLY early considering that we stayed the night before as well and the lady manager with the other male worker were open quite late due to all of the wedding parties still ordering. This was quite disappointing.", "title": "Very basic room in historic (old) building", "user": "Mary J", "date": "October 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 180653068}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Upon entering the main hotel we did complain to the front desk guy who said that he would mention it. Not sure if that was ever talked about to the manager or not. However, both wedding parties were very upset and all had noticed that this young man simply wanted to get off work because his young girlfriend was tired of waiting for his shift to end. This was the first time I had ever seen this type of behavior at a McMenamins and I certainly hope it is the last time since most of us stay at the hotel simply because we can safely drink, enjoy the atmosphere, and not have to drive at the end of the night. Many people ended up driving that night after having a couple of drinks to a local bar down the street apparently and to me that is unacceptable.", "title": "the good, the bad and the ugly", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Heidi K", "date": "August 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 174574996}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Forest Grove"}, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 21, "very good": 36, "terrible": 13, "excellent": 22}, "aka": "Mcmenamins Grand Hotel Forest Grove", "slim_ranking": 0.75, "description": "Make a grand escape to McMenamins Grand Lodge!
