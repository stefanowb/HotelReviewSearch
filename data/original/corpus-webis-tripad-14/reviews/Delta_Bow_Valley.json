The conference had suggested the Hyatt Regency and Hotel Arts, however the Hyatt was too expensive and the Hotel Arts did not receive the greatest reviews. So I booked a stay with the Delta Bow Valley based on reviews on TA. Overall, my two nights at the Delta was very pleasant. Quick check in. Rooms were spacious and modern. The beds were very comfortable. Lots of counterspace in the bathroom and a nice shower head. Location was ideal, just a couple of blocks away from the c-train. Walking distance to 17th avenue where there are plenty of restaurants and some shopping. Underground parking charge is expensive but the norm for Calgary. I would stay here again. It would be great if they could get a starbucks at the bottom of the hotel and they should look into getting wireless internet access in the room!", "title": "We liked the location and the staff was friendly", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NZBrad", "date": "April 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 60535903}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We were in Calgary for a concert at the saddledome and wanted something close for accomodation.

We went past the hotel and as we know the chain we thought that it would be to an acceptable standard. The hotel has a nice lobby bar and the room was a pretty standard room. For the money I would think it was slightly overpriced but then we paid the rack rate and then with parking on-top it was not the cheapest.
