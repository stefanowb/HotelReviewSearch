We stayed on a package deal from offpeakluxury.com, which included dinner and breakfast. Our room was in the annexe, not the main house, and was very big (approx. 18' x 16') with a small hallway and large bathroom. It was very comfortable, with Freeview TV, armchairs and various bits of furniture, but clearly lacked a recent refurb - with rather stained upholstery, worn/grubby carpet in the bathroom. Also the bed was two twins pushed together, leaving an annoying ridge in the middle. The mattresses were pretty firm and not particularly comfortable. The room was very quiet and, with windows on 3 sides, looked out onto some of the well tended gardens which emphasized the country feel.", "title": "Grand country house hotel with excellent food and service but rooms a little scruffy.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jimbob72", "date": "April 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 27894480}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009", "text": "Hintlesham Hall is heavily used for weddings and other events, but it was curiously quiet during our stay (Easter weekend).

Dinner and breakfast is served in the main hall - a very grand room with a stratospheric ceiling, huge chandelier and vast oil paintings. The uneven flagstone floor leading to the hall could well be from the original house, built in the mid 15th century. The food was mostly superb and service exemplary, if occasionally a little overbearing. One minor gripe would be the eagerness of staff to hurry you into the restaurant while enjoying a pre-dinner drink. Menus would appear within minutes of sitting down in the bar and then, without much time to peruse the choices, your orders were requested. We had to keep requesting more time, despite our table being reserved for later. Breakfast is less good than dinner - the full English has clearly been sitting around for a while, waiting to be plated - but is generous and extremely filling. The wine list is fairly extensive and not too expensive (from \u00a325 upwards) considering the choice. We had excellent wines each evening - once on recommendation from the head waiter.", "title": "A Super Seventy", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "keith_f_davies", "date": "January 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23971318, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The quality of the service", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The fitness centre is very good and free to use for all hotel guests - a well equipped gym, aerobics room with punch bag and weights, a heated outdoor swimming pool and masseurs available (at extra cost).", "title": "Once again Fantastic", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "GavT", "date": "December 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 22637066, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Right next door is the Hintlesham Hall Golf Club - a 'championship course' of approx 6,500 yards.

We also had lunch which wasn't included and i found it reasonably priced and enjoyable. The hotel rooms/ corridors might be a bit \"tired\" but there is nothing wrong with them and they are really big (i saw two rooms). The dining/ lounge areas are gorgeous from an \"old English house\" perspective. Staff were helpful and friendly.
