We were at first disappointed that we couldn't get hotel reservations within Yosemite Village, but after traveling there and seeing how busy it is, were very happy that we chose The Blackberry Inn. While approximately 45 mins. drive from inner Yosemite, the Inn was a great choice. Steve and Alex, the innkeepers, were wonderful hosts - welcoming, helpful, but not intrusive. Very informative about the area, they steered us in the right directions. The rooms were comfortable and spotless. Steve's breakfasts were delicious, and Alex's packed lunches just the thing for a hike in the Park, which takes you many miles from restaurants or markets. We also met very interesting folks at the breakfast table -- amazing how many were from England! (Hi, Claire and Ollie!). Thanks, Steve and Alex, for a great inn experience.

I have found a marvelous place that I would like to be my place whenever I want to escape into the Sierra. But, writing this, I know that it will be harder to get a reservation. Nevertheless, I need to write my first hotel review. This place is heaven. The rooms are perfect in all ways. The location cannot be beat - only 13 miles from the entrance to Yosemite. Wildlife wander around the place and if one needs a day away from the crowds of Yosemite, you can pull up a comfortable rocking chair on the large wrap around porch and watch the deer and hummingbirds and listen to the wind in the trees. The innkeepers Steve and Alex are part of the charm of the place.
