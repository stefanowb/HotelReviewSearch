We enjoy the Domain area, so we decided to visit this hotel in order to see if it is where we would like to stay. So we walk up to the desk and we are the only ones there. After a brief wait, we actually had to ask her if she could help us. She said she waould get to us in a minute. So right off the bat we were wondering about the service, but we let it go. When we were finally helped, we asked if we could see a room so that we could decide if we wanted to stay here on our honeymoon night. She called a guy to show us a room, and it wasn't anything spectacular, but the hotel seemed nice enough and we wanted to eat in the domain, so we went ahead and booked a room. So fast forward to the night of our stay, we arrive in a tux and wedding gown, and the valet didn't offer to help us, or to help us with our luggage, we had to actually go park our car ourselves, and walk in carrying the luggage, right passed the valet who, once again, did not acknowledge us. We approached the check-in desk, and stood there - you guessed it - after a brief time of the girl moving from monitor to monitor without acknowledging us, we asked her if she could help us. Of course, it was going to be a minute. Apparently whatever these girls do, checking people in is not their first priority. So once we get checked in, she doesn't ask us if we need help with our bags, she tells us about what apparently is a selling point on the room, which was a floor to ceiing window. Hold the excitement - I will get to that in a bit. So we lug our luggage to our room - btw, pet and mildew smells - yep. They need to rethink their pet policy. Anyways, we get in to the room and it was just like we had seen on our previous visit. Really nothing special, i could doctor some photos up for you, but really, any La Quinta ar Holiday Inn Express room looks the same, save the floor to ceiling window. So the first thing we want to do is email our family and let them know we made it ... blah blah ... but we then find out that the internet is not free! The Westin - Domain - proclaimed stylish - hip - great customer service advertised - floor to ceiling windows - but you have to pay to use the internet - an additional $15 a day. So no internet for us because we are already being gouched for the price of these windows. So we requested a room with a view. Well, come to find out, the only views these rooms have is either of a power plant or of the parking lot facing the west sun, which in Texas is over 100 degrees in the afternoon. So there we are staring at our parked car from our hotel room with the sun pouring in. Let's close this nifty sunscreen visor they have conveniently on the window ... close close ... eerk - it stops about 3/4 of the way down. Apparently the visor is not made for the much anticipated floor to ceiling windows. So we still have sun pouring through the lower 1/4 of the window. So we decide to close the heavy curtain, which just made it dark in the room. So much for the windows and the view. So it is late in the day and we want to take a bath... no bath... shower and realx from the long day. Well, save your towels, because one of them is going on the floor because the shower doors leave about a 1/8\" gap all the war around them and the shower leaks all over the floor. After my 10 minute shower i had to get out bec my towel could not hold more water. Also, the bathroom door is so wide, that when you open it up you can barely close it unless you step up in the shower or on the sink and I am not a fat guy - ridiculous planning. Refrigerator is actually a cooler, so it is basically useless. We wanted to get a soda out of the vening machine - $2.50 for a can - they must think a lot of their cans. The machine would not accept our perfectly flat dollar. A staff person was walking by - maybe a cleaning person - and we were obviously having problems with the machine, but she did not offer to help. We never did get the soda, which is fine bec we save what was going to be $5.00 for two cans. So how about that wonderful quiet room ... well, the door to the rooms is very heavy and slams shut behing you ... which is fine for us, but we could hear when anybody within a four room radius was leaving their rooms as well. The ac/heater unit tries to keep the room at a steady temp, so it would click on for 20 sec, then click off for 40 sec, on for 20, you get the idea - all night long. There was no option to turn just the fan on in order to cover up some of the noise it made when it went on and off. When we were checking out we had immediatley remembered that we had left a shirt on the back of the door, so we immediatley asked the girl if we could run up and get it. Well, since we had technically handed her our keys, she would have to send somebody up there without us to retrieve our item. Good thing we knew where it was ... guess she though we might steal one of their Starbucks coffee packets or something. So my wife fills out a survey on this place and gets contacted from a guy the next day. Instead of being apologetic of any of these things, everything he said was in defense of their crappy service. So we were starting to get annoyed further from this place and now this call (will the hotel memory ever die?!) and he offers us a free night, here at this hotel. We laughed and told him he could keep his free night. We didn't need the aggravation. He eneded up refunding us half the price of our hotel room. My recommendation, seriously, if you like this place, then you don't get out much. This is Austin and there a lot more hotel choices for you to choose from. This place was not worth half of what they charged us. The restaurant? I don't know, didnt eat there .. the bed? Yeah it was soft, but shouldn't it be? But what about the golf cart that drove you to the shopping .. are you serious? The shopping is a block away ... and I only saw one golf cart, so either walk a block or stand on the treeless parking lot in the sun and wait your turn. Ugh. Who needs that. No express checkout. This hotel tries to grab you with its location and plush lobby, but enjoy that part of it because it only goes downhill from there.", "title": "Total disappointment ; the good thing is we don't have to ever come back", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "carnold2", "date": "September 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 78128537}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary on 8/20/10 following some partying in Austin and because it's a new Westin and a very quite area.
