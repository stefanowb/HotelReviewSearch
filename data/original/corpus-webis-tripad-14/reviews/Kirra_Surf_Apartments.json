The room was clean and new and more than enough space to accommodate our group. Everything was there, air-conditioning, comfortable beds, fully fitted out kitchen, laundry, secure underground parking, pool area & BBQ, big screen TV, great view, and with security access for the access and lifts for peace of mind. The location is perfect with a coffee shop/restaurant in the basement and central to the main road. We specifically stayed here to get away from the Gold Coast/Coolangatta areas. It's quiet here and right opposite a patrolled beach. When we ate we either went downstairs or into nearby Coolangatta or up to the Gold Coast for a trip. It's a little further away to the Theme Parks and Surfers Paradise than the more popular locations, which is why we picked it, but it's straight onto the motorway to get there. I though we would get a little noise from the airport but I was surprised that other than the odd flight when the wind changed, we weren't really bothered. Actually, the only criticism is that the spa on the top deck isn't heated, if it was we would still be there !", "title": "Outstanding", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MBarr", "date": "May 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161338340}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My husband and our parents stayed in one of the penthouses recently and had an absolutely wonderful stay.

My bed was a bit soft for me, but that's probably just me. The 2nd bathroom was tiny - make sure you are nice to whomever is in the big room. Free Austar with movie channels and DVD/CD player - we couldn't find an Ipod dock for those to whom that is important. We hardly saw reception - we were so comfortable with where we were we didn't ask for much. Any check in requests were easily accommodated. Only a few picky cleaning issues - the glass balustrades and sliding doors were a bit grimy as was the outdoor table - although keeping them clean would be very difficult, but it did cut down on the view.
