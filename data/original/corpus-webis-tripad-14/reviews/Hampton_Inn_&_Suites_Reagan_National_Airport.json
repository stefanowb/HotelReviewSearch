It is only a few minutes away from the metro and a few stops away from all of the tourist attractions in Washington.

We had a fifth floor room away from the elevators. It was very quiet. You could not hear other guests or any traffic below.The room was a good size for just the two of us and the bathroom was medium sized. It had a hairdryer and had the personal necessities (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, etc.) It had a pool which we did not use because we were running around sightseeing every day. The area is very nice. It is situated among other hotels and high rise apartment buildings.

We chose it based on the good reviews and proximity to the Metro for visiting the sites in DC. The hotel was clean and comfortable. We had a room on the 7th floor facing Eads St.. This hotel is in a busy area so traffic noise can be heard. The Crystal City Metro stop is a short walk as are restaurants and shops. We did use the parking garage but once we parked the car we didn't touch it until we left. The garage was adequate, kind of small spaces, and a bargain at $12.00 a night. The room had a microwave and refrigerator. The only complaint was the small breakfast area. The first morning (Monday) was extremely crowded and the server was having a hard time keeping up. The breakfast was nothing special. The usual cereals, muffins, breads, fruit and yogurts. A couple of hot items such as sausages and egg patties. One morning was french toast sticks. The front desk staff was friendly and made a couple of good restaurant suggestions withing walking distance. Jaleo, a Spanish tapas restaurant that had a happy hour with reduced prices on drinks and tapas and Pizzaiola, a pizza and Italian food casual restaurant. The first night we stumbled upon Ted's Montana Grill. Big mistake. The worst meal of our trip. Very greasy steak, mushy green beans, and expensive for the poor quality.", "user": "KLGB", "date": "November 13, 2009", "id": 49134262}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "BEST HOTEL IN THE ENTIRE D.C.

We got exactly what we asked for when we reserved: a quiet room on a high floor -- we were at the back of the hotel, not overlooking the busy Jefferson Davis Highway, and far from the elevator. The room wasn't enormous, but was spacious enough, and it was nice to have a bathroom with a bit of space to it. We had to ask three times to have feather pillows switched out with foam -- allergies -- we made the third request after housekeeping staff had left for the day, and the desk staff did what they could to find us one foam pillow, and two more came the next morning. Other requests were handled quickly and efficiently. The breakfast buffet, included with the room fee, was an excellent deal: a wide selection of foods of all kinds available from 6 until 10 a.m. The hotel is also nicely located: a two-block walk to the Crystal City metro station which goes directly into DC on both the Blue and Yellow lines, and one stop from the Reagan National Airport.

Although the purpose of our trip was, sadly, to bury my uncle, a retired Colonel in the USAF at Arlington National Cemetery, we found comfort and hospitality with the Hampton Inn. We wanted a hotel that could accomodate all of our extended family and found this to be THE PERFECT hotel. Located only 5 miles from Ronald Reagan Airport, the hotel had a free shuttle pick us up from the airport and drive us to the hotel. Once there, we were greated with warm smiles and even warmer cookies! Our rooms were spotless with bedding as requested and free wireless internet. The breakfast each morning offered a varying hot main dish--scrambled eggs, cheese omelets, french toast strips, etc along with standards such as yogurt, cereals, muffins, donuts, fruit and breads. Not only was this an excellent location for our sad reason for the trip but it was excellent for sightseeing around DC. Only a short walk from the Metro station, with complimentary shuttle service to the entrance of the Metro, if requested, it was super convenient for stops along the mall to see all the monuments and Smithsonian museums. The exercise room was always in use, although not by us! The pool was indoors and there was plenty of sitting room for the family to gather. The staff was very helpful in accomodating our family and even made certain cookies on request! The location was near great shopping and fantastic restaurants.
