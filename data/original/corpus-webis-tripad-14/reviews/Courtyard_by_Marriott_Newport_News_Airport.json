The lobby area is very nice, and it has a nice snack bar that also serves alcohol. The happy hour prices are very good, but some of the food items are a bit pricey, eg, the $11 chicken ceasar salad. The only small glitch we had was that housekeeping only left one wash cloth after cleaning the room. The front desk promised to bring more cloths, but never did so.

Check in was pleasant. The smiling desk attendant was kind as were any other staff we encountered at the hotel. So that is a plus. Upon entering the room, the first thing I do (and I recommend this to everyone) is check the bed for bed bugs because of the hysteria in the media. I did this and found that there were no bugs, but I did notice a distinct red blotch, fingernail sized, on both the top (flat sheet) and the bottom fitted sheet as well. My wife said it looked like blood, like someone might have had a slight cut or something. I asked if it could be lipstick but we both came to the conclusion that it was blood. So we called downstairs and asked for a linens change. The desk attendant apologized and sent up someone to change the linens out. This was done swiftly and professionally. And when we went downstairs later, the desk attendant (who might have also been the manager?) asked if the problem was resolved. I told him that it was. I am a very easy going guy and am not a finger pointer or anything, so I was pleased with how they handled the situation. But I would recommend that anyone who stays here request a linen change upon arrival. The reason is that there is a chance that the day room cleaners might be taking a few shortcuts. You might find that the sheets are not crisp and have a distinct \"slept in\" look. Or you might find that the rug looks like it wasn't vacuumed because it didn't look that bad, etc... This is more a management issue than anything, as in most Marriotts you will find that there is a feel of greater supervision over the housekeeping staff. It is admirable that they are willing to react in a professional manner to room problems, but why not focus on making sure that no room problems are present to begin with. So get on the ball and check behind your staff manager! So in conclusion: nice hotel, with very friendly staff, but rooms are a bit hit or miss with cleanliness.

The room was even better than the lobby, which is saying a lot! I absolutely loved the decor. Everything in the room was of high quality and very functional. I do have one issue with the bathroom however. I think this has more to do with the cleaning people than the hotel itself. The shower had signs of hard water buildup and maybe mildew in the grout. The bathroom is the most important room in a hotel to keep clean. It can really make or break the experience. The shower is large with bench seating and looks to be very newly renovated. Such a shame it hadn't been cleaned properly! The bed was the cherry on top of my experience. I hadn't slept that well away from home in maybe a year I think.

The bathroom was really cool. No old outdated bathtub with slow drainage here. This bathroom has a glass enclosed shower that could actually fit two people (although there's only one shower head). I found a more than ample supply of towels and washcloths, that looked nice, but were on the thin side.
