The rooms have recently been re-decorated, but this is a budget hotel so its not exactly modern taste however, it was clean. The cleaner came in every day, changed the towels and cleaned the room. All staff were very friendly. This hotel is in an excellent location for Universal Studios, Interstate 4 and all shopping malls. Very easy access from Sanford and Orlando international airport. We were purely in orlando for shopping prior to christmas and wanted to make the trip as cheap as possible. I was happy with our stay for the money we paid. If you are expecting 5 star accomodation - Do not book this hotel as you will be disappointed and will leave bad reviews.. if you just want a base for the end of a hard day thats basic and clean and cheap with it - then this is perfect!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 26, 2005", "id": 4301125}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Stay off the Kirkman Road side", "text": "The hotel was decent. I only paid $45 per night for the room so my expectations weren't too high. The problem I had was the room location in the facility. My room was on the 4th floor overlooking a Chevron station and Kirkman Road at the intersection of International Drive. Friday and Saturday night the parking lot of the Chevron station was used as a gathering place for people blasting music into the early morning. The stop light at Kirkman Road and International Drive was a staging light for motorcycle racing that created an immense amount of noise as the engines of the bikes were approaching 10,000 RPM. At 1:30 AM I couldn't take it anymore. I called the desk and ask them to get me a different room. Luckily they did have a room on the inside of the facility on the first floor near the pool.
