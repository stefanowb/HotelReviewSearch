We pulled up to this lovely bed and breakfast and were immediately taken in by the charm of the grounds and home. We also stayed in the Cote Parc, which gave us the feeling of being tucked away in an old castle. The home has been lovingly restored - my favorite was the old tower staircase - and is impeccably kept.", "title": "Wonderful hosts, beautiful home!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DodieSoCal", "date": "October 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 21428970, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything", "disliked": "\u2014 There was nothing not to like"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Our hosts could not have been warmer and friendlier.
