The marriott was very nice with freindly employees. After checking out of our other hotel at 10am the Marriott was happy to give us an early check in so we could start our vacation. My only real suggestion is if they are offering the all-inclusive option online I would go with that. We didn't book it, wasn't available the morning of, but would have saved a bunch of money if it would have.

During my stay, I ran into a few minor problems and needed assistance from the staff. They were all pleasant, but did not go the extra mile and were not proactive. I got the impression that they didn't really care and just wanted me to go away. Receiving mediocre service during travel complications is extremely frustrating. Also, I do not own a laptop and was unpleasantly surprised to find that the hotel does not offer free Internet computers. They have a small business center that does not operate 24-hours a day and charges over 5$ per 10-minute session. Other hotels in the area offer free, 24-hour Internet access. Dining options were also a let down at Casamagna. On my first night, I arrived late and ended up spending over 30USD for an unmemorable sandwich, soft drink, and small dessert from room service. I like having ice in the room and got really tired of having to walk to the bar every day because the ice machine was out of order for the entire week. Before leaving I needed help contacting a taxi service to get to the airport, so I approached the concierge. After a huge hassle and many failed calls, I asked the staff if the hotel offers transfers. It was frustrating to find out that they do offer them and they could have saved me a huge hassle by just mentioning this in the first place. Again, the service at this property is sub par and bordered on passive aggressive.

We were not so fortunate on the trip over and were soaking wet, freezing, and semi- seasick watching others who were VERY seasick, while we could hear the folks upstairs having a good time- dancing, drinking, sunbathing, etc. The snorkeling was not that great in comparison to other places that we have been, but Isla Mujeres was fun and once we made sure to get a seat up top on the way back, the boatride & crew was much more enjoyable. We also did an excursion to Chichen Itza, though did not book it through the hotel and were quite glad.
