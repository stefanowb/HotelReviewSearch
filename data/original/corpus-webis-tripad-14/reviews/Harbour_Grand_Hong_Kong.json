It was nice to go outside and not be pestered with people trying to sell you watches and make you clothes as we were on other holidays here.

An upgrade to a room on one of the Club Floors (which included complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea etc in the Harbour Club Lounge) was offered on check-in.

On reflection this would probably have been a good deal as the daily upgrade charge was only a few HK dollars more than the cost of breakfast for 2 in the Harbour Grand Cafe.

Beds and pillows are very comfortable and bedding is also high quality - best nights sleep for ages for both of us. The glass wall between the bathroom and the bedroom was a bit unusual but there is an electrically operated blind for privacy if you're sharing. The bathroom was dominated by a large circular bathtub which was lovely for relaxing in after a hard day's shopping/sightseeing. However it is a little difficult to get in and out of due to the position of the sliding glass door and the basin and toilet are a little short on space around them.

The property is spanking new having been around for only a year or so. Though compared to some its competitors (Excelsior, Marriot etc) perhaps the location is not ideal, that is it is not smack bang in the centre of causeway bay, however it is located barely a 5 minute walk away from the Fortress MRT & the bus stop from where it takes max another 5 to 7 minutes to get to the main commercial streets/buildings, be it Central or Times Square etc. Taxis are also easily available, plus the whole public transport system in Hong Kong is so good that the location is hardly a bother. Plus being perhaps on a less crowded street/area is the reason why the Lobby & the size of the rooms & other common areas is on an average far bigger than any other Hotel in Hong Kong. Plus each & every room offers a great view of the Hong Kong Harbor, though I would recommend one goes for an upgrade & books on the club floors (Floors 35 to 40) for the best views. Plus the club lounge facility over all is great value & as are again the views from the club lounge on the 41st floor. The rooms are well furnished though perhaps it caters to the more bling taste of the new rich from Mainland China hence there is an overwhelming sense of faux luxury & gold platting every where. I mean a T.V. in the bathroom to my mind was a bit too much. That apart the hotel also offer a pillow menu. Breakfast selection is good though not great. The 3 days we ate there the buffet menu didnt change though there is a vast number of dishes to choose from including a veg Indian section. Now the not so great part, Service, this is a bit patchy. All the staff seem keen to help, however they are not consistent & dont seem to be experienced enough in the service industry. The conceirge for instance depending on who was manning the booth ranged from good to average on days. Moreover there was a mix up with regards to our room rate, & the folks at the front office on day one where not sure if our rate included breakfast in it or not & it took a mail/call from our travel desk to sort it out. Over all though these are minor niggling issues & would recommned this place to anyone wanting to experience a quick five star holiday . To my mind if one gets a standard room here for around the 900 Hong Kong Dollar mark breakfast included, one should go for it. Added advantage the A11 bus from the airport drops you just two minutes off the hotel in 50 minutes flat. P.S.
