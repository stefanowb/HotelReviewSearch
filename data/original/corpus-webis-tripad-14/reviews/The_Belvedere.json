Luckily they didn't notice the smell in their room. When they got to their door the swipe keys wouldn't work so they had to go back to the front desk to get them reset. Instead of apologizing, they said \"Well they should have worked!\" The second day they asked to be moved to a king room so they were moved to the 17th floor. Again their keys didn't work. We were on the 16th floor - our room was nice enough but had an odd layout. There was a long hallway upon entering the room. The bathroom was tiny - the toilet was literally 2 inches from the wall. That was great advice that someone gave about using the service elevators at the end of the hall - they were so much faster. I noticed that when the elevator stopped on the 15th floor, it looked like that floor had been recently remodeled. It had dark wood doors and more updated carpet but I didn't get to see a room. We heard that there might be a taxi strike the day we left so we asked the concierge to book a limo to take us to the airport. It was half an hour late!

Please note that the website photos do not match the actual rooms you will be receiving when you check in, unless you have asked for a \"completely renovated room\" which will cost substantially more than the advertised prices. The room you will receive, as did my wife and I, and all of the other convention participants who booked here with us, will be classified as a \"partially renovated\" room by the staff. This means that it will be dirty, with stained carpeting in need of stretching ( a definite tripping hazard), peeling wallpaper, mildew and mold on almost all bathroom surfaces, no view (ours was of a tenement building across the alley), and the overwhelming pungent smell of industrial strength room freshener which will permeate all of your clothes and your luggage. When we were there we attempted to complain about our room, but the staff, who was obviously used to dissatisfied customers, refused to re-assign a different room to us, and did not even come upstairs to inspect the room after we made our complaints known. The front desk manager, Julio, was the rudest manager we have ever encountered, unwilling to act on any of our complaints or the multiple complaints of other guests with similar problems. The other front desk staff quietly apologized to us when Julio abruptly removed himself from the situation to take an \"important phone call\"--the front desk staff seemed overwhelmed with the continous stream of complaining guests. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel in the United States. The room furniture was broken, scratched and looked as if it were purchased from the Salvation Army resale shop. The air conditioners were small dirty units which did not operate properly unless you tied back the rubberized curtain to enable airflow. The vents of the air conditioner were filthy, with dirt and dust overflowing the filter area onto the front control panel. The \"kitchenette\" featured prominently on their website was nothing more than a corner of a long, dark hallway with a dirty dormitory refrigerator and a cheap microwave oven perched on a flimsy countertop. The elevators were not functioning for half of our four day stay, forcing us to share the service elevator with the staff; we were stuck in one of the elevator for several minutes when it suddenly stopped. If you are able to change your reservations and stay elsewhere, definitely do!

Like most people I booked it based on the reviews on trip advisor. It was fantastic. The rooms are lovely and very comfortable (personally I liked the firm bed!). Yes the bathroom is smallish but what do you want to do in it!!. The coffee maker and microwave were a real bonus. It is lovely to be able to have a nice cup of coffee either in the morning or when you come back in the evening. We were always left two or three sachets of coffee. Despite intending to make use of microwave due to the enormous variety of eateries in the locality we didn't!! The staff are efficient and helpful. I changed a travellers cheque every morning no problem (I think we were there at a very good time of the year. The hotel was busy but not overly so). We had no problem with the lifts but as we were only on the eight floor we used the stairs when going out and the lift when we came in. The hairdryer wasn't working and within five minutes of a phonecall to reception a new one was delivered. The location of this hotel is superb with Times Square only a couple of blocks away and theatres and restaurants within walking distance. We went to see The Phantom of the Opera which was marvellous. We got the tickets at the ticket booth in Times Square for 50 dollars each. It's worth going to for the special effects alone. Use the subway. It's the only way to get around. It is 2 dollars for any journey and there are different tickets you can get for a certain amount of days. We got a weekly ticket that costs twenty one dollars (per person) and used it all the time. If you are going to be there on a Sunday try and fit in a trip to Harlem. There are many you can book and it is a great experience. We spent a full day in Central Park and it is really lovely to walk around it. It's an oasis in the middle of the city. A visit to the Metropolitan Museum is another good day out but it can be very busy and it's not easy to get a coffee or whatever in it so be sure to bring water with you. The area around Pier 17 is very nice with lovely shops and restaurants. It is also close to Battery Park where the ferries to Liberty and Ellis Island leave from. We spent another day there and it was a wonderful experience. Anyway, back to the hotel. I can highly recommend it and it is excellent value for money. You couldn't be any closer to Times Square, Broadway etc. Yes there can be noise at night from the fire station at the top of the road but who does'nt hear noise from fire engines and police cars at night if they live in any city? When in New York go with the flow. The pace of life is mad and everyone seems to be running around the place but you'll be on your holidays and don't have to run with them! Try and let people know that you are on holidays. There are so many different nationalities living in New York the people in shops, restaurants and bars do not know automatically that you're a tourist. We generally found most people very friendly - talk to them and they'll talk back to you. New York is full of people looking at maps and it's the same on the subway. We found that on a number of occasions strangers stopped and asked if they could help us and this also happened on the subway.
