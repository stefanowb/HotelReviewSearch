I have stayed at various Tune Hotels in Asia and this location boasts the unfriendliest staff. I would recommend booking as far in advance as possible to get the cheapest room rate. This last visit, I had to book the day before and ended up paying close to $70 CAD - a far cry from what it's actually worth and it stung since I have paid as little as $8/night from booking in advance (Tune Hotel Kota Kinabalu). Overall, it's fine for getting a bit of rest before your flight, but there's not much to do in the area, so you wouldn't want to stay here more than one night.", "user": "Starseed35", "date": "August 30, 2010", "id": 77429567}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "no frills but adequate", "text": "We stayed here for two nights, the first after our flight and the second after spending a day at Sunway lagoon. We found the accommodation to be as described in other reviews - small but adequate. The free internet access was a bonus. The location is great as is in walking/viewing distance from the airport and there are enough places to eat near by to get by. I would stay here again if stopping over.", "user": "AnnieFairlie", "date": "August 28, 2010", "id": 77278521}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "good location , but dirty hotel", "text": "The hotel is located very close to the airport - you can reach on foot or pay a ryggit for the bus. Room very small, cramped and dirty. For Internet, TV, air conditioning need to pay extra. Hotel staff very much respect the hour check in and check out. The hotel store, 7 Eleven,''so you can do cheap shopping. I recommend only to people waiting for the plane, because the hotel is not what to do. It is better to go to the heart of Kuala Lumpur.", "user": "poltramp", "date": "August 27, 2010", "id": 77157947}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect for its purpose", "text": "Mr. Tune: a genius!!! It's exactly what you want for a place to rest between flights or before early flights. Close to terminal, and you pass a multi-restaurant en route. Excellent bathroom, comfortable bed, aircon (essential to pay for this)with fan excellent. Small, of course: what more do you need? Use it if you are just setting your bags down and showering and sleeping; it makes no claim to be a home-away-from-home. No frills, of course: but it is perfectly comfortable. We slept well: ask for a room high up and on the side away from the road, or on the back side. Only problem would be the slammed doors; maybe the hotel could put a sign on the doors asking people to try to close them carefully. But people in Sheratons are often just as inconsiderate about doors and hallway conversations!", "user": "Traveller99ab", "date": "August 18, 2010", "id": 75719487}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "perfect for sleepeing one night", "text": "I've been for four diferent nigths this summer and the hotel is very near Low cost airpor, you can see it when you go out fromm the airportt. 5 minutes walking or 1R by van.

Good shower, firm beds, ok a/c etc. But rooms are tiny, not really cleaned well considering check out is early and check in late, so they should have enough time to clean. Our rooms had scuff marks from suitcases I would assume hitting the walls for lack of space, beddings did not feel too clean and the bathroom had cobwebs.
