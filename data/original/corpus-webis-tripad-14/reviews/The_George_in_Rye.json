Then we were told we had been upgraded to one of the suites so the day was just getting better. The room was super and the huge bath a real treat.

We don't usually stay over but an offer came up on Groupon for The George and it coincided with our trip for Scallop week (can thoroughly recommend this event every February) so we thought we'd give it a go. In all honesty, whenever we had walked past The George we had assumed it was just a pub, and occasionally we had seen a wedding party there so we'd never thought about staying there as we assumed it would be quite noisy and rowdy. As it turned out, we loved it! We stayed in a room that was not attached to the hotel and it was beautiful. It had the feel of a log cabin with a huge, very comfortable bed. The bathroom was lovely with a large, powerful shower. There was lovely fresh tea available in room (tea pigs!) and biscuits. The only downside for us was that the room was next to some gates and we were woken very early by the sound of deliveries being wheeled over the cobbles. Breakfast was fantastic - it's the only hotel menu I know that has boiled egg and soldiers (for adults!) on the menu. The quality of the food and drink was excellent and the options for the buffet section were very tasty - particularly the homemade yoghurt. Once we'd checked out, we sat in the small lounge area and read our books and had a peppermint tea which was really relaxing, and the staff were so welcoming and friendly.

Overall we were very disapointed and would not stay again. To be honest I was surprised by the positive feedback by others. Upon arrival there was a mistake in our booking. Despite requested rooms over 6 months previously and calling two times this week to ensure our requested rooms we were offered two rooms which were not up to standards i would expect for the money and which were far removed from each other despite requesting that we were put together. A mistake can happen anywhere but what I really found disappointing was the manner in which it was handled and I was made to feel a nuisance and that I was in the wrong (which I wasn't). The apology was not sincere and after much trawling up and down the steep stairs we eventually gave in and accepted rooms which I would say were adequate. The lady on reception also pulled faces behind my back which my mother happened to see which again I did not feel was particularly professional. In relation to the restaurant we booked this last night. I would say that this was fine but very expensive for what you got. The fillet steak was \u00a319 and only included chips. A side of meagre brocolli was \u00a33 extra. All in all I think they could do much better. Upon check out this morning the hotel manage was equally unfriendly and unapologetic and the lady we met yesterday. Will not be returning.
