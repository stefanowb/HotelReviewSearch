During our stay we decided that a stay in a hotel in the centre of Corsica would be a good way to end before catching the ferry in Bastia for Italy. After checking out a few guidebooks we decided that Jardins de la Glaciere sounded great. I gave them a call and the friendly and efficient member of staff told me that they could not give us a room for both the Saturday and Sunday nights as we had hoped. He did have a room available on the Sunday and this we booked, resigning ourselves to another night on the campsite.
