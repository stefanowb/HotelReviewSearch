We arrived by car, but the train would be easier if you were staying in Barcelona. We did not have a gps and were very tired, so we struggled finding the exact location for awhile. Paul was super flexible with our arrangements and sleeping situation as we had our two kids and gramma. He welcomed us around 1100am, Thijs fed us breakfast, and we took a siesta before going downtown. I think they receive more young travelers and couples, but they prepared a really quiet place for us to rest and sleep and we really appreciated that. The house is really perfect for their business and has ample room to spread out and take in the views. The atmosphere is totally relaxing as is their honor system for beer and wine. It was a refreshing way to start our vacation. I had to catch an early train to meet some friends back at the airport and Paul got up to make me coffee after I told him not to worry about it. He and Thijs are classy, quality people. They were not set up for credit payments when we left so he told us to pay via paypal after we returned to the state a week later. If I find myself in Barcelona again, I will definitely stay again to see my friends at No Worries!", "title": "Reliable, Courteous, and Easy Going", "user": "flyingscottsman", "date": "April 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 104489847}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "These guys really know how to take care of their guests and make everyone feel at home.
