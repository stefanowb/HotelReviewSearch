The location is excellent, as it is within walking distance of most of the downtown businesses. Also, the rooms are a nice size, with VERY comfortable beds. However, there are a few negatives as well. First, they deliver \"breakfast\" in a bucket to your door. You get a TINY carton of juice, an apple, and a DISGUSTING pastry or muffin. These are like the kind that you get in a 20 pack at Costco. Defintely plan on making other breakfast arrangements. Also, our confirmation letter stated that we had a jacuzzi bathtub in our king room. This did not exist and was a big letdown. Finally, we booked this hotel through a Travelzoo special and received a really good rate.

I found the Coachman's Inn in a guide book for dog lovers. Wow, was it ever nice. Its architecture and furnishings made us feel as though we'd been transported back to Tudor England. The office staff was friendly. We would recommend the Inn to all canine companions. (But I'd love to stay here even if we hadn't brought our dog, Sparky.) It was an easy walk to the shopping areas and to all the restaurants that would let Sparky eat with us on the outside patios. The evening cookies were scrumptious, and the morning continental breakfast (which was brought to us in a champagne bucket) was filling enough to tide us over until we ate an early lunch. It's also a block away from a nice store and deli, so you could save money by putting some sandwich fixings in the room refrigerator. The room was clean, quiet and spacious and the bed super comfortable. The amenities were presented in a pleasant manner. However, the parking spaces are a bit narrow, so if you have a choice between taking a truck and a car, opt for the car. Every room was decorated for the holidays with a wreath on each door and a small Christmas tree in each room.
