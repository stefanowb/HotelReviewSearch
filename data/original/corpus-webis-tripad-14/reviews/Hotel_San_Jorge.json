The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. They always had a smile and made you feel at home. The rooms were basic but clean which was nice. They have wifi which was great and two computers guests could use if they wanted. Restaurants were within walking distance which we appreciated not to mention the best coffee and dessert place, Jireth.", "title": "Great Hospitality", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MJ24", "date": "October 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 142749596}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "Would recommend this hotel if you are ever in Santa Rosa de Copan.", "title": "Friendly accommodating staff", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "wheels2g0", "date": "December 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122196779}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Our Habitat for Humanity team stayed here during our build. The rooms were large enough for 3 of us to get around without being crowded. We had plenty of hot water in the shower. Jorge was always helpful, as was other staff. We had breakfast in the dining room, and lunches were packed and taken to the build site. The food was plentiful and good, much needed due to the energy we were expending. The hotel's central location is great for walking to restaurants and the cathedral. I know other Habitat teams have stayed here and they, too, were pleased with their experience. I would surely recommend this hotel.", "title": "Giant rooms, Central Location, Good Bargain, Great for Mission Teams", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "mm112233", "date": "November 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 49434283}], "location": {"country": "Honduras", "region": "Copan Department", "continent": "Central America", "city": "Santa Rosa de Copan"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 9, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 15}, "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "We are a family business and offer you the largest and more comfortable rooms in town and a touch of hospitality that will make you feel right at home."}
