Like us, I doubt that you\u2019ll only visit Hever Castle once. There\u2019s something special about sleeping in the fabulously restored, Astor Wing, quite apart from the sumptuous, historic accommodation, the staff are truly delightful, each and every one. On our first visit, we were thrilled to be served breakfast in the Great Hall, not an everyday occasion, even at the castle. The grounds are gorgeous, there\u2019s a large boating lake, a water maze, abundant flowers, shrubs and trees, in a variety of settings, together with water features and planting unique to Hever. I adore Hever, the modernity perfectly married with the ancient, supplying this guest with a memorable stay and longing to return. Activities and events too numerous to mention here, are laid on throughout the year, take a look at their website and choose your favourite. We visited in December, so they had erected beautifully decorated Christmas trees, not just one or two, but so many that I lost count, those lining either side of the Gallery, matched for size, looked breathtaking. If you get a chance this year, just stand at one end and try to take it all in. Standing just outside the Keep, was a large tree, branches laden with list labels for Father Christmas. I spent quite a while just reading what people of all ages had written. If you\u2019re passionate about history, particularly Henry VIII\u2019s doomed relationship with Anne Boleyn, Hever is a must, but even if you're not, well, it's a must.", "title": "Sumptuous, historic Hever", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "EAClack", "date": "June 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 165279303}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "I took my wife to Hever castle, staying at the hever castle luxury bed and breakfast in their Astor wing for our anniversary.", "title": "Romance and beauty and history all in one place", "user": "Mrcellular", "date": "June 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 165062853}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "I have to say that it was really excellent.

Hever Castle and its grounds are so atmospheric and incredibly beautiful. I am a big Anne Boleyn acolyte and staying here was simply a dream for me. The only thing that impeached on our stay a little is the attitude of some of the other B&B guests. Some were quite rude and very judgemental. For some reason we were given a few dirty looks and talked about very loudly by other guests, which i simply cannot understand as we did nothing untoward or to offend. All i can think of is the fact we are a young couple and my fianc\u00e9 has alot of tattoos but that doesn't warrant such a reaction. However, this is certainly not the B&B's fault.

Having access to the Castle and grounds for the duration of the stay was a bonus too; the opportunity to wander around the grounds on an early summers evening after the public had gone was absolutely magical.
