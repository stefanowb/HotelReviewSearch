As other reviews state, it is cramped, but this particular hotel is in an excellent location, close to Gloucester Rd and Kensington high st tube stations. We stayed for two nights, but we were barely there at all. I'm afraid I don't agree with the previous review about hotel staff being helpful, When we checked in I had the feeling that we were an interuption to the staff member that checked us in, and they were not very helpful or informative. Calling this place the Ritz is deceptive and defeats the object of writing reviews, whilst it is clean and cosy, there is no hiding from the fact that this particular hotel has obvious pros and cons, the main ones being that whilst it is cheap, you don't get an awful lot for your money.
