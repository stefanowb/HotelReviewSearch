We were told we could snorkel right off the beach by our travel agent but we were warned not to by hotel staff because of jelly fish. Originally we were told snorkeling was free with all inclusive but it isn't. We felt like several of the dining staff expected tips. We noticed that those who were leaving tips were getting quicker and more friendly service. We didn't feel that way about everyone but it made us uncomfortable because we went \"all inclusive\" for a reason. Also if you want lobster or seafood it isn't included unless you are a preferred member eating at the grill (snack bar during the day grill at night) otherwise it is an additional charge to your room. Each night only a few restaurants were open which we were not planning on. The breakfast buffet was the same all week which gets old fast. All of the dining areas closed so if you weren't feeling well you had to grab something or you would be starving at some point during the night.

We did not meander much from our room, but really didn't need to, either. The staff was more than friendly. We have to commend Fabian and Carlos (Juan) for excellent beach service. They did not let our glasses go less than half-full. The food was okay, we're not picky, and we ate plenty.
