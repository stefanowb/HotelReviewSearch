The rooms while small were very clean and comfortable. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and the hotel has free internet access in the lobby. We had a problem with the air conditioning in the room which we had to ask to be looked at twice but as soon as they realised that it was actually broken they moved us to another room as soon as possible. It is about a 20 min walk into town and 4mins walk to the station. There is a bagel shop next door and a patisserie across the road so we got breakfast from there rather than dining at the hotel.", "user": "T-A-UK", "date": "July 30, 2007", "id": 8259215}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed in this Ibis for 1 night during a quick trip to Munich.
