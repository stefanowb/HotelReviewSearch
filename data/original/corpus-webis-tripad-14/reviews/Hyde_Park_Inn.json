It is an excellent 3/4 star hotel, the rooms are spacious and well kept, and the staff have almost always been friendly and helpful. Take a room above the 5th floor if you can as there are small balconies with beautiful views over Hyde Park. The lower floors have no balcony. There is on site parking which will save you money if you have a car, but it is limited so be sure to tell the staff when booking that you need a parking space. The prices have been quite reasonable over the time and the only reason we didn't stay there last time we were in Sydney is because it was fully booked.

You are also alloted a parking space if you have a car (I do not recommend driving in Sydney). The beds are very comfortable. The hotel is very \"homey\". It is a comfortable place to stay in. The desk clerks do not really bother you but say hello and smile when you walk in. Also included is a flat screen T.V.. There are a lot of channels, but what I liked the most is the \"Box Office\" channel that offered new movies that are on DVD for free. I was sick for a day and a half during this trip, so the movies really made me feel at home. The hotel is very centrally located to the subway (on same block or across the street) that connects you to all the main attractions. On the same block there is also a a bus stop that connects you with all the main buses that can take you all over the city. There is a also a Seven-Eleven store two doors towards Liverpool street where you can buy inexpensive dinners (noodles, beef pies) and bus/subway tickets (I suggest buying the \"Red Ticket\", you can use this ticket for a week on all the subways and buses that are in the Sydney Area but won't work on the Ferries). It is also two blocks from the Monorail, two blocks from the Spanish Corrider, a block from China Town and across from Hyde Park.
