The location of the hotel is ideally situated in the downtown area, with only a short walk to Pike Market, the retail district, Pioneer Square, and the waterfront. The hotel staff are both pleasant & accommodating, and the suites all feel (and smell) very fresh and clean. The rooms on higher floors have views of Puget Sound, and, on a clear day, the mountains on the Olympic Peninsula. You can relax and watch the ferries go back and forth into the sunset. The beds were very comfortable, the linens were of high-quality, and the sound-proofing in the rooms was excellent-- we did not hear city noise or any of the other guests during our entire stay, thus ensuring for a very restful sleep. The soaking tubs are the largest & deepest I've ever encountered in any hotel, and they also fill from the ceiling, which is unique in itself. The hotel also has a boutique spa, with a very accommodating staff, and the spa treatments are simply divine. I would highly suggest pampering yourself with a few nights at Hotel 1000 if you are planning a trip to the Emerald City.

There are too many large buildings blocking the view otherwise. The person who checked us in seemed new to the Hotel, so I didn't find our greeting particularly gracious, but the check-in was fairly quick. For instance, she knew nothing about the direction our room would face. I'd heard all about the ceiling fixture from where the water flows into the tub below, so I was prepared to be awed, but the water splashed out of the tub onto the floor tiles (making the floor slippery) and nearby window, so this isn't a feature I'd repeat in my home. The tub was long and narrow and the window looked onto an adjacent building. There was an electronically operated shade, so our privacy was preserved, but not its views. Our room's furnishings all showed wear, which surprised me given the price of our room $400+, but the high quality sheets and pillows made for a wonderful night's sleep. We were provided with french press-ground coffee, which was magnificent - a clear contrast to the bland coffees provided elsewhere. The city location afforded nice shopping opportunities, and it's only a few blocks away from Pike Place Market, a \"must\" for tourists. The valets were on top of our requests and very helpful. We were here for a special anniversary and the Hotel provided a white-chocolate plaque decorated in milk chocolate with our names, which accompanied six chocolate creams. We had a very good time. The downstairs restaurant seemed to be hopping, but the guest quarters upstairs were quiet. Our Internet connection kept failing, but we didn't need it much, anyway.

It is very boutique chic, kind of W Hotel at half the price. We were super impressed with the room and the bathroom with the tub that fills from the ceiling.

We aren't sure to this day if it was for the broken TV or for my birthday. They didn't say. But it was a nice touch either way. Nonetheless, the TV still wasn't working properly nor was the internet, and we couldn't watch a movie again. And the screen on the phone (which is like a mini computer screen) was supposed to automatically dim at around 9pm, but it didn't and it was so bright lighting up the whole room, we had to cover it with towels and a pillow. Also, there was a light bulb burnt out in one of the closets, and it is so dark in these rooms that we couldn't see what we had in there. They didn't replace that either and so we swapped the bulb from one closet to the other, but then the light wouldn't go out when we closed the door. That was probably why it burnt out in the first place. Also, our desk lamp was broken and just hanging off it's base...I was surprised they'd let it just hang like that and not fix it before occupying the room.
