{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 12, "name": "Pippin Lake Bed and Breakfast", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Really sweet", "text": "This is a little log cabin on the shore of Pippin Lake, a convenient place to stop if you're driving south from Fairbanks to Valdez. There's a full kitchen, a comfortable bed, and a spacious living/dining area. The owner stocks the kitchen with the makings for breakfast (milk, cereal, bagels, yoghurt, etc.). You have the use of both a canoe and a paddle boat if you want to go out on the lake to fish or just hang out. There's a gas barbeque if you get lucky when you're fishing. They even provide a plate of homemade cookies when you arrive! The only negative is the proximity of highway 4. The cabin is about 40-50 yards from a busy (though only 2 lanes) state highway. At night there's not much traffic but if you find traffic noise intrusive you might be bothered during the day.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "jbullock47", "date": "August 13, 2005", "id": 3759487}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Copper Center"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 3, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 8}, "slim_ranking": 0.555555555556}
