Yes, our window had a view of an alley, but if we'd wanted a great view, we would've paid for an upgrade or stayed at a waterfront hotel. We didn't care about the view because we didn't plan to spend an extensive amount of time in the room, and it suited our needs just fine. The A/C worked just fine, except for the time when I screwed it up through operator error, at which point I called the front desk and they sent someone up to correct the problem right away.

We didn't pay for parking, as we lucked out and got free street parking right in front of the hotel (and the usual 2-hour restriction didn't apply because of it being a Sunday followed by a holiday), but we saw the reasonably-priced private garage just a half-block down the street, which we would've used instead of the more expensive valet parking if not for our luck with the street parking. Valet parking might be a good option for those who plan to use their car regularly, though, since apparently the garage down the street charges every time you take your car out of the garage, whereas the hotel's valet parking is a flat rate.

We were thrilled to find this place (which is one of Washingtonian magazine's top 100 restaurants) as an alternative to some of the more touristy places around the waterfront that were not very appealing. For drinks in town, we enjoyed the historic but casual setting of Sly Fox Pub, just off the main traffic circle, and Ram's Head Tavern not far from the hotel on West St., which had live music. We had a very good, inexpensive lunch at 49 West, the coffee shop/wine bar/gallery that's just down West St. from the hotel. Finally, we particularly loved Davis' Pub, tucked away off the beaten path in Eastport, across the drawbridge from downtown, which we found thanks to the recommendation of a local -- a great casual spot for drinks that has a beachy, friendly, neighborhood vibe; we also enjoyed some big peel & eat shrimp and delicious crab dip at one of their outdoor picnic tables with a partial view of the water. As for shopping, Main St. offers a number of places that are fun to browse. Ladies, for reasonably priced and stylish jewelry, handbags, and a small selection of clothing, check out Lilac Bijoux near the waterfront on Main. Lastly, if you're not lucky enough to have your own boat (which we weren't), to get out on the water try a sailing cruise with Schooner Woodwind Cruises, which was informative, fun, and relaxing with a friendly crew and - a nice surprise - a good selection of microbrews to enjoy on board (they also have wine).", "title": "Exactly what we wanted", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "pon421", "date": "June 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114917793}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights while my son was at the naval academy soccer camp.

From reading the website and looking at the pictures, we both expected the hotel to be much nicer than it turned out to be. In fact, my wife booked the room in July for our October weekend and got an executive room at a less expensive rate than the hotel's normal booking rate for that same room. We specifically wanted a room with balcony access. Since the hotel only has 8 rooms with balcony rooms, we paid a little bit more though still a lot less than the normal rate. There are 4 executive rooms with balconies and 4 suites with large balcony/decks. We both liked the size of the room and thought it to be cozy. However, the carpet in the room was quite worn and dirty, and the fixtures both in the bathroom and in the room itself were cheap and worn. The sliding glass door was quite beat up and the carpet right inside the door was quite filthy. The king bed was firm though still quite comfortable. However, for such a large bed, we were only provided with 3 small pillows, an extremely thick and heavy comforter (quite possibly the heaviest comforter that I have ever felt), and a blanket. On the second night, we requested an additional pillow and blanket which the hotel provided rather quickly. The mini fridge was propped up on two pieces of wood, which looked rather cheap. The worst part of our stay was the room service breakfast. We both ordered the standard American breakfast (scrambled eggs, potatoes, toast, and bacon), however, when it showed up, there was no toast on either plate, no bacon on one plate, and the other plate had rather uncooked Canadian bacon, plus I had ordered scrambled eggs but received a western omelet, which was no big deal. Also, the potatoes were terrible...as if they had been sitting under hot lights in a breakfast bar for several hours. We couldn't even eat them because they were so hard. The eggs lacked any flavor, although I had the western omelet by mistake on their part and it had flavor only because of the peppers and onions. So moral of the story: eat out. We also were told that the ice machine didn't work properly when I went to fill up my small cooler with just a little bit of ice. Location-wise the hotel is just down the block from restaurants and shops on West St. and just a few minute walk to the harbor. The Loews is about a block away. The next time we return to Annapolis, we will likely stay closer to Main St. and the statehouse. For the 3 1/2 stars that the O'Callaghan claims to have, we expected a nicer, cleaner room and slightly more luxurious. They even show robes in the hotel pictures but there were no such items in the rooms.", "title": "Can Do Better", "user": "ardmoreflyer", "date": "October 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 20680465, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Close proximity to restaurants, shops, and cultural attractions of Annapolis", "disliked": "\u2014 Dirty room, terrible room service"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The O'Callaghan is in a great location -- we went for the Navy football game, and it was an easy walk.
