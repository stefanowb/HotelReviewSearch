The gym was okay, but gets very crowded, so it can be difficult to get to use any of the equipment. The pool is nice, but if you want to sunbathe after 11 am forget about getting a lounger as they'll all be taken. Breakast was by and far the biggest disappointment. The food was fine, but no matter what time you go it is always very, very busy. All the tables are squashed in together, and there are so many that one morning I couldn't find my table and another guest - who I'd never seen before - had to point me in the right direction.

The hotel is a quite oasis from the noise and bustle of Hong Kong. We were upgraded to the club floor but without any of the priviliges as all rooms were booked. The room was large enougfh for two, magnificent harbour views and the best bed we have ever had in a hotel - It was a side Harbour view room and the ones on lower floors are exactly the same. Breakfast is magnificent as is the dinner buffet. Room service is inexpensive and fast. Beer in the inroom mini bar is around AUD 4.50 a can but we got 50% off to $2.25 (cheapest mini bar i have ever seen !)Cool drinks around $2. Supermarket in adjoining shopping plaza stocks everything you could possibly need at great prices. The shuttle is efficient and fast although at only HKD 30 a taxi to Nathan Road is a good option.
