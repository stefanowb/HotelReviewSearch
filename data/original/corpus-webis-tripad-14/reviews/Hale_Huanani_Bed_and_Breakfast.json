Everything was outstanding! The breakfast in the morning was very good. The bread that was made fresh daily was extremely good! What was really nice with this BB was you got the feeling that you were a local. We first got in on Wednesday afternoon and went straight to the house. After getting settled in we just took it easy that afternoon. It was not until the next morning we went into Kihei to go to the beach and we relized that we avoided all the tourist!! Which was really nice for us, plus it is super quite!!

We stayed in the Niu Suite and everything was great. Very quiet for sleeping, very spacious with combination sleeping and living area. Good ventilation and fans (no air conditioning which is normal as electric kwh is very expensive). Great shower in bathroom, full closet with tons of extra towels including stuff for the beach. Good size refrigerator in kitchen and had a microwave, sink, plenty of dishes. Fresh fruit and a baked Hawaiian bread for muffins were placed on the patio each morning at 7 am. They were yummy. A basket full of macadamia nuts and a nut cracker treated us with fresh nuts when we needed a snack. You need a car here, you are about 1.5 miles up the hill from Wailea village. Best snorkeling is down in Makena - not sandy beaches there but you can get in off the lava without getting hurt and there are turtles and great fish. Susan has chairs, mats, boogie boards, coolers so you don't have to bring that stuff from home. We had happy hour at the Fairmont one night - great sunset and whale view. This B&B is really a value - I told Susan that I thought she was not charging enough for what she was delivering. I walked in the morning in the Maui Meadows neighborhood and it was very safe and everyone I passed said hello. Susan gave us her ideas for what not to miss on the island, where to snorkel and where to eat. Also we just chatted about other stuff as well and she is very approachable and an outstanding hostess. We ate at da Kitchen in Kihei and Five Palms in Kihei, both very good. Did an early bike trip out of Haleakala but did not see sunrise due to cloud cover. Did a whale watch out of Lahaina and had great whale sitings. Spent 4 nights in Molokai and that was a whole other story - very worthwhile to go over there but it is a place stopped in time about 50 years ago. All in all, a great value stay - we have always stayed in the Wailea resorts but those are so expensive and you pay extra for every single thing plus the resort fees and taxes. The only thing we missed was the ocean view but we had plenty of that in what we did on the island so it was worth it to save the money.", "title": "Nice place, but a big \"beware\"", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Portnoff", "date": "February 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 3.0}, "id": 124550386}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed 2 separate times for a total of a week- read the reviews they are spot on!", "title": "Beautiful & clean- A+++++!!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CG1313", "date": "February 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 124397499}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were in Maui, Hawaii in Nov 2011 when we stayed at this Bed and Breakfast in Kihei.
