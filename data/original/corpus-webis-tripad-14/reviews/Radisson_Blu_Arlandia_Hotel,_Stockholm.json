About 10 minutes away on free shuttle bus, yellow bus number 14 outside the terminal. Got to the hotel and the free WiFi wasn't working, annoying if you need to do work. Was told it would be fixed soon, but stayed off all night, not a good start! Room was ok, just average, did notice it seemed quite small and tight trying to move round with cases. Pretty clean but some of the room furniture looked a bit tired. Bathroom was small too, wet room with the toilet almost in the shower! When I say wet room, I had a shower and the floor got flooded. The seal at the bottom of the shower screen didn't appear to do much and I ended up with a whole wetroom! Restaurant food and drink menu seemed very overpriced even for this part of the world.
