Given one of the kitchenette units, which was handy. Hotel could use a bit of upgrading but overall it was clean and comfortable. Location is right in downtown Whitehorse, and the hotel provides a shuttle to the airport. The restaurant is quite good, and the lobby is comfortable to hang out in. Staff were friendly. The hallways and our room smelled a bit like smoke, even though these were non-smoking areas. There is no air conditioning so when it's hot, it's hot.

Some of the rooms are nice; spacious and updated. Others, like the \"standard room\" we were in the first night are not so nice. The standard room was extremely small (think hostel), the bathroom did not have tub and the only window was tiny as well - and everything seemed to be original fixtures. The whole hotel including rooms appear to be clean. We did have a large cigarette hole burn in the quilt both nights, the staff at the front desk didn't seem concerned, even though these are supposed to be non-smoking rooms. We upgraded ourselves to a room with a two person jacuzzi tub and king size bed our last night - it was an extra $40 but worth it - a lot more room, and much nicer to be in - the tub itself was worth it.", "title": "It's OK - not bad, not terribly good; it'll do....", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "strattc", "date": "October 5, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3993107}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "This hotel was okay, nothing special.
