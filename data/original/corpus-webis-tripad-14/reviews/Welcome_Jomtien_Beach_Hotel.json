Bathrooms was a little old and tatty but not too bad. Bathroom had lots of clean towels and shampoo soap etc.. fridge was well stocked and drinks were not to highly priced. Had a meal delivered by room service at about 1am. Food was quick to arrive and still hot but a little lacking in flavor. Breakfast was ok but not very warm but fruit was yummy. The dinning room was very busy but the girls were quick to clean up and we had a nice hour sat people watching and drinking coffee. Only thing that gave us any stress was the fact we had our 2 year old very inquisitive daughter with us and as we were on the 8th floor we were scared as she could open the windows if stood on a chair so be careful if with little ones. All in all for the price which is very cheap had a nice stay with no problems.. Staff were ok too and smiled a lot.. We would stay again.. Oh and location was not a problem as its quiet close to everything but about 10 mins on a bhat bus to Pattaya", "title": "Nice Hotel But Management Lacking", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "travellinrock", "date": "September 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5779382, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 spacious room - nice pool & pool enviroment - location", "disliked": "\u2014 staff - housekeeping - breakfast - gym - no bar facility (lounge)"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2004", "text": "Hotel itself very nice.
