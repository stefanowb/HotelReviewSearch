There was a flat screen tv and dvd player up on the wall out of any little hand's reach. Bathroom was fairly small though very clean. The gardens are very well kept and provide plenty of seating and loungers and there is a nice small play area. Dinner was included in our package and the food was extremely good, both in quality and portion size, with a choice of at least 6 dishes for each course. The staff were all friendly and no request was too much trouble. Unfortunately our son was sick on the very first night, but the staff responded promptly with clean bedding, towels and disinfectant and were very understanding.
