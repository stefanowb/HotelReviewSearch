Second, one had to sit on the toilet sidesaddle because there was no leg room. Third...watch the shower.

Even the complimentary breakfast is made up of some white bread, packaged pressed ham, a few cheeses and cofee that must be nuked. I never saw any other guests and no wonder.

If your room is on the square side of the building (\"square view\") you may find the building work outside noisy. Located on the fourth or fifth floor of the building, but there is a lift. Hostel is very centrally located for Metro, the main tourist sites and all kinds of night life. We struggled to find it at first - it is next to the \"Pans\" hamburger takeaway and an opticians at one end of Sol Square.", "user": "Aeger", "date": "April 15, 2006", "id": 4975097}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Far better than expected!! Very comfortable!!", "text": "Just to let everyone know that we found this place very central, clean, cheap and friendly etc but that currently they are doing construction work in the square outside the hostel. This looks like fairly long-term work ie through the summer. We did luckily take ear plugs as we had heard that Madrid never sleeps and this worked!

I was there for 3 nights, Since it was a gay hostel, i was expecting to maybe meet other gay travelers. There are actually signs posted throughout the hostel to be quiet. The hostel was extremely clean. The location was ideal. I bought a 10-rides ticket for the metro and only used 4, i could walk everywhere i needed to go. If you are looking for a charming quiet place to sleep and don't mind giving up the luxuries of a hotel i would recommend this hostel to you. I had a private room with a shared bathroom and paid 30 euro a night.", "user": "Sagittariusuf", "date": "May 9, 2005", "id": 3451219}], "location": {}, "stars": 1, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 42, "very good": 82, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 54}, "aka": "Hostal Puerta Del Sol Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.174342105263, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 3.5, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 3.5, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "In the centrer town, near museums, bars, palaces, clubs and discos.
