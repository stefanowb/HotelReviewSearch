The rooms are complete, by Nicaragua standards, having hot water, air conditioning, complimentary bottled water and a free breakfast with cooked to order eggs. The hotel is small, but in this case, it is to the guest's advantage, as all staff members know who you are, and treat every guest as a valued customer. I stayed a week and by the end of the week, I found all the employees were familiar with my routines and preferences and were eager to make sure my stay was nice.", "title": "Newer hotel-excellent value, excellent service", "user": "bakphoenix", "date": "April 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 28343304}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The overall look of the hotel and the rooms was nice.
