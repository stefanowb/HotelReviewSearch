I am surprised no-one else mentions this. It could do with an an Entrance sign on the drive. Look for the Harvester Pub and drive in there. My room was unheated despite being booked and it turned out the heater did not work. The staff were very helpful and got me a standing heater which worked fine. They also put it on for me on my arrival on the second night. Bed was very comfortable and I slept well. Compared to other Premier Inns it was only average tho' I thought- the Shower smelt when I went in the first time; the remote control on the TV stuck a bit; the heat did not work and I could not really regulate the temp. of the standing heater. But the staff were helpful and did their best to sort the heating, bringing me an extra duvet in case. I had a reasonable rate booking early and it is convenient for the University.", "title": "Arriving in the dark you can miss the entrance.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Hilary B", "date": "May 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 129777871}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Excellent.", "title": "Premier Inn coventry", "user": "Rowanother", "date": "April 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129121845}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with family", "text": "What more can i say ?", "title": "Excellent stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Indytv", "date": "April 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127971148}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled on business", "text": "just what I expect fm Premier inn", "title": "Clean Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Kevnorth", "date": "April 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127200887}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Had a weekend away staying two nights in order to go to the NEC in Birmingham which was a short stay away.

Prefer this 'made to order' cooked breakfast rather than buffet and loved the internal 'breakfast room' (not part of the restaurant next door) run by Premier Inn staff but wonder if it might be a bit small if the hotel is full. Also like the new choice of pillows in the room. My only complaint was this room was not big enough for a family of 4 (although this could be because we booked online that morning) meaning no gaps to walk between the beds and the pull-out bed (mattress on the floor) was very uncomfortable for my 11-year old son.
