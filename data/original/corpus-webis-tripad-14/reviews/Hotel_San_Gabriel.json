There is nothing to complain about this hotel except on thing: Due to the cold weather the room was freezing cold. There was heater/aircon-unit on the wall, but that didn't do much good. Even though they hat radiators in our rooms, the where only turned on sometime during the evening for a couple of hours and then shut down again. When we woke up in the morning the room was ice cold. Taking a shower was no option, because the bathroom was even colder. Other than that it was a perfect stay in a great hotel, with beautiful and romantic rooms (great attention to detail), a great an quiet location, in an interesting town.", "title": "Romantic hotel with a personal touch", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "oller", "date": "January 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6647477}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Charming Hotel", "text": "We truly enjoyed our stay in Hotel San Gabriel. While I wouldn't call it the best in Spain like in another review, I think that it's unbeatable in its price category (we paid 80 euros per night for a standart double without breakfast). The location is perfect: In the heart of 'La Ciudad', the oldest and nicest part of Ronda, but very quiet. We appreciated the little details which showed that the owners really care about their guests. In the wine cellar you are treated to a glas of sherry, you can enjoy movies in a lovely decorated mini-cinema, there is a free library with a wide choice of books. Unfortunately none of the staff informed us about those extras and also in the room there was no information about it. We even discovered only after 2 days that there is an elevator, as it is well disguised. Our room was quite large, very tastefully decorated, the bathroom without fault. Breakfast with good quality products but a rather limited choice. All in all very recommendable!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "have_a_FUN_trip", "date": "January 8, 2007", "id": 6565498}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "And if you like to have a great dinner with creative Andalucian dishes and a view over the gorge then try Restaurante Santo Pola, just around the corner from the hotel.
