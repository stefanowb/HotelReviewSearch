The house really is a home away from home and for anyone who loves design, it's the home that you wish you lived in! No detail goes unaccounted for and the house is only just a part of the unique experience of staying there. Antonio, Catarina, Paula go above and beyond and are encyclopedias of Porto (and the north) and the creative genius that exists there.

Catarina and Antonio were so friendly, informative and helpful with every part of our visit that by the time we left, we felt we were leaving old friends behind. The house and space are remarkable - from all the beautiful and thoughtful design details to the colors chosen. Breakfasts were always yummy! Our bed was a dream and we slept like babies! Location was A+++++! Loved the neighborhood and the friendly neighbors! Do use the Taxi service offered - it's worth every penny and made our arrival so easy and pleasant. The public transportation is only steps away and we learned very quickly how to get to every part of the city. The \"seafood\" restaurants were a real visual and culinary experience - again, perfection. Unforgettable is the perfect word for 4Rooms Porto!

From the time we first contacted Catarina to inquire about booking 4Rooms, to the taxi she organized to pick us up at 4:00am to go to the airport, our experience at 4Rooms in Porto was tremendous. Their service and attention to detail is fantastic. We were upgraded to their new \"Sky Loft\", which is across the street from the main building......amazing and worth every penny. The breakfast each morning (the table is set up each evening in the loft and Catarina brings breakfast from the amazing restaurant they work with a few houses up the road each morning), couldn't have been any better. If there are any special food requirements, let them know and they will accomodate.

The buses are also convenient and a bit cheaper.

We wanted something that was no touristic, and a more authentic experience. Staying with Antonio and Catarina was unlike anything we have come across in our travels. Their customer service was really incredible - nothing was too much trouble, and they were forever coming up with new and interesting things to see and do (and best of all, delicious restaurants to go to). The property is small, but perfectly formed with lots of designer furniture (a real passion of Antonio's). We had such a good time, that we also managed to stay with them in their luxurious villa (with private pool) in the Algarve for a few days for our honeymoon (just got back). It is a new \"project\" that they're working on (based on the same ideals that made their Porto project so great). Antonio is keen to keep it a secret for now (as he develops the idea), but even at this early stage, it is pretty impossible to fault it (beautiful property, designer furniture, private pool and delicious food, all within minutes of he coast). If you get a chance, and loved Porto, then try and persuade Antonio to let you visit.

We stayed here for 3 nights after we arrived in Porto from Australia and was the best choice that we ever made (except maybe staying a little longer!)

Whilst it is a little bit out of the main city centre, you get to experience a section of Porto that is beautiful and not very touristy. The apartment is located 2 mins from the beach and the river, and is also easy to get into the city by catching one of the frequent buses that takes 15 mins. The breakfast was also very yummy, and you get complimentory water all day long. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!
