I ended up choosing this hotel for a couple reasons. First, I was short on time and availability for avail rooms for New Years Eve in Berlin. Second, location was key in my decision as i wanted easy access to public transportation, a friendly neighborhood for the wife to walk the dog, shopping, food both the fast and the sit in variants and enclosed parking for the car. Last I was using previous customer reviews to help sway my decision. Now the hotel for the price was only okay. As mentioned in previous reviews there may have been a renovation or something at one point as the lobby and entry into the hotel was magnificent but when we entered our room it seemed like the forgotten one...actually the forgotten floor or more specific one of the non smoker floors. Maybe this is just Steigenberger quality or Berlin flare but the room didn't really meet my expectations of a 5 star hotel of such a prestigious European chain. Wood cabinetry seemed dated, tv was antiquated (still don't get why not just use LCD screens at places like this) and the bed was actually the Euro standard of two separate beds put together to form \"one\". Surely they would just have one piece queen/king mattresses, no? The best part of the room for me was the bathroom. Seemed as if it actually got the makeover. Nice granite countertops with dual sinks for me and the lady and a nice deep bath/shower. Also of note is that this hotel does allow dogs at the rate of 15 Euro a night, which is fine with us because we love travelling with our 7 month old Boston Terrier. Overall i rate this as only a decent hotel as far as specific facilites go to match star rating. When it comes to location and access it's near the top as it puts you smack dab in the center of the main shopping boulevard and a quick step to the U/S Bahns and even the bus station (local hub at Zoological Gardens).

It is a 4/5 star hotel and has all the services you need. This was my third stay and it is great value for money and a great city centre location for tourists. I was at a conference in the hotel and the conference facilities are some of the best in Europe. The only negative thing is the outside look of the hotel which is very 1960s, but inside it is great and the rooms are not large, but quite adequate.", "title": "Lovely hotel and reasonably priced", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Berkshire_UK", "date": "April 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15117417, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Executive floor", "disliked": "\u2014 Outside look of the hotel"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Taxi from the Tegel airport is less than 20 Euros....", "title": "First Class Hotel", "user": "Nisirian", "date": "March 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14140968}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled on business", "text": "On this stay I was upgraded to the Exec floor, with lounge facilites available until 9pm, inc Champagne.....", "title": "Excellent", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "karamera", "date": "February 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 13686619, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, breakfast, spacious room"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "book somewhere else", "text": "Don't bother looking anywhere else.....stay here!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "torontotoronto75", "date": "February 7, 2008", "id": 13368518}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Central location for tourists & within easy walking distanceof the railway station & shopping malls.", "title": "Personality Conflict: 3 Star trying to Be 4 Star, Classic Trying to Be Modern.", "user": "Montylicious", "date": "January 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 13004151, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Bar", "disliked": "\u2014 Front Desk Service and outdated room"}}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 38, "average": 74, "very good": 305, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 426}, "aka": "Steigenberger Berlin Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.101949025487, "description": "First class hotel with a fabulous location in the heart of the city near the landmark \u201cMemorial Church\u201d , known for its traditional quality, german style and friendly, efficient service.
