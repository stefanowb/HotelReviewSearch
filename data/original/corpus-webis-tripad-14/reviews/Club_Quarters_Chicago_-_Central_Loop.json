The rooms were pretty small but unless you plan on spending a lot of time in your room..... The staff was really helpful for getting on the right bus route and holding our luggage after check out.

Hotel halls were clean. Carpet was not worn. There was a supply closet in the hall with extra blankets, pillows, ironing board and iron. Staff was friendly and very helpful with information. Doormen were quick to help in and out of taxis and were knowledgable about the area. FREE internet service in the lobby and on the third floor. Lobby was very cozy with TV and fireplace. Coffee in the morning. Patrons were a cross section of business people and international travelers. Because the hotel is located in the Loop, it is very quiet on the weekends. There is a restuarant/bar attached to the hotel, a coffee shop a block away for informal meals and a 7-eleven across the street for snacks. Starbucks is next door.

The parking was very expensive for the two nights my Dad and I stayed there. We felt safe around the area at night. The Elephant and Castle was a nice pub but the food was a little overpriced for what it was. I was not happy when we requested two beds and only got a queen. I called the front desk and they wanted me to pay 30 dollars more a night for the suite, which would give us a queen bed and a sleeper sofa. Apparently, our check-in at 7pm was too late to get the two-bed room we requested. Our room had the bed and a desk chair and that was it for seating. We didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room so it didn't matter too much anyways, but it was still quite annoying they wanted to charge us more. I found the climate control to be either too hot or too cold and our room smelled of cigarettes.
