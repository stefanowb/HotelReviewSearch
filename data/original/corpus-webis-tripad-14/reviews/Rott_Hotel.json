The Rott was excellent. Clean, friendly desk help, great breakfast. It's right next to the Hard Rock Cafe, but totally quiet; I never even heard anyone in the hall (I was on the top floor).

The Hard Rock Cafe is next door which I read about in a TA review before we went, but I am sure glad I did not let that hold me back from staying at the Rott. This hotel could not have a better location. It is right in the middle of everything you will want to see. Easy walking distance!!! And just a half a block around the corner is the main square!!! Another plus the Hotel Rott has, is its own wonderful Mercedes to drive you to the destination of your choice. Yes there is a fee, but you know ahead of time what that fee is and they could not have been more accomodating when wewent to the State Opera House or the airport.
