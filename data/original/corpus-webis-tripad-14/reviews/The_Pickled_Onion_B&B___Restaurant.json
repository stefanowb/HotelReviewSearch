Valerie was very welcoming and the cabana (Nohoch Nah) was even nicer than the pics show, with tiled floors, nicely furnished, fridge and tea and coffee-making facilities. It was a lot bigger inside than it looked from the outside. The garden setting was a delight, lots of birds about. We were unlucky with the weather so a bit cold for the pool, but it looked great for a dip in the more usual weather. Food was great, choice a bit restricted, but this meant service was the fastest and most efficient we've ever experienced in Mexico; the restaurant is very nicely laid out and comfortable. Its very handy for visiting Uxmal but there's plenty more to visit close by, including Kabah, only about 3 miles away. There's lots of wild areas close by. Apart from the occasional lorry rumbling by, the setting is very peaceful aand relaxed. Overall, one of the nicest places we've stopped in for a long time.", "title": "Lovely cabanas, lovely food, great service", "user": "cymraeg4", "date": "January 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150963835}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with family", "text": "This B&B with little houses to stay in should not be missed! Theowner has gone to great lengths to make this a pleasant place to stay, the prices are reasonable and the food is great. We are budget conscious travelers and tend to eat at local restaurants and the food at the Pickled Onion was as good or better than any we had on this trip! There is no AC so I can not speak to how hot the houses are in the summer, but in January, with a ceiling fan, we did not have any issues. The bathroom was partially open to the room, understandable because of the tall peaked roofs. Nice pool for swimming. Wifi only in the restaurant, shuts off around 9:00, but to have wifi at all in that location is very nice. Very well located for trips to Uxmal and the other ruins, Valerie is most helpful with answers to your questions and will find tours guides if you want her to. And the packed lunches are a good deal, nicely prepared. We stayed two nights.
