They are run down, dirty, and have few amenities. However for 35 us a night its hard to complain too much. My room in itself was a decent size , and somewhat clean with no dirt to speak of, but the entire hotel had a musty run down feel to it. It felt as if it dusted or painted in 20 years. I arrived at the hotel at about 1pm the day before my 6 am flight back home... being a 95 degree sunny day I was hoping to take a swim, but was disgusted when I saw the pool area. It was covered with bird droppings and trash. As far as the breakfast , I took one look and walked out. All in all, this hotel is OK if you are not too picky and you are on a budget. The problem with Bangkok airport hotels is you really have little choice. Even the one nice decent hotel ( Amari) is WAY to expensive for what you get. In downtown Bangkok it would go for about 50us a night. They charge over 150.00 . For that you could the Pennisula downtown. Which once was rated the best hotel in the world. Most people could probably deal with this hotel for one night, but my advice to more selective travelers would be to avoid the airport area and stay somewhere downtown--its only 20 extra mins.", "title": "OK.... for one night.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "icem2829", "date": "July 20, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3685425}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2003", "text": "There aren't a lot of airport hotel options outside of the Amari Airport Hotel which is outragiously priced for the quality relative to other great Bangkok hotels. Once you eliminate the Amari Airport Hotel, you really have like 4 other choices - all of them in the $45-60/night category which is really what many people are looking for after arriving at midnight from the US and wanting to catch the next flight out of Bangkok to points like Phuket, Ko Samui or Chiang Mai or to countries beyond Thailand. Other people who want to stay close to the airport are people who have to catch the 6am outbound flight out of Bangkok back to the US.", "title": "Okay if you're jetlagged and just want to spend the night before your next fligh", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Spahkee", "date": "May 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3504157}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005", "text": "The 4 \"near the airport\" choices we've stayed at are the Comfort Suites, the Quality Suites, the Asia Airport and the Rama Gardens.

It is inside a gigantic shopping centre where the only thing you can buy is electrical goods, particularly mobile phones and computer components. It is so huge that the staff get around on scooters inside. The hotel has cheap furniture and the worst pigeon problem i have ever encountered. Do not use the large, delicious looking swimming pool, which had great potential. look closely at the bottom, you will see that the brown stuff is pigeon poop. The pigeons nest on your windowsill, on your balcony, in the eaves of the pool terrace and just about everywhere. They swoop down and drink from the pool completely fearless. The smell is awful and there is poop everywhere you look even on your lounger. We could not get towels when we appeared at the pool, it was unsupervised. The lifts kept breaking down and some guests i met had been trapped for ages. The breakfast is indescribably horrible with fake juice and eggs floating in peanut oil. This is a budget hotel and you could only laugh at it and put up with it if you are young and reckless. It was distressing for a woman with a child. It is opposite a McDonalds if that is what you are after, then it might suit. We made a big mistake by judging it from the internet photos. It is also in a hellish location devoid of charm. We were looking for a hotel close to the airport, if that is what you want also, then stay at the Sofitel Central Plaza, it is 100 times better and not much more expensive", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 8, 2004", "id": 2171555}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Lam Luk Ka"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 19, "average": 12, "very good": 5, "terrible": 13, "excellent": 2}, "aka": "Asia Airport Bangkok", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
