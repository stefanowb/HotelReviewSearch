Even though we walked in sweaty from our ride and had tossed hair, we felt welcome. We were able to park the motorcycle right in front of the hotel, which was well lit at night. Our room was large with a king size bed. One wall had a large mural painted and another was exposed brick from the old building. Our only complaint was the shower. There was a rain-shower head and a handheld. I am not a fan of the rain shower and we both felt the handheld needed to be up higher on the wall. We only ate one meal there, which was in their bar.

The Iron Horse was the destination of a recent business convention and they booked up so fast, I had to stay elsewhere, which was not only a disappointment, but a huge inconvenience for me. So, I was not a happy camper when I walked in. The problem was, they fell over themselves being so nice to me that I tried to stay mad, but couldn't. We had a very tight schedule all day Thursday that went late into the evening, so I called my other hotel for a late check-in (which was The Hilton downtown Milwaukee, see that review too). I decided to leave my truck at the Iron Horse Hotel and take a taxi to the Hilton later on, this saved me on another parking fee. The parking attendant guys were the nicest guys ever, opening the door, greeting you, they pulled up my truck at the end of the night, got my luggage out, called the taxi all with a smile. It doesn't end there, the next morning, they pulled up my truck again, put my luggage back in and re-parked the truck until 2:00 Friday afternoon, all for $24.00. These guys not only deserve good tips, but made an unhappy person feel a whole lot better. Being a woman, alone in an unfamiliar city, they made me feel at home. I truly wished I could have stayed there, everyone was commenting on how comfortable the beds were, so I did have to pout a little. At the end of Thursday evening our convention had free drink tickets in the bar. I tried talking to some of the folks in our group, but was just feeling sorry for myself and sat at the bar, well the bartender was like an entertainer, before long I was laughing and having fun watching all that was going on in this very busy bar and how they handled it all. This boutique hotel is first class, but laid back, which is exactly what I liked most about it - it feels like home. The lunch they served was excellent too. I will be back and next time I'm staying there! They are dog friendly too, biker friendly. It's just the coolest, hippest place and I'm bringing my girlfriends for a girls get away. We usually stay in downtown Chicago, but the parking and room fees are getting to be a little too much and this is closer to home for me.

Each of the 100 rooms has an enlarged photo mural of a Milwaukee woman which has been hand embellished by the artist. The bed was comfortable and the decor (especially the shower) was very unusual and added to the boutique quality of the hotel. Drinks were expensive - but that was to be expected in such a high-end hotel. My only complaint was the toilet paper - not as soft as one would expect in such luxury. OK - so I'm fussy!
