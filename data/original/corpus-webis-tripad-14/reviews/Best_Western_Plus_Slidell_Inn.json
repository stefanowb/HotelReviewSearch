Everything on their website and the third-party websites indicated \"Free Limited Continental Breakfast\" which is one of the reasons we chose the hotel. When we arrived, we were informed that there was no breakfast. I asked if there was a rate adjustment since we were never told that the breakfast would not be included. The front desk clerk said no and asked if we wanted to find other accommodations. This was at 11 p.m. on a Friday night! Talk about customer service! They've never heard of it! You should never mislead a guest. It's just false advertising. It got worse when we entered the room. There was mold on the curtains and live mosquitoes buzzing about. Ignoring the \"privacy please\" door hanger, a male employee entered our room without knocking well before check out time. Thankfully, we had just dressed. Only one of the machines in the \"gym\" worked and there was no TV or music. It's pretty hard to work out to silence. Again, it's false advertising to say you offer amenities that you don't have. Best Western should be ashamed to put their name on this dump.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 8, 2003", "id": 1276060}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A Hidden Haven", "text": "I want to inform you about Best Western Slidell Inn at 120 Taos Street if you are considering staying there. Don't! There is a sleep inn that is the next exit over---it is about the same price and at least there you will be guaranteed a \"clean\" room. I stayed early this month. We booked the hotel on Travelocity. During our first night, when we checked into our room there was a pungent odor. We thought it was the smell of the hotel and could not understand why such a new hotel smelled so bad. We complained to the desk clerk about the smell. He said we could either check into a smoking room or there was a suite available for an additional charge. We could not check into the smoking room, because my companion has asthma and we didn\u2019t want to pay an additional fee for the room so we stayed in the room. Upon our investigation of the foul odor, we found huge mold spores in the air conditioning vent. When we called to tell them about the mold problem and that we would take the other room, it was no longer available. We had no choice, but to spend the entire night in this room.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Atul P", "date": "August 30, 2003", "id": 1269820}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The competition in Slidell amongst several garden variety motels is close, but unfortunately not fierce.
