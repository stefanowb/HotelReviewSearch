In my entire life I have never stayed at a hotel where the staff were so unwilling to help the guests in any way and treated so poorly by staff. We had three rooms booked. We had problems with all three rooms some of which were fixed but with pursuasion and others to which the staff just ignored the problems. I could tell all the stories but I find it very irritating and frustrating to even talk about it. I observed the staff be rude to anyone who came with any questions or concerns. The motel was in a convenient location and the rooms were fairly clean but all three had a very strange smell, with each room having a different smell. Definitely was not worth the price we paid. I later found many other similar motels in the area at a much better rate.", "title": "poor service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tbaytraveler43", "date": "April 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 4828520}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006", "text": "Stayed in Hollywood for New Years Eve.
