Breakfast was outstanding - though slightly perplexed by the request for orders the night before, this proved to be one of the things that made everything go so smoothly. I think it was the high quality of everything - furnishing and ingredients - that really makes this stand out; it made everything so relaxing. Do go to Chanonry point - we saw dolphins and seals there; the shoreline on the way to Evanton was littered with seals basking on rocks in the sun. Eat at Riva - really enjoyable food.
