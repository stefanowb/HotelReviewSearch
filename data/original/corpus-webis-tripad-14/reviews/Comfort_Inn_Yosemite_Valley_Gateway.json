We did not stay in the main hotel because I had payed a few dollars more for a suite. The suites are located in 2 buildings near the hotel. I am sorry I spent the extra money.

All 3 were identical but 1 had been turned upside down to give the appearance that it is different. If you are considering staying at this hotel do not pay extra for the suites.

We arrived late after driving from Yosemite and decided to look around for a hotel. I had previously read the reviews here and looked at pricing on websites and decided not to book any room in advance without seeing it first. I was quite pleased with the hotel and the front desk staff was very helpful. They told us up front about the various rates available and we took advantage of the AAA rate savings. They also directed us to the various food choices in town which was helpful at the late hour. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. The HVAC worked well and kept us comfortable through the night. The bathroom was large and clean although it was a big plain and the toilet was noisy when flushed. The TV worked fine and had a variety of stations to choose from. The beds were firm but comfortable and the linens and furniture were in good condition. The only drawback I can see is there are no elevators and you may have to climb either one or two flights of stairs to your room. The hotel is on the western outskirts of town and up on a hill so it was also a little hard to locate after dark. There are other options available but we did not check around to compare rates or rooms as this was perfectly fine and the rate was reasonable for the location. None of the hotels in the area are high-end and apparently only one hotel has elevators so if this is an issue you should check first, otherwise I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.", "user": "wdev", "date": "September 17, 2007", "id": 8738316}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed there for one night to visit Yosemite the next morning.

As noted by some other posters, the park is a good 45 minute drive or so from Mariposa. However we are early risers and found the drive to be quite pleasant and scenic, and we were able to beat the long waits at the new bridge construction. Contrary to what was said in another post, there are in fact a number of restuarants in town. We ate one night at a local burger joint that had a lot of character (walls and ceiling wallpapered with old record album covers) and found a very nice, if small, Mexican restaurant just a block or so from the hotel. The hotel was okay as a base of operations for exploring Yosemite. The breakfast was pretty much standard. It would have been a plus if there was a fridge and microwave in the room, something I have come to pretty much expect when staying at this chain. Mariposa itself is a quaint little town with old west flavor that I wish we had more time to explore.
