We stayed for one night before catching an early morning flight and the 24 hour complimentary shuttle to the airport was very convenient. Breakfast was included in the price which was also handy. We had no problems with the room or staff and would consider staying there again in a similar situation.", "title": "Fine for one night", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Angelco", "date": "July 17, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5474981}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "very disappointed", "text": "the front desk service is unhelpful and sometimes rude. They have this certain attitude. Try to call room service? it's not exactly room service, because they would actually ask you to go down to the restaurant in the basement to get what you need. The room lacks mini-fridge, although a vending machine is available at the other side of the hotel, it can become annoying, but not that big deal. However, when cleaning up the room, they don't always renew what was used. The air-conditioning needs a while to actually cool off the room and it's rather LOUD when it's on. The bathroom is extremely small, however the bathtub and shower area is quite clean. Very disappointed in the hotel. If all you want is a room to sleep and then leave and not care about the service and amenities, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, i wouldn't come back.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 9, 2005", "id": 3541852}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Alright... nothing special", "text": "I stayed at this hotel in November for 3 nights. The rate was reasonable. Rooms were a decent size, although the bathrooms are incredibly small and the sinks are not in the bathroom, they are out in the hall. The hotel restaurant is expensive and the food quality is definately not worth the price. The \"pool\" is an oversized bathtub... this hotel was a good price and may be a good option for those who are not so picky about hotel amenities. I picked it because I wanted a hotel with a pool, so I was disappointed in that respect. The interior of the hotel has recently undergone renovations, so it is nice. I am sure there are nicer hotels out there for a little more money. I doubt I will stay here again.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "leenNovaScotia", "date": "January 26, 2005", "id": 3087749}], "location": {"country": "Canada", "city": "Dorval"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 17, "average": 49, "very good": 103, "terrible": 20, "excellent": 50}, "aka": "Best Western Dorval", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "An Airport property, located 2 minutes from Dorval (YUL) International airport, offering free wifi, free continental breakfast, on-site restaurant, and discounted Park and Stay rates."}
