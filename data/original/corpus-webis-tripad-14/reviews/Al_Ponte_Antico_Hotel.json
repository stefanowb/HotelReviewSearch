Our room had windows opening onto the canal and there was some noise from the water traffic, but this is nothing like that of a motor highway. The room was insulated enough from noise at night and we were willing to put up with a little noise to be able to look out onto the Grand Canal whenever we wanted. Being on the Grand Canal also allows for direct transfers to and from the hotel by water taxi and eliminates lugging bags through the streets.

We had a wonderful suite (apparently the best in the house) with a very large bedroom, separate lounge/desk area and with two huge windows that opened out onto the water of the Grand Canal. Whilst the bathroom was small, it was very modern and sufficient and the additional space in the suite more than compensated for it. The rooms were clean and the staff were all wonderful, the breakfasts delicious, with the eggs coming from Matteo's grandmothers farm and sitting on the balcony having breakfast in the mornings looking out on the the Grand Canal or drinks in the evening before going for dinner and then back for a nightcap, this was one of the highlights of Venice for us. Our third trip to Venice and staying with Matteo was like staying with a very good friend, but with five star service. A smaller hotel where the guests mingled with each other in the evening on the terrace (if you wished to do so) and there is no other place that we would consider staying in Venice in fact any time we are in Europe it would be a must stop.
