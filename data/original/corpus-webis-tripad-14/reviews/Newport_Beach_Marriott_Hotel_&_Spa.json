The bed was a King size bed and it was very comfortable with soft sheets. I did get a good night's sleep because of how comfortable the bed was. The hotel itself was a little crowded with business travelers. The staff was very nice but I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you like peace and quiet. We did enjoy happy hour at the bar downstairs but it was also packed with people. It was very loud and hard to talk unless you yelled. Parking was expensive, I believe it was $22.00 dollars to self park. We are gold members so we didn't have to pay for wireless internet but if you don't have status with Marriott they charge you for that too. I just think this hotel was a little too expensive for the room that I received. I also think if you self park, you shouldn't have to pay for it.
