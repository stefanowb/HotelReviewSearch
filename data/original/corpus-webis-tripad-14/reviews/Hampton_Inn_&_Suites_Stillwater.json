Each stay has been an enjoyable experience. The rooms are clean and well kept. I have noticed very little noise from either outside the hotel or within the hotel itself. The hotel itself, overall, is kept very clean. The lobby and breakfast areas are very nice, particularly when the temperature is cool enough to have the gas fire place lit. Just as important, the staff is as friendly as any I have encountered. And it\u2019s more than just the front desk. The Maintenance staff, cleaning personnel, etc., were all openly friendly during my stay.
