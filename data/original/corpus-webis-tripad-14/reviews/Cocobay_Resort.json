The cottage itself was OK, clean and reasonably presentable, the bed was OK. A lovely balcony, pity that the sun only shined there for about 1 hour in the mornings! The food, breakfast's were OK lunch got more unpalatable as the week went on, Dinner went the same way, at best unpalatable at worst inedible. You just knew what you were going to get the next by what you had the day before only warmed up and still unpalatable IMHO.

The \u201cPool\u201d would be nice if you could imagine nice teak wood planking, a Jacuzzi each end of the decking and at least twice the size, what you got was some gnarled old wood planks which were almost rotten with bad joints and nails sticking up and repaired splices which didn\u2019t match the thickness of the adjacent planks and the wooden loungers that had seen better days, I don\u2019t mind \u201crustic\u201d but the condition of the pool and its surroundings defied the meaning of the word!
