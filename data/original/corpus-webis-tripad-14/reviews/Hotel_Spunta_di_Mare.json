People were friendly and the food a bit like very tasty home cooking (2 menus to choose from). We were in the part without a lift: not recommended if you have back problems ... The room was clean and functional. I would probably not stay for more than 1 or 2 nights as the area is not the nicest on the island and the hotel correct with regard to its price category bot not exactly homely.", "title": "Simple, functional and not far from airport", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "asmile", "date": "October 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 47682796}], "location": {"country": "France", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 21, "very good": 56, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 24}, "aka": "Hotel Spunta Di Mare Ajaccio, Corsica", "slim_ranking": 0.3125}
