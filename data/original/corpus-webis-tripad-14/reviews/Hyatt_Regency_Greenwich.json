The property is beautiful and a welcoming business-type hotel. Reception was friendly but a bit distracted (the two receptionists were actually counting cash spread all over the counter - I thought that odd). I was asked if I wanted a room close to the elevator. I responded that I wanted a king-size bed in a very quiet room. I was told that a recently-renovated room on the top floor would be perfect. Card-key in hand I trundled to the 4th floor room 4042... quite a distance from the elevator (good start!). The room was clean and nicely appointed... quite large and comfy. Ten minutes after arriving in the room, another couple was trying to enter. They had been checked into the same room by the reception staff (remember I said Reception was distracted?). I called down and reported the SNAFU. I received another call a few minutes later apologizing and acknowledging the error. Now, at about twenty minutes in the room the noise began. Teenagers running, traipsing, marching, ambling back-and-forth down the l-o-n-g hallway... unable (as teenagers are) to modulate their voices. The hotel, it turns out, was overrun with them. This went on all the way until I left the hotel to conduct my business at 5 PM. I returned to the hotel at 10 :30 PM and there were, if one can believe it, MORE teenagers than before... all attending one of the various functions.

I was impressed by the staff, the reception and concierge help, and the interior, which was surprisingly pretty.(if predictably corporate). One caution, our room required quite a long walk from the elevator, a tough trip on two replacement hips. We were advised to stay away from the apparently noisy atrium rooms, which i think was too cautious, because at 11:00pm, it was pretty quiet on a Saturday night.", "title": "Very well run.", "user": "cycle11", "date": "October 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 182016648}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Trip to Greenwich", "text": "A fine property, which I would recommend for events or a trip to the \"Stanwich\" area.", "user": "MJC991", "date": "October 22, 2013", "id": 182002979}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We are long time Hyatt Gold Passport members and have enjoyed many lovely stays in Hyatt properties around the world.

Everyone we encountered, without exception, seemed to be personally dedicated to making sure our stay was exceeding expectations. From the valet drive to the front desk (Pam was very helpful) to wait staff to the housekeeping staff, everyone was smiling, energetic, asked if they could be of help.
