On leaving very early at 5.30 in the morning, the receptionist was efficient and friendly and made me feel that my custom had been valued. The hotel is well placed for Angel tube station and Kings Cross / St. Pancras underground station is only about 10 minutes walk away along Pentonville Road, so if you have a rollercase/bag its a comfortable walk from there too. As you leave the hotel and turn left to walk into Islington, after about 200m there is a small row of shops on the left which has a cafe serving an excellent traditional breakfast for \u00a33.99 (there is a choice of three or four options / combinations). If you are looking for nice friendly bars / pubs there is a wide variety in Islington plus lots of restaurants/ eateries to suit all tastes and budgets. For getting around, the off-peak day tickets are excellent value, you can use them any time after 9.30 in the morning for the rest of the day (or all day Sat / Sun) and at \u00a35.40 for the Zones 1& 2 option which covers everything you are likely to want to get to in central London, they will save you an absolute fortune if you are making several journeys on the Tube. You can order and pay for tube /t ransport saver tickets via thetube.com website and have them sent to you though the post. I certainly had an enjoyable break staying at this hotel, liked staying in Islington (I usually stay in the Marble Arch area) and for the price (\u00a390 per night ) such a nice hotel in London was excellent value.
