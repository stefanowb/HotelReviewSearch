I searched trip advisor for reviews of available hotels and they all pretty much said the same thing, very run down, poor, with the brittania rating poor but better than the other available options. So we decided to take a chance as we were only going to be staying one night. Check in was quick and hasstle free (we arrived just before 2pm) I had booked two executive doubles and how different were they ! We went to the first room which was extremely small very dreary and tired. It didnt say executve in any way to me. A maintenance guy called in to fix the tv remote so i asked him if all the rooms were like this, he replied \"no some are bigger\" so i expressed my disappointment to him. He then said he would get the duty manager for me and about five minutes later Duty Manager Cecile turned up. To cut a long story short she changed our room and moved us to another floor in a room next to the other room we had booked. Why these werent together in the first place i dont know but the second room was so much better. Big bright and airy and redecorated. It still wasnt extremely fancy but this is only a 3 star hotel so we were happy with our second selection. Now i think we were only accomodated because we checked in early if you turn up late you get whats left. Breakfast was average with a good self service selection ok if its in your room rate. The whole hotel is undergiong a refurb and this is going to take some time as there is a lot of work to be done. You can see how grand it use to be but how neglected it has become over the years. Once the refurb is complete all the rooms should be bright and airy instead of dull and drab. Overall i found the staff friendly from tv repair guy to duty manager cecile to receptionists and our stay was a pleasant one in the end. My advise book manchester city centre hotels well ahead if possible or get to the hotel early with time to complain if you end up in an un refurbed room :-)", "title": "Thankyou duty manager Cecile !", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Derbyshire-MrsS", "date": "December 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 11281348, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Central location walking distance from train station and into town centre", "disliked": "\u2014 Undergoing refurbishment but a long way to go before its complete"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007", "text": "Check in took 20 mins.

The bedroom was poorly equipped with the wardrobe (it is an insult to other wardrobes to even give it that title) had sliding doors which were off their runners and it was so shallow that clothes had to be hung facing you and overlapping. It was a joke. The windows were filthy inside and out with miserable secodary glazing that hadn't seen a duster in an awful long time. The walls were marked and the choice of pictures on the walls were just odd - they wouldn't have even been in fashion in the 1970s. The noise from the downstairs discos (weddings) prevented us sleeping and we were on the third floor. We were really glad that we weren't on the first or second floor.

We were greeted on arrival by a very friendly member of staff. Our room was much bigger than we expected and very clean, if a little worn round the edges. Tea making facilities and toiletries were topped up every day as were clean towels. Food was of a good standard for a coach tour and staff were very friendly.Right in centre of Manchester, you are only a few minutes walk from Arndale Centre and lots of restaurants. Only downside was that Manchester have ceased to operate their \"Hop on Hop Off\" bus as as we were on limited time did not get chance to get all round sights we would have liked to see. Our tour with Urquhuart was excellent value for money and only downside was the driver!! He had no local knowledge at all and was late getting us everwhere. No people skills and when he introduced himself as Tim \"The Hun\" most of us were not amused!! But apart from that we had a great time,and if you ever go to Liverpool go the the Albert Docks. The museums are so interesting. We didn't even make it as far as the shops on this trip!! Trip to Bakewell was spoiled by very bad weather but looked a lovely little place to visit.", "title": "OK HOTEL IF YOU GET A DEAL!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "bob1323", "date": "August 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 75321875}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 330, "average": 402, "very good": 360, "terrible": 547, "excellent": 112}, "aka": "Britannia Hotel Manchester", "slim_ranking": 0.745762711864, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.5, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.5, "rooms": 2.5, "location": 4.5}}
