I can see what people are complaining about. The manager was a bit distracted when it came to admin and practical things but not so it must be said when he was serving food which he did with an enormous smile on his face. The service was a bit hit and miss at times but after a while we realised that they were a skeleton of staff who did everything and were always busy. The rooms although luwuriously done out and again with a bit of flair, were starting to looked a bit shabby around the edges. They need an odd job man to come in and tackle all of that. Having said all of that we were prepared to ignore all of that because of the stunning food in retaurant and we could see that we were staying in a special place. The Old Inn was very old and the architecture of the building and its grounds was so pleasing with it's low ceilings, big open fireplaces and cosy snug rooms. They had some nice ales on tap. It was decorated with real style and warmth using lovely colours on the walls wood and textiles and there were woollen blankets on every armchair. The restaurant is in an extension at the back of the pub and is rather like a summer house so the light streamed in. The total cost of the food inluding earlier aperetif and bar snacks for a three course meal with wine was \u00a385 for two. For that quality it was reasonable and portions were generous. The cleanliness and bed quality were excellent and yes take ear plugs if you're a light sleeper as the rooms are close together. We loved it and you cannot beat it's close location to the very beautiful Stroud Valleys. We paid \u00a3120 for a double room", "title": "Locally sourced fresh food on menu was utterly gorgeous", "user": "BaaCheshireUK", "date": "October 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119390592}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with family", "text": "( Cake and Ale ) incuding a gourmet breakfast with all local produce.

Sadly, over the past year, it'sgone downhill and now it's little more than a grill room: three different types of steak (with chips) some sausages, fish of the day (sic) with no indication of what might accompany it, some kind of duck and a token risotto for the vegetarians.

We weren't looking for luxury, just somewhere comfortable, nicely designed and with good food. The Ragged Cot looks great from its website and at some point, I expect it lived up to expectations. The room we had was spacious with lovely decor, a comfortable bed and tasteful fittings. Sadly it was also dirtry and extremely poorly maintained. The tiles in the bathroom were disgustingly stained and there was hair on the floor and in the shower. It could be a bad choice of tile is to blame, perhaps something more hardwearing would have been best but my first impression of the bathroom was 'yuk'. I moved a sheepskin rug by the bed which didn't look very clean to find an enormous stain on the carpet underneath. The paint was peeling by the extractor fan, on the windows and the nice wool blanket on the bed was covered in makeup. It was dissappointing. The food in the restaurant is actually quite good - we ate there for dinner - and the service not bad at all. It was the room that wasn't worth the pennies and the breakfast was nothing to write home about. Small things are also lacking - we asked for brown bread with our breakfast and heard the chef shout out that he didn't have any left. We expected the woman serving breakfast to come and apologise, instead, just some white plonked on the table without a word! The Ragged Cot feels like a business that has lost its way - or can't cope with the B&B side of the business as well.
