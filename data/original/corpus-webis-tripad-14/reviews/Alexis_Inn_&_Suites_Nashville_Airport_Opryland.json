Most of the nicer hotels near Vanderbilt's campus cost at least $150 per night. We don't mind the five-mile drive to the Alexis because we save a lot of money; therefore, we can visit our daughter more often. The rooms are fine! The beds are fantastic!! The pillow-top queen beds sure beat the full-size beds you get in many hotels. We have stayed at the Alexis at least eight times and have never had a bad experience. The free breakfast is very good. Personally, I think no one can complain about the Alexis since the prices are so good.

I'm sure you're most interested in the major flaw so I'll get that over with right away. The problem with this hotel is that their walls are paper thin, particularly the ones between the hallway and the rooms. Both nights we were there, people ran up and down the halls all night, yelling to each other, talking on cell phones, and slamming doors all hours of the night. This wouldn't have been so terrible if the walls weren't so thin, but you can hear every single sound inside the rooms. We had to turn the tv up loud to be able to drown out the noise, but it was extremely hard to get any sleep. There was also some noise from the busy intersection the hotel is located in front of. There is only one entrance/exit and it is hard to turn left onto the highway. We just turned right and turned around when needed, so that wasn't a big deal. It sounds bad so far, but there were good things about this hotel as well. The best thing was the price. We paid $50.00 + tax per night, which is extremely cheap in Nashville. The location is good as well. We were only 5 minutes away from Opry Mills and the Grand Ole Opry. Most of the musical shows and such were very close by. The hotel room was very nice, but a little small. The staff of the hotel are wonderful though. Everyone from the manager to the custodians were very polite, helpful, and willing to go out of their way for us. The hotel also has a small workout room, which is basically a treadmill and exercise bike, and a computer room as well for you to use the internet. All in all, we enjoyed our stay, but it would have been much better if we could have gotten some sleep. If the noise doesn't bother you, this is a wonderful motel to stay at.", "title": "Don't Expect A Good Night's Sleep", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "seekhimfirst82", "date": "July 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 8052120, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The helpful staff", "disliked": "\u2014 The noise heard through the walls"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Nashville"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 15, "average": 58, "very good": 107, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 103}, "aka": "Alexis Inn & Suites Nashville Airport Opryland Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.317567567568, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}}
