David went out of his way to make everyone feel happy to join him in the actvites. Elvis & Beatles tributes and the magician certainly kept us entertained in the evening. our rooms were cleaned everyday with fresh towels. all the staff were very friendly, whether we was at the bar, in the resturant or the reception. i would like to say a big thankyou to Rafael from reception who made our stay most enjoyable, with his warm welcome smile we found him to be kind caring friendly and approachable throughout our stay,", "title": "perfect holiday", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "rebecca42manchester", "date": "November 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120132508}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with family", "text": "you must visit siam park and loro parque they are great fun days out for all the family .", "title": "Great hols!", "user": "jackojoy", "date": "November 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 120130129}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not for us", "text": "i would definitely recommend this all inclusive hotel to anyone, we are most certainly booking to return in the future", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Julie G", "date": "November 2, 2011", "id": 120087604}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "from the Metcalfe family.", "title": "Fantastic Holiday", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sarahorbs", "date": "November 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120085914}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I was a bit dubious having read really differing views but I neednt have worried.

But the service etc was great. The hotel itself is really nicely laid out, our room was really spacious, yes dated and if I am honest if I sat around and started looking closely at things I could probably list a good few things that were not up to scratch but as far as I was concerned I was only sleeping and showering in there!
