The taxi journey was short from the bus station where we got dropped off on the ecobaja shuttle from Cabo airport and immediately we were impressed with the look of the Costabaja development. The open airy lobby is lovely and the rooms are modern and well appointed although some may not like the slightly odd glass shower cubicle right in the middle of the room. Service was always friendly with Israel in particular a stand out helpful guy. We ate at the Italian restaurant at the Marina in the evenings and the food was excellent and fairly reasonably priced for a upscale resort - you can charge the bill to your hotel bill which is convenient. We also took and excellent tour to Spiritu Sanctu Island to swim with the sealions with Fun Baja who are also at the marina - all arranged by the hotel. There has clearly been a large investment in the CB development and I hope that it pays off as its in a lovely spot and will certainly be back. Pretty faultless couple of days - only service glitch was terrible service at Hemingways - gave up after 3 attempts to order a drink and went elsewhere.

The evenings were cool enough that we left the sliding door open and listened to the waves breaking gently on the beach. Our room had a small refrigerator. The staff was very attentive and quickly learned your name and of course your drink of preference. I dont recall all of their names but special thanks to Jose, Leopoldo and Israel. The morning breakfast buffet was excellent lots of choices every day. The beach club also had excellent food. We were always so stuffed from breakfast that we would order the octopus appetizer or ceviche and share it for lunch. The restuarants in the Marina are very good, but dont forget to go into La Paz to experience the wonderful restuarants. There is a free shuttle bus or a cab (120 pesos).
