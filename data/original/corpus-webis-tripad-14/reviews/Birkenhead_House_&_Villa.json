Then we were served lunch by the in house chef, before being shown our room, which was absolutely amazing, and had a fantatic view over the water. The artwork in the villa is really beautiful, and the food is simply amazing! For dinner we just popped downstairs, which had been lit up with candles, and sat down in what felt like our own dining room with the other couple who were staying there.
