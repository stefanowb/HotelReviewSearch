We've tried to find decent accommodation all over the Highlands as we're up there a lot, and it's very difficult to get away from flowery B&B syndrome. Braeriach is different. Fiona has great taste, and it's like being at home - you can curl up in the sitting room in front of a roaring fire and it's just heaven. The family who run it are very welcoming and the meals are superb, so definitely go for that. There's the river flowing past outside, and it's in a really handy spot too for all sorts of Highland pastimes.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "KrissyT", "date": "July 6, 2005", "id": 3640228}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 10}, "aka": "Braeriach Guest House Kingussie, Scotland, UK", "slim_ranking": 0.708333333333}
