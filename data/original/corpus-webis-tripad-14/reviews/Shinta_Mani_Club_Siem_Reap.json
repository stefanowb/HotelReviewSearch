Breakfast is simply outstanding, including sparkling wine! Free minibar with Cokes, soda water, beer, water, juices and nuts. Laundry done perfectly and same day. Nightly turn down with a treat. In room tea and coffee. Good safe that fit my laptop. iPod dock (you'll need to bring an adapter if you have iPhone 5 or higher). Nice music playing when you enter room the first time. Lovely lotus flower arrangement in room. 2 oranges in room for your enjoyment with plate, napkin and utensils. Bed is wonderfully comfortable. Plenty of hot water and powerful A/C. Great linens. Comfy bed. Little noise (and I was right across from restaurant and bar). If you can't find the hairdryer, it's in a drawer in the wardrobe. No need for adapter as electrical outlets accept US standard plugs (ensure you don't need a converter before you plug in, of course!). Nice lap pool; cold drinking water just materializes when you sit in a lounge chair.

We asked to have someone look at the a/c in both rooms. They did, but there was no improvement. In the second room we stayed in, the overhead shower did not work, though the hand-held shower did. The telephone in the second room did not work.
