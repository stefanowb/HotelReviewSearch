First of all there is construction going on at the hotel. The majority of us arrived on Thursday and unfortunately the hotel either wasn't prepared or equipped to handle such a large crowd converging at one time. Many of us stood in the registration line for 3 hours or more waiting to check-in and get keys for our rooms. Upon our departure the hotel did acknowledge that something happened, but they weren't sure what it was and was working to determine what the problem was and to fix it. They did give all of us our final night stay free of charge, so I guess some concessions were made. I also self-parked and asked how often the shuttle service ran. I was told it was a constant circulation. However, I attempted to catch the shuttle at 4:15 on Monday morning so that I could to take someone to the airport. The shuttle didn't come back to the hotel until 4:43...again, no one can explain that one either. For the price of our \"group\" discounted rooms I really expected to at least have coffee, a refrigerator and microwave in the room. None of those exist and an additional \"hotel service fee\" is charged to you on each day to partake in continental breakfast and coffee in the lobby. A refrigerator can be \"rented\" for an additional daily charge. The hotel staff was pleasant and the rooms were very clean and well kept. It is on the trolley route and you can get to a lot of locations up and down International Drive without having to drive. There are several bars and restaurants in the hotel lobby as well.
