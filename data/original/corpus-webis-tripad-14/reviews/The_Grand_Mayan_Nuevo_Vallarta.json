We spent almost the entire week relaxing by the pool. The pool area is huge! There is a water playground for the kids, two wave pools, a nice long river pool, and five linked pools. There was not charge for use of the inner tubes in the river pool and wave pools. There are not any hot tubs but in January we really didn't miss it. The daily highs were around 83-85 degrees. The pool that is near the main entrance to the river pool has circular fountains in the middle that shoot out warm water, so this pool is at least 85 degrees and the pools get cooler and cooler as you walk from one to the other away from the warm fountain. We were surprised to have decently strong drinks from the pool bar. Happy hour was from 12-1 and the 16oz. drinks were 70 pesos (about $7). After happy hour the price went up 1 dollar. Compared to pool bar drinks in the U.S. this isn't too bad at all.", "title": "Very Relaxing!

We are in our 20's but most people there were middle-aged or older with a few young families. We weren't bothered by children running around screaming or drunk young party people. We arrived at 4pm and were told it would be 1 hour before our rooms were ready. We checked back at 5pm and they said it would be another half hour. They finally gave us the room keys and found the maid still finishing up the room. But it was very cleaned and everything worked just fine. We were told by the concierge that there would be a $30 (American) charge for using the safe but it was not on our bill when we checked out. We kept all out receipts and doubled checked our bill at the end. There were no problems there. We had a one bedroom unit which included a full kitchen without an oven. No hotel units in Mexico have ovens. We went to the Walmart for a $6 (American) cab ride each way. I heard the selection at Mega is better and the ride is only $2 more, but we made do with Walmart. We had breakfasts and half our lunches and dinners in our room. We left 1-2 dollars for the maid each morning and she left us lots of fresh towels and cleaned all our dirty dishes. The beds are firm but not the firmest we've had in Mexico. Our backs didn't get sore. We had a small pool on our balcony but didn't really use it. They called our view a golf course view but it was only partial golf course. THe rest of the golf course is under construction. We didn't mind the construction view since it wasn't too loud and we still saw Puerto Vallarta and the mountains in the distance. There were 3 daybeds/sofas (see photo), one in the bedroom and two in the living room. Each has about a twin size foam daybed with a cot size trundle underneath each. So technically you could sleep 8 in the one bedroom unit. The staff were very friendly as were the other guests. I have never been to a hotel where people talked to strangers in the elevator or pool so much. Many people who we talked to, both owners and RCI exchangers, have returned year after year. We were told there would be a $15 (American) daily charge for use of the gym and spa. My husband went to the weight room twice and we were not charged. The gelato by the gym is excellent! There is a little store at the resort with some basic foods, cereal, milk, coke liquor, water. But U.S. brand name stuff is expensive. We bought rum, coke and clear plastic cups at Walmart and took our own drinks to the pool. The pool bar uses clear plastic cups too and no one said anything to us. There is a computer in the room which we were told internet for is $13 (American) per day. There is an internet cafe with computers to use or wireless access. We paid 80 pesos for 30 minutes and 50 pesos for 15 minutes. (about $8 or $5)", "title": "Fantastic resort!

We ordered room service once. A cheeseburger and fries was about $12 (120 pesos). We ate at Samba at the resort and enjoyed it. For a resort the prices were quite reasonable. Club sandwich with chicken breast was $12. We also ate at the Italian restaurant on site. THe lasagna was only $12 but nothing particularly yummy. Not nearly as expensive as Hawaii. La Laguna Tino's is a $3 (American) cab ride or 20 minute walk away and is open air on the lagoon. There was a live mariachi band. It was okay, the drinks were weak. It is a seafood place. We went a couple times to Quioxte's at the marina. The marina is about a 10 minute walk north from the resort. You can take the road, catch a golf cart, or walk along the beach. Quioxte's is a very friendly tapas restaurant. We mainly enjoyed the chocolate lava cake. We also had burgers at another marina restaurant, can't remember the name. The service was slow, we were the only table, but the food was good and cheap. For really good fresh Mexican food go into Puerto Vallarta to Pipi's. It is a couple blocks off the Malecon and everyone knows where it is. The portions were huge and delicious. THey make fresh guacamole at your table and have enourmous margaritas. They filter their water so it is safe to drink. This was the most expensive meal we had at about $40 (American) for the two of us. The cab ride into Puerto Vallarta was 160 pesos (about $16) and back was 210 pesos. There are plenty of touristy shopping places and chain restaurants along the Malecon. We took a cab to Bucerias for about $11 (American).

THe airport timeshare people will offer tours and free rides to your hotel. Don't fall for it! THey take you to other resorts for presentations and often won't even take you to your hotel unless you buy. The Grand Mayan tried to get us to do their presentation at check in.

The restaurant food was mediocre. Great pools and beach but our room had a terrible odor. I thought the odor was related to the air conditioning and I called maintenance but the odor never went away. Housekeeping sprayed something on the drapes (probably Fabreeze) but that only lasted 5 minutes and we lived with the odor the entire week. Watch out for the time share sales pitch. I could barely get away from them. When we said we would not sign that day they kept bringing new people to the table to draw more boxes and explain the benefits in a simplistic mathematical way. I am a CPA and you do not analyze this type of investment the way that they explained it. When we told them we were leaving they took us to another room so we could \"collect our prizes\". There was one last attempt to sell us a time share from the owner's representative as opposed to the third party marketing force in the other room. When that failed two more people tried to sell us vacation packages. As it turned out we already qualified for the \"prizes\" (discounts off hotel bill) without having to go to the other room. We wasted half a day which was not worth it given the total discount that we received off our bill. We found that all of the sales people were not cordial when they finally understood that we were not singing a document with them that day.

The pools are wonderful and although we did not have kids with us, there were a great number of children/families there. It would seem to be a paradise for them and lots to do geared for kids. The food is fine but overpriced. The breaskfast buffett was good but not for $220 pesos per person. The hotel/studio rooms do not have a mini refrigerator, microwave or a coffee maker. A coffee maker would have been nice. The drinks at the pool bar were also over priced, $95 pesos for a 20 oz. pina colada and $55 pesos for a Corona. Understandably, you are not allowed to buy your own and bring it to the pool. Hit the pool bar from noon to 1pm during happy hour, prices are about 1/2 price on several drinks. The beach was ok but nothing special, you can't walk very far. Suggestions for dinner: There are several great places to eat within walking distance. The Willows is excellent, they have wonderful seafood. It's located just out the gates of the resort and 1 and 1/2 blocks to your right, maybe a 20 minute walk. Great food, excellent bar tenders, live music, and TV's so you don't miss the game. A cab ride is about 3 dollars. Also, Eddie's is great food for breakfast and dinner, very good seafood. To find it, take a left when leaving the Mayan hotel, (not at the gates) and follow the sidewalk to the bus stop just past the Sea Garden. Take a left and follow the walk to the Marina. You can't miss it. This area also has Guidos and 8 Tosdados. All are very good. For another breakfast outing go to Estudio, again from the bus stop go across the street (past the OXXO) and follow the court yard to the marina, Estudios is on the right near Vallarta Adventures.", "title": "Things to know before you go", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "smski", "date": "December 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 50634806}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled with family", "text": "All the food we ate there was great, we were never disappointed.", "title": "Perfect Family Vacation", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "thelevinefamily", "date": "November 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 50343439}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We just returned from a Thanksgiving week stay in a two bedroom unit at the Grand Mayan.

We put it all in the safe, locked it and went down to the pool for the day as we knew we didn't need to bring cash with us because everything gets charged to your room. While at the pool, someone opened the safe, took the cash out of my hand purse, and locked it back up so we wouldn't know. Another coincidence is that we happen to go to a restaurant for dinner that night that didn't except credit cards. So I went to pull out my cash, only to find out $200 was missing and I only had $120 left in my purse!! I was sick. My hand bag had NOT left my side all night, and in fact was set on top of the table and NEVER left unattended for someone to steel from. The ONLY way someone took the money was from steeling it from the room safe where it had been all day until dinner. We are 100% sure it was stolen from the safe because we were very meticulous that day with our money and locking the safe.
