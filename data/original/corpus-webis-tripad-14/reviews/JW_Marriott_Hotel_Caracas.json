Although my room was not ready when I arrived, I was asked to wait in the lobby while a room would be assigned. During the approximately 15 minutes that I was in the lobby waiting or outside smoking a cigarette, I was updated at least 3 times personally by a member of the staff as to the status of my room. Once the room was ready, I was pleased to learn that I had been upgraded to a suite; it was the only smoking room available and rather than give me the \"I'm sorry, no more smoking rooms\" I've gotten at other hotels, the staff generously gave me the suite so that I could be comfortable.", "title": "Fantastic", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ben_cohen", "date": "April 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4984135}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Bland hotel in an awful city", "text": "The room is exactly what you'd expect of a JW Marriott---exceptionally clean, well-stocked mini-bar, plush beds, extensive chocie of tv channels, etc., etc. Housekeeping came around at least twice a day to see if I needed anything, more water, more amenities, etc.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 13, 2006", "id": 4456030}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved the Marriott!", "text": "Negatives: just a few. First, the room service menu is very confusing in its lay-out and limited in what it offers. In a city where going out at night is not an option, I wish there would've a wider selection of items to choose and frankly, the food I did select was rather bland. Second, while you can actually walk around the immediate area during the daytime, it's not advisable to do so once it's dark. This is typical of Caracas; however, being stuck in a hotel that's somewhat cookie-cutter in design can get boring---the Tamanaco, while more \"isolated\", certainly has more atmosphere both during the day and night. Finally, the fare for car service to and from the airport is absurdly high---almost $95 each way!!!!
