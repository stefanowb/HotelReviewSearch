Our room was very dated and on the 39th floor which means you are next to a function suite to the extent the toilets were outside our room. We complained about this to reception but they said they were full and had no other room to give us. I have no doubt this was true but the question I would ask why would they have even designed the hotel so it has rooms on a function floor? We ended up checking out a day early even though the room had been paid for and was no refundable.... This may seem a little drastic but we simply had a nicer place to stay in hong kong than a dated room next to what ever function they that on that day/night! We complained again on checkout and the receptionist did get the assistant manager who offered us another room which we declined then they took off a room service charge which was only small. They also gave us a lift to the IFC in the hotel car as a gesture.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Stucros", "date": "September 28, 2012", "id": 141542748}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The manager did think on his feet which I liked but in a first class hotel we were give a second class room for a four night stay I think they need to think bigger....
