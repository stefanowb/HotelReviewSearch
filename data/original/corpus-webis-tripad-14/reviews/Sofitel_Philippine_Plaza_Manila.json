Average wait time of 10 minutes at the front desk to be served, an even longer wait time for metered taxi's because of the hotel's location being so remote, being told that although i booked a Luxury Room that for me to get a new Luxury Room i need to pay double of what i actually paid otherwise i will be given an older room on a lower level floor, the room was horrific, thin walls so all could be heared from outside. Considering i could have stayed in Makati in a bigger/newer room and paid much less. cannot recommend this hotel for any reason.", "title": "Very Disappointed!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "GCaceres", "date": "May 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 130922695}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "My mom stayed in this hotel for 5days and I gave her a visit. The pool area has a marvelous view because of the manila bay. But the interior is so plain, it has a countryside theme in colors and the balcony was made of wood so my daughter was so afraid to step on it. I think its unsafe too. They put the non complimentary items on the mini bar so if you are un aware, you might mistaken the evian water as complimentary just to know it cost 240pesos. The complimentary items are in the bathroom area which is i think not good that you would put a drinking water inside the bathroom.The room key card/ television malfuntioning which causes some inconvenience specially if you are here for business purposes as this will cause time hassles. The public transport is also not easily accesible so can't recommend if you are in a tight budget. The worst is that there is no broadband signal inside the room, which will push you to subscribe in their paid internet connection. But on the other hand, the staff we're the best part of it, they are friendly and accomodating, which embodies the Filipino hospitality.", "title": "No for the hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Elle_beauty", "date": "May 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 130620456}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for 5 nights and found the service excellent.

Nice staff, great room. No problems except for the pool area. Looking at the pictures on the website, i saw myself sitting in a lounger next to the pool, sipping a mango shake, working on my suntan. Instead, we were surrounded by hundreds of screaming Filipino children and their parents taking pictures of said kids. They turned the entire pool into a public swimming pool, with a lifeguard blowing a whistle every 30 seconds and yelling at some disorderly kids. There was a wedding party going on, so while trying to ignore the screaming kids and relax, we had well-dressed members of the wedding party walking over us taking pictures, giving US dirty looks, as if WE didn't belong there! I booked the room for three nights, but after the first day we never went back to the pool, as it was constantly filled with screaming, splashing kids. They were also running around the entire grassy area, running into people. Sofitel even built a playground for them near the pool, for their enjoyment. Forget the people who pay top-dollar for a room, it seems they are more concerned with the children.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Dharma_Punk", "date": "June 1, 2012", "id": 131057188}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We only spent 2 nights here and arrived late the first night due to a delayed flight. Hotel is very nice and we did feel out of place in the lobby with shorts and t-shirts on (but nobody said anything). The greeter at the front door was wearing a nice evening gown. The main restaurant is still under renovation from the earlier flood but we had to leave early in the morning to get to the Sun Cruise dock for a day trip to Corregidor island. It was great as the hotel is so close you can walk to the pier in 5 minutes. That night we took the hotel shuttle to the Mall of Asia but had to take a taxi back since the shuttle stopped at 8pm (taxis are cheap in Manila compare to NY). We had hoped to go enjoy the pool but there was lightning so they closed the pool.
