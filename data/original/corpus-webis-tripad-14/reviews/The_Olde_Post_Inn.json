Once we were settled in our comfortable en-suite room, we decided to have dinner that evening as well. We made it just in time for the Early Bird, and Oh. My. God. The complimentary amuse-bouche crab cake prior to our starters was just the beginning of a wonderful evening of great food, great wine and great company. Recommendations? Try the duck and share the chocolate brownie dessert!

I believe it's a converted post office. When my wife was driving us there, I really had no clue where I was going to. When I got there, I was none the wiser, as I had never heard of it. I could see from the plaques on the wall that it's won best restaurant in Ulster several times and Bridgestone award of Best Restaurant for 2011 ! Well, the food didn't disappoint at all. We went with the 5 course meal for \u20ac56 each. I had a chicken and lobster caesar salad which was delicious. My wife had goats cheese. We both had soup which was tasty. My wife had a chicken main course while I went with the rib eye of Angus steak with bearnaise sauce. My wife had an apple tart for dessert. She said it was outstanding. I had a collection of ice creams and sorbets which I found acceptable enough. Overall the food was great. We were stuffed after it. It's not minimalist gourmet fare. They lash on the veg and potato to complement the main course. Easily 9/10 from both of us. We stayed over the night. It seemed we were the only ones. No sign of life. The bedroom was lovely. A huge bed with nice decor and a big plasma tv in the room. The bathroom was nice and clean as well. A small complaint would be that the weather was very warm and we left the window open, but there was noise coming from the bar till around 12.30am. Next time I will bring my earplugs ! The breakfast the following morning was absolutely outstanding. I had the full Irish. Everything on the plate was so tasty, especially the mushrooms and white pudding. The staff are the big selling point of this place. The owner was a lovely chatty person. The waiting staff were all very friendly as well. We will definitely be coming back here. I think we will bring my parents for a surprise trip the next time. It's a lovely restaurant in a lovely location. Great for total relaxation.
