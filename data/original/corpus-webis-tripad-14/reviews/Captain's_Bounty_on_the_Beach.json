We parked our car and walked every where we went. We had wonderful weather and the beach was full of people. The rooms are right on the beach. The sound of the waves is so relaxing. The towels were big and fluffy and all rooms had a refrig and microwave so helpful. But most of all the rooms have all been done over and with such taste. Our room was a soft yellow with new furniture and new beds. We slept so peacefully. The rooms were so clean. The staff couldn't of been more helpful.

Our most recent stay, 8/2005 was very disappointing. While the rooms have been 'updated' there are still multiple issues that the owner has neglected. The bugs - centipedes etc all over balcony & room; bedding is only changed every 3 days - we slept with sand every night. While the balcony provides a spectacular view of the ocean, all of the chairs on our balcony were broken. We have also found that the 'new owner' is not very 'kid friendly.' The room's were 'OK' as far as cleanliness - could of been much better. Be aware if you are located on the first floor - dog hair and water from plants continually 'drops' from the upper floors, onto front sidewalk. The owner, Tim, was very unprofessional and condescending when these issues were presented to him. Unfortunately, we have ended our 'yearly trip' to the Inn. We have already made reservations at another establishment for next summer.

Smoking is not allowed in the rooms, but is permitted on the balconies, which are incredibly small - perhaps no more than five feet in length and separated from adjacent units by only small metal railings. If guests in adjacent rooms are chain smokers, as ours were, you may be forced to vacate your balcony and close your patio doors. Although there was no A/C, the cool breeze would have been very pleasant with the patio door open. However, if we opened the door we had to deal with the second-hand smoke that permeated our room.

While at a great location, our stay could have been better. The person who made our reservation booked us in the middle of a family reunion, so that we had people on either side of us crossing over our balcony to visit with one another. In addition, the parking was terrible. With a limited number of spaces, we once had to drive our vehicle over the curb to fit in to a small spot left after a van with a hitch took up almost two spaces. There was also no air conditioning, which I didn't know about until we arrived and found one desk fan for the entire room.
