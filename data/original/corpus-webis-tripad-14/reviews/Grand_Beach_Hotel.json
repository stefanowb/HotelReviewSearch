When we arrived we loved the location. Directly on the beach! We asked the front desk staff if we could see a room before making a final decision to stay and were escorted by a bellman to an available room. We were so impressed with the room we checked in immediately. The decor is \"cloud\" white and comfy. There is a living area with a sofa bed, a full bath, a smaller bath with a shower only, a seperate (but not walled off) bedroom with large mirrored his/her closets. A mini-bar with fridge and snack bar ($) with bottled water and sweet and salty snacks are also available. There are very comfortable robes hanging in the closet that we practically lived in when we weren't on the beach. The outdoor restaurant was well-staffed and the food was very good.

The rooms are all white like the pictures and the view is amazing (we had a 1 bdrm suite w/ 2 bathrooms and 2 balconies) There were a few stains on the carpet which were reported immediately to the front desk and the mgr Jose compensated us which was really nice. There is a nice pool on the 7th fl for adults only and although the main pool is nice as well, you need to get there early to get a spot as there were many small children there. They should def work on getting more chairs out there. Beach is beautiful and yes you do have to pay $10 for each chair and umbrella I think it's worth it. The restaurant Chez Gaston has great food (you can also order from the pool + beach) but the menu is a little small and should have a little more variety. Be prepared as this is miami and the food + drinks are pricey but hey your on vacation! Hotel is in a perfect location.....far away enough to relax if you want to hang on the beach all day but close enough (about a $12 cab ride) to the action if thats your thing. The staff is extremely helpful and so professional which was a pleasant surprise. The only other thing I would suggest is they let ppl know they will need to leave a $75/night deposit on your cc, this is not mentioned on the website or confirmation email which is a little misleading.
