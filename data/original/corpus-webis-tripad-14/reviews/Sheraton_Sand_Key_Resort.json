The restaurant staff were really excellent. We did find te reception staff a little abrupt and cold, but the concierge staff made up for it 100 fold. Being from the UK, we were unfortunate on our last day to find that we were stuck in the US due to the Volcano in Iceland. The concierge phoned around and found us a room in another Sheraton hotel in Orlando. We were in a worrying situation, and the concierge were both helpful and sympathetic. Full marks ! I would stay at this hotel again, but they need to debug the bar area more often, my partner got savaged by sand flies (occupational hazard) in the bar on two occasions. In summary - rooms pretty good, view great (sea view), location great, restaurant great, most staff great, could do better on reception.

We added a fridge at $5/day and the maintenance man was there right away with the fridge, but the fridge was falling apart--the door was so bent out of shape that there was a gaping hole at the top.

The gulf is a short walk across the sandy area--no big deal. There were tons of shells covering the beach. This room was listed at $270 per night and with my AAA card it was $230--still expensive considering you pay extra for beach chairs and fridge--at least the poolside cafe's prices were reasonable. Rusty's Restaurant was fairly reasonable too.

I travel a lot and this is one of finest hotels I have stayed in. The hotel staff was great and very attentive to all our desires. A few points...Several reviewers have made comments the pool is too small and the beach too long of a walk. Absolutely untrue! The pool is beautiful, adequately sized, and was never overly crowded the 10 days I was there. If you want a bigger pool, try walking to the beach and swimming in the biggest pool in the world...the ocean. The beach is not \"too far\" to walk unless you are the laziest person in the world. It is several hundred yards to the beach and a very pleasant walk. If walking the length of two football fields upsets you, you have more problems than a vacation can deal with. We used every possible amenity in the hotel including all three restaurants, both stores, room service, the business center, and the poolside bar. All were exactly \"as advertised\" and very much to our liking. The hotel does not \"nickel and dime\" you to death as a few people have claimed. The hotel does not claim to be an all-inclusive resort and if you want something not included in your room price, you certainly must pay for it as you would at any other hotel. We enjoyed every minute of our stay at this hotel and after 10 days, we didn't want to leave. This hotel is definitely the No. 1 hotel in the Clearwater Beach area. Perfect location. The hotel is located on Sand Key which is just south of Clearwater Beach. You can drive over the bridge and play tourist for a while (with a few thousand of your closest friends:) and then escape back to the sanity of Sand Key in minutes.

My view was of the dirty rooftop :\\ There wasn't anything to do on the private beach, so we liked to go Clearwater beach for the activities.

At the check-in I was assigned room 315. Asked if it was a Water/Bay view and Linda mentioned it was a Parking lot view. I asked for something better and the only thing she was able to give me was 1st floor in front of a tennis court. First of all, who wants a 1st floor at a HOTEL? I mean if it was a Motel I would understand. But really????!!!! Plus, more noise/traffic on 1st floor than other floors. Secondly, how private is your suite when it is in front of a tennis court on the first floor? I was formerly at the Holiday Inn Express and my view faced the construction site. I purposely moved to come here to have a better view and closer to the water. So guess what? Room 315 doesn't face the parking lot. It faces a wall and A/C units (probably same room as vsquared13). Not even a parking lot lol! Called and again I got Linda. I kept asking for a better view and it seemed she didn\u2019t understand that I didn't want the 1st floor. You would think she would get it after repeating, \"I don't want 1st floor\". Worst of all, 315 faces the elevator where again, you can hear conversation of everyone coming and going.
