The aiport shuttle service was very convenient. Liked that the parking garage was gated and that there was an Applebee's next door. I really liked the renovated lobby and breakfast area. Checked out the outdoor pool and whirlpool, but didn't get to use them. Really liked the hot breakfast and 5:30 Kickback, and the customer service was excellent. We had a two room suite, which was really nice. It had two flat screen televisions with a great selection of channels, a kitchenette with a microwave, mini refrigerator, and sink, a couch, coffee table, table with chairs, and a desk with a rolling chair and the living room was separated from the bedroom by a sliding door. The hotel is in a very convenient location and it is not that far from the San Antonio Zoo and the River Walk downtown.

One bonus was that there was a bridge that connected my floor to the outdoor parking structure.
