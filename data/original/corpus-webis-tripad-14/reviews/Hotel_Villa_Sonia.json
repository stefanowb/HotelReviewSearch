Its hard to say whats not right but there are many minor things wrong that made its a good stay but feels it has alot more to offer. Keep in mind that this place is popular for local weddings which do look impressive but the downside is that the food on those nights for hotel guests is a lower prority to the staff.

The highlight for me other than the view is the swimming pool. Perfect temperature when I visited in June, soft water and little chemicals but still very clean. The food at lunchtime was OK but the service could be slow dependent on who was on duty. Food in the evening was acceptable but wouldn't wish to eat in the hotel every day. Good options available in the village. I used the hotel shuttle bus/car on a couple of occasions and the pick ups back were on time. Hotel clean and quite well run.
