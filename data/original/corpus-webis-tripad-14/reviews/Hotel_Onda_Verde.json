The Onda Verde is a well maintained, quiet little place where almost every room has a view (with balcony or terrace) of the spectacular coastline and azure water. There are pathways that lead down to the beach area, which is small and rocky where you\u2019ll find the water is crystal clear, calm and a deep bluish green. There are beach chairs, umbrellas and a small cafe as well as boat rentals. Part of the pathway leads to a stone wall area where bathers can also relax, but there are no chairs in this area, so if you don't mind laying out on a towel you can easily dive right into the water from this perch. If you want to experience the Amalfi Coast from the sea, you can easily negotiate a fair rate from one of the boaters down at the beach. My son and I wanted to do some snorkeling and see Positano from the sea so we spent an afternoon hugging the coastline, diving in the warm water exploring the small grottos, eventually coming upon the idyllic cliffside setting of Positano.", "title": "Very welcoming staff!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Natalie-Sutton", "date": "July 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 116037951}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lunch on the terrace", "text": "The pathways that lead down from the main hotel lead to some very good cafes all of which serve excellent local seafood at reasonable prices.", "user": "tericollins", "date": "July 14, 2011", "id": 115356255}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The restaurant at Onda Verde serves an excellent breakfast and nothing is quite as peaceful and beautiful as enjoying such a spectacular view watching the local fishermen and boaters start their day living off of the sea.

After a very interesting train ride, we opted to have Miro arrange for a driver pick us up from Sorrento as opposed to taking the SITA bus that runs from Sorrento to Praiano. The drive is beautiful out to Praiano. Francesco welcomed my husband and I with open arms; we are an young, American, multi-ethnic couple who receives strange looks from some people who do not realize that I am a Ph.D. and my husband also has a professional degree beyond a Bachelors; we're normal, happy, friendly, law-abiding citizens who like to travel the world. Everyone was kind, friendly, hospitable, wonderful to talk to, just really pleasant. The room was wonderful; super clean (I am a clean/germ/neat freak) and I was thrilled. The bed was comfortable - two twins pushed together with a thick pad on top that covered the middle so the gap wasn't noticeable. The bed (letto) had the warmest blankets; we slept with the doors open to the terrazza. We opted to purchase our room with half board, which included breakfast and dinner each day. The food was very good. Breakfast was typical Italian breakfast. Dinner was great! Large selection of seafood caught right there in the Sea and prepared by Chef. We loved the food, wine, service, and company. There are restaurants around the hotel, but we chose to eat with Miro; much easier. We went on the trip to Capri and had a ball. Worth the money and time. The hotel arranges it for you. Great time. One of our favorite things was the silence. It was so quiet, relaxing...not an airplane in sight for days. No loud cars.

We highly recommend if you have lots of luggage or are not good with TrenItalia, have MIro's driver pick you up in Napoli. **Do not try the Circumsuveviana. It could be very confusing or even dangerous if you do not speak Italian. I am extremely good with the Treni, speak Italian, and I was confused by that system. It is not TrenItalia. There were drunks, homeless, very questionable individuals on the circumsu. treno. Professionally we are not who are normally bothered by individuals from various socio-economic stratus, various races, ethnicities, cultures, etc., but this was not very comfortable. We would not allow our parents or children to travel on that treno; put it that way and my Dad lived in Europe for years. We normally travel EuroStar/FrecchiaRossa/Gento; this other treno was more like the worst inner city treno I'd ever seen. Avoid this: Simply have Miro arrange to have you picked up by the company called \"Flavio\" (Antonino owns it) and all will be ok. We were charged 90 Euro from the hotel to Napoli. Some drivers wanted 120 Euro, Antonino was cheaper. Next time, we will take the EuroStar to Napoli and be picked up there by Antonino, then Antonino will take us back...problem solved.
