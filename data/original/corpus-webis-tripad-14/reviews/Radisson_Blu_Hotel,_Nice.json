The hotel is right on the Promenade des Anglais (the waterfront avenue), facing right onto the beach and water. However, it is located considerably to the west of where the action is in Nice (by action is meant restaurants, shopping, bars, etc.). Although the hotel attempts to overcome its geographical disadvantage by running a shuttle into the heart of Nice, the hours of operation are quite limited, especially into the evenings. Our hotel room was spacious, clean, modern with every reasonable convenience. The staff were all friendly and very helpful, going out of their way to make one feel welcome. The buffet breakfast is really excellent. To overcome the hotel's location disadvantage, we simply took a taxi back to the hotel in the evening when we had exhausted Nice's active area (about 15 Euro's, which is not huge in the overall scheme of things of staying in Nice).", "title": "Excellent hotel right on waterfront, somewhat away from action", "user": "Calgarymember", "date": "October 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 10033147, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, right on the waterfront.

The beach is only a stones throw across the road and the airport is close (but not too close!) by. Otherwise the location is far from ideal. Its at least 30 minutes walk to reach the town centre, longer to the old town, but a pleasant walk. Took a taxi one night which cost 12 euros. Parking in the basement car park is pricey at around 20 euros a night but there are residential streets a couple of blocks back from the beach were you can park for free.
