BUT, if you want to stay in the absolutely best location of the Quartier Latin and not have to worry about having to put on airs to communicate with the staff, this is well worth checking out. I have stayed in, probably, every room of this hotel since I found it about 20 years ago. Some rooms are better than others (typical of ANY European hotel that's been around for a LONG time and is family-owned). It is not your typical \"box\", modern, cubicle. The first time I stayed here was with a group of students and we left our extra luggage in the basement (WELL before the current breakfast room was built) while taking a trip outside of Paris. Since then I've stayed here several times, both with students AND adults and have found it \"comfortable\" and within walking distance of the Orsay, Louvre, Notre-Dame, Luxembourg Gardens, and the oldest streets of the city. If you are an antique buff, you'll love being in the center of the antique shop district. If you love fashion, Louis Vuitton is facing the hotel and there's a Dior shop around the corner. If you love caf\u00e9s, Les Deux Magots and Caf\u00e9 du Flore are withing 100 feet of the hotel entrance. Try the Petit St Beno\u00eet for a restaurant that still retains the ambiance of the days of Sartre.", "title": "My favorite Paris hotel - and I've traveled to Paris since 1969", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "jim4thetravelpro", "date": "May 29, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5232279}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A great hotel, but they're remodeling (but I still recommend staying here)", "text": "In a city where you can EASILY pay $600 per night for a room, you'll find the Crystal to be a jewel (sometimes in the rough, perhaps).

It looks as if half of it is closed down, and the front is covered by scaffolding, but you can still see out to the street through the mesh covering. There were workers outside our window only one day out of the 5 we were there, but it was Easter weekend, so that may not always be true. We weren't in Paris to hang out in the room, anyway. The location is fantastic. Our room was small, but clean(the smoke smell faded after a day or so), the bathroom was newly remodeled, clean, and had a bathtub...and actually quite big by Parisian hotel standards. Our room faced the street, but since it was on the top floor, the noise wasn't bothersome. There is a lift, but it only goes up to the 4th floor, so if you stay on the top (5th) floor, you'll have to carry your bags up the last flight. But you simply can't beat the location. Right in the middle of everything. And I'm looking forward to see how it looks when the remodeling is done. I'm glad we stayed at this hotel during our stay, and I would definitely stay here again.

The service was great\u2014they even watched our bags for the few hours before check-in because we had arrived early, and the entire day after check-out until we took a taxi to the train station. The staff is completely bilingual and very friendly. Our twin room was small but clean. I will now mention some of its drawbacks before getting to its good aspects which as you will see, far outweigh them. 1. Our room did not have a bathtub, but instead, a shower stall with a rather flimsy shower curtain. (But maybe soaking in a nice tub is not really all that necessary for short term travellers, or for Parisians.) 2. The \u2018inner courtyard,\u2019 which our room faced, is not really a yard but a shady cement space on the inside of the building (imagine a donut, and the hole in the middle is the \u2018yard\u2019). The hotel had made an effort to make it nicer, placing a statue and some flowers on the space on the ground floor, but nevertheless, it is a constantly dim shaft which sometimes echoes with sounds from the other rooms facing it. The room is adequate for sleeping in, but if one plans on spending a substantial amount of time in the room and would appreciate natural light and some sort of view of the outside, the \u2018courtyard\u2019 rooms are not recommended. We were on the second floor and got practically no sun at all. Also, the wireless internet connection which we purchased for 10 Euros for 24 hours was also very slow and fickle in the room, perhaps due to its location. There was, though, a public computer terminal right off of the lobby area (available for those who had paid for Internet).", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 20, 2005", "id": 3684547}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Firstly, let me say that the Crystal Hotel was one of the few places in the Engadine that allowed us to book for 3 nights over Xmas.
