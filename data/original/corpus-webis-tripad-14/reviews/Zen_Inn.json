Run by the affable Liam and the lovely Wayan, the Zen Inn offers modest but very honest accommodations attached to a bar/restaurant that serves excellent food at reasonable prices. For residents a basic breakfast is inclusive in the price. And for a pittance more you can eat to your hearts' content in the English tradition of not having to eat again until the \"eat-all-you-can\" BBQ starts in the early evening (several days a week). Close to some of the best beaches on Bali and a hub for boats to other islands, the Zen Inn rocks. You'll make new friends and have a very good time.

The room was nice with an enclosed opatio area and a shower (indoor and outdoor). My only complaint would be that I think we needed a mosquito net- we got bitten by something at night.
