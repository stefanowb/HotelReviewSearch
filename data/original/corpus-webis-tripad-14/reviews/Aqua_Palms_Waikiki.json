The pool was incredibly tiny, I have never seen a smaller hotel pool. Our only complaint was the medicinal/chemical smell in the hot hallways. Not sure what that is from, but they really need to do something about it. And some air conditioning or ventilation of the hallways is needed. Some of the furniture is a little worn and rooms could stand some new wallpaper, but for the price we paid, I didn't expect a lot. All the staff we dealt with was friendly and helpful with the exception of the man at the tour desk, who was rude. The continental breakfast was only open from 7:30-9:00 a.m., so we were only able to take advantage of it 2 days. But the nearby Wailana Coffee House had excellent, reasonable breakfasts, and is open 24 hours a day. The bus stop is right in front of the hotel, and was very convenient for us. Buy the 4 day visitor pass at the ABC store for $20-it was a great deal that allowed us to ride the bus as much as we wanted.
