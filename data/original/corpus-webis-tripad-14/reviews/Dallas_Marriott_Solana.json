Beautiful architecture, friendly staff and spacious rooms. However, I had the bad luck of being given an adjoining room. It is unbelievable how thin these doors are!

One of those boxes contained a glass memorial candle holder which was shattered because he took the luggage cart down a ramp too fast.

It is not really \u201cnear\u201d anything but it isn\u2019t far either by local standards. If you want to walk out of your hotel in either downtown Fort Worth or Dallas, this is not your hotel. However, if you are interested in suburban upscale DFW and want to be near say SouthLake, it is well located. It is in the middle of a high-end office park and there is really nothing around it but big corporations.

The public areas are nice and the design attractive. The guest rooms are tasteful and many, if not all, have balconies. The pool/Jacuzzi area is nice, as is the nearby fitness club that you can use for free as a hotel guest. Certain issues however can ruin your trip (I have stayed in 3 different rooms.) Avoid rooms with adjoining doors to other rooms. The acoustics of these rooms is horrible. You can hear the person next-door converse on the phone, breathe heavily in their sleep, and pass gas. I am not exaggerating. When I complained to the front desk a woman said, \u201cmany of our guests complain how much they can hear and say it is creepy.\u201d Also avoid their handicapped rooms as you will have to contend with a VERY heavy bathroom door that must be closed every time you wish to exit the room as it obstructs the door into your actual room. The food in the restaurant, Cielo, is pretty good and a really reasonably priced buffet.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "PattiTX", "date": "December 29, 2004", "id": 2961328}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A wonderful stay", "text": "Bottom line: I would stay again but make sure I had the right room", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Anchier", "date": "September 3, 2004", "id": 2510660}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved this hotel", "text": "I live in the DFW area. We reserved a suite at the Marriott Solana for the use of bridemaids who would be coming from out of town for our daughter's wedding. We made the reservation months in advance. Two months before the wedding, the hotel notified us that we could not use the suite since a business group would be using it as well as all the other suites at this hotel. First they suggested that we would be given a hotel room with a balcony so the women would have a place to sit down (in the month of February!!) instead of the suite. When they were told we would be keeping our original reservation for the suite, the hotel then offered to give us a regular room with furniture removed to be used as a \"hospitality room\" with a frig stocked with snacks. We refused this offer insisting that we would keep our original reservation for a suite. We are still in the middle of this. The hotel has lousy customer relations and service. As of now this problem with them has not yet been resolved. I will never stay at a Marriott Hotel again. They obviously don't know how to treat people fairly. They are making a problem they brought upon themselves our problem.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "YorkResident", "date": "April 15, 2004", "id": 1786757}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Westlake"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 4, "very good": 42, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 54}, "aka": "Dallas Marriott Solana Hotel", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
