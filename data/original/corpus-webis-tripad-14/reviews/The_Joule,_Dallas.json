Once we got there, we ended up hardly leaving our hotel the entire 3 nights/4 days we were there over New Years Eve, as we loved our room and the hotel so much. We enjoyed the Charlie Palmer for dinner and drinks nightly, and were treated like VIP's everywhere we went. Todd at the Charlie Palmer bar was the best - our trip wouldn't have been the same without him. We experienced true Southern hospitality from Todd and the rest of the incredible staff our entire trip.

We only stayed one night and had so many issues. My patience was def tested at this hotel at the incompetence incurred. Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it. Wait it gets better! Then upon check out our bill was suppose to be for $320 but they charged $388, they claimed it was a hold authorization...I've never had a hotel do that upon checkout. They finally corrected that charge, but now 2 days later they have charged a separate additional charge of $121! So I called AGAIN to ask why, they said it was for mini bar. We went out for dinner and then straight to sleep, then left early in morning bc construction noise woke us up, so we didn't have time to eat anything from mini bar. Plus my husband doesn't drink and I'm 6 mths pregnant, so pretty sure we didn't access any alcohol at the mini bar. They havent offered any sort of compensation or lousy apology. Still waiting for this latest issue to be resolved after being trf to 3 ppl at the hotel. Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for. Save yourself the trouble and stay elsewhere. I'm spending more time sorting out issues than the time we spent in the room.

A visual masterpiece from award-winning designer Adam D. Tihany, the hotel creates a tasteful union of Old World quality and contemporary design with original marble flooring, richly colored fabrics, custom millwork, chrome, glass and populated throughout by original artwork from names including Andy Warhol, Tony Cragg, Adam Fuss and Richard Phillips. In addition to uniquely designed guestrooms and a spectacular penthouse, the property currently includes a cantilevered glass rooftop pool and bespoke lobby environment. Set in the heart of a burgeoning downtown, adjacent to the flagship Neiman Marcus and within walking distance of the internationally acclaimed Dallas Arts District, the hotel is ideally located. The Joule - an artfully delivered experience in an iconic setting infused with energy, style and passion."}
