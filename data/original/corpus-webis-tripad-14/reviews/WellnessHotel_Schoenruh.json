All public areas were clean and well kept and the staff were extremely helpful. We had the gourmet food package which in effect is dinner, lunch, bed and breakfast. Lunch is self service and can be taken any time from one until four in the afternoon.There is an outdoor eco pool and an indoor pool both of which are of a reasonable size. We didn't use the spa but it looked tempting! During our holiday, we walked in the mountains and the surrounding villages and using the bus/train transport systems is relatively easy.

We arrived at the hotel by car on New Year's eve, I had some difficulty accessing the hotel as cars were parked right up to the front steps. On enquiry I was told that there was nowhere to park, however after some conversation a place was found for us in the underground car park, at a cost of 4 euro\u2019s per night. We were then taken to our rooms, my husband and I were in room number 255, my daughter 253. Beware that the hotel seems to change the room numbers though. Entering the room I felt I was stepping back 25 years or so, the decor was very outdated with old furnishings, old fashioned wall paper, in places leaving the walls. The guilt edged pictures, rusty radiator, old chair, a mirrored fridge which also served as the t.v. stand, a bathroom 20 years out of date, complete with cracked sink, was not what I expected to find in an Austrian hotel of this class. The bedroom and bathroom were also very small. After taking a shower I stepped into the bedroom to get dry as there was not enough room in the bathroom, I am 5' 6\" and 11 stone! After complaining at reception we were told we had only booked a 'superior double, which is what we had been given, to call these rooms superior is a gross exaggeration. My daughter's room 253 was as bad. My son who was flying in was given a room at the other side of the hotel, it may as well have been another hotel, his beautifully furnished room (108) was a world away from the shabby rooms in the older part of the hotel. Things however were about to get a whole lot worse when around 1am on New Year's day we went to bed, room 255 is directly over the kitchen, which seems to run on trolleys which were pushed around most of the night, access to the kitchen is through a sliding door, again underneath room 255. These rooms should not be let out, certainly not for Schoenruh prices, they are old fashioned shabby noisy rooms that should not be in use, the sheets were well worn and in parts developing holes, the small towels again were well worn, together with the bath robes.", "title": "New Year at the Hotel Schoenruh", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Linda M", "date": "February 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 123978142}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "After two sleepless night we were able to up-grade to another room, for another 32 euro's per night we were given a beautifully decorated room, with a large walk in shower, a large bed and everything you would expect from a 4 star Austrian hotel.", "title": "My new favourite place", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ohsevenphive", "date": "October 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119815015}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "On New Year's eve there were more people booked into the hotel than the staff could cater for, we waited for an hour between courses, at which point we gave in and went to the bar.
