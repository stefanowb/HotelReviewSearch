I stayed at the Sheraton this time primarily due to an internet price offer and the 4 star rating of the hotel. But it's clear that the Sheraton sheds all it's normal charges in order to make the rm price look cheap -- while my quote was abt $200 a night -- in fact I paid abt $300 a night. On a two night stay that's a big \"surprise.\" Valet parking is $35 a night, and their non-valet parking is $28 a night and a block away. To be fair, Seattle parking in general is way overpriced -- comparable to NYC (where at least it seems merited). Internet is $9.95 per day. If you send packages ahead (as many of us business travelers do) you are charged on a sliding scale based on weight -- that added another $60 to my bill. AND they lost the most important box of the lot. While they made some \"visible\" efforts to look for the box -- the fact is that Fedex showed the box signed for, and their own system had logged it in -- but they could not locate. I've had better help at Motel 6 -- and they don't charge anything for internet or boxes. The room was a perfectly normal hotel room; ditto with bathroom -- in short, there is nothing here that \"special,\" they are overpriced, and service in this case was subpar. Also they seem to cater to conventions, large groups, so there are long waits for everything (elevator, bell boy, cashier, etc., and there usually 20 - 30 people out front smoking and blocking doorways. Everyone has their hand out (not unusual at a hotel like this, but even more blatant here -- and without much of a smile or effort) When I have to open my trunk and pack my bags in the car, it seems impertinent to be expecting a tip just for bringing the car up. Will not repeat this hotel, and frankly hurt my impression of Sheraton overall as well. I have had much more consistent and better visits at Hiltons lately. One small note -- there is a great Vietnamese restaurant around the corner called Bambuza -- don't miss it!

It started on the phone when I tried to get a room through Sheraton. The rate fluctuated with each phone call and I made 3 of them. I ended up calling and talking to the manager about the reservations department. First I was told that there was a military rate, then I was told that there wasn't one, then that there was only a military rate for the actual active military man and not the spouse. Which doesn't make sense. I gave up. didn't book a room, set my mind that I wouldn't try to stay there again. There are plenty of nice hotels in Seattle. We decided to priceline, got the rate we were looking for without the military discount and ended up at the Sheraton anyways!!! Fate!! Still the service sucked!

I was also disappointed in the internet service. I tried to connect from my room, but the connection was slow and did not work for very long. I eventually went downstairs to the lobby to use the free internet which worked much better. The hotel was very good about refunding the price of the internet service that I had paid for, but if they are going to make you pay they should at least offer dependable service. Another thing that I didn't like is that they did not give me all of the credit for my stay with the Starwood points program.

I was surprised the bathroom was a compact tub/shower combo with a single vanity sink. I expected a separate tub and shower for this size of room especially since this tower was recently built. They had a 32\" flat screen LCD TV which was nice however the room is so large it really needs a larger TV. We couldn't read the guide on the the TV because it was so far away from the bed. I loved all the space in this room. There was a large desk area and an over sized chair with an ottoman. there was a large dressing area near the entrance to the room and still lots of room to move around.
