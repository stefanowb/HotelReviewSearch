We had not intended on staying in Sandusky - but the kids preferred to get a hotel and return to Cedar Point the next day also. (We were already lodging in downtown Cleveland). As a joke, we told them, \"You find a great, clean hotel for less than $50.00 and we will do it! They pull out the laptop, and searched, and came up with the Maples. As parents, of course, we were leery, but then read the reviews. We decided to swing by and check it out. This was the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, and we were provided a room with 2 double beds, and a twin bed, for $45! It slept the 4 of us perfectly, and each kid was thrilled to have their own bed. Our daughter is very into history, and vintage, and this was perfect for her! For a one night stay, it was perfect. They said it reminded them of the cottages in the movie \"Niagara\". Not swanky, by any means, but a bit of the past, and wonderfully nice hosts. (We had to borrow tools for a car problem, and they were very accomodating!) Very short and pretty drive along the coast of Lake Erie to Cedar Point (took 7 minutes). Kids thought the front sign was cool - and couldn't believe there was a time when a color tv would be an advertising feature. In fact, they insisted on getting their pictures taken with it! I will upload those photos. They had free donuts, but they were all gone by 9:00 a.m., so be sure to get up early to get them. We ended up driving to the donut shop where they came from to buy our own, and they were delicious! Next time we are in Sandusky, we will be sure to stay here, and maybe add a day so that we can enjoy the hotel grounds and walking trails (across the street). Thanks again to the Maples family for a great impromptu stay!", "title": "Americana at it's best!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "gobux", "date": "June 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 16566642, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Price", "disliked": "\u2014 No wireless internet"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Sandusky"}, "variance": {"poor": 15, "average": 24, "very good": 61, "terrible": 13, "excellent": 110}, "aka": "Maples Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0588235294118, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 3.5, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}}
