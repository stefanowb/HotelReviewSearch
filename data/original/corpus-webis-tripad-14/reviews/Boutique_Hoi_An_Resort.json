It could be great but the lack of care and service sorely lets it down. With one or two exceptions, the staff were miserable and did nothing to make you feel like you were paying reasonable cash (by Vietnam standards) to stay at a good hotel. Whilst the place is quite new, it already feels tired in parts because standards have not been kept up e.g. soap dispenser broken and unusable in the pool bathrooms, spa bathrooms lacking any toiletries other then one set of shampoo and shower gel to be shared between all showers, towels throughout stained and worn. Breakfast was just ok. We often had to ask to be served tea and no effort was made to clean tables between sittings. We used the bikes one day only to discover within 5 mins we had a flat. When we returned to the hotel and told the bike attendant all he had to say when we pointed to the flat tyre was \"yes I know\". One day the pool ran out of towels. Room cleaning was patchy - often not until late in the day, sometimes they replaced towels, sometimes they took old ones away but didn't leave clean ones. None of these things would be a big deal in isolation but one thing after another becomes a bit eye rolling when you're supposed to be in a good hotel. Ok as a base only to explore Hoi An but don't rely on this place for anything more. Also a bit big and busy to be described as 'boutique'. I agree with other reviews that it feels soulless. Two sets of friends stayed here independently when it first opened and highly recommended it. Sadly with the passing of time it seems standards and service have slipped.

The ancient town of Hoi An, 30 km south of Da Nang, lies on the banks of the Thu Bon River. Occupied by early western traders, Hoi An was one of the major trading centers of Southeast Asia in the 16th century.Hoi An has a distinct Vietnamese atmosphere with low, tile-roofed houses and narrow streets; the original structure of some of these streets still remains almost intact. All the houses were made of wood, decorated with lacquered boards and panels engraved with old ancient characters. Pillars were also carved with ornamental designs. Hoi An have earned the town status as a heritage site by the UNESCO and has become a very popular tourist destination in Vietnam.All rooms are facing the sea with private balconies and some have direct access to the beach from private terraces. Room facilities featured single and double vanity, bathtub or shower, air-conditioning, television, IDD telephone, mini bar, safety box, hairdryer, wireless internet, coffee and tea making facilities. A large swimming pool is in the center of the resort surrounded by a tropical garden. A spa, located next to the pool, is a haven for pure relaxation and rejuvenation. Our spa facilities include three treatment rooms, five massage pavilions and two steam rooms. Pedicure and manicure services are also available at our resort\u2019s spa."}
