Michael and Helen have a talent for what they do; the place is immaculate; everything is provided; nothing is too much trouble (thanks for the use of the tumble dryer, Helen, it's the couple who insisted on walking round Damflask during the storm) and, above all, they have time for you. The house is ideally located; the views stunning and there's the Bradfield Brewery brewery tap, the Nag's Head just down the road!

And is certainly one of the best places I've EVER stayed in before. The family run guest house is very welcoming, wonderfully stress-free and extremely well organised. You will receive a first class breakfast, wonderful themed Robin of Loxley room with nice details and very comfortable bed. The dining area and lobby are both very spacious plus Helen and her husband exceptionally friendly, warm and helpful (especially when spotting my signs of a friends wedding party hangover!) I seriously could've stayed all week - and hopefully next time I will. Thank you so much for such a comfortable stay, I will highly recommend that others visit such a beautiful area of GB.
