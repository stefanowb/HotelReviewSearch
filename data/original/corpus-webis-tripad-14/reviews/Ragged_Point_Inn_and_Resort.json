The bath was totally scaled down simple - clean enough, but I have a BIG complaint in that, the shower was old, with a riketty door that hardly closed, and there is NOWHERE to put anything inside the shower!! No soap holder, just the bare shower walls. Come on you guys, how much would it cost to install a simple soap dish?? I hated putting my stuff directly on the shower floor!! yuk!
