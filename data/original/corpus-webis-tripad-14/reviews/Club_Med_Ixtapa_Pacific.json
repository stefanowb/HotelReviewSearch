We went with fairly low expectations and were pleasantly surprised. Remember this is Club Med, not the Ritz-Carlton. It's important to be in the right frame of mind when embarking on a Club Med vacation. If you are looking for fun in the sun, relaxation, lots of sports to choose from, very friendly and helpful staff, tons of food with lots of variety, simple and casual accommodations, fabulous activities for you and your kids, than this is the vacation for you. Our room was \"cute\" and resembled a college dorm room with stucco and tile. Regarding the bugs and lizards...yes we did have some ants, but they were TINY and were not in the sleeping area. We did see lizards, but they were not in our room at all. We mostly saw them in the evening on the ceilings in the hallways. Again, they were small and did not bother us at all. It's a tropical place and therefore critters do live there as well. I had heard about mold in the rooms and we had no mold whatsoever. Our air conditioning worked well in our room and the beds were not bad (even though it is true that they are mounted on a cement foundation). What I found to be the very best part of Club Med were the G.O.'s (staff members). They are young, energetic, amazingly talented, always helpful and friendly, and really made our week there unforgetable. These people bent over backwards to make our stay fantastic. We have a 12 year old son who had a blast. He met other kids his age, bonded with the G.O's by doing activities and shows with them, and just generally had lots of fun. We've only been home for a day and he is already trying to talk us into another Club Med vacation next year. We really enjoyed the nightly entertainment although some may think it's hokey. This destination is definitly geared for families with children. The kids are often times in the shows which as a parent was fun to watch. Adults are encouraged to participate as well. Other nights the G.O.'s provide the entertainment and they are a very talented bunch!!! I really can't say enough about the staff there. The food was pretty good and very plentiful. The best things there are the chocolate and white chocolate bread. The ice cream is fabulous as well.

I was looking forward to, but not excited by, the prospect of a ClubMed vacation. It was the first time I had ever taken such a vacation. Usually, I would actually take the time - a month or longer - to visit a country instead of go to a resort. I was uncomfortable and wary. The wife and kids (10 and 12), however, couldn't wait. Prior to leaving I checked the Trip Advisor site and came to the conclusion that some folks clearly had a axe to grind. One reviewer noted in response to previous negative posts that many Americans are not aware that the USA is a pretty cushy place to live and we automatically think that everywhere has the amenities that we take for granted e.g. great air conditioning. Everywhere isn't like the USA. Other reviewers gave Ixtapa ClubMed what I perceived to be a fair hearing and these are what I based my pre-trip thought process on. We were suposed to have a garden view room. Prior to departure, our AAA travel agent faxed a letter to the resort and asked for a specific complex with an ocean view despite the fact that none were available. I did not expect it to work, but, upon arrival, we were escorted to the VISTA apartments with an ocean view. It truly was a beautiful view. I get ahead of myself. We were not on the ClubMed charter but when we arrived at Z airport we were greeted by a well-dressed young man holding a sign with our name on it. He escorted us to an air-conditioned Suburban which whisked us safely, courteously, and comfortably 25 mins to our destination. We were met with music and the attention of 2 G.O.'s who took our bags, sat us down, and brought us a nice cool drink. A quick overview was given and then we were taken to our rooms on the third floor (which was great as there is less foot traffic). The kids had their own connecting room, which both they, and we, were happy about. The rooms are exactly the same as in the picture on the website. I thought there would be more, but the whole room except for entry and the bathroom area, are in the picture. Not big, but certainly big enough and well-appointed for this type of vacation with 2 beds, a window sofa, t.v., fridge, radio/c.d/clock/alarm and a coffee maker. The toilet was clean but small and felt a bit like a cave to me. The shower-a reviewer point of contention it seems-was just fine for us. A tad smaller than the one in our master bedroom but no big deal. Water pressure was okay but the shower did flucuate a bit between warm and cool. Essentially, if you are over 230lbs and 6'5\" I can see where you would have a problem, but otherwise...This is not a new resort, being over 30 years old, I believe, and as such, things like the tile in the bathrooms could do with an upgrade. But, everyting was clean..just a bit tired in places. Ants were there but stayed in the sink. The beds were a bit on the firm side as previously noted by other reviewers. The room did smell like it was next to the ocean but the scented candles I took to cover a reported mold smell never came out of the bag. The towels were new and fresh every day. And, as long as you are not bringing a massive suitcase full of clothes you will never wear, the storage space is adequate. The maid service was superb, with flowers folded into the facecloths every day. We went for a walk to familiarize ourselves with the layout and then took a reviewers advice and went to the 6:30 introductory meeting. It was very informal, but professional, and useful. Don't miss it. Then it was off to dinner. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality, choice, and quantity of ther offerings. It is not gourmet, but it is not cafeteria either. If you cannot find something you like, you are not trying. As you walk in, you indicate how many are in your party and are seated appropriately. If you want to sit with friends-old or new-it is no problem. If you want to sit at a particular table or place it is no problem. By the second day, our kids were going to dinner on their own so that they could eat with new friends. The restaurant is open and birds do fly in and out but the birds do not swoop down and pick food off anyones plate and there are no flies buzzing around either. The resort is extremely safe, although I would not let our 10 year old walk around on her own, I felt very comfortable with our 12 year old doing so (except the beach). If you prefer to go to the other restaurant, you do need to sign up at 11:30 at the bar. I kept forgetting to do so and, as a result, we never went. Others said it was very nice, albeit with the same food as the main restaurant. I can see where it would make a nice change especially for busy parents who would like a break from the kids. The G.O.'s eat at the main restaurant and are really nice, interesting, hard-working individuals. You will probably find a couple of them at your table most nights. There is always somewhere to eat, whether it is at the restaurants, bar, or pool bar. Food is not an issue. For that matter, neither is drink. There are soft drink machines available all day but watch out for the wasps which like to hang out there. They are not aggressive and in the week that we were there I did not meet anyone who was stung. after a day or so, you get used to them and ignore them. Also, alcohol flows as freely as you want at whatever time you want. One thing that bothered me is that the G.O.'s have to use tickets to purchase their drinks. They have a limited number of tickets and they don't last long as the G.O.'s are required to party with the guests. So, many guests (including me) just ordered their drinks for them. Hey, we've already paid and they work hard enough. It doesn't have to be a hush hush thing, so feel free to get the G.O.'s what they want right at the bar. The local bar tenders are the ones in the Hawaiian shirts. The ClubMed employee's are the ones who wear the same as every other G.O. You don't have to tip, but I did early and well and I got excellent service all week long. Whether that is connected or not, I couldn't say. After dinner there is a show in the open sided theater which a previous reviewer described as \"hokey\". I would tend to agree for some of the shows, but most of them included the kids at the resort and so, for us as we had kids, they were fun. Our kids loved being involved, too. The circus show (on Friday when we were there) should not be missed whether you have kids or not. After the show, which ends at about 10:15ish, the G.O.'s all head to the bar for some 'Let's get everyone going' action...They do the ClubMed songs and dances on the bar stage and those who cannot fit, dance on the dance floor. Everyone is encouraged to join in and, as much as you may not want to, within a few days you probably will. The bar stay pouring until 1am but that isn't necessarily when the partying stops. During the day, there is so much to do. Despite a previous reviewers comments, I did not see any browbeating of guests to participate in any activity...quite the opposite, in fact. The water aerobics, to which the reviewer was referring appeared to be very well attended principally because it was done in the pool where most adults were during the day AND it was a ton of fun. Perhaps aerobics were not their thing. Other activities you can chose to do or not are sailing (plus lessons), kayaking, beach volleyball, soccer, tennis (plus lessons), gym, water polo, and the ubiquitous trapeze. My typical day was a tennis lesson for an hour, on to sailing or kayaking, then gym (not many machines), to lunch at about 2ish, hang around by the pool for an hour, then to the trapeze at 4pm (which is adult time until 6pm). At 5pm I would either continue with the trapeze or play soccer until everyone dropped dead from exhaustion as the humidity in Aug really is dramatic. I didn't play volleyball, so can't speak to that. But, I can say that the sailing lessons were adequate-I'd never sailed before; the kayaking was excellent fun (try catching the waves on to the beach); the tennis lessons were great-I am a life long tennis player and benefited from them; the gym is not great as there is next to no equipment short of 2 treadmills, a couple of machines, and some free-weights; the soccer games are sometimes good-depends on who shows up; and the trapeze is amazing. If you do nothing else, place youirself in the safe hands of Russo, Kevin, Leeza, and Kenny and get yourself up the trapeze. From 5:30 to 6pm they teach the guests how to do 'catches' on the trapeze. Very cool. Tell them Nigel said hello. If you do well, you may find yourself in the Wed night trapeze show. After all of that activity, it was on to the bar for a couple of cold ones and then back to the room for a shower and dinner. The air conditioning was fine in our room. Despite all of my activity, my wife chose to do next to nothing and she loved that as much as I loved the activity. Our kids had a wonderful time in their respective programs and spent most of every day there despite us trying to extricate them from it every now and then just to say hi. The G.O.'s in the kids programs do a tremendous job and our kids were not only taken care of but watched over with genuine affection. No sunburn or overexposure at all. Their activities were appropriate and fun. The only excursion we took was for the dolphin experience. We chose the hour long version and it cost $126 for each kid. Expensive but, for our kids, it was a great experience never to be forgotten. The beach is beautiful and you can rent a seadoo on the beach if you want. It isn't cheap at $40 for 1/2 hour. Capitalism at its best! The beach is not beset with wandering salesmen as it is essentially a private beach. It is great for body surfing, warm but not clear due to the waves. One of the things that has not been mentioned much is the people you meet there. Our kids met some nice new friends, and my wife and I met some lovely people, too. This, I suppose, is one of the really good things about resort type vacations...if you want friends you have to make new ones. Many of us forget how to do it and it is a pleasant experience finding good people. One of my kids got sick but not because of the water. She had a cough which got worse over there. The nurses office ordered some Robitussin which was delivered to our door in about 2 hours. It was about the only medicine I forgot to pack. My wife did get very sick for 24 hours with a bad stomach and it may have been the food or water, but, we couldn't pin it down. I ate and drank the same stuff and didn't get sick. I took all sorts of stomach and OTC medications with us and we used only the stomach medication for my wife and the alka-seltzer for me in the mornings! So, in short, although I had next to no expectations of this vacation, I had a really amazing time. It has made me reevaluate the type of vacation I normally take and can honestly say, that there is room for this type of vacation in our lives. Big surprise for me. If you are going expecting a 5 star resort...don't go. If you are looking for servants...don't go. If you are looking to find something to complain about, you probably will. But, if you are looking for a place where your kids will have a great time, and you can do as you please with your time with NO pressure surrounded by beautiful scenery. By all means Go Go Go. Without doubt, every single ClubMed employee is committed to making your vacation the best it can be for you. However, there are limits to what they can do and some guests push them hard. As a result the G.O.'s are more apt to do more for those whom they like and respect than the whiners and disrespectful who treat them like servants and make their lives difficult. You may want to check out the weather at time of year you want to travel before you book as the summer does get hot and humid. Just as a final comment, we were there for 7 days. We lost a couple due to sickness and, of course, the first and last are mostly travel days. So, I could have done a few more. My thought is that 10 days would have been a good amount of time for us. More than that I would have gotten bored unless I went on some excursions - paid or self organized. Take: OTC medication for coughs, colds, bad stomachs, morning headaches: lots of film, sunscreen, and mosquito repellent (for nights) as it is expensive in the shop. Pack very light. Our vacation really was great.
