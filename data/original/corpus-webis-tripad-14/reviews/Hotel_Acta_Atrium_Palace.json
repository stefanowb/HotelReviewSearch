The hotel is in an excellent location in the Eixample area, within easy walking distance to Las Ramblas, two metro stations and the Placa Catalunya. The rooms are tiny but well appointed with great showers and nice toiletries. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the Gran Via, and it was quite nice to sit outside and read a book for a while after walking around all day. The traffic on the Gran Via is quite noisy, but the room must have extra thick glass, as you could barely hear any outside noise once you closed the sliding door. The staff was superb, and every restaurant they recommended was excellent. We booked our rooms online and were able to take advantage of the $7.50E breakfast price. The buffet is very nice with both hot and cold items as well as cappuccino's etc. on request. There is also free water and juice in the room minibars which are refilled daily.", "title": "Atrium Palace is an excellent choice", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "AKMCT", "date": "May 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3438485}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very pleasant stay in Barcelona!", "text": "We would definitely stay here again, should we return to Barcelone.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Nancy M", "date": "April 26, 2005", "id": 3416973}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "impressive atrium palace", "text": "We traveled to Spain for a company trade show. All our reservations were handled online. The hotel was very prompt in getting back to us by email if we had a question about our upcoming reservations. There were 18 in our party and we had 9 rooms. It was very clean and quiet. The service at the front desk was very helpful in setting up dinner arrangements and entertainment for our large group. The language barrier was not a problem. There was at least one person at the desk that spoke English every time we needed assistance with something. We were in Barcelona for 3 nights, we spent about 180 euro's a night but this included an excellent breakfast each morning. The rooms varied quite a bit in size and in view. Everything in Barcelona is tight packed. Our particular room was small but adaquite. The bathrooms were very nice and the showers excellent with plentiful hot water and water pressure. Some on the rooms had views of the street and were bigger in size, some looked at the brick wall of the building next door, some overlooked a school yard. We didn't go to Barcelona to spend time in our room so the size and view really wasn't an issue. The air conditioning worked great, for some reason the hall ways and elevators were very warm. The elevators everywhere we went were tiny. This hotel was no exception. We tight packed it into the elevator with just my husband and I and 5 pieces of luggage. These elevators were not built for wide bodied Americans!! The location was excellent for many of the sights. I'd reccommend this hotel for a pleasant but not extravagant stay in Barcelona. The use of the computers in the business center was free, everyone in our group enjoyed that feature. I never made it down to the spa or exercise area's so can't make a comment on them.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 25, 2005", "id": 3414716}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "We have just returned from a 4 night stay (April 21-25) this hotel is lovely, ultra-modern and very clean.
