Late arrival of our flight meant we arrived at 1am and had to use the night window for check-in. It was unseasonally cold and the check-in staff member was incredibly slow booking us in. We stood shivering in the cold wind for 15 minutes while he mucked around with my credit card and sorted paperwork allocating our room, even though we had advised of our expected late arrival. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this hotel. Our room was fairly spacious with two queen beds, a very clean bathroom, small table and tub chairs, and decent quality amenities. It's right across the road from the main entrance to Disneyland, and although we didn't use the pool area, it looked very nice. Breakfast room is small and they don't offer much other than sugary cereals and danishes/muffins etc. It's right next door to Maccas which is 24hr which might be good for families. I stayed in this hotel more than ten years ago when holidaying in Anaheim with the family and it was good then too... the standard has not dropped. Price was good and overall I'd recommend this as a great option if you're spending a week in Anaheim to visit Disneyland etc.", "title": "VERY Nice Family Property... good value and nicely kept!", "user": "wilsoncm65", "date": "January 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148681541}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel and it was perfect!

We stayed in a family suite and when researching, it was the most affordable accomodation of that size by far within walking distance to Disneyland. Also their family suites consist of 1 king bed in the front room & 2 queens in the back room so nobody has to suffer on a sofabed! We found the staff to be super friendly and helpful.
