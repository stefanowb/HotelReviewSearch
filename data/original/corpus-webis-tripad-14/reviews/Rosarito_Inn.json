The room was as pictured on the website and clean. The view was great and the balcony made relaxing in the morning extra nice. The loud music from Bombay Bar next door might be a problem for some so be sure to book a room on the other side of the tower if you're a light (or not so light) sleeper. We had earplugs so the music wasn't a problem. This is Rosarito after all and loud, late nights should be expected. Overall the property was clean and the parking was secure and safe. Check-in was a little slow but not horribly so. Would we stay there again? Yes, because the location is awesome, the rooms clean, and the balcony is a must. We might ask for a room opposite the clubs though.", "title": "August Weekend", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CalTraveler45", "date": "August 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 170923507}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Unfortunately our spring break vacation to Rosarito was a disaster.

We ended up in a large unit in the Oceana condos. The condo itself was fine, but it is located right next to an open-air disco that had an all-night rave. We did not sleep a wink. The music continued until the morning.
