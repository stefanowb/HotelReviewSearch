This time I had nothing but poblems. A month before our stay I call for resevations and was qouted 148 for a suite with 4 adults plus we have a AAA card for 10%. A week before the date I call to confim the resevation again and is qouted now 187 and is told no discount can be used on the weekends but after some talking with the person we still can use it. As to why the price went up I was told it was because they had down only 2 people staying not 4. So I asked why would I ask for a suite then which they had down. So when all is said and done the price now qouted is 167 including the discount. At checkin the price is now 187 again. When asked the clerk tells me that the last person I spoke to miss informed me and that the price is 167 but that dosent include taxes an such. So we end up paying 187. 4 days later I go to take money out of my account and it says that my account is overdrawn by 140 dollars which I think cant be true. So into the bank I go and they tell me that there was a charge for 208 dollars and then another fo 187 both from Microtel. I call Microtel and ask what these charges are seeing how I paid 100 cash and should only be chaged 87 on my card and I have the receipt to prove it. They tell me they have no idea and will look into. Mean while it takes a day and a half to get my money back.
