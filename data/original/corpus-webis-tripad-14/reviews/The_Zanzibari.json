A group of 9 friends and I stayed over New Years Eve and we couldn't ask for more. We rented 2 private guest houses that gave us more than enough space. The houses were modern (had large flat screen tv- though we were too busy to ever watch them!) and had views that literally took your breath away. The houses had private pools and were steps away from the main pool. The service was amazing! The staff became our good friends who would do anything to make the trip more enjoyable. The owner was amazing and accommodating even when we had difficulties with our credit cards (he let us pay in both US and shillings). I should note that one must have a credit card not a debit/credit card combo because this will not work. It caused a bit of a problem for us, but we worked it out. The meals were amazing! Some of the best food I had in Africa! The tours were also amazing! I recommend the Sunset Cruise and snorkeling to Mnemba Island. Both were well worth the money. Also well worth the money is the massages they offer. Imagine laying in a beach hut, listening to the waves, as a petite woman gives you the most relaxing aroma therapy massage. HEAVEN! I will note that as a group of ten 20 somethings that this isn't the place to go party. However, the staff was more than happy to help us book transportation to local hotspots like Kendwa.
