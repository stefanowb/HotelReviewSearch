There was a little mix up when we were told that the restaurant was closed to host a gala ball but when we explained we would want something to eat, we were simply added to the gala ball guestlist at no extra cost! It's in a beautiful location with a stream running by. The bar is absolutely beautiful with a big open fire and lots of dark wood and chandelier lights. The restaurant was fantastic - we especially enjoyed the warm breads offered as a pre-starter. The rooms were lovely, cosy and had the shabby chic that I like in hotels because it gives them an atmosphere lacking in brand-name accommodation.

There were 2 weddings on there this weekend but as it was on in the Marque it didnt affect us noisewise at all. Overall a lovely stay, friendly staff and a lovely comfortable room.

I have neither love nor hate for this hotel, we've stayed here several times now. It's handy for visiting a friend in the nearby city. The hotel is currently undergoing exterior work and one side is fully scaffolded, and unsurprisingly, that's where our latest room was situated. When we entered the room, there was an overwhelming odour of mould and spores ... my other half offered to see if they'd change our room, but I rarely like to be bothered doing that, once you've hauled suitcases up flights of stairs ... it'd need to have a dead rodent before I'd bother ... so we couldn't open the window as I didn't want any more dust/spores in. The room was cold initially, but we whacked the heat up, as usual, then left for several hours ... when we returned, it was like the middle east in June. I yet again berated myself for my stupidity, I've just never been to any hotel anywhere else where guests have such free reign with the temperature - old, cold folks would just love it. On the plus side, the beds are big, and comfy. The bathroom shower-head was quite grotty, otherwise the shower worked fine. Bizarrely, the toiletries on offer were shampoo and bath gel, but no shower gel ... they seemed okay anyway. In the breakfast room, the heat was again stifling ( but this was maybe magnified by our slightly hungover condition ). I'd have loved the menu option, but there were just the usual cereal options. The fruit juices are cheap and not good. The cooked breakfast option seemed to just be the usual fried bread and meats in the heated bain-marie, we weren't offered any alternative this time. I must say, my biggest overall gripe was with the poor quality of the cooked food - I hate paper-thin, scrawny cheap bacon; sawdust sausages and cheap black and white pudding. I wish the owners would cut back on the heat a bit and up the food quality. Cutting corners on food is always a mistake. But I remain ambivalent about the place, believe it or not !
