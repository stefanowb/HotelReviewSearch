This hotel was recommended because of the location and the resonable price. The staff was excellent. They offered champagne when we arrived, a turn down service with chocolates, and a tote bag when we left. Although the room was a really nice size, it all started with the discovery that the TV did not work. We tried to get the front desk, but were unable to get an answer that evening. The night wore on and none of us got a wink of sleep due to our young child's fever and runny nose (certainly not the hotel's fault). The next morning my husband woke up early for his business meeting, and desperately needed a shower after such a difficult evening. The cold water did not work and the hot water scaulded his hand when checking the temperature. Unable to take a shower he dressed and left unshaven and unclean to an important meeting. Really disappointed and very tired, we went downstairs to let the desk know about the hazardous scorching hot water. The staff explained that when they are slow there can be a \"valve issue\" causing this problem. I just thank God it was not my young child's hand that was severely burned. Clearly negligent about this \"valve issue,\" the hotel never should have made us pay for a night which may have been more comfortable spent in our car.
