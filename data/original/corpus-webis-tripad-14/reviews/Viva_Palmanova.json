There are five pools, the relaxing adults pool great for couples and the three children's pools, one with slides in and the other a small shallow pool covered with a canopy ideal with toddlers. There was no shortage of sun beds by the pool. The staff were friendly and helpful. Although we were self catering we did eat at the poolside bar a few lunchtimes and they food was tasty and fairly priced. The drinks were also fairly priced. There was entertainment on everyday for the kids. The apartments were clean and nicely furnished with plenty of space for a family of four. Close to the beach and easy walk of about 5 mins to the shops, bars and restaurants. Would certainly go back and wouldn't hesitate in recommending this complex to friends and family.", "title": "Excellent Holiday!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sarah L", "date": "June 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131526018}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel was very clean and all the staff worked so hard. The room was ok but could of done with some tlc and touching up but again cleaned well. The food was just good with great service, i really can not praise it as provided nothing more than a decent meals. What the hotel need to realise is that when booking a number 1 hotel not everyone wants children to eat chips for the whole of the holiday. A top hotel could offer a later meal for people wanting to stay late at the beach or explore the area during the day The area is so beautiful with this hotel placed to avoid the Blackpool in the sun reputation of Palma nova.

A few disadvantages: small ants in the balkon and the living room, lack of kitchen items, too small garbage bin, just one tv channel in english (the other ones were in german or swedish). You can use extra towels to the beach, just pay 10\u20ac for one as depositum. The toaster and the kettle didn't work. We said to the recepcionist and the made came with a new one kettle. Children pool was to cold to our 2 years old daughter. Otherwise there were evening shows to the children at 8 pm every day. There is also a big children playing ground - that was super. We were dissapointed as we should check out 12 :00, but our bus should come just 17:00, We asked if we can stay a little bit longer in the room because of child. The receptionist offered just 2,5 hours longer for 12\u20ac!! What should we pay for?
