You can see clouds & mist right in front of you. The rooms are spread on the hill & one has to climb certain stairs to move. The management won hearts in providing total personalized feel. The restaurant is not very big, but would be happy to offer your choice. They take you for an evening spice plantation walk which again is a wonderful experience. As we were from Delhi (which is one of the most crowded places), this stay was a good start for our Kerala Vacation & a complete stress buster. The rooms & premises have the English colonial feel which is preserved in the right manner. The place is situated some 2-3 kms from the main town. Suggested for people who are in love with nature. As you are in the lap of nature do not expect TV or other entertainment mediums, & this is the way it should be. AC are not required as the climate is generally to the cold side. Expect your mobile to show no network / poor network. We loved all this to happen as we wanted a break.", "title": "Very Peaceful - Enjoy the English Colonial Feel", "user": "Pankaj A", "date": "February 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 152763528}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Situated some 3km outside Munnar and on a road not recommended after dark Windermere Estate appears to cater predominantly for western tourists.

Breakfasts were fine - mainly western but Indian available on request but the evening meal - when we were there - was very disappointing. The first night there was potato soup, 3 or 4 curries ( veg and non veg which were fine) then pineapple upside down cake. The next night was worse- vegetable noodle soup which had few noodles and was reminiscent of the packet soups of the 1960s whilst the pudding was a truly inedible instant whip type of caramel mousse. Given that there is no option but to eat here more effort should be put into giving a choice of local starter and dessert - even if it is only fresh fruit.

Despite being a T-total establishment, on Christmas Eve the hotel kindly provided us with a bottle of red wine in our room along with some delicious Indian style fish fingers, a small present and a Father Christmas hat to be worn at dinner.

The most important aspect of our stay that enhanced our experience was the excellent customer service and the effort the hotel management made to meet our needs.
