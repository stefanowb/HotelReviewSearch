In Fatima, we stayed at the Cruz Alta, which we chose because of its excellent location (across fromthe basilica) and very reasonable price. It was probably the best hotel we stayed at during our trip-- as well as one of the most reasonably priced! Spotlessly clean, ultra-modern rooms (nut huge but plenty large). An extremely friendly and helpful front desk staff who were able to answer every question we posed (accurately, too), and who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The deluxe continental breakfast was much more ample than usual, as well-- another fine selling point. By all means, when you come to Fatima, stay at the Cruz Alta.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "revjeff", "date": "September 22, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2592795}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Central Portugal", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 8, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 26}, "aka": "Cruz Alta Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.189189189189, "description": "It is a small and quite hotel, with only 43 rooms, all carefully ready to receive you in a calm, modern and comfortable style. The hotel is located just in front of the new Holy Trinity Church, part of the Sanctuary of Fatima. Just across the street there used to be a Big Cross (\u201cCruz Alta\u201d) that gave the name to the hotel.Modern decoration involves warm and strong colors, both in public areas as in the rooms.All hotel areas are connected to the internet by broad band wifi. Also available there is a business corner with internet access, where the guests keep in touch with their home, or just print a document.There is also a garage, which is very convenient, as the access to the Sanctuary from the hotel is obligatory made by walking."}
