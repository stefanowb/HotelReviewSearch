The receptionist basically lied to us, she initially said they had overbooked then said they had a hydraulics problem which affected an entire floor of the hotel and some patrons (including myself and my husband) had to go to another hotel for one night. Ok, they paid for the taxi to and from the other hotel, but it meant we couldn't just unpack and settle in for a further day. The other hotel was also not situated in the city centre. When we did return the older man at reception told us \"they had overbooked and too many people used the computer, not the way to work\". That said, it was a lovely hotel in an ideal location for exploring the city centre. The Metro was nearby and there were plenty of restaurants to choose from. They did compensate for the inconvenience of us having to go to another hotel and gave us a junior suite with a jacuzzi which was spacious and comforatble. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was fine, it could have been better but we thought it was fine, there was plenty of it and just what you would expect for a continental breakfast.

Many people have commented on the standard of breakfast. We agree with those who give it a poor rating.We have stayed in many 4 star hotels across Europe and the Imperiale offering is one of the poorest.The orange juice was incredibly sweet cordial, there was only one salt pot for the entire restaurant leading to the farcical situation of the waiter spending most of his time wandering round tables looking for it! Although there were several waiters on duty they failed to notice when things needed replenishing.Having said that, breakfast is not the reason for visiting this magnificent city and the Imperiale is extremely well placed for sightseeing . This outweighs any negatives and we would stay here on a return visit. Avoid the gazebo restaurant belonging to the Imperiale -food very average and expensive.
