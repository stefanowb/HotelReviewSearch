On arrival, I checked in at reception and was informed that our booking was for 2 nights, and we had only requested 1. The guy was very good and said that if we only wanted 1 night there was nothing he could do but let us stay for the one night. Apparently he has a lot of errors with internet bookings, but most of them are caused by the Golden Chain Motel booking system. Rooms were nicely appointed, very clean and well maintained The bathroom was fairly small, but adequate for the purpose. There is no restaurant at this motel, so we ventured up to the township to see what was available. Well, there was not much on offer. There is about 3 or 4 places to eat so we chose the Caf\u00e9 Neve as they had a steak on the menu and we love our steaks. The meal was a little while coming, but when it arrived it was presented butterfly\u2019d on a serving of vegetables and was very nice, a bit fancy for me. I thought it was a little expensive, but when I realised where we were, miles from anywhere, then I thought that the price was reasonable. We were lucky that we went to the glaciers in the afternoon as the whole area was fogged in the next morning. We had booked a Helicopter flight, but that had to be cancelled because of the weather.

There was a comfortable sofa, but we found the whole place rather basic for our taste. It had all the facilities that you would expect, but somehow they just didn't come up to scratch for us. We stayed in motels in New Zealand that were cheaper than this and which had better furnishings, and fitments, and which were warmer. There was not a lot of privacy, as other guests could be walking past our windows and could look right in if they wished to, but of course without the big windows you wouldn't have the view.
