The breakfast was amazing with freshly made fruit salad and delicious full English breakfast. The location is great as it is only 5 min away from the Vauxhall tube station and away from the main street.

Vauxhall is a great location--a quiet, residential area just across the bridge from the heart of London. The tube station is only five minutes away, but during my stay, a physical injury prevented me from taking cabs or using transit, and so I was especially glad that I could walk to so many interesting destinations from the B&B--ten minutes to the London Eye, twenty minutes to the Tate Britain, thirty minutes to Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey/Buckhingham Palace.

From the freshly cut-up fruit salad to the eggs, sausage, ham, beans, grilled tomatoes and juice - don't worry about calories since it's all fresh and/or organic and, you'll probably walk them off sightseeing anyway.
