We booked one full year in advance to attend our son's UCLA graduation. We had to pay IN FULL to hold our room. We chose Hilgard House because of its proximity to the campus (walking distance).

When I got there I was told that the \"free parking\" included in the cost of the room did not pertain to my large truck (toyota tundra) and that I would have to park in the Ralph's grocery store parking lot (3-4 blocks away) at a fee of $5.00. The manager literally yelled at me in the parking garage in front of other guests. He was pointing his finger at me and shaking his finger at me. When I asked where I could stay or where the Ralph's is (being I'm not from the area I had no idea where the Ralph's was located) he became irrate and mocked and mimicked me \"ohh, the poor baby, she doesn't know where to go\", \"poor thing\", etc. After my encounter with this \"man\", I didn't feel safe staying there. Luckily another local hotel had a cancellation and welcomed me and my truck without any problems. The desk clerk (young gentleman) appologized profusely for the manager's behavior and stated that we would have been able to handle the situation without the manager's involvement. I have filed a complaint with The Los Angeles Area Hotel Association and I will also be contacting the Chamber of Commerce. Since so many people drive large SUV's and trucks, they should mention the parking situation when people make reservations over the phone. They could even make arrangements for a shuttle to Ralph's or a reduction in the room rate for those of us that are expected to pay to park somewhere else. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 14, 2005", "id": 3667927}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "I decided at the last minute to drive up from San Diego and get a place near UCLA where I was picking up my daughter the next day. Even though I called only hours before my arrival, the staff was very helpful and made arrangements for me, including the exact type of room I asked for. The hotel was clean, quiet and very nice. It does not have extra facilities (pool, gym, etc.) but I did not need those - and the rate was very good for the area. The parking is secured, but the spots are a bit small. I knew this ahead of time as I had read previous reviews and my car is small so it worked for me. We didn't have much time to explore the area but it is only a block or so from UCLA in Westwood Village.
