New York is the city which never sleeps, but we do. So, for us a good sleep after a busy day means a lot. And The Hilton Garden Inn gave us that opportunity.

Firstly, the midtown location is ideal - bordering on 5th Av means being in the heart of things, with just a 10 min walk up Broadway to Times Square and the theatre district. Equally, there is a subway station at the front door for access to everywhere. The hotel staff are friendly and obliging to a fault. The front desk checked us in within minutes, and were available at all hours for questions, to share a joke and have a chat. The concierge was excellent, from being able to recommend a good restaurant, tell us which subway to take, recommend an afternoon's adventure or reassure us that we were doing what tourists in NYC should be doing. The room was impeccable, with firm, extremely comfortable beds and excellent sound proofing against the mayhem below. Small details made a difference, like free wi-fi, morning paper at the room door, a microwave and fridge in the room, complimentary tea and coffee in the mornings in the lobby. I am well aware that choosing an hotel can make or a break a holiday. I can say without reservation that our choice of the Hilton on 35th was the best we could have made.

It was relatively new, good location and nice staff (and no knock on the door at 9 am to clean the room or check out like I've read for other places). Anyway, I agree with a lot of the comments posted on here. We were welcomed by staff as we entered the hotel and were able to check in pretty early. Painless check-in! Room was a little small, but cozy enough with a rather large bathroom (for NYC). Standing shower, which was great, and you could tell the amenities and the fixtures were top notch. TV was a little slow to start up, but that was explained in the room (on the placard).......flat screen with quite a few HD channels too. Went to the business center, and there is enough room to do some work on the computer (I think there are 4 in there). Internet is free in the room, but I didn't bring a computer for that trip (if you're there for leisure, the computers in the b center should suit you just fine). Only slight criticism is that the elevators took a while to actually go down. They all kept going up, and we had to get on and go up several flights (picking ppl up), before eventually going back down to the lobby. Interesting. Based on other reviews, we didn't even try the food.
