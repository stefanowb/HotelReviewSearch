Our bathroom door had one handle that was chrome and one was brass-colored, so it looked funny.

Rolling her eyes, making me feel uncomfortable, asking why I would ever NOT want a second floor room at 11 am instead of waiting to come back after 3 pm when the normal check in starts, she SPRANG into high gear when I told her I had two dogs that were 50 lbs each. She couldn't wait to send me out the door. I don't know what kind of bad day this was for her but when I asked her if she was having a bad day, in a sing song voice said, \"Oh I'm having a great day! And you?\" I told her I was having a great day too. It was better because I ended up going to the Econolodge because they take pets. On this La Quinta's website, it says NOTHING about size and type of dog. Just \"Pets Welcome\". I reported her and this hotel to the customer complaint section of LaQuinta and am waiting to hear back from them.

I was happy to find a La Quinta here, and our dog was more than satisfied. I was puzzled by the reviewer who said that there was \"not a lot of open grass area,\" as we found the grassy areas more than ample for our dog's needs. There is a large grassy area in front of the hotel. In addition, there is a sidewalk lined with grass along the back street that leads to Wal-Mart, where there is more grassy space. Next to a lumberyard next door, there is an open field. (Even a horse would have been able to romp in all that space.) We used accumulated points to stay in a suite, which was immaculately clean, quiet, and very spacious. The bed was comfortable, and the bed linens and covering were not heavy, which is often a problem in some hotels. The desk staff was helpful and very friendly and seemed to genuinely like dogs.
