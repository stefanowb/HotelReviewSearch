The rooms and communal areas are perfect and it feels like a real luxury stay. Brfeakfast was amazing as well as all of the little extra's in the room and the cottages. Its one of the best places i have ver stayed and has everything you could possibly want. The afternoon tea in the tea room is phenomenal and the gardens are beautiful and right on your doorstep.

The attention to detail is amazing, from your own bar in the beautiful lounge (all included in price) to the sherry & whisky on your dresser for a quick evening tipple all add to the personal charm of the stay. Breakfast is in the main house looking out onto the terrace and gardens, the food expertly prepared by their charming chef. The welcoming and friendly staff all ensure you feel like you have always lived here! The bedroom (and en-suite) are wonderful and the bed sumptuous making it difficult to leave the house and venture out. When you do there is the famous Secret Gardens and picturesque Sandwich village to explore, with its quaint shops and not a chain store in site! How they have kept the usual coffee suspects away is a credit to the local council. Their is a tea room (open spring to late autumn - so we have to come back) and a small gift shop on the grounds (linked to the Secret Garden ao plant lovers can get their fix here). Dominic and the team at the Salutation have invested heavily in this famous estate and we are sure that it will continue to be the place to go for affordable luxury in Kent.
