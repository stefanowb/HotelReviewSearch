The woman at the front desk couldn't find any information about a preferential rate and the \"upgrade\" wasn't possible because there weren't any rooms at the next level available. However, she was quite accommodating and was able to give me the BC resident rate which took about $10 off the room rate.

We stayed in the 1 bedroom suite and didn't want to leave. The view is fantastic looking over the pier and sound and watching boats come and go out of the downtown marina. The hotel is downtown and within walking distance of restaurants, shops and the marina. The kitchen is small with high end appliances. We cooked dinner both nights in the suite because it was so relaxing just sitting on the balcony, watching the view. It was so nice to cook there, it was equipped with everything we needed and all the kitchen equipment were quality products. That was such a nice change from most hotels with kitchens we have stayed in. We bought fresh fish and shrimp from the fish market on the pier and walked to the market across the street from the hotel for the rest of the ingredients. The master bathroom was enormous, with dual sinks, large tub and separate shower. There also was a second bathroom with shower and one sink just inside the front door. The weather was our typically Pacific Northwest gray days and we enjoyed sitting in front of the fireplace each evening. Downstairs just off the lobby is a shop with baked goodies, breakfast and lunch items and coffees and teas. We bought a loaf of artisan bread to go with our dinner the second day and breakfast items each morning and they were wonderful. The hotel was exceptionally clean, even all the corners! My husband kept saying he would be very happy living in a place just like that! We never used the dining room table because the deck was so nice but the table was beautiful.", "title": "I could move in", "user": "Boatermom", "date": "September 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118533429}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We enjoyed a peaceful 2 nights in a studio suite with a partial oceanview.
