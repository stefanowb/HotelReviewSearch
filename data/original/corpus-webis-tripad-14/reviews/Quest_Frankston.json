The self catering hotel is great. If you get a room with a view its even better. The room I had was spacious, with good facilities for a couple with young small family. I didnt use the pool as I was their for business mostly but it was small but OK for a dunk I guess. There is a Westfield style shopping centre within walking distance and an italian restaurant thats quite good. The frankston area has a nice bay area and is obviously under going some regeneration and investment. In a few years this will have made a big difference but at this time the area hasnt much to offer. However as a base for Mornington, Melbourne (45min drive) and the wider nicer coastal area its a good place to start on the cheap. Thyere was no wifi and I couldnt get the netwrok cable to work either, but that could just have been my UK based business server not wanting to talk to Ozz.", "title": "Great hotel, average location", "user": "TimandVal", "date": "September 26, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 81046713}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled on business", "text": "The rooms were modern and adequate, although a little too 'used'.
