The hotel was chosen on the basis of location and that it would hopefully be of an acceptable minimum standard. As it turned out it was really quite good. Why a hotel in Sutton would be near to full on a Friday night is beyond me but it was. I grew up nearby and in those days, although a bit scruffy, the town had a sort of charm about it. Not now! The hotel is modern, clean and the staff friendly - I was given an upgrade on arrival which was nice because I am not a frequent Holiday Inn customer. The room was of a reasonable size and the bed comfortable with a choice of pillows. My only complaint would be that the shower was in the bath rather than separate. Breakfast was of a good standard and the lady who was covering my table was attentive without being overbearing. This is my second experience of a Holiday Inn Express in the last month or so and at \u00a380 a night for B&B I thought it offered satisfactory value for money.", "user": "BigMac58", "date": "May 17, 2013", "id": 161021992}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "According to expectations", "text": "We were in London for 3 days on business.
