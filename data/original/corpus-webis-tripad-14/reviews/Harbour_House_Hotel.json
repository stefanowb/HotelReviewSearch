We have stayed at other top rated hotels in NOTL, but this was the best...and perhaps the very best period! The service from the moment you walk in is first class and friendly. They show you to your room and explain all the ammenities. If you need dining reservations, they will make them and you can take a free shuttle if need be. However, the location by the water and numerous boats is so good that we just parked our car (for free) and walked everywhere. The rooms are spacious with leather chairs, fireplace, large flat screen tv, and the most comfortable bed. The bathroom has both a separate shower and two person whirlpool tub. The decor throughout is both nautical and contemporary, and particularly clean. Another terrific feature is the daily wine tasting with glasses of red and white local wines, cheese, crackers, and cookies. And then there is the included breakfast! Too many delicious items to mention but the smoked salmon and homemade granola were standouts. I can't recommend this hotel enough, and if you can get the Travelzoo deal we got, it makes it a great value as well.

A nice perk in the late afternoon was the complimentary wine and cheese in the main sitting room by the fire - great way to mingle with other guests.
