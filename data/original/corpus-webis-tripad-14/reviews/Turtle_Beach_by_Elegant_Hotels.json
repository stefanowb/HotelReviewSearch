Turtle Beach resort is amazing. You really are in paradise. We were up-graded due to getting married and when I stood on the balcony & saw the view I cried! It was breath taking. The room was fantastic and the maids did a fantastic job of cleaning it to such a high standard. The staff were amazing. They went out of their way to accomodate us and we couldn't have asked for a warmer welcome. Our wedding day was incredible. Roselyn is truly amazing and will move heaven and earth to make your wedding day just right. The lady rushes about all day trying to make your day perfect. I couldn't fault her in anyway. Maradona and Tyson are brilliant lads. They go out of their way to talk to you and bring you drinks - wherever you are! The lads at the watersports hut on the beach are brilliant fun. They will set up whatever games you want. Terrance on reception is a true gent and will help you with any query. A must is Bajan Roots & Rhythm. What an amazing night. The atlantis submarine trip is fantastic. Scuba diving with Dive Pro is a must.
