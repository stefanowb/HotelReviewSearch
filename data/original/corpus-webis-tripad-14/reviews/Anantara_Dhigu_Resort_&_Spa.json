The GM, Jeffrey is an affable presence and made us feel so welcome. The hospitality was warm without being intrusive. He gave us good tips on the various restaurants. The food was perfect at the grill restaurant, where we had most of our meals. Breakfast is a spread and the Thai restaurant is superlative. Prices are high considering everything is flown in. Local seafood is not easy to procure. The resort is spread over the island to ensure maximum privacy, the children could play on the strip of beach outside our room in a tranquil bay. There are the usual water sports and the instructors are a god send for beginners. The spa carries elemis products and follow Thai procedures and you can never go wrong with that. My husband spent evenings playing volley ball with guests and staff most evenings. The pool is fairly large and has fairy lights at night. There is so much natural beauty that one is instantaneously relaxed. I barely wore slippers for the whole trip! However, I felt the rooms were a bit too dark and the daily clean up job was average. There was a thick layer of dust at the mini bar. A superb trip and we will surely revisit. Thank you Jeffrey and team.

Heaven on earth is an understatement, It was by far the nicest place I have ever been. I came to this resort as a day guest. I was staying on a local island and decided to splurge ( hey it's the Maldives) and pay the $178 to go for the day. The neat thing about it is that you get to use the $178 as credit to use during your time at the hotel. During the two days ( okay you caught me...one wasn't enough. Had I gone at the beginning of my trip I probably could have talked myself into going every day) I used my credit for an amazing buffet lunch each day, drinks at the swim up bar, parasailing, and a white coconut essence wrap at the spa. You can see why I didn't want to leave. They also had diving, jet skis, wake boarding etc. keep in mind that the \"in house\" guests are first come first served so things fill up quickly. They also have free kayaks and snorkel equipment you can use and a little uninhabited island you can paddle over too. The Anantara is made up of 3 resorts...two 5 star and one 7 star that is private. You can use all the facilities at both of the five stars. They are both very nice, and I have saved the best for last. The pool is AMAZING! Infinity pool looking over the Indian Ocean...breathtaking. And then......the ocean. The ocean is crystal clear. You can see your toes. And if you swim out a bit you get to a sand bar with a hammock just hanging out in the middle of the ocean. An amazing photo opp and super relaxing, If you can't tell from my review...I will be going back! Maybe next time I will be able to afford one of the water villas where I can walk into the ocean. Ohh and as I said...I didn't stay there but I did ask to see one of the rooms. We looked at one of the family rooms with its own pool and outdoor bathroom, vaulted ceilings, bar...yah I would have kids just to stay there", "title": "Heaven on earth", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "spicypepper21", "date": "April 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 157904559}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We got there at night, and getting there and check in was pretty easy and fast.

We were lucky to catch the free cocktails every Wednesday from 5:30-6:30pm. It gives the staff/managers a chance to meet the guests. Room service food was actually better than in the restaurants (go figure). But if you do have to eat out of your room, do try the Baan Huraa (thai restaurant) at Anantara Veli (the sister-resort across the way). Fantastic Thai cuisine. A bit expensive but it IS good, and they have a set menu for 2 that can actually feed 3 people that makes it a good deal. The spa is super relaxing.
