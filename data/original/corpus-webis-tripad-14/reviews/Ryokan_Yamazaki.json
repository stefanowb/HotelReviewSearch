We were in the annex, which is about a 2-min walk from the main building; it's also off the main road, and backs up to a mountain, with a small creek running between the building and the mountain that sounds lovely all night long. It's a gorgeous and peaceful setting. Most of my comments echo what other reviewers have said: it's beautiful; the rooms are simple, but clean and well done; the people who run it are absolutely wonderful, in that they are warm and considerate, and have a great sense of humor; and I can't believe how inexpensive the place is. (I suspect the low price is due to the out-of-the-way location, but I'd pay more for a location like this.)", "title": "Absolutely wonderful", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "heads26", "date": "May 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7597736, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, food, owners", "disliked": "\u2014 No complaints at all"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Depends on your room", "text": "A few important points have not been brought up in previous reviews, though. First, the food was terrific. Although the owner had said they could not accommodate us for vegetarian meals, once he understood that we wanted Japanese, not Western, food, they served up some incredible meals. Second, although other reviewers seem to suggest that the place is difficult to access, it's actually very easy to get to if you take 10-min ride on the JR train from Kyoto station toward Sagano and get off at Hanazono. The ryokan walking distance from three lovely temples in northwestern Kyoto, including Kinkaku-ji, the \"Golden Temple\". Finally, it's just north of Arashiyama, one of the prettiest parts of Kyoto, which features many wonderful temples, lush bamboo groves, and a terrific monkey sanctuary, the Iwatayama Monkey Park.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Fuei", "date": "April 16, 2007", "id": 7367433}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great find!", "text": "I'd stay there again in a heartbeat, and would unhesitatingly recommend it to any of my friends.

The owners are very nice and had we been given a better room I would have given a better review so make sure you don't get room 8 in the annex. Also be aware that the ryokan is a good 40 mins from central Kyoto, buses from there only go once per hour and there are no buses after 9 in the evening so you need to take a cab if you're heading back after that.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 16, 2005", "id": 4026765}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "Incredibly friendly, and helpful staff, with adequate english speakers. The rooms were clean, spatious, and unique, with a beautiful garden at a good price. It felt like I was visiting a welcoming Japanese home more than an Inn.
