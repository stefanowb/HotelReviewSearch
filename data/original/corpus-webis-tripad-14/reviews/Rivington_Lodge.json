The mould in the grout in the bathroom was a little off putting, but the room had been cleaned and the shower had good pressure and lots of hot water. The bedroom itself was large and had been recently painted. The bedding was clean and crisp but the mattress was well worn. The double sofa bed looked a little grotty and I didn't open it out to check it. The furniture was adequate but was well worn and the tea/coffee making facilities were welcome after a long drive. Checking in at the spa shop was not a problem and probably makes sense in keeping costs down. The location on the service area means that there is some traffic noise from the motorway, but it didn't disturb our sleep too much. This was the cheapest place to stay in the area and was perfect for an overnight pit stop, but I would not have stayed for more than 1 night.", "title": "Cheap place for a stop over", "user": "SuzyWho", "date": "December 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121706725}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "Room was clean and all facilities worked.
