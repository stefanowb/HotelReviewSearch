Everyday at 2:00pm, servers would hand out frozen towels and popcicles. Our room was located by the Pineapple pool with a small patio. The staff is very friendly and accommidating.

The rooms are ok , not worth $219 per night , I stayed in room 280 , no AC in the bathroom , needed updating and small bathroom, bed sheets and comforter cheap material, ceiling looked unfinished , if your going to charge $219 per night , I don't mind paying , but I want my money worth. The only reason they can get that rate is because of location , supply and demand . In my opinion the rooms aren't worth more than $130-$150 per night. On the same trip I stayed at Loews South Beach Miami for $199 per night. The pillows and comforter were made from feathers , location right on the beach.

The room was also very quiet and had the air conditioner was fantastic, which is a major bonus as the temps were over 100 with the heat index.

The hotel is right next to its sister hotel, Southernmost on the Beach, which we had full access to the pool, private beach, and great sunning deck! We did not spend much time on the beach b/c we really loved the pool! The beach isn't the best, but we had already been told that by friends, that people do not go to Key West for the beaches. That's why having a great pool was important and the Southermost definitely had great pool options (3 pools in total to pick from!). The staff was super friendly and helpful from the time we checked in to the time we checked out. Even though we were not able to check in early, we were provided w/ a temp card for access to the pools and the bathrooms to change into our bathing suits. The room was clean and quiet.

Upon our arrival we were greeted with a card and a bottle of champagne in our room. The two staff members that really stood out were Boomer and Louie! Boomer did a nice job of running the pool activities as well as taking us out snorkeling just off the pier of the resort! Saw sharks (nurse), a barracuda, starfish and countess fish! And the best part was it was free of charge! Louie did a great job keeping the pool deck clean! I met him on Friday morning briefly as he sold me a hat. On Monday, before we left I ran into him again and he remembered me by name!! Considering the amount of people he came across daily, I was truly impressed with this display of hospitality. The resort's restaurant had an excellent happy hour with very tasty hors d'oeuvres. Key West has excellent restaurants as well as their nightlife! Had fantastic meals at Blue Heaven and El Siboney.
