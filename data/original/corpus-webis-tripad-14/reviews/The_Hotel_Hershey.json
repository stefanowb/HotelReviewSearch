We were on the 9th floor. Rooms are very nice, beds comfortable. All of us utilized the Chocolate Spa for treatments and it is a very good spa, but usual pricey spa prices (my spa pedicure was $75 before tip.) Nice indoor pool and hot tub as well. They had a lot of different \"chocolate-oriented\" activites, for a price, which looked great (like wine paired with chocolate tastings), but we didn't have time to partake due to our spa appointments. Had dinner in the more casual restaurant - my food was just OK, everyone else really liked theirs, so perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. The Iberian Lounge is Breakfast the next morning in the Circular Dining Room was excellent - great upscale buffet and well worth the $17 price tag. Setting is lovely. They are currently in the midst of a huge renovation and I think the place will truly be 5* quality once that is complete. I would definitely return after the renovations.", "title": "Great for a girlfriends weekend away", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mccarthys5", "date": "April 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 27389000}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled with family", "text": "My wife and I do not mind spending a little extra money to enjoy \"four star\" comfort.

We went in March. My first impression was not a good one. While I was getting a tip for the valet parking, the attendent said that their was no charge for the parking but a gratuity would be appreciated. I knew from the sign, it was free valet parking, so I was reaching into my wallet for his tip. It was a put-off to be reminded that way. The temporary entrance was boring, but there was no sign indicating that this was a temporary entrance because of construction. Once we checked in, we were not told how to get to our room. The front desk just said there is a map inside with your key. We ended up wandering the halls looking for our room since there were so many additions to the hotel. Our room was just \"okay.\" I would definitely not say it was a 4 star room. We found 2 stink bugs in our room. We were called 4 times to be reminded about our spa itinerary, even though we told them each time that we already knew our itinerary and to stop reminding us. We even got a call after our spa services were over. Our spa buffet lunch was mediocre. The wraps were dried out. The waiting room before the spa services were crowded and we didn't have a place to sit a couple of times. There was a beverage stand and we had coffee grounds in the bottom of our cups. The gym only had a few ellipticals and no one helped us with the equipment, headphones, etc. We had to fend for ourselves while the attendant spoke on the phone the whole time. The really get you with the spa credits. You have to spend for product in the spa. Be sure to get a receipt for everything! We heard a lot of people being told they had a balance when they didn't, and then it happened to us when we checked out. Thank goodness we had receipts for everything and it showed a zero balance. The bed and linens were nice and comfortable. The shower had great water pressure. The outlets nearby had some nice bargains. I would not recommend this hotel. The spa treatments were nice, but they seemed like an assembly line. If you go with another person, you won't see them. The services aren't not together. The locker room had a lot of accomadations. Bring your bathing suit for some of the shower spa services. The one we had, can't remember it's name, it was a woman sparying you with a hose while you stood in a stall. You felt like you were being de-loused. Strange. I never felt \"welcome\" in the hotel.

I asked for a room with a nice view and got a room overlooking the ventilation system, which was very noisy. The room was very small and smelled like it used to be a smoking room. When I walked into the bathroom there were hairs in the tub, which didn't inspire confidence in the room's cleanliness. When I made the reservations, I wasn't made aware of the fact that there are huge rennovations underway, which really takes away from the experience as well.

Well, from the look she gave us, you would have thought we had asked her to put us onto a rocket ship and launch us into outer space. She looked at me blankly for about 10 seconds as though she had never in her life received such an outlandish request. Once she finally grasped the request, she told us that they really can't sit us in a different location - and then went into a lengthy description of the hotel's policy in taking turns seating people in different areas in fairness to the waitstaff. So I repeated my request, emphasizing that we would not enjoy our breakfast if we were seated between tables of screaming children. So she left us standing there and went to consult with the dining room manager. We stood there for about a couple minutes watching her have this long, drawn-out conversation with the manager.
