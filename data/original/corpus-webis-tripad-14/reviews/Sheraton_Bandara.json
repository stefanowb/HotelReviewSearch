{"user_rating": 3.0, "review_count": 232, "name": "Sheraton Bandara", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I had stayed at the hotel about 7 years ago and remembered it as beautiful and pleasant, and an advantage is the location of the hotel near the airport. Now I returned for three nights and did not get the room I reserved (with furnished terrace), but a room on the first floor where windows cannot be opened. First that disturbed me, but then the advantage is that no mosquitoes come into the room. After the long journey from Europe I was just to tired to make a fuss shortly before midnight. There are also many airline crews residing at the hotel. To start with description of the hotel, the appearance is still very good, and the staff is as friendly and helpful without exception as it ever was. Unfortunately, the buildings are a bit run down and would deserve a touch up. Still, room utilities were all in good order, and something I always appreciate there was a coffee maker (coffee replenished regularly free of charge) and an ironing board in the room. Bottled and sealed mineral water of a reputed brand was also replenished regularly free of charge. Food (buffets) was good. A detail on the laundry service: Laundry delivered before 7 am should be returned same day at 20h, but I didn't receive my laundry. After a phone call at about 21 h I received it in five minutes. There is no service directory with phone numbers in the room, only the indication \"guest services\" on the phone. I regret I forgot my bathing trunks, as there is a nice swimming pool in the centre of the hotel. I did not have enough time to visit all other highlights of the hotel as I was on a business trip and not on holidays. A final positive point is that there is a reliable free shuttle service to the airport on demand. However on the other way form airport to hotel, I hadn\u2019t found a shuttle service, and had to take a local taxi. The driver asked for 40 USD, but then accepted 5 USD which is still an very high price, if not excessive, for the short stretch of about 2 km.", "title": "An Airport Hotel that has some local charm", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "January 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 93042964}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed for Buissness due to close proximity to airport.", "title": "Is This Really a Sheraton?", "user": "FLYISH", "date": "January 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 91896042}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "Promised a Airport pick up but never came ..waited 30 min. finally took a cab long flt and couldn't wait any longer. when told about the incident at front desk,....got a blank stare?", "title": "A very different Sheraton!!", "user": "marksa67", "date": "November 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 87189657}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Get to my room.

My request to the reception to use some aromatherapy oils went unheeded. The bedsheets & towels supposedly white, were a greyish color. The sinks had mold.
