Keeping up to their brand name, Marriott, Jaipur has done a fantastic job and it is one of the best modern place to stay (if you do not like to choose palaces/ Haveli for your stay). The location (drive to the airport is just 5 minutes) of this hotel makes it most preferred by travelers but that's not all. The rooms are carefully decorated and utilized maximum space to give enough space within. The main restaurant \"Okra\" has been our all time favorite and chefs/ Managers make sure you have everything you could ask for. Chef Sahil Arora has been a darling meeting all our needs not only pertaining to food but everything else. Bhawani, the Restaurant Manager is another person to mention as he has been a great help throughout our stay. Though it was a very short stay for us, but we thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality extended. The only time I got a little worried at the time of check out when after calling for more than half an hour, our luggage were not brought down and we almost missed our flight hadn't it been delayed.
