We traveled to Ft. Lauderdale in search of comparable sun and sand as we might find on the Aegean or The Med. As fate would have it we were greeted at the counter by Sabri Cimenci who just so happens to be from Turkey. Turkish hospitality at the Hilton! We immediately felt at home. Mr. Cimenci gave us a most excellent orientation to the resort and followed up to make certain all was well. We were impressed again and again by the staff at this Hilton property. Christopher could not have been more a gentleman in assisting us. He left a most memorable impression. Shakira and the others in housekeeping were just wonderful to us. Pool staff? Too many to mention but each and every one charming and quick to get you settled around the pool. Particularly the young woman running the children's activities. Wow she knows how to work with the kiddos. Even the folks staffing the towel station on the beach made certain we had everything we needed to be relaxed and enjoying our stay. The folks renting umbrellas and lounges at the beach I don't believe are Hilton employees though. Charging for lounges on the beach? Really? One thing about the Hilton that I liked was that there were no hidden \"resort fees\" to pile up. Some people have complained about the parking rates but it beats the heck out of some other major metropolitan area hotels. The staff in the Q hotel shop were so kind and they were so nice to our little one as he power shopped daily for this and that in their store. The staff behind the counter at the street-front Le Marche were so helpful and the coffee was great. Seriously, do you all ever catch a break or even slow down? And teamwork? Front and center! I have read a few of the blah reviews of this place and it is unfortunate if any of these things indeed happened. Our experience was pretty flawless. I have learned that if you are kind and considerate to the staff anywhere most often you get a solid return on that investment. We had a few snags. Housekeeping was busy and missed our trash. Big deal. A simple phone call fixed it. And yes you may be put on hold and things don't always happen lightning fast. Get over it! This place is huge and requires precision management and staffing. They do a GREAT job. The housekeeping staff rocks by the way. They stay very, very busy and we were so unpredictable as to when we were going to be in the room or out. They were so patient with our erratic schedule. We ran out of coffee (we drink A LOT of coffee) only to have the staff bring us a huge bag of regular and decaf which lasted us through the end of our stay. We drink Lavazza here at our favorite coffee shop so having it in our room made it even more like home. We even bypassed the Peet's Coffee served down the street at the Ritz.. Hilton, you have an incredible property in Ft. Lauderdale and you have an even more incredible staff. Some recommendations: Bigger trash cans in the kitchens; Peter Thomas Roth . . . incredible body wash and shampoo . . . rather blah soap; and the robes could use a little remake. Beige, enough said. Back to the positive. To the people out front who meet and greet and TCB the whole day long. Best I have ever seen anywhere at home or abroad. Poetry in motion. One final thanks to Mr. Kolz ( I hope I got your name right). Our 30-month old watched me lock the safe so the next time it was unlocked he programmed it and locked it up tight. Mr. Kolz came to our room to open our safe. What a kind, professional man. He was so good as our son tried to assist him. A true gem of a gentleman. I have never seen an entire staff so committed to making a stay as close to perfect as one could hope for.

We sat in the lobby, hungry and tired, waiting to be told our room was ready, After 25 minutes, and no one coming to inform us one way or another, I walked up to the desk and was told the room was ready. We arrived at the room, only to see that the room I had booked two months earlier, was beside the elevator. I am a Hilton Honors member and have specifically asked to not be near the elevator. We entered the room and Richard, the bellman assisting us, phoned the front desk asking if an alternative room was available. No. I thanked him for his efforts and began to settle in. I opened the closet and saw a pair of mens underwear and socks on the floor. I notified the front desk of the dirty laundry and asked to have it removed while we dined in the hotel restaurant. It was still there one hour later when we returned. The restaurant experience was ok. They were extremely busy, service was slow, the waiter forgot my initial glass of wine and I had to ask the Maitre'd to please get it, as the waiter was so busy I couldn't get his attention. The saving grace was Lindsay, from the front desk, brought me a meal voucher for our entire table of three. She apologized for the delayed check in and dirty laundry in the room. Lindsay said the hotel would be giving me a partial refund on the 100,000 Hilton Honors points I had used for the two night stay. I said thank you. The following morning we went out to enjoy the day and returned at 7pm, to see our room had been serviced but the dirty underwear was still in the closet. We stopped by the front desk on our way out to dinner in town and asked again to have the previous guests dirty laundry removed. It was gone when we returned at 10pm. In the morning, as we were getting ready to leave, we noticed our room with two beds, had been supplied with only two bath towels. At this point, I was tired of complaining to the front desk, as this is the most I have ever done this, so we shared. This is a busy hotel that seems to be overwhelmed and management does not have a good handle on what is going on. I won't be staying here again. Oh, and I never did get a refund on any of the 100,000 Hilton points I used staying here. I sent a complaint through Hilton customer service in March and never heard back from them.
