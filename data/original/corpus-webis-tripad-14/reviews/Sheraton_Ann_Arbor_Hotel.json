How has it changed since becoming a full blown Sheraton property? Well, a positive development is that it partners with Starbucks. The welcome desk is now more personal although the personnel are less friendly (probably due to a change in the general manager). The lobby area is more open allowing for a far greater level of noise from the bar and surroundings, especially when there is a catered event or a UMich game. The 6th floor lounge food is way upgraded but its architecture is inconvenient with a long table (to share with strangers) dominating and a lack of individual or small group seating. Also, the coffee is hidden in a corner so a person preparing a cup blocks access to other food and drink. Food runs short and refills are long in coming. Patronage is not upgraded - a man ate breakfast in the lounge barefooted and in pajamas. Look - it is fine to stay here and earn SPG points, and we will surely return. I am just not sure it is an advantage over Four Points or, for that matter, the less costly Hampton Inn properties in town.", "title": "Four Points or Sheraton - What's The Diff?", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DrSGPrice", "date": "October 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 142245053}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel can be had for really great rates if one chooses to the prepaid rate, please note this is not refundable and there are no cancellations when choosing the prepaid rate.", "title": "Great hotel and great rate in Ann Arbor", "user": "vg247", "date": "October 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142180910}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Rooms are clean and hotel has a great bar and also restaurant with good food.", "title": "Quiet stay in beautiful Ann Arbor", "user": "Jonny S", "date": "October 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142149623}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Housecleaning was rather unfriendly otherwise everyone else there was very customer service oriented.", "title": "Good Business Hotel", "user": "BusinessTraveler1983", "date": "October 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 142084235}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I had a nice overnight stay at the Sheraton Ann Arbor.
