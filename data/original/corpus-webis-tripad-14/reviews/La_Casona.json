The staff is extremely helpful and mostly English speaking, the beds are comfortable and rooms cleverly appointed. It is a little bit more off the beaten path and you will have to walk a little or take cabs if you want to get anywhere, but it is not terribly far from the subway, and that can help hasten the journey. If you want to stay somewhere that isn't a chain, La Casona is the place to stay in Mexico City.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jayci", "date": "September 14, 2004", "id": 2574629}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fabulous & Charming Hotel", "text": "Note: my fiancee did get ill eating the cheese on the last day in the breakfast buffet.
