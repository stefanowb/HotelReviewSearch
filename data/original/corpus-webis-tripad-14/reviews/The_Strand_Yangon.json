The Strand signature cocktails are heavily based on Mandalay Rum. The bar got busier and busier through the night since it was happy hour and half price drinks. But that made the beer normally priced at $6 just about bearable. I was amazed that they claimed that they didn't take credit cards. Although credit cards are relatively new to Myanmar, but quite a few hotels now accept them. When I asked for the bill they had added a 10% tip and a 5% government tax as stated on the drinks list. However I was very angry that when I paid the bill in dollars I was short changed. When I found the waiter again he said that it was hotel policy to round up the total of the bill. I stated that they had already been tipped and I would like my change, but he stated that they didn't keep small notes. After I stated that I wanted my change the money was finally handed over. The people of Myanmar are wonderful, friendly and possibly the most giving and kindest that I have ever had the privilege of meeting.
