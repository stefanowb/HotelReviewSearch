My room on the seventh floor had a very good view over the city including the india gate and the immediate area surrounding the hotel is green and pleasant. The main downsides to this hotel are that it is starting to look a little tired on the outside and the bathrooms and the spa are not 5 star quality (although at 220$ per night perhaps the rack rate reflects this). My bathroom in a club room was small and cramped and the fittings are probably at least 5 years old. Similalry the showers and toilets in the spa could do with being updated. Other things to be aware of: in Delhi a 25% tax is added to the room rate and 12.5% to all food and spa prices and 20% for alcohol so the overall experience is not as good value as you might originally anticipate; and you cannot really walk to anywhere from this hotel.", "title": "They Call This Place a Palace??", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "NYCHoya", "date": "June 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7968208, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 Decorations"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled on business", "text": "The Taj Palace may have been a luxury resort....in the 1980's!
