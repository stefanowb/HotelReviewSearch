However, what we found when we checked into this $269/night motel room was a toilet not bolted to the floor (subsequently fixed), broken tiles, rusty fixtures and broken (and dangerous) electrical outlets. Common areas were outdated and unclean. Five trips and three phone calls to the front desk produced responses from the desk staff that \"only the manager could address our complaints\" (oh yes, and one offer of a free breakfast). Despite verbal (phone messages) and written requests, the manager never contacted me during our stay and never appeared to be in the office at the times when the staff said she would be returned. The Margate has a nice beach and beach bar, but it is a poorly maintained, overpriced motel with very poorly trained staff. Given that combination, I wouldn't recommend staying at this 'resort' until it comes under new ownership and management.", "helpfulness": 23, "user": "funshine", "date": "October 9, 2004", "id": 2674268}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "OVERRATED", "text": "We stayed at the margate on september 5th, we were going to the B.B king concert.
