We were quite surprised and pleased when the hotel staff graciously offered us an early check-in and gave us a key. We were equally delighted to find such a lovely room waiting for us. The housekeeping staff wrote a personal note welcoming us and we laughed to find an adorable little rubber duckie dressed as a Halloween witch waiting on the bathtub. The amenities were great - everything we needed and more. The room was quiet and the bed was comfortable. It appeared to be very clean, so I was a little startled and disappointed to pull the comforter back and find several french fries on the floor next to bed. Apparently, that was one spot they missed cleaning. I rate it 4 stars for cleanliness and value (the price was a little higher than some other hotels in the vicinity).

The desk staff was very nice and when we balked at the quoted price of $114 for a double room, she asked why we were visiting and when we told her the reason she offered the UWEC parent price of $79.99 which was more in line with what the motel had to offer. The lobby, our room, and the breakfast area were well-maintained and clean. The outside area had a nice touch of jack-o-lanterns and little handmade ghosts decorating the bushes for Halloween. The breakfast offered a fairly good variety of hot and cold items, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc. Our room was very nice and clean and the beds featured white bedding which we appreciated rather than the typical floral-print-that-hides-stains bedding that you often see.
