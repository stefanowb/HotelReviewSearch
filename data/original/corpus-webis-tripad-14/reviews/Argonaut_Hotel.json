One word to sum up our experience - WOW. Our stay there was perfect. We took advantage of a package that included parking and breakfast - a full breakfast from the regular menu. The food and service were great. The location was ideal - easy to find and right next to the trolley, easy walks to the Wharf and Piers, great restaurants and places to spend the evening. From the moment when we checked in, we were thoroughly impressed by the friendliness and sincerity of the staff - no \"in-your-face\" forced-smile attitudes, just people who seemed happy with their jobs and interested in making our stay perfect. The comlimentary wine hour was a great time - a gorgeous comfortable lobby, good wine generously served, pleasant way to relax before heading out for the evening and chat with staff and other visitors. We checked in just as the hour was beginning, were encouraged to take a glass up to our rooms and come back down for more. Everywhere we turned, there was comfort and ease. The rooms were a delight - not a single complaint. Nicely decorated (the theme wasn't overdone at all), spotless, impeccable condition, VERY luxurious bedding, Starbucks coffee in rooms - we both said that if we tried, we couldn't have found a single thing not to our liking. We've stayed in all sorts of places and this is def tops - would have been worth it at twice the price.

The wine tasting (glass full) in the Lobby by the fireplace every evening is very enjoyable. While in San Francisco you must dine at Cliff House Sutro's Restaurant at least once. A bit expensive but go for the view. Make sure you arrive early around 4 or 5 to enjoy the view and sunset. It's not near the hotel and the cable cars do not go there so we had to take a taxi, but its worth it. Everything else is in walking distance or jump on cable cars next door and see the city. Go to Chinatown and eat at Cathay. They had the best chinese food! Locals including cops recommended it. I'm going back to San Francisco in September and will stay at the Argonaut.

I had drunk half my glass of wine so my husband took it back along with his for a top up. The man serving this night refused to do this stating the glass was half full, this embarrassed my husband as everyone else had received more than one glass in fact the people stopping at the conference had someone circulating with the wine topping them up. This guy must of realised he had been rude and embarrassed my husband as he approached him 10 minutes later and offered to top the glasses up as the wine tasting had finished.

My main complaint was the bed wasn't as comfortable as many other high end hotels (it crowned a little in the middle and was kind of soft).
