Booked online and stayed in a 2 bedroomed lodge - number 4. We've been fortunate and stayed in some absolutely fantastic five star hotels and upon entering the lodge it was quickly apparent that this was right there up with them. A double room on first floor level with full bathroom and a double room on the ground floor with an identical bathroom. We had a lounge, a dining area and a kitchen-ette. The soft furnishings were oppulent and the lodge was very clean. The binnoculars were a real bonus as we looked out onto the lake and watched the wildlife. The children get their own \"cygnets package\" where they get to check themselves in and there are tiny bathrobes and slippers on their bed and I mean tiny! The pool, which is all most kids are interested in, is only available to children under 12 between the hours on 10 and 4 so if you're using this as you're touring base then it's a real drawback, however, we had it all to ourselves and had a wonderful 2 hours in the pool, sauna, whirlpool and so on the decor is amazing as is the view out onto the grounds. We did not book for dinner as, again, children under 12 are not welcome after 7pm which is a bit early for us so we had a few drinks on the terrace of the Blaney bar (5 star prices for sure) and walked back to our lodge to cook the kids a pizza in our kitchen-ette unfortunately the over was not connected so it was cheeseboard and crisps all round. Breakfast was stuffy and unclear as to what the format was, we were poured orange juice yet at the cold buffet section all other juices were available.
