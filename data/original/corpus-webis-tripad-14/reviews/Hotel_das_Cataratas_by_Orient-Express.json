Our room was very big and well appointed with lots of lovely toiletries and some more free Havaianas! The pool was beautiful with plenty of loungers and the bar by the pool served great drinks and food. Breakfast was wonderful - very high quality and massive choice (they even did porridge which made me feel very at home!). The gym was almost empty and had great machines and weights - all very new.

The breakfasts are so generous and beautifully prepared with the best fruit platters, fresh exotic juices, gorgeous pastries, enough to set you off for the day on many adventures.

Both hotels are the sole properties located in their respective national parks so there are no other choices if you wish to stay within the parks and have easy access to the falls. You are therefore a captive audience! Although das Cataratas is a beautiful property on the whole and the rooms are attractive, its management is milking its location for all it's worth. Our travel agent reserved a standard room and we were therefore not expecting a view of the falls from our window. We learned, however, that most other available \"views\" are basically worthless. The first room we were shown was on the lower level of the \"garden wing\" and had a view of the hotel's service entrance. The second room, also in the garden wing, had a \"view\" of a high mound of grass. The third room (which we ultimately accepted, because \"nothing else was available\") had a view of the roadway adjoining the property. The garden wing is quite a long walk from the lobby and restaurant and is not really desirable. Perhaps other \"views\" are available from this wing, but we certainly saw a representative selection. Management is not friendly; in fact, we felt as if we were on the defensive when we requested a better view. Our room was also not ready for occupancy when we arrived at 2 PM, which was supposed to be the official check-in time. The hotel does have a beautiful swimming pool and we thought the dinner buffet was quite good and not too expensive, considering its quality. I would still recommend staying 1 night on each side of the falls, but be prepared for an \"attitude\" at this hotel.

But 150 USD for a room service two course dinner with no alcohol? Ok fine, charge this but make sure it is fresh, delicious and organised by a room service manager who has a basic grasp of English. I'm not exaggerating when I say that unless you order EXACTLY what is on the menu (takeaway numbers style) you will have at least one or two extra phone calls trying to figure out what \"salad dressing on the side means\" or \"a scoop of ice-cream with the cake instead of cream\" or \"don't put hot water in the tea\". You will then be delivered the wrong thing and the whole process starts again (this is after they try and charge you 20 USD EXTRA for a scoop of ice-cream of course). The food by the pool is even worse, you can only order sandwiches / burgers / bagels or fries. A sandwhich described as \"filet de Beef mignon\" turns out to be a sugar filled white processed bread filled with some of the frozen beef you find in supermarkets. When this is accompanied by fries cooked 2 hrs ago and an ocean of dressing on your two pieces of lettuce you start to feel a bit annoyed when you get a bill for 35 USD. This wouldn't be too bad if you could actually order something fresh or healthy from the room service menu if you are by the pool or at the bar.
