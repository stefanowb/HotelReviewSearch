The room was a very nice size. The beds were comfortable. The service was excellent. The television in my room did not work and the front desk staff moved me to another room immediately. They also gave me some free drink vouchers without my asking for anything. All of the staff (front desk, wait staff, bar staff, concierge) were excellent and spoke English very well. The breakfast was excellent. A wide range of choices. The metro takes you into the heart of Copenhagen in approximately 10 minutes. You can buy tickets at the hotel. I would definitley not hesitate to suggest this hotel to anyone staying in Copenhagen.

We booked it as we needed to park our car and we could not find a central Copenhagen hotel that had any parking. It is located in a very new build area of Copenhagen (20 mins to central via walk and Metro). There is nothing to do in the immediate vicinity, other than a large shopping mall about 5 mins walk away. This means if you can't be bothered getting the metro (or \u00a330 taxi) to the centre, you will need to rely upon the hotels facilities, which are minimalist both in option and design -basically a Bar / Cafe, located to the left of reception (there is a restaurant, but it was closed). It is very, very concrete minimalist, which did not aid the atmosphere. Service was pretty poor, (here did not appear to be enough staff) Our Room was fine.
