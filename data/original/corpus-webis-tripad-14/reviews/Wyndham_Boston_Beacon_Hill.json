Our stay at the Holiday Inn Govt Center was a pleasant surprise. It's located close to Charles St (lots of antique shops) and 2 or 3 blocks from the Govt Center T stop. Also right next door to a Whole Foods, which really came in handy. The room itself was small but more than adequate, with a fridge, a view of the Charles River, and most importantly, a bed with cotton linens and good pillows. Another review mentioned sirens but even tho the hotel is near Mass General, we never heard an ambulance, just the very occasional police siren. The room was quiet. I rarely sleep well in hotels but slept great here. The staff was helpful and friendly. Due to the high cost of parking ($36 per day- our only complaint) we parked outside the city and took the T in. We booked this on Priceline for $125 a night- a bargain.", "title": "Surprisingly Good", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "sacharama", "date": "July 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5508926}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Location", "text": "We stayed for 3 days for pleasure with our kids and loved the location.

Our room overlooked the car park for Whole Foods and CVS pharmacy which meant we had no street noise.

Our three year old ate free for breakfast. The staff were very friendly and helpful a real asset to the hotel. We never had lunch or dinner there as there were so many good restaurants in the area.

The hotel and room were nice, very clean, and the staff was pleasant. This hotel is within a 15-minute walk of the Museum of Science in one direction and a 15-minute to government center and the North End (with all of the great Italian Restaurants). There is a small lobby and a restaurant onsite. I did not eat at the restaurant since Boston has so many fabulous restaurants. My only complaint was at $36 per day, parking was expensive. The hotel is close to the T (the subway trains). We went all over the city using the subway, which is easy to use. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. This was a celebration weekend for my daughter who was graduating from Boston University. Over the weekend, we ate at three great restaurants. These three great restaurants were Carmen\u2019s (Italian.) on North Street in the North End (a small place that was very romantic with excellent food), Bob\u2019s Southern Bistro on Columbus Ave in the South End (Soul food with great friendly service with good ribs, excellent jambalaya, excellent corn muffins and other southern food). Bob\u2019s Southern Bistro has live Jazz that was good but a bit noisy since we were two tables up from the stage. (Next time, I will ask for a table closer to the door). It was a good place for a big group and the prices here are very reasonable. There was a $ 5 per person cover charge added for the Jazz. Our big, special dinner was at the Elephant Wok on Beacon Street in Alston. This restaurant was amazing, there were several big groups of 10-14 people (all of the graduates and their families) that the restaurant was serving and they managed to give excellent service.
