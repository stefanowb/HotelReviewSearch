I must say I had a blast reading them and picturing every word in my mind...it was great. Most of the reviews are obviously old since I believe that the hotel it is a very good choice for any type of traveler. Price wise and service wise it is an amazing choice. I spent 3 nights at the hotel and everything went better than I had expected. I was picked up from the airport 10 minutes after I called for a shuttle and was allowed to check in before noon since my flight arrived at 10:30 AM. The rooms have everything, beds are very comfortable, room was clean and the temperature was perfect. I was glad to see a fridge and a microwave since I had to be there for 4 days. I took the shuttle to the Mall, restaurants near by and the movie theater. The staff was very polite and they made sure I enjoyed my stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel and the Staff is doing an amazing job going the extra mile.", "title": "I guess things have changed", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LordRic0n", "date": "June 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 32847209}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled on business", "text": "We came into Pittsburgh needing a place to stay.
