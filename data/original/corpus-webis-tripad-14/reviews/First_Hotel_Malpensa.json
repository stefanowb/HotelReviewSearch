We took the shuttle bus from Milano Centrale train station the day before our flight.(5.5 Euros ea.) Then we caught the hotel's shuttle van to the hotel from terminal 1 at the airport. It was very close to the airport but noise was not a problem. It is in an isolated neighborhood ,so don't plan on anything but staying in the hotel. The restaurant in the hotel was very adequate for dinner and there is a local restaurant next door. The room was very clean . All in all it was a good experience though not inexpensive. Relatively speaking, the location and van to the airport(be sure to make a reservation at checkin) made the cost worth it. We left before breakfast -but it is included in the price of the room.

The hotel is around the corner from the airport, but it is very quiet. The room was great, the people very nice and the convenience a great plus. As another has written, the food is very pricey in the restaurant, but we encountered decent food with a very pleasant staff. So, if you are hungry and particular about your food (after three weeks on the road-we weren't), eat before you come out. Left too early to assess breakfast. You can relax outside or in a comfortable lobby using the lobby bar. I would recommend staying here if you arrive by plane later in the evening before going onto Milan or your next destination. Have some Euro coins in your pocket when you arrive at Malpensa. You will need them to call the hotel for your ride.

We called First Hotel right away, and cancelled the reservation - and then, at the hotel's request, emailed them. The hotel emailed back a cancellation. Our American Express was charged anyway - and we were told by American Express, who investigated the situation, that this hotel has a 24-hour cancellation policy. We then filed a written documented request for reimbursement with Alitalia, and have never heard back, despite repeated phone calls, and one visit on a subsequent trip to Milan. We are out 125 Euros.
