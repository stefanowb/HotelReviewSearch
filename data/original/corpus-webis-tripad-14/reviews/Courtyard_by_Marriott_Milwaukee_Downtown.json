Nice, clean, good value. My only complaint, i am an early riser. I like to get up, get some coffee and surf the net while my wife sleeps in. This Courtyard has no coffee service until 7am! I was told they quit having 24 hour coffee when they remodeled. Clearly some \"Bean counter\" again wins out over real customer service.
