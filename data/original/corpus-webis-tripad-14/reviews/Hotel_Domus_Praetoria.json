Yes, the immediate area around the station isn't the prettiest, it has the usual fake bag vendors and local drunks like a lot of cities but there's no real danger there and the street they are on is fine, in fact I'm sure they're next to a police station.

We were allocated their biggest room and we felt like royals! Our room was enormous with high ceilings, entry hall and spacious bathroom (no bath just shower). The room had cold air con and a mini fridge which was great. The floor was a lovely polished timber and the room had a very Roman romantic feel to it. The bathroom was clean, well appointed and relatively modern. The hotel was a bit tricky to find - they are not allowed large street signage, so you need to look for the numbers and then a large timber door. The lift is shared by other tenants in the building and when we tried to leave in the morning the cleaning lady had left the lift door adjar downstairs so the lift wouldn't move to collect us - so we had to take the stairs. Other than that, there are no problems. The hotel was quiet and close to some lovely casual eateries - although we found dining outside meant putting up with a strong drain/garbage smell....I guess that's Rome. It was a short walk from the Termini station and there is a police station on the same street so it feels very safe. The only negatives would be that although we had a small credit-card-like room key with no identifying details on it, the man on the desk insisted we leave this with him when we left the hotel. Also, breakfast is just a voucher at a cafe across the road. When we were there, they did not speak English so I couldn't ask for something other than coffee (which I can't drink) but I am not sure they served anything else anyway. The food was simply a choice of one pastry - nice for a snack but not if you want more for breakfast. Not a big deal though, you can always go elsewhere for breakfast if you know not to expect much.", "title": "a real gem", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Jen&Mike", "date": "October 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5901859, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the enormous room was total luxury", "disliked": "\u2014 no breakfast or food facilities"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "As this was the last hotel we stayed in on a 7 night trip around Europe we were hoping for a great hotel, which, thanks to these reviews, we got.", "title": "Everything Good", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "beauxl2002", "date": "September 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5883530}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Following just a two minute walk from the Termini (through an area which isn`t really that bad at all) we arrived at the hotel which is marked only by a plaque.", "title": "Great budget hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Kitbit", "date": "September 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5834270, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location near to Termini"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "I believe I am somewhat objective and an experienced world traveller .

The location proved to be excellent for the arrival from the FCO airport (an express train runs from the airport to the Termini station and is 1/5 the price of a cab) and then taking the Eurostar to other cities. Termini is also a metro stop, so we took the train to most sites and found this to be an extremely easy and affordable way to get around the city. The hotel is a mere 3 blocks from the station, but be advised to look for the name of the hotel on the doorbell list as there is no sign. The staff (Massimo, Fabio and Antonio) was extremely friendly and helpful (and spoke excellent English). As I waited for the room to be ready, Fabio went over the \u201cmust sees\u201d and how to get there. He then carried my bags up the 4 flights of stairs since the elevator was on the fritz (it was fixed later that day). The room was blissfully cool in the blazing late July heat (thanks to individually controlled AC). Room and bathroom were much bigger than expected. Both were clean and had the standard amenities. The included breakfast is a croissant/pastry and coffee at the bar across the street (standing only). Though not exactly filling, the service was courteous and fast and one could easily go out to the open air market on Milazzo and buy fruit to complete the meal. The open air market also offers items ranging from undies to lemon zesters, providing a fun, cool local experience.
