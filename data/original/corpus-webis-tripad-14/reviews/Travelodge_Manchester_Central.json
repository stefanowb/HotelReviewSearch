The fact that if you did a log roll on the floor in a family room, gives you at least 8 rolls, shows the size of it. However, I think the cleaning staff need to learn how to make beds, as you encounter a huge bulge in the bed. Also, they need to repaint the rooms as you can see a lot of cracks and dampness and they need to fix the showers. The staff however were fine, with their helpfulness and quick service. Best thing in the whole room was by far, the aerobic mat given to you as a bed however, was never used as a one within our stay.

Grim, 60\u2018s office block in need of demolition given last lease of life as a Deansgate hinterland doss-house for the easy-to-please on a budget. One lift out of two out of order; room smelled of fag-smoke; no chair in the room. I asked for one to be put in; was told I would have to carry one up from the bar indicating virtually no people are employed here to serve the guests.... Oh yes, the bar.....no draft lager available and barmaids caused a near explosion with the CO2 canister trying to attach a new barrel indicating zero staff training. Tinny, mildly distorted 80\u2019s dross music playing at an intrusive volume so I declined the \u201ctwo bottles of Wifebeater for \u00a35\u201d offer and went for a proper pint elsewhere. Had dinner out. Returned to try and answer emails only to find the Travelodge\u2019s WiFi provider seems to have perfected almost Dickensian trick of preventing iPhone 3G access from the room thus forcing you to pay their onerous fees. Went out again rather than pay, returned to sleep only to endure sadistically uncomfortable bed made worse by the constant thrumming of various pieces of heavy machinery nearby that seemed to be in constant use. After all this, I did not dare risk breakfast so went to Pret instead and fell in with the door at 7 AM. Returned once more to try an revive myself under a useless, dribbling shower. Single bar of cheap soap in the bathroom was the only concession to personal hygiene. I only booked as I had a \u00a315 voucher which brought the cost of this miserable stay down to \u00a330. Proof again that you get exactly what you pay for. Bring your wife here if you are looking for a cheap divorce; I\u2019m sure she will just leg it vowing never to take a penny on the condition you agree to a restraining order never to come within 10 miles of her ever again.
