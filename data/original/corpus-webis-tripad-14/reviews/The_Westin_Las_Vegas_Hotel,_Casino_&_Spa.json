The rooms are tiny, almost European in size, and you have to walk around a dresser to get to the far side of the room. Forget the pool, it is impossible to go there no matter what normal time of day you might try - there are only a few lounges and they are always gone. The lobby and casino area is a disapointment, we were looking forward to the low-key style we heard this property offered, and have stayed at many Westins throught the States, so we thought we knew what to expect but this is barely above the standards of a 2 star property. (The rooms was CLEAN though, very clean, no problems there.) The check-in people were lovely, the valet people not. The hotel gave us some free magic shows tickets (Collin Foster) and he was great! You can hear everything in the rooms next door, when they cough, open their curtains, talk on the phone, etc. I knew way more about these neighbours than I wanted to. You can also hear everyone talking when they walk up and down the hallways and the security staff walking the hallways talking on walkie-talkies kept me up half the night! Oh, we ate the restaurant, very mediocre and the couple dining next to us must have felt the same as they left most of their food as well.

Kept asking me for an authentication code. Called front desk who connected me to someone else who told me I had to look on the TV for the code (????). Hung up, went on TV - no code. Only instructions for wired internet which also didn't work. Had to call desk again - spoke with nice girl who gave me the code I needed. All in all, took about 20 minutes to get connected.
