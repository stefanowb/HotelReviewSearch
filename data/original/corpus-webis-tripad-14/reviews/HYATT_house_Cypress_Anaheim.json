Some hotels are iffy where that is concerned.

A balcony overlooking the courtyard area with a soothing sounding fountain and pool area. The bedroom had 2 double beds, very comfortable, and a small flat screen. We had 2 teenage boys with us and so I asked if a 2 bedroom suite was possible and they simply opened a dividing door to another FULL non suite room that had it's own bathroom and flat screen.
