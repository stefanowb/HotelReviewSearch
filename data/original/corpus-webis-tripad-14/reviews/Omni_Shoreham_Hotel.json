The en suite was very clean and the room attendant changed the linen including bed sheets daily as well as replenishing toilet rolls, shampoo etc. We made use of the Select Guest option which we joined on line prior to the holiday and this provided us with free morning beverages and a newspaper delivered to the bedroom at a time of our choice every morning.
