(Although it is fully booked for xmas) We found the staff to be very friendly and hard working. The food was good, we have stayed in 3 star hotels before and this was so much better.lots of variety and very tasty.there is a microwave if you find the food isn't as hot as you would like but it is to be expected seeing as it is a buffet.the rooms were a little dated but spotless/very clean. There wasn't much in terms of entertainment but with having two small children that didn't bother us much. We found other guests on the holiday to be very friendly. The weather was really good too.
