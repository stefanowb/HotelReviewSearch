Yes, the hotel is a long way from downtown (I do not recommend walking at all) and the rooms perhaps may need better sound insulation but my experience at this hotel was absolutely wonderful. From the moment I checked in (which was at 10:30ish in the morning), to the room I was given and to the shuttle drivers I could not ask nor want for me. I certainly will have no hesitation whatsoever to stay at this hotel again if I am ever in Nashville, TN. I am a traveller so I enjoy interacting with the locals of a particular city or town and I welcomed using the local bus network to get around and there are certainly two bus lines that stop close to the hotel. Just a final point, the hotel does not in the main have any free internet access (be it wifi or otherwise) but on the 6th floor of the hotel there is a computer that people can use free of charge - be mindful however it is primarily for the use of the airline staff that frequent this hotel.", "title": "Above Average", "user": "moiset", "date": "October 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 20725640}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Only problem with hotel is their charging for internet usage and even having to use a credit card in the business center.
