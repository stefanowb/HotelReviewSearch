I did check regularly before our trip and the information I learned was most valuable. The magical express worked perfectly. Traveled with wife, 8 yr daugher, and 5 yr son. Had seven bags and never had to touch them. We arrived at airport at 9:30 PM. Walked right onto bus, check in was less than 5 minutes, changed into swim suits, took a late night swim, went for for a snack, and returned to room around midnight and all of our bags were there. Great on check out as well. Got luggage cart from front, checked in bags, and did not touch them again until baggage claim at Cleveland Airport. Hotel staff was great. Every person was very pleasant. Took advantage of tip envelopes per day for housekeeping, upon return to room would find balloon animals, towel animals, scenes with kids toys, house keeping even let me borrow a computer cable for lap top without having to rent one. Hotel grounds always very clean. Icons are larger than life. We were on Disney Dining Plan, awsome idea. Saved a lot of money. Just our dinners averaged about $150 per night. I would guess that we saved between 500 and 750 dollars. Thanks for everyone who suggested to make reservations asap. We ate everywhere we wanted. The Royal Dinner in the Castle is so magical. We found the bus transportation worked fine. Never more than a 15 min wait. Magic hours are a plus. We stayed late in parks every night. I also want to thank those who suggested you fax hotel before you go with your room request. We did so and got room in the 50's section lakeside. It was quiet and every morning we had ducks, bunnies, or cranes to greet us in the morning. I can say it truely was a magical vacation and the tips found on these pages helped a lot.", "title": "Fantastic Trip", "helpfulness": 44, "user": "travelko", "date": "July 19, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5487072, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Value", "disliked": "\u2014 Fax in room requests 3 to 4 days before check in"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "wont go back", "text": "we have stayed at many disney hotels.

At first we were so excited with all the bright bold colors and the neat retro style it had outside. The rooms were very small, not enough towels for four people, had to keep taking some off of the carts, floor was all sticky from something spilled by previous guests. The lines at the food court were very long if you went at peak time. The refillable mug was a great value. Parking was inconvenient. At night we had to park far away from our hotel. Buses to take you to other parks were a reasonable wait and drivers were all friendly. This is a resort for people that are on a budget and do not plan to stay at the hotel resort for the day instead of going to the parks. We figured that being we weren't going to spend any length of time at this resort, it was ok for the price. We started off with this hotel being it was the cheapest, and we got what we paid for. THOUGH, the staff was friendly and someone at the hotel actually sent a photo birthday card of Mickey to my husband with balloons. I don't know how they knew, because we never told them.

I have a family of 4, 2 sons ages 14 and 11. Our last trip to Disney was the summer of 2000. On our last trip we stayed at All Star Sports which was great so I was all for staying at a value hotel again and knowing this hotel is pretty new I thought we couldnt go wrong. I must say Im glad I read a few reviews as they were very helpful. Let me start by saying we were very pleased with our stay, the value hotels are perfect for a family on a budget. The rooms are spotless, and there is plenty of room for luggage and getting around with 4 in a room. So what was different this time....Pop Century is a RESORT and that means it is huge in comparison to the other 3 value hotels. I absolutly loved the walking path along the lake and the bridge. I do believe I took more pictures of the wildlife than anything at Disney. We woke to birds, rabbits on the lawn, ducks and herons sitting by or in the lake and there are huge turtles near the bridge, however getting around can pose a problem. There is no dout you want to be in building 4 or 5 which is the edge of the 50's into the 60's. If you are on the inside of the buildings you face the hippy dippy pool, if on the outside either another buildings or the lake. This is where you find the main building...food court and buses! I think no matter what building, parking is terrible.If you drive you will want to minimize trips to the car, its a good hike for most..Buses, no problem usually on in 10+ mins. We were lucky and never stood. Food court, in an earlier review it was stated there was nothing healthy there, let me correct that person....everyday I saw fresh fruit, in the cooler there were grapes and cut up fruit. I purchased a salad twice. there was milk and yougurt as well. I didnt say those items were cheap. Overall the food court is reasonable, about 10-20% higher than what most of us pay at home. EX: Burger/fries $6.50. The food court stays pretty busy but there was always plenty of seats. All the pools only go to like 3 1/2 feet which is fine for me. They have beach balls and such to play with and there were even life jackets for smaller children to use. Overall the service was good, hotel is a great value for a clean up to date room. The grounds are bright and funky in style and theme. If you are used to staying in $400.00 a night rooms this is not the place for you, however if you are a family who like a nice average room that is clean in a very tacky fun environment...I say book!!", "title": "Disney does it like no other", "helpfulness": 33, "user": "AddictedtoCruising", "date": "July 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5460922}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I loved the theme", "text": "We stayed in the 50's section.

Also, our room was on the 4th floor, which I would recommend to avoid noise from foot traffic of people coming and going early in the morning and late at night. The food court was convenient, with enough variety to please everyone (except no hot dogs, which is a staple for my daughter).

This hotel is Disney's version of a Holiday Inn (along with the All Star Resorts). If that's what you expect going in, you'll be fine. If you expect a Hilton, Park Plaza or Ritz, go to one of the more expensive Disney properties. That being said, the hotel was better than expected. My girlfriend and I requested a preferred room with a king size bed and Disney delivered. We were in the 60's building overlooking the pool. The pool was always crowded and people went in at night but we rarely heard much from our room on the 3rd floor. We also never heard a peep from the surrounding rooms so sound insulation is good. If you're worried about pool noise, get a room that doesn't face the pool and you'll be fine. The bed was comfy and the pillows aren't what I have at home but they did just fine. The room was very clean as was the bathroom. Word of advice: use the privacy sign if you stay in your room in the early mornings. Disney apparently assumes most people go to the parks early and come cleaning around 9/10am. We like to sleep in and quickly learned to use the sign the first morning! Also around 10am the happy music plays from the speakers around the pool. If you're in the parks, no problem but if it would bother you (didn't bother us) stay at a room facing a courtyard. We only ate at the hotel once and it was fine. It's pretty much a self-serve cafeteria so you need to grab a table first and get the food one at a time. Think of your college food court or inside a fast food place. Bottom line on the hotel: I'd stay here again and would recommend to anyone coming to Disney on a budget. If you have money to spare, the other Disney resorts can be very nice (just depends on what your tastes are and pocketbook allows).", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 7, 2006", "id": 5435894}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "From the reviews below people like to include the Disney parks, etc along with the hotel review (which I feel should be two separate reviews) so I'll include my experiences as well.", "title": "It did the job...", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "LovetotravelSt.Louis", "date": "July 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5434396}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "Transportation: It varies.
