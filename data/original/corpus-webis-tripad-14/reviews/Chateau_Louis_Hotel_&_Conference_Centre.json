The gym was ok except my room key didnt work to get in there as well as the ones they gave me. The free breakfast was great! Fresh fruit and plenty of options. Not too amused that every morning I ate there the waitress went around and offered everyone else coffee except for me and got to me as I was about to leave. I resulted to giving myself a sponge bath as the shower not only was low-flow but was fine at one point, then scalding hot then ice cold! Another thing I was annoyed about was the fact that I specifically left the \"privacy please\" sign in the door everyday I would leave for work to find that my room was done up and every day I would call the front desk to complain.
