Aside from being only two blocks from LAX, it's an overpriced dinosaur sticking up in the California skyline... this hotel is so old, I'm half expecting to see Jayne Mansfield pull up to the front door in a 1961 Edsel. The good: friendly staff. The bad: OVERFRIKINPRICED!!! You know, that you have to pay $13 bucks a day just to check your email bugs me. That you have to pay $30 bucks a day to park a car (park at one of the MANY nearby airport parking lots, WAYYYYY cheaper) is laughable. The sports bar called \"Champions\" should be called \"Shack du $8 Coors and Baskets of Grease we call food\". It should be standard inexpensive pub fare, but no.... it doesn't matter what you eat in there, you can expect a minimum of a $20.00 charge/person/meal/perhaps. The Steakhouse smells great, too bad you can't afford to change your mind if you decide to fork out $38 bucks for an $8 dollar strip loin.
