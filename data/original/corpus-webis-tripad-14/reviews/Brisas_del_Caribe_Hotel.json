Our room was in the new (South) part of the hotel and was very nice and clean. A short walk to the main building and the beach but it is much quieter. The buffet isnt brilliant (we had better in Havana) but it's not that bad either. Breakfast and lunch at the buffet are very good. Loads of choice and varied quite a lot from day to day. Evening meal in was a bit hit and miss, but the three times we went their, we found something that we liked. My only complaint would be that the food isnt labelled very well, not so much a problem for me, but some people might be fussy about eating something if they dont know what it is. I think I had frogs legs one night, but it could have been anything (tasted like chicken). The a la carte's are all ok too. Not a massive choice on the menu's, but it's enough. If all else fails, there are some good restaurants in Varadero town. For the last 4 days of our stay the hotel got a lot busier and things started to change. We had to put towels down before breakfast in order to get a space (something I hate doing). The service suffered a bit as well.

DO NOT accept a room in numbers 135-140 however as it is really close to the \"service room\" and that end of the hall smells... We had a room in the old section and loved it.Resort: The grounds are beautiful and are well kept. Beautiful gardens between the old and new sections...nice for pictures. Gym equipment is a bit old, but usable. Tours and Restaurants: As many have said before, book your free tours (Canimar River and Sunset Cruise) early. If they say it is already booked, be persistant. Get on a waiting list. It is definitely worth being nice to those who book these for you...they can pull strings. Olimpia and Maida are real sweethearts...Food: Ok, I went down determined to have a good attitude. And I did. However, even with all my determination, the food was definitely not their strong point. Much of their food is deep fried (to death), and what is \"healthy\" is swimming in butter... The meat (chicken, fish, beef, even shrimp) is cooked many hours too long. Being a chef myself, this was somewhat frustrating... The A la Carte restaurants are marginally better. Great atmosphere... OH, and amazing bread.Staff: Friendly. Some I tipped, many I didn't. They were all equally friendly and helpful. Hints: The travel mug i little plastic cups. And plan on giving it to your favourite staff as you leave. You can't get one in Cuba and you will make someone's day.The Cigar store on 64th street, is nice, air conditionned, state run...but will RIP YOU OFF if you don't know your prices. Individual Cohibas I bought for 12$ on 64th, I could get for 6$ at the airport...Don't bring plug in stuff for you room unless you have an adaptor. Every thing is 220. There are no alarm clocks, bring one. You have to get your towel on your beach chair by 7 or your out of luck.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Syl", "date": "May 1, 2003", "id": 986511}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing", "text": "I stayed in Brisas in July 2002, and i must say that i had an INCREDIBLE time.
