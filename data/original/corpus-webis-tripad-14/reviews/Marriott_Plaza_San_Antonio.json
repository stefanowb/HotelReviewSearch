The grounds had character with multiple older houses converted into reception halls, work-out facilities, etc. The beautiful birds roaming the courtyard added to the ambiance - not your standard cookie-cutter hotel. The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful. The proximity to the Rivercenter Mall, La Villita Market, and Hemisfair Park make the fact that you are not directly on the Riverwalk seem inconsequential. We truly didn't miss a thing.

Our first room reeked of cigarette smoke, so I went back to the front desk and they gave me another room asap. They also upgraded us to a room with a view of the courtyard. My mom went with us and liked the hotel as well. Her room originally did not have a remote for the TV, but she let the front desk know and they sent one up. My room didn't have a bathrobe to begin with, but the front desk sent two up within minutes of my call. The kids loved the heated pool and hot tub. The workout facility was very nice. We ate breakfast at the hotel one morning and it was very good. They serve a buffet with a cook to order omelet, pancake and waffle station. The location of the hotel is excellent; just a five-minute stroll to the riverwalk. The self-serve parking was right next to the hotel ($16/day). The only issue I had was the internet access. The website states there is internet access in the guest rooms, but it doesn't tell you there's a $10/day charge for it. They have free wi-fi in the lobby, but it requires a user id an password from the front desk.

Our attendant checked us into a courtyard view room with a great view of the courtyard and free-roaming peacocks. The room was well furnished with nice bed linens. The room had updated carpet and furniture. The bathroom was average Marriott quality, but overall the room was clean. I must comment that the 20\" TV was a little too small. I was expecting a 27\" or 32\" from a Marriott. The breakfast buffet was average for $13. We self parked instead of valet, because the lot was literally in front of the hotel without the hassle of having to wait for the valet attendant.

This bellman needed to settle down. When I said I wanted to self-park the car the parking staff said it was only valet for this day. Although this change in procedure was not advised in any of my communication with the hotel the staff still just charged the self-park rate.
