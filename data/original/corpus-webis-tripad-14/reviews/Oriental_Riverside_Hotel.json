Most taxi drivers didn't seem to know this hotel, so pre-print a map if you're taking a taxi here.

My guide later told me that it's a government-run property, so there's little incentive for anyone to 'serve'. The room itself was adequate, but smelled of smoke (on a non-smoking floor). The bathrooms have been updated and were impressive. I appreciated the free internet in the room. Breakfast was a real disappointment - a multitude of staff (most seemed to mill around aimlessly) and a wide array of food offerings (local and international), but nothing was kept warm (resulting in soggy food), and a good deal of the food didn't seem fresh (incl breads and sweets).
