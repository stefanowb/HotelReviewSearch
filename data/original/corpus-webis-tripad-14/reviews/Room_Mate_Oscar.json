The outside of the hotel is really eye-catching and interesting but doesn't seem out of place in the plaza. That was a decent start, the reception staff were friendly and helpful although apart from checking in and out I had no need to speak to them. The rooms are different, for a start I agree with a number of the other reviews that the lighting system is a joke. It was just a case of pressing all of the buttons until you gor the desired result! We didn't mind the glass bathroom and the shower was absolutely glorious. I would describe the room as functional and it was a shame the only window looked into a hole in the middle of the building resulting in very little natural light. I paid a very low rate for the room though so wasn't too put out by this. The big apples left on your pillow each morning was a nice touch and the breakfast was tasty and plentiful. The location was a major bonus for the price, we were able to walk almost everywhere and it's in a quiet little square.
