My room was in a building not attached to the main building. I was told that this building was in the process of being SOLD and would soon not be part of the hotel. I can understand why as the rooms in this building were NOT 3 star rooms, basically more like a motor lodge. A friend was staying in the main building and his room was much nicer. Also, his room had wifi, where as mine did not. My room was VERY CLEAN, which is always nice. The staff was somewhat deficient. The first key they gave me didn't work. They forgot to call my friend with his morning wake-up call. The desk staff spent more time chatting and gossiping with each other and to my amazement wouldn't stop until I INTERRUPTED THEM. Normally when a guest approaches the desk, the staff stops on their own accord and turn and address the GUEST...but not here. The night time desk staffer seemed to be doing paper work and seemed annoyed that I dare interrupt him to ask a question.", "title": "Good for what I paid, but NOT a 3 star hotel!

I called the hotel directly to book, since I couldn't get a AAA discount booking at their website. I was quoted a great rate for their 'bed & breakfast' package, but was charged over 10% more when I got there. The staff argued with me all weekend, insisting they'd never quote a rate so low, and refused to honor the quoted rate. Beware: the confirmation # given at booking did NOT show the quoted rate. After all that, I now have a credit card statement showing they charged me twice, and the on-staff manager can't find the charges. So, I have to wait t til their accountant returns on Monday to have him check the credit card records. Amenities: While the room was probably luscious in the late 80s or early 90s, it's now quite dated. However, these are the largest rooms I've seen, with high ceilings & an oversized bathroom, as well. The cobwebs along the ceilings freaked me out a bit, but the room was pretty clean elsewhere. The pool is pretty, if you can use it - It might be unavailable due to a party booked there. Fitness room is okay, if you can find it, though I've seen better. And, this is no longer a honeymoon hotel (used to be known as such by the locals) - loud children ran the halls during my stay.
