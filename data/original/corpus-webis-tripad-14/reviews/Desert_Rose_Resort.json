We loved the apartment layout and found everything to our satisfaction. The continental breakfast was quite adequate and late afternoon nibbles and drinks good. We used the pool area and had no trouble in finding a sunbed in the afternoon. The location was superb for us as we needed to be near Hooters and MGM for the entertainment that weekend. No trouble walking to the MGM for the monorail to go up the strip. We stayed the following weekend in a four star large hotel on the strip and hated having to walk through the smoky casino for ages to get to our room.

This is our second time in Las Vegas and enjoyed both times. We stayed at the Rio the first time and the Desert Rose the second. Both are very different experiences and we enjoyed them both.The Desert Rose is just a short 2 block walk off the strip, accesssable but quiet. If you have a physical disability the walk may be too far. The pool and hot tub stay open until 11 pm compared to the strip hotels of 6 pm. It is nice having your own cooking facility. Going out to eat every meal is not my idea of fun. The resort had a nice continental breakfast every morning with a very friendly staff. The concierge was very helpful in printing our flight boarding passes. If you are looking for a retreat to get away from the chaos of the strip (when you choose) at a reasonable price, then this is the place for you. If you want non-stop action then stay on the strip (but pay more money). This was a perfect place if you have a car.

The breakfast was ok with bread, bagels, fruit, cheese etc. Afternoons between 5 and 7 there is entertainment and free wine beer and soft drinks, we only attended once as there is so much to see and do in Vegas.

We arrived very early (due to changed flight) 9am and guy at reception was very accomodating and said they could check us in immediately. Showed us two rooms - first had 2 Queen beds, was clean, tidy and on ground floor. We wanted second room to have twin beds so they showed us another room but this seemed old and drab, also on ground floor with door to roadway which did not have any deadbolts or other than standard ranchslider bolts so I went back and reiterated we would rather wait a couple of hours and get an upper floor room. The guy at reception seemed very unimpressed with my request and looked very annoyed, even though I was extremely polite which was a bit upsetting. I think he sensed he had upset me and calmed down and offered to have a room overlooking strip on second floor made up and ready by 12 but we couldn't get twin beds in the second room as they have hardly any rooms like that. We went to the strip and returned at 4pm. No room had been put aside for us and new receptionist apologised and let us look at a room on 3rd floor with view of strip (as far away from lobby and pool as possible), but it was very nice and clean and we could see Excalibur, Luxor, MGM, Tropicana from our balcony. After that it was great. Room was clean, tidy - the beds were fabulous (this was the third hotel in our trip and by far best beds and pillows). We had two room condo with two bathrooms, three televisions, full kitchen, and dining. My daughter slept on the sofa which was hugely comfortable and all was well. The breakfast in the morning is from 6am to 9am. The earlier you went the better table you got however we went about 7.30am every day and had no problem. We had cereals, toast, bagels, cold boiled eggs, danishes, coffees, hot chocolate and other drinks. Brilliant for free! We went to the mix and mingle drinks and nibbles one evening and it was very pleasant and we talked to people from UK so that was lovely. Pool was small and we didn't use it... every day by 9am all of the deck chairs are taken as people put their towels on them whilst they have breakfast and then sunbathe all day. Hotel is very handy to strip - 10 mins walk maximum to Excalibur, Luxor, MGM and 5 mins to Hooters, Tropicana. We used the $5 each all day bus pass and rode up and down the strip - good value for money but don't expect to get up and down too fast as it stops continuously but cheap sightseeing tour and it goes to the outlet malls too! I would stay here again as excellent large apartments for families compared to hotel rooms. Do NOT use the phone in your room though. I made a 4 minute call to NZ which should have cost about $10 and it cost $42USD. I queried this on checkout and the receptionist told me that the hotel charge about $20 just to dial out an international call and then charge quite a lot per minute and they usually \"warn\" their customers about this on checkin.
