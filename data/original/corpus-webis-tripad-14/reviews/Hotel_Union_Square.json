My husband immediately went to see about changing rooms, they then offerred us room 415 on the same floor - the bathroom was larger, the closet was walk in but still small just enough to put the cases in, but the room was still small, we had no drawer space hence had to live out of our cases. The coffee machine was on the top of the TV, but to make coffee the machine had to be placed on the floor because the flex wire did not reach the plug socket. The view from our bedroom was another guest's room, our windows were opposite each other so when they were in we had to close our curtains. The reception staff were helpful and friendly. But the location is excellent and right in the centre of everything. On leaving the hotel I asked how many of the rooms they had like the one on the website and the picture by the lift, the receptionist told me that they were doing up the rooms and the website is very misleading to guest booking that hotel.
