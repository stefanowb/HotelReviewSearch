The initial impression was good, with what seemed to be modern, comfortable, refurbished areas. However, when I reached my room (32), I was very disappointed. It must have been one of the old, non-refurbished ones, with furniture that did not match, a scrathed hard-wood floor, and a bathroom which seems to have been tacked onto the room as an afterthought. I ate in the restaurant which is warm and cosy, with an old fashioned feeling. The main course was unfortunately overcooked, and pretty much burned to a cinder. The sleep quality was good in a comfortable bed. However, around 5:30 there was a commotion outside which woke me as the rubbish was collected in the car park outside my window. Breakfast is served on the top floor and was quite adecuate. If my room had been better, I would have rated this hotel a little higher.", "title": "Disappointing room in an otherwise nice hotel", "user": "BraddyBarcelona", "date": "September 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 178669548}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice restaurant/rooms need refurb", "text": "Stayed for one night while on business in the area. The location is very good being so central. I had stayed here previously and can see there has been modernisation since then. As other reports say the room I had was also very basic and a bit worn out so pleasing to hear they are refurbishing. There were tea/coffee making facilities in the room which was good. Also wifi was a good speed and reliable. I ate in the restaurant and loved the food. Great menu and service.
