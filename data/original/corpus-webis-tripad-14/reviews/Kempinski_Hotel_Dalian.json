It is well located across from one of the many parks in the city. The rooms were wonderful especially those on a high floor. Very clean and well maintained. One problem is that the walls are thin so you can hear noise from the rooms next door but this is endemic to Chinese hotels and other buildings. The buffet which is included in the price was excellent with a wide variety of Western and non-Western dishes. the highlight of the hotel was the spectacular swimming pool and health spa - spotlessly clean with outstanding atmosphere.
