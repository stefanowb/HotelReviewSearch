This hotel is one of the reasons that I was so hard on the other one. My company has their HQ within a few miles of this location, so I end up staying in the vicinity a lot, and the Hyatt Suites is a stand out. I'm not surprised that it's listed as #1. Although it's starting to show it's age a little bit (they still haven't upgraded to flat screen TV's, and there are a few dings here and there), the maintenance and attention to details, as well as the quality of their customer service still make it a stand out. This really was apparent to me on this stay (I'm here now), because I transferred from another major chain 3* property to the Hyatt and the difference was like - wow! All suites (as the name would suggest), nice pool area, outstanding fitness center (the chilled towels are a nice touch). I the interest of fairness, I will point out a couple of caveats: They charge - $6/day, I think - for parking (this doesn't apply to me, because my company has a relationship with them). Also, they charge &9.95/day for internet (again, doesn't apply to me - this time I'm not sure if it's because of my corporate affiliation or the fact that I'm a Diamond member - probably the company thing. I know that my Diamond status gets me free breakfast buffet coupons. All in all, if it we're for the fact that there is another fantastic hotel a few blocks from this one (you can actually see the sign from their front entrance); I wouldn't hesitate giving this one my top pick.
