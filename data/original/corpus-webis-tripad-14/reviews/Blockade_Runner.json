Both times we have had trouble with the reservations web site which averages nightly prices and is not responsive to changes. The price on the room seemed reasonable, but the reservations agent never ever mentioned that some of the rooms have tubs and some showers only. I did not think to ask because the web site description never mentions this major difference. It describes different bed sizes and views, but not this critical point, which seems increasingly to be an issue as hotels remodel and find showers cheaper and more ADA compliant. When we checked in, we were given a noisy room, near a screaming baby and asked to move. We were given a second room and neither one had a tub. And none were available because the hotel was pretty well booked. So if this matters to you, ASK IN ADVANCE. The breakfast was included in the price and was so so in terms of quality and convenient. They are located on the beach but charge to rent beach chairs. That seems a bit chintzy.", "title": "Nice location and large rooms, but reservations not so good and few tubs.", "user": "pickytraveler49", "date": "October 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142812647}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Pretty nice hotel for the price that we paid.

The bathroom was small but tastefully updated with a rain shower. The coffeemaker in the room is kuerig and they do give you several pods. To our surprise the room rate, which was remarkable, included a breakfast buffet. It was very good - we had scrambled eggs with fresh spinach and tomatoes, vanilla french toast, great potatoes, very nice fresh fruit and delicious coffee.

The outside remains virtually unchanged so don't be afraid when you first pull into the lot. The lobby and dining areas have been nicely updated. We had an oceanfront room which was a decent size; however, the bathroom was a little small (no sharing the bathroom vanity). Again, the reno needed to go a little further in the rooms - new bed for one thing. It had to be the worse bed we have ever slept on, very springing mattress and extremely loud. Seriously, the first night I kept waking myself up when I turned over - that loud. The breakfast was the usual breakfast buffet, nothing great but nothing bad either. We paid $30 for 2 chairs and 2 umbrellas, a little high considering we were there during the off season. So, all in all, the price we paid for the room and amenities was a little high considering the age of the hotel as well as the furnishings. The price is more keeping with a higher end hotel, the Blockade Runner is not a high end hotel.

Needless to say, we were shocked when we walked into the lobby - it is a great little oasis on a great beach. The lobby, pool area, gardens and beach are lovely. We arrived before check-in and our room was not ready, but they took a cell number and promised to call when it was ready. They called slightly before check-in time and by the time we made it to the front desk, our keys were ready and we were off to the room - great service. We opted for a room with a private balcony and I am very glad we did. The main building has 'juliette' balconies that really aren't balconies at all...but rather a balcony facade in front of sliding doors - no room to sit/stand. Our room was on the top floor of the other building and offered a large balcony with a chaise lounge and high-top seating. It was a perfect spot to enjoy the sunrise over coffee (Keurig in the room) or take an afternoon nap. I would highly suggest you pay the extra amount for a private balcony. The pool area was nice, clean and offered abundant seating. The beach chair/umbrella rental was as expected and the attendant made sure we had everything we needed. The complimentary valet was a plus and everyone we encountered was pleasant and eager to assist. The 'free' breakfast buffet was very good with multiple cold/hot selections. We dined at East for dinner on Saturday night and the food and presentation were very good although there are better restaurants on the island for the price. Room was nicely appointed and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was small and the pocket door was odd, but it didn't detract from the flow or usability.

I booked a block of rooms here for my wedding. HUGE mistake. The rooms were not ready when the guests checked in. Once guests finally were settled in their rooms the hotel requested that several of them including the groom move to different rooms. They did not give me the Bridal suite that was promised to me in the contract, putting me in a different suite instead. They did not respond to service requests for ice and other items. I found cockroaches and dirty glasses in my room. The temperature control in the room did not work, there were apparently two settings frigid and off. But all of that pales in comparison to the way the staff treated me and my wedding guests. The lady that we had booked the rooms with, Particia, actually called my mother the day before the wedding to berate her and to tell her that our guests (paying customers of the hotel) could not use the hotel access to get to the beach where the ceremony was being held, all because we were not having our reception at the hotel (i.e., they weren't making an additional profit beyond the 34 rooms we booked). When I spoke to the manager and explained to him that every guest of the hotel uses that access to get to the beach and ours would too, he was less than obliging. I should mention that all of the details about the wedding were made known to the hotel when we signed the contract for the block of rooms, and the hotel made no mention of any concerns at that time. The staff or \"Blockade Runner Police\" as I now refer to them, harassed each of our vendors as they arrived on site, often before they even had a chance to park their cars. In short, the staff of this hotel were extremely rude and seem to lack a fundamental understanding of how businesses work. They did everything in their power to ruin my wedding, so brides beware!!!
