We booked for 1 adult and 2 teenage children and got 2 double beds...not ideal, would have preferred 3 singles, 2 queen or 1 queen and a single. We only stayed for 2 nights and it was late when we arrived so did not bother to seek another room. We selected this hotel because it was close to the airport and free shuttle. It is quite isolated from anything. For example a taxi to Sony Studios was US$20 and to Santa Monica was US$40. In hind sight we would have been better staying at a hotel in Santa Monica with free airport - hotel shuttle. There was so much more to do at Santa Monica. We ordered room service on 2 occasions and would have been much better eating at the restaurant as the room service food was cold when it reached us. The hotel room was typical business hotel room , clean with very small bathroom.", "user": "SandyCAdelaide", "date": "February 5, 2007", "id": 6745793}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pleasantly Suprised", "text": "What a great find.

From start to finish, our 2 night stay was of excellent quality. The staff was accomodating but not intrusive. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. The Select Comfort beds were very nice, but took me a little bit of time to find my comfort zone. Room size was average, but for two guys here for a football game, it was more than adequate. The hotel was easy to find, and close enough to everything we wanted to do. Would stay here again without any hesitation.

They are a good size, the internet access is free (a real bonus), and nice and clean. The street noise is audible but not bad. The staff is really nice and goes out of their way to help.

The beds and bedding were very nice. The furniture looks like it has been updated, however, the carpet and walls are showing their age. Carpet was beginning to tear/unravel in spots and the walls were dirty in some places. The bathroom had a new mirror and sink area. The overall feel of the hotel is good and was a good price at $115 a night, however, this was a discount rate we received because of the circumstances that took us out to LA. The price per night otherwise would have been about 165 and I'm not sure it's quite worth that amount. Parking is $19 a night which is typical of the LA area...you pay to park everywhere. I would think that parking should be included in the nightly rates.

Radisson just agrees with us, and this place was no exception. Room was spotlessly clean, and so was the bathroom. Housekeeping very competent. The room came with free Internet and an empty refrigerator, which is really commendable for a hotel of this class. You'd be amazed how much those two things will save you during a hotel stay. Also, free use of business center (including printers) and they give you complimentary water bottles. It's true that the parking here is expensive. But, all things considered, I do feel this is a generous hotel. I really hope it stays that way. We had a Sleep-Number bed, which was extremely comfortable. Bed linens and towels were crisp and clean. The grounds were very nice, with lush greenery and a pond surrounding the hallway that connects the elevators from the lobby. The pool area was nice, as well.

We were in the middle part of the hotel, neither closest or farthest from the freeway. Also, anyone who complains that the view they got was that of freeway is not being fair. If you're on the south-facing side, you'll see the freeway, the Howard Hughes Center, the Westchester hill and rows of airplanes approaching LAX in the distance. If you'reon the north-facing side, you'll see the freeway and the parking lot, the garden/pool area, and then the view of the Westside all the way up to the Santa Monica Mountains, including Century City and Santa Monica in the distance. In other words, if you're high up enough to overlook the freeway, that means you'll have an interesting view to look at besides the freeway.", "user": "dscrub", "date": "August 6, 2007", "id": 8363039}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008", "text": "Booked six nights at $60 on Priceline.
