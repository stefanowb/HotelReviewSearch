The people working at the desk all maintained a steady cheerfulness and willingness to help with the smallest details from arranging a tour to making the least expensive international phone calls.

I recommend it for a short stay, specifically fi you can secure a booking via one of the many online booking networks, in which case you get value for money. The regular rack rate is overpriced for what is offered,; the rooms are small, as are the hallways, so it can be noisy as other guests leave or come back from/to their rooms. Note: the single rooms are \"cute\" i.e. minute, and you need to be sporty to manouvre around the shower room. For breakfast I recommend one of the \"cafs\" in Sheperds market .....
