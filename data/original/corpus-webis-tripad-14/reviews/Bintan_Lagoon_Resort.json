Our bathroom was not operational for the 2 days we stayed because of a serious problem with the toilet. It clogged and overflowed 4 times in 2 days. We called for an \"engineer\" to come 4 times to our room, each time it was \"fixed\". The next time someone flushed the toilet, it would overflow all over the bathroom- disgusting! When I asked for housekeeping to come and clean the floor (obviously!) they didn't send them for hours and when they came, they used our bath towels to mop up- we had to tell them to go get some cleansers and disinfectants and do a proper job. Needless to say, it was a disgusting and hassle-ridden stay. I voiced my disappointment (anger!) many times and was told that a manager would meet me at checkout to apologize for the awful experience. When I got to the checkout counter, I was told that the manager was having lunch with some other guests and couldn't meet me. After pressing the manager was reached by telephone and I was offered a 10% credit- $58- for my troubles. Seriously? I stayed for 2 days in an unhygenic room with no operational toilet and they offer me a 10% discount? Poor toilet facilites, poor maintenance, poor housekeeping but most of all horrible customer service!

Also, good to know, that the lounge is pretty smelly when shrimps or eggs are fried in the restaurant.
