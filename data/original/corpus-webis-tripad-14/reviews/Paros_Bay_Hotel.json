We were looking for a relaxing week on Paros after much site seeing. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, especially Ester - she was lovely! On the first day, we were a bit annoyed because of the internet. We stayed at this hotel specifically because it had WiFi and were needing to do work during our holiday. The first day the WiFi didn't work at all. We were told \"this happens sometimes\" but I think that the management needs to get the strength of the signal looked at by the company because it would connect to our devices but then no pages would load. Luckily the next day the internet was working so we were relieved. We still had to go to the reception area to use it, rather than our rooms, but we were grateful that it was working.", "title": "Good stay at Paros Bay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LauraHutton", "date": "July 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 135931543}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Paros Bay - My personal opinion", "text": "The pool is fantastic.

We are travelling on a tight budget so to be able to stay in such a gorgeous place for such affordable prices was fantastic. We were picked up from the ferry free of charge and had such a cheerful welcome at reception. We had a sea view room and were given 615 which in my opinion would have to be one of the best as it is right on the end so you have unobstructed views out across the whole point and no one looking in at your balcony. Does mean that the wifi signal didn't always work but you can always sit in the lovely bar lounge area or by the pool to get that. I understand people's comments that the rooms and bathrooms are a tad tired and could do with a spruce but they are nice enough and always cleaned daily. The rest of the resort is lovely everything is modern and so clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We were very impressed with the quality of food and drink available and for such good prices. The royal mojito is a must! The food at the restaurant is all around 7-8 euro and very good quality. The chocolate souffle is insane we had it every night and only 3.90!!! Unfortunately as we were there in low season a lot of bars and restaurants were shutting down and hatrojan through without warning the restaurant closed at the hotel which was really disappointing as it was so great! I would definately say a car or scooter is a must walking wouldn't be fun. We got a quad for a really good price through the hotel 17euro a day and it got dropped off and picked up. If you have had some experience on a quad it's better here then a scooter as it can get windy on the roads and many roads are quite rough so a quad gives more stability. We took the quad to naoussa which was well worth it and to some lovely recommended beaches. The small beach next to hotel isn't great as perhaps due to the wind there was quite a bit of rubbish in the sand and water but about 2min drive on the quad is parasporos which was stunning with great loungers. We were blown away by the beaches we went to with the most pristine clearest water I've ever experienced! Also I would recommend cactus Mexican restaurant to the right of the windmill further around the bay in parikia. Also a good self service laundry behind it called wash and go very clean and fine prices and free wifi while you wait! I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would stay there again although perhaps at the beginning of September rather then the end when everything shuts down.", "title": "Heaven on earth...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Javier C", "date": "August 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 138342665}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is ideal for anyone wishing to visit the island of Paros, being close enough to the main town/port of Parikia, but without being right in the middle of everything.", "title": "Lovely hotel, and really helpful staff.", "user": "JamesandNichola", "date": "September 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 78670382}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Paros Bay hotel is a 20 min walk from the centre of town, situated on a headland overlooking the beach.
