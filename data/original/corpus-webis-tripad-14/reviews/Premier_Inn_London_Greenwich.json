We found all the staff very friendly and helpful, especially the two named above and Angelo in the restaurant. Good place to stay for visits to Greenwich Park, Maritime Museum, Cutty Sark etc. Also not too far from central London if you are planning to go there during your stay as we did. The DLR (Docklands Light Railway) is very efficient and takes about 20 minutes to get to the City, (Bank station), the DLR station in Greenwich is within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. Hotel has only been open just over a year and very well run by staff who enjoy their jobs.

It was up to the usual decent standard of most Premier Inns; nice, clean and functional with no frills. They provided free ice for the room, in an ice-bucket from the bar. We arrived at 10 p.m. on the Thu night and the restaurant was closed so we got excellent fish and chips from the Golden Chippy across the street, run by a very friendly Turkish-Cypriot who has owned the chip shop for over 30 years! As a consequence, we did not have any meals in the restaurant as we had restaurant/market plans for all the following days/nights. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to Deptford Bridge DLR station (there is also a Tesco Express just to the left of the Travelodge there for water, drinks and snacks) or about 7 minutes in the other direction up Greenwich High Road to Greenwich DLR/Rail Station so very handy from that perspective. However, unless you intend extensively exploring south of the Thames and Greenwich/Blackheath in particular, consider staying in a Premier Inn or other suitable priced hotel closer to the city as it does take quite a time to get to/from here if most of your time will be spend in central London. It is only 8 mins by rail to London Bridge which is the stop for the Shard and more importantly HMS Belfast and Borough Market and this train also goes to Cannon St Station, in central London so it's not too bad but does add journey time.
