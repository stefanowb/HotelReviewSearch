The owner is great, warm and very helpful in giving us a map to orienting us and giving suggestions as to how to maximize our time. I think the best part of her hospitality was keeping us updated on the status of the tropical storm that was skirting by the island. We stayed in the studio apartment and were very comfortable. The mattress was not the most comfortable but it was ok. The AC was good and we enjoyed watching some tv to relax in the evening from our busy afternoon. Plenty of hot water in the shower. The kitchenette was convenient, allowing us to keep our water and flan chilled in the minifridge. The grounds are nicely kept. We had rented a golf cart and there was plenty of parking in front of the property.", "title": "Wonderful hospitality!
