Nice hotels(limited) were always so very expensive in the years past. Recently, with the influx of many new hotels, you are able to get decent prices at nice places. The Westin in Gurgaon is one of these places. The hotel is close enough to the Airport and around the business center. The hotel is quite grand, and I always enjoy peeking into the functions that held there almost every night. Midweek weddings are a great spectacle to view and you are assured to find one of these during the stay. The hotel is not an oasis, but it's a very nice hotel for the value. Only one blemish was the service at their basic restaurants for dinner. The service was very slow and the wait staff seemed confused. There were Indian families that were visibly upset at the service. The waiters couldn't get the menus over to quite a few tables and this inlcudes me. The breakfast is solid and a must do at any of the Indian Hotels. The Masala Dosa is quite good for a N.
