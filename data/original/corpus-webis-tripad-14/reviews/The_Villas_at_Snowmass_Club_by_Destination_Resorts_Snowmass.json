It suits us well since it has some of the luxuries and facilities of a hotel or resort, but the condo-style units provide extra room to spread out, which is a big plus when you have kids, skis, and lots of heavy winter clothes!", "title": "Perfect!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "danielleco", "date": "September 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5781957, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Incredible", "text": "In spite of all these positives, there are a few countervailing factors that prevent me from giving me a 5-star rating. First, its not on the ski mountain, so you have to take transportation to get to the slopes in the morning and to return at the end of the day. Second, most of the villas have outside entrances into the units, so it gets chilly (at least in the winter) if you want to leave your room and walk a block or two to the main lodge where the restaurant and pool are. Also, the elevators are few and far between, and fairly slow, so if you're on the 2nd or 3rd floor, you'll probably end up walking up the stairs most of the time. While these are not huge negatives, the Snowmass Club is fairly expensive, so the standards for comparison should be pretty high.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 30, 2006", "id": 5412852}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2004", "text": "Important note: there are a variety of accomodations at the Snowmass Club---make sure you understand what you're getting. We have stayed in the Snowmass Club Villas, which are freestanding condo buildings a block or two away from the main Snowmass Club Lodge.The \"Residences\" at the Snowmass Club is something different---these are the fractional ownership units, which are newer, larger, and more expensive than the Villas.

This is the place for anyone and everyone. I can't decide if the happiest people on earth are the employees or myself and the other guests. You can't help but have a great time. Read a book by the fire place and you'll inevitably meet your new best friend (my wife did)! Take the three-minute shuttle to the mountain and your kids will meet their new best friends. By the way, your lugging distance is actually less than if you were slopeside. Go to the bar to get away from everybody and their new best friends and you'll meet you new best friend. Don't be stopped by the initial sticker shock, from talking to other people they pay more becasue their accomodations do not include, airport bell-service, discount ski passes, wonderful restaurant and bar, on-site afforadble TRUSTABLE childcare, movie rentals, full kitchen in the villas - stop me I have 11 months before I go back!
