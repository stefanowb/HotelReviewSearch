The hotel was fine but nothing to write home about. Our room and the hotel seemed to be a bit tired and old but otherwise sufficient. One thing I found surprising is that the bathroom is did not have a vent so when you took a shower, the room filled up with steam and it took quite a while to clear. There are several restaurants within walking distance and many more within a 10-15 min car ride so that is very convenient. Oh, one more thing .... Check-in took quite a while because the hotel's systems were down and everything had to be done manually.
