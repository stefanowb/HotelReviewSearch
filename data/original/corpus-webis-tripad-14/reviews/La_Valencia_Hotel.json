Once in the reception area, you are bathed in a soft light that immediately soothes you and greeted by two soft spoken receptions who quickly greet you and call you by name and honor you pre requested needs and send you off to your room with that nice bell man Bob.. who shares a lot about the area. We had a lovely room with windows that open, letting in the soft breeze of the afternoon and local sounds. Also, we received a lovely bag, that included a bottle of wine and a sweet. (It was my Birthday) this was thrilling. The room had a wonderful view and from somewhere a wonder smell continue to premeate the room during our stay. We took a long afternoon stroll along the beach and had lunch at Bubba (reasonable and good food). When I returned to the room, there was a wonderful slice of cake and a birthday card from the Staff, I was delightfully surprised.. and the cake was the best. Evening brought us to the Lounge and as the Cerna played we had cocktails and relaxed and watched the fog roll in. Had a light supper there and retired around nine.

We stayed in a beautiful villa in the far west area of the property, just above street level. The pool is gorgeous, the grounds are taken care of, the flowers are beautiful all over the property. We arrived for a romantic weekend, and had taken advantage of a Travelzoo offer. I was contacted a few weeks before my arrival to see if I wanted to upgrade to a partial ocean view for an additional charge, which I accepted. We checked in, was given our room key, and when we entered our room, not only was there no ocean view, there were 2 queen beds, not the king we reserved. The only remedy to this was to spend an additional $500 for the villa, which we did decide to switch to. It had a great private patio, and a beautiful bedroom and bath. No fault of the hotel, there was a lot of traffic all day and into the evening, which could be loud at times. If all of the villas are located at the west of the hotel, then expect the traffic noise.

The weather didn't cooperate (gray, gray, gray ... until the day we left) and the hotel was undergoing renovations here and there. But this was more than made up for by the superb staff and kind attention to detail. (Special thanks to Michelle and Brian at the front desk and Bob and other members of the welcoming valet team.) For instance, a wedding reception bumped us from the restaurant (the site of our anniversary dinner), but the management set us up in front of the magnificent picture window overlooking the Pacific, at the end of a dramatic Spanish Colonial Revival lobby that would put a spring in the step of Norma Desmond. The dinner was fantastic, and the champagne complimentary (an apology for making the new wedding more important than our old one -- there were also wine, chocolate strawberries, and a rose in our room). The room itself had been upgraded to ocean view. Plus we got a late check out (due to ear-splitting tile cutting and repair going on for hours around the pool, dissuading us from using the area until the day we checked out and the noise abated). We would definitely return and suggest you check out this nationally registered historic pink pile on the hill. As repairs and upgrades are finished (refurbished elevator, etc.) La Valencia will emerge as a lady of a certain age who's just been \"freshened up\" a bit to stay in the game -- a familiar enough sight in southern California.
