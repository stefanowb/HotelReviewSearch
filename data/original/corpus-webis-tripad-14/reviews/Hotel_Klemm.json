The hotel was almost fully booked, and so we were given a room in a building 2 doors down. It was very clean and very new, but had none of the character we had been hoping for when we booked the Klemm. It felt like (and probably was) a standard room in a conference facility. We also weren't told when we booked that our room would be in a different building. If we had known this, we would have chosen a different hotel. Nevertheless, the hotel gets a good review for a beautiful breakfast room with appealing food, friendly and efficient service, convenient location, spotlessness, etc. We were also given a wonderful restaurant recommendation from the hotel staff member who was on duty on Saturday night. She sent us to a modest but hip, local bistro with great food, great service and an interesting locale clientele (the Rheingold). We were a litte surprised by her recommendation (we didn't expect such a choice from a \"grandmotherly\" type who didn't speak much English), but she guessed what we wanted and sent us to the right place. Overall, we'd recommend the hotel, but advise others to find our where their room is located before settling on the Klemm.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "frogoutofwater", "date": "June 21, 2004", "id": 2213427}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Quaint Faily Run Hotel", "text": "It was a joy to stay with at this small family run business, and after 1 hour I fell in love with the Hotel Klemm. During May 2002 I had a room with a beautiful view that looked out over a garden area between the buildings of the Hotel and its neighbors.

Not very well known and in few of the guidebooks, this is a small familty-run hotel. The rooms are being redone in a euro-modern style that actually works very well in this older building. My small single was so well laid out that I felt like I had much more room than in many standard American-sized hotel rooms.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "milepig", "date": "September 29, 2003", "id": 1371151}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Wiesbaden"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 27, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 30}, "slim_ranking": 0.0888888888889}
