We flew into Quito late at night after a long day of traveling from the United States and were pleasantly surprised by the cheerful staff and the special touches in the room like the hand-signed thank you note and two plates of (delicious) desserts waiting for us! The first stay was in a \"Guest Room\" which was on a lower floor, and was modern in decor. I realized that I had forgotten my toothbrush and when we contacted the front desk, a friendly staff member came right up and brought one in (no kidding) about sixty seconds. We slept like logs and departed early the next morning for the Galapagos. Our next stay was about a week later, when we returned from the Galapagos to Quito for one night before heading off to the Amazon. That stay was in a \"Royal Suite\" which was HUGE and quite a steal at $100/night. There were two bathrooms (a full and a half). The decor was more traditional than the Guest Room, with the living room containing a sofa, television, incredibly well-stocked minibar, a table and two chairs. The half bathroom was off of the living room and the full bath (with an enormous bathtub) was off of the bedroom. The bedroom had a large flat screen television and a comfortable bed with feather/down pillows and soft linens. The complementary toiletries (which included slippers, loofah, shoe shine kit, sewing kit, shower cap, comb, shampoo, conditioner, soap, cotton swabs and rounds) were excellent quality.

This stay afforded a little more time to explore Quito so we decided to check out a vegetarian restaurant, El Maple that we had heard of. With address in hand, we opted to take the hotel taxi. Once there, we (me, my husband, and the driver) realized that there was El Maple in that area. We drove around for a little longer and then without us even asking him to do so, the driver called back to the hotel on his cell phone, had someone search for the correct address on the internet and give it to him over the phone, and then drove us there. Amazing! Our last stay was equally wonderful (perhaps more so after returning from the jungle where the accommodations were decidedly more rustic (and involved a lot of unbidden bug guests) and we were frankly, sad to leave. We used the business center a few times, which is a pleasant space next to the lobby that had four fast computers and a printer to check our emails and only had to wait once for a computer. We also used the laundry service which I think was actually a dry cleaning service. While quite expensive, all of our clothes that were worse for wear after the jungle came back freshly cleaned and were hanging nicely in the closet in bags. Unfortunately, our schedule did not permit us to try the breakfast buffet but I did catch sight of it when I was on the elevator (to leave for the airport) and it looked fantastic (a land of plenty). Two comical notes: the few times we took regular taxis back to the hotel, we had trouble communicating the hotel's name. After saying \"Radisson\", we would receive puzzled looks and after several rounds of: \"Radisson.\" \"Radisson? \"Yes, Radisson.\" \"Radisson?\" \"Uhhhh....Swissotel.\" \"Ah! Swissotel!\" (The Swissotel is right across the street from the Radisson). Once there, we would point to the Radisson sign and the taxi driver would inevitably exclaim, \"Ah! RRRadissohn!\" So apparently you need to perfect the accent! Or just bring a business card from the front desk with the address. The second comical note had to do with the english translations on the menu, hotel information binder, etc., which were unintentionally humorous (charmingly so). My husband and I are still laughing at the phrase \"Corporal defoliation\", which was listed as a spa treatment (translation: either body exfoliation or body waxing...we couldn't determine which!). The only (very minor) complaint has to do with the large windows in the rooms, which offer a nice view and allow plenty of sunshine, but are single-pane and do not offer much insulation against noise. (Luckily, I had earplugs so all was right with the world.) All in all, the consistent quality of the staff, the rooms, the little extras, and the thoughtful touches truly made this hotel a traveler's delight.
