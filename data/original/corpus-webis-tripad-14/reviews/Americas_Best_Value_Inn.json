We've stayed at this Super 8 several times, our daughter goes to college nearby. Perhaps because it was the weekend of graduation that they were unable to put us in as nice of a room as we had stayed in on previous visits. The room had an unpleasant musty odor when we arrived. We were just dropping our luggage and going out to eat so we opened the window. When we returned it wasn't so bad. We were on the first floor and the second floor creaked when the upstairs guests walked around and they walked around a lot. The breakfasts have always been outstanding but on this stay they didn't offer the \"make your own\" waffles. The other things that were offered were nice and fresh (baked goods, fruit and coffee).

The biggest gripe we had with this hotel was the bed...the matress was fine but the sheets didn't fit and kept coming off and had pilling on them. I just couldn't sleep well on them. The third day hubby talked to the manager and they knocked 20.00 off our room rate per night for the inconvenience...and when we came back we had sheets that fit and were not pilled.

Trains do run all night, but on the opposite side of the hotel I was able to sleep with no problem.
