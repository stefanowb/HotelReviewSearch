Motel staff very friendly and happy to reccommend where to go to eat/listen to music etc. We got the feeling work was not quite complete - the area at the back of the condos is not cultivated, and we would have appreciated a small garden area there. Also, we had to park our car right in front of the 'view', which was a pity!

After noticing a \"Bad Egg\" smell, from one of the units, we complained to the office. After some time, we investigated our selves what it could be. The smell was getting worse. It was discovered that the pilot was not lit on the hot water heater and gas was leaking into the room. Thanks goodness nobody got cooked! The other problem we had with another unit was a tub that didn't drain. With nasty, smelly water pooled in the tub for the weekend, we had no choice but to use a neighbors shower during our 4 day stay. The management did nothing to solve the problem. However, the rooms were nice and I might give them a second chance.

Not so. You would think these cabins were the Taj Mahal the way the manager cranked out the rules of our stay. We got the impression that our business was not wanted when we realized that we were the only cabin booked and the other motel rooms were at 5 percent capacity, so it would have been a nice touch if the manager had just turned on the window a/c unit so we would check in to a cabin that had not been baking at 100 plus all day before we checked in. This is a small town, but the service here did not reflect it at all. Very old, very basic accomodations with plastic chairs falling down the hill and junky cars accumulating here and there. It doesn't even have a restaurant to make it somehow make sense.

What a great outcome. Room was inexpensive (abt $55 for a room with two beds and private bath), basic, clean, well-maintained. Motel staff was friendly, helpful with advice. Best of all, it was convenient to all the restaurants and shops of Terlingua (and Study Butte). What a fun, friendly community -- lively restaurants (Starlight Theater, Tivo's, Roadrunner Deli), good music, interesting stores, and really some of the friendliest people I've met. Ultimately, my visit to Big Bend was really enhanced by spending each night and morning with these fun, friendly people; turns out I'm really glad I wasn't able to get a reservation at the Lodge in the Park, because I'm sure I would have stayed there each night (rather then drive out the 20-miles or so to get to Study Butte and Terlingua).
