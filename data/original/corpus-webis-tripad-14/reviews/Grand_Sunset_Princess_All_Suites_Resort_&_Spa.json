First off hardly any mosquitos not sure what everyone is talking about- also regarding the beach if you knew how to read english you would see the sign at the beach front that says \"Red Mangrove\" that is why parts of the water were brown and had a slight smell, it is natural and the marine life need this to thrive- all you have to do is travel to the right or left of the mangrove and you find clean, clear and beautiful waters. We did not have one bad experience here, well I did fall and hurt my shoulder but no shoes and a few drinks were the reason, wear good gripping shoes the pool walkways get slippery and the resort is all marble floors- just be careful. The staff work very hard, are very friendly and smile all the time- our balcony was facing the service road- all day the workers used this path- as they walked they joked and smiled with each other, truly happy with there jobs and not overworked but wow how they kept the grounds maintenaced. The nightly entertainment was wonderful, food good, pool wonderful, our pool bar had a bartendar named Felix- gotta love him. We walked a lot but there is a shuttle available for those that want to be lazy. My mom at the age of 66 had a blast, she had a swim out room right by the pool bar- a little loud and busy due to the music and games but we enjoyed every part of it. The pool entertainment always made you laugh until you had to pee. There is a local gator by the Asian restaurant, along with many local lizards and iguanas- not at all like Cancun this is the jungle baby. By the kids club there is a family of spider monkeys too I am assuming they live there so they can play on the swings and such at night. I would go back today if I could and my family feel the same.The only problem with this resort is that Mexico's drinking age is 18 - my 19 yr old took full advantage of this- he hung out in the sports bar and disco quite a few nights- he had a blast met lots of friends and was always grinning from ear to ear. I made him carry his drivers license whey he was out and about at night in case something happened.

For it being so huge, they work VERY hard to keep it clean....I even saw a guy in the pool with a toothbrush scrubbing the individual tiles. They even cleaned the statues in the middle of the resort. Our stay was amazing and we really did not have many complaints. I think they could have arranged the dinner reservations a little better because we were only able to get 2 reservations because the others were all booked. The food is just so-so in the buffet but I believe that is because they are trying to accommodate so many different cultures at one time. Breakfast was definitely the best of the meals. During lunch they have a grill outside the pool area with fresh hamburgers and hot dogs that was amazing. Not a very long wait because the meat is being cooked quickly. It was a great alternative while you laying by the pool or the beach. The cabanas near the beach and pool are first come first serve but most people are pretty nice about letting you know they are leaving so you can grab their spot. It is really hot so its a great idea to grab one of those if you can. All in all we loved our vacation but the one thing you MUST do is GO INTO THE CITY! We traveled into Playa Del Carmen one night and we took a taxi there and back. We ate at Ajua which is a cute little restaurant owned by a women from TX. They cooked your food in the middle of the street for you and it was a great experience. Then we went into the shops on 5th avenue and it was amazing.

The third morning I went to the front desk to complain and the lady said someone would be there in 10 minutes and would someone be in the room. I said yes and headed immediately back. After waiting an hour I went down to the pool while my husband stayed. I came back after 2 hours to see where he was, he was still waiting. I called back to the front desk and talked to the same girl. I told her that 10 minutes had now been 3 hours and still no one had come to the room and we didn't want to spend our entire day waiting. Service arrived within 5 minutes and he looked around and listened and made a call and opened the ceiling. This took another hour or so and then we were told they had to fix this on the roof and it would take about 30 minutes. We went to the pool and came back a couple hours later to check. Still noisy, if not worse, and so I called again. Again I spoke to the same girl who let me go to call service. She called back about 15 minutes later to tell me that they had fixed it. I asked her if she would like to come to the room and listen and tell me it was fixed. She said the service man would be back in 10 minutes. While waiting I had an idea to push on the ceiling because as it was louder it sounded like it was actually banging on the ceiling. When I pushed on the ceiling it stopped! When the service man arrived I showed him. He opened the ceiling again and went to the housekeeper to get a broom and bend a pipe that broke the u ring holding it and bent it up the other way...he was so proud he \"fixed\" it.", "user": "Bubs404", "date": "July 31, 2010", "id": 73078629}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Just returned from 6 days at Grand Sunset Princess Resort in Playa Del Carmen.", "title": "beautiful resort...some areas need attention", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "brandbridgeltd", "date": "August 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 74771718}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The place is as huge as everyone comments on..and as well maintained and beautiful.", "title": "Over-rated, reviews don't lie: Platinum a joke", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Playful_Couple", "date": "August 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 74694334}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you can swing it--go Platinum--mainly because you have access to the quieter pool areas and beach area.

The grounds are very clean, rooms are nice size (we stayed in a Villa) with great amenities. I loved that the resort was all-inclusive (including alcohol and gratuities) so we never had to worry about anything. If you are a platinum guest (platinum suite or villa) you are allowed extra amenities, which was nice. They greet you with champagne on arrival, the platinum club has a dinner hosted for the hotel guests once per week. Room service is free for platinum guests (if you have an all day excursion, this is a great benefit) and they also allowed you to go to the platinum internet cafe anytime and use the computers free of charge. I would definitely say the platinum status was worth the extra charge. We booked our vacation through a travel website which included round trip airport transfers. The downfalls to this resort are few, but there are some.... if you book an excursion (we used apple vacations on the hotel property), you need to prepare to be the first people picked up in the morning and the last dropped off at night because this resort is kinda out of the way from all the others. It is the furthest out, so it takes extra time and money getting somewhere. We did the XCaret tour which was an all day event and did not return to the hotel until around 11pm. The next day we did the Chichen Itza tour which was another all day event and did not return to the hotel until after 9pm. There were 3 hours of picking up and dropping off other passengers at other hotels on each end of the excursion which made a long day even longer. Six hours is alot to spend dropping off and picking people up. Not the fault of the hotel though, just wished they would have maybe arranged that differently. I'm not sure what people were talking about relating to a bad smell at the resort. Never noticed any of that. The food was okay at best.. not great. They make reservations for you at certain restaurants on the hotel grounds for different days. Not every restaurant is open on a given day which was somewhat misleading. The buffet is okay I guess.. but they pretty much have the same thing every day for breakfast and lunch. Dinner is a little bit different. They really didn't offer anything exciting that you couldn't get at any other buffet. The beach is nice. I agree that there are a few uncomfortable steps when you get into the ocean.. but after that.. it is beautiful. Plenty of lounge chairs and areas to relax in. Platinum guests have a reserved area on the beach which is nice in addition to a private pool. The resort is very large, so plan to do alot of walking!

I saw no effort to clean the beach. I can handle seaweed as that is natural, but the trash was excessive. I have never seen more trash on a beach. It appeared they had no one cleaning the beach.
