I booked a King Suite at this resort and when I arrived was put in a Double Room. I said that I was confirmed in a King and they told me it was based on availability. No where in my documents does it say based on availability. I double checked! The resort did not care if I stayed or left, they simply said \"it was up to me on if I wanted to stay or go\" Of course we pre-paid so they really didn't care. My husband is 6'3\" and doesn't fit on a double and they just didn't care at all. I would have booked somewhere else if there was even the slightest possibility that we would not have a king bed. Then when we went to one of the restaurants and asked for a particular table by the window we were told \"that wasn't for us\" it was reserved for honeymooners, no other option was given and the table was never used while we ate. Again, the resort doesn't care because you are locked into their eateries so if we left we would just have to go to another of their restaurants. We also requested a different liquor than what was in our room and were told that those bottles were not available to us despite them being offered in the bars all over the property. Room service was not able to bring any alcohol drinks with food either. Our room service dishes (which we were specifically told to put in the hall) sat in the hall for up to 24 hours during our stay. Every time we asked for something that was readily available at other resorts we have stayed in in the area, we were told no and given no other options. Also, our shower was not clean when we arrived. There was a gob of hair backed up over the shower drain, it was quite disgusting. The in room safes are also not digital and require a key that obviously then you must keep track of and carry around wherever you go. The hammock was quite disgusting because if it gets wet at all the blue from the hammock gets all over your clothing and stains. Despite the fact that the website of this resort states that the restaurants require no reservations, apparently if you are a \"premier\" guest you can make a reservation and cut the line at any restaurant. We were never told of \"premier\" status nor offered anything of this kind. The property also has several different colors of bracelets to designate what type of guest you are.

It is situated on a coral reef and it is not safe to swim in the ocean at this resort. They have a little lagoon you could swim around in, but it's not the same as being on the beach. They do have sand spread around, but again, not the same. We went to go have dinner at the Italian restaurant (can't remember the name) and when we got there, they said it would be an hour wait and gave us a buzzer. An hour later, we went back because they still hadn't called us and there were 3 or 4 other couples in the same situation. We were all irritated because there were plenty of empty tables available and no one had buzzed us. On top of that my food was lousy - fettucine alfredo - pasta was all stuck together and impossible to eat. The resort is too big and you have to walk forever to get anywhere. The rooms are teeny-tiny. The toilet had a running problem. You couldn't see the TV from the in-room jacuzzi. The beds were hard. It is in the middle of nowhere.

As discussed in other reviews, the South side is the more lively side in terms of pool and other activities, while the North side (where the spa is located) is a bit more sedate.

We were generally impressed with our room. King sized bed dominates one half of the room, the in room jacuzzi the other half. Not a lot of space to sit or otherwise hang out apart from the porch.

By the way, the website suggests that their beds are along the lines of Westin's \"heavenly beds.\" Not so (at least in our room). Fairly firm mattress with okay linens -- nothing fancy however. I loved the fact that the minifridge was always stocked with water, beer, soda, etc. There was also a wall cabinet that had four bottles of pretty good liquor (Smirnoff vodka, Bacardi Rum, Jose Cuervo tequilla and some off brand single malt Scoth) for making drinks in the room. (TIP -- Minibar is restocked daily but they're always on call). Based on other reviews, we tipped the maid a couple of buck each day (TIP -- bring LOTS of singles with you) and as a result we were constantly resupplied with bath products. When we arrived they were using all Biosilk products (which impressed my girlfriend but meant little to me) but towards the end of the trip they seemed to have switched to a \"Palace\" brand (at least for some of the products). Nonetheless, by that point we had amassed a small suit case worth of stuff that will take us a lifetime to use. We hung out on the patio a couple of times and the hammocks are great. Our view was okay (we could see the water if we stretched). If having a great view is a big deal, I'd suggest nailing that down at check-in, otherwise my impression is that it can be a hassle to move later on (especially if it's busy). (TIP-- Ask a check-in about your view and room upgrades). We noticed that some of the wings had some signs of wear and tear.
