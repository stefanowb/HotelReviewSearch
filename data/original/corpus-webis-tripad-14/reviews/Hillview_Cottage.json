Our first stop for the night, after arriving at Edinburgh airport, was Stirling and the Hillview Cottage B&B. We had found it on Travelocity and booked it before departing the States. It was a lovely restful friendly place. The views from our room (we had the twin ensuite facing the pastures and woods) was serene and felt like a true home stay rather than a place of business. Jon the owner was so very friendly and kind and helpful. His full cooked breakfast was excellent and more than I could eat! The shower had tons of hot water at good pressure and the beds were very comfortable. We went from there to many other B&Bs as we traveled around the country and when we were on our way back to Edinburgh we decided to call Jon to see if he had a room available for us. He did and, after our travels, it was like coming home. We stayed in B&Bs that were more luxurious and more expensive but NONE of them had the charm, the comfort, and the fabulous hot showers and comfy beds of Hillview Cottage. Jon even made our dinner reservations at a very popular pub in Thornhill.

The photos of this acconmmodation posted on the internet do not reflect the state of the place when you arrive. Firstly, the site is situated next to what seems like the long straight at Brands Hatch. However, that can be overlooked when you see the excellent views surrounding most of the property. Car parking was a nightmare. We were instructed by the son to park at an angle of 5 degrees in order to facilitate maximum use of the parking area, but there is not sufficient room for the number of cars, and it is extremely likely that once you have parked later in the day, you will not be able to move again until the following day. We were put in a room with one comfortable double bed and two bunk beds. There was no wardrobe, the one window was a completely sealed unit, the wall heater socket was hanging from the wall, we had to clean out the draws in the chest of draws before we could put any clothes in there, there were no fire escape notices, and the bathroom door was upside down! The room was built onto the end of the lounge where the children were doing their homework, on what turned out to be the breakfast table. The door which separated the room from the lounge was bare wood and did not fit the doorway properly. As such, we could not only hear them, but we could see the light which they kept on until they had finished their work. It was only possible to get any air in the room if we kept the back door open (which led to the rear of the property). This of course is completely impractical at night. As soon as we entered the property, it became obvious that there was a very strong smell of burning incense and personal items littered the entrance area. Breakfast was sub-standard, very little of it and cold. There is a false floor being constructed immediately above the dining table, which currently houses a pile of mattresses. There were also loose wires hanging from the ceiling. In summary, it was dirty, smelly, uncomfortable and littered with health and safety hazards. It is clearly simply a money making exercise and is not run with the care and consideration which, not unreasonably, one would expect.
