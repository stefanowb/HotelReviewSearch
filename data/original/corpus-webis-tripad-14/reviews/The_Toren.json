Pleasant, welcoming and helpful staff made our stay here a memorable one. The Toren is centrally located in the pretty Jordaan district - perfect for transport needs and sightseeing. You are spoilt for a variety of eating places nearby. The two restaurants that we particulary enjoyed a meal in are 1. Cafe Dereiger in Nieuwe Leliestraat 34 and 2.

Along with the Anne Frank museum just around the corner as well as the canal boat tour. Lots of lovely shopping and many places to go to eat and drink.
