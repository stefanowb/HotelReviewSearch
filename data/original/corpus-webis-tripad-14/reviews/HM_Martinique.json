We had a fantastic time. There were 22 blokes of a varied age group. youngest 23 oldest 70. I dont care about other reviews that condem meals etc. These people need a reality check. The cost of all inclusive is almost unbelievable. You can hardly stay in a hostel in the UK for this price. This hotel is superb for the money. Just read that someone got robbed while we were there, but stayed in 4* hotels in the past and heard the same. Everything was great, all but one member of staff that tried to rule with an iron fist. The bar is suposed to be open till 23.00 and my mate, a 70 year old guy, was stopped at 3 minutes to 11 from getting another half of beer. Then on our last night I got to the front of the cue got served half a beer and asked the bar-tender to get my cousin a half who was stood a yard away. The guy in question came up to him snatched the beer out of his hands, spilled some over him and shouted no. I complained at reception and the guy followed me. When he talked to me, he started rabbiting on about how us English come over with all our money thinking we own the place. Watch out because in my opinion he will cause some major problem one day. You will know him when you see how he operates.
