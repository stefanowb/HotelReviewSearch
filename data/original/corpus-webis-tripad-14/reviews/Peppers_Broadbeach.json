Staff are great and location is perfect. Pool on level 4 was warm most days ( wind cools it some days) and spa nice and warm. Location perfect and I'm always pleased we are not in surfers which I find cluttered and tacky. Great beach, park for kids, bike/ scoooter / walk paths,woolworths, shops, cafes and lovely endota spa. Theaterette was great. Now if only they had a kids club it would be perfect! Or supervised movies fri and sat nts for kids while parents go out? ( people with kids like luxury accom too! Thats why they are all in fiji and bali....) we did use the babysitting service which was good but expensive. This year we were disappointed that the complimentary movies were restricted and many were $18/ movie which is very dear when they are $3 to hire. A few more pieces of play equipment are needed in the play area near the bbq. Great meal at nearby moo moo restaurant.

We are actually still here on day 5 of 6 and have loved every minute of it! We are on the 16th floor of Tower 2 in a 2 bedroomed ocean view apartment which is my favorite accommodation of all my hotel stays... It really is home from home! Spacious, clean, modern and minimalistic... Simply gorgeous! Gorgeous sea views greet you from every window... Heaven! In the darkness, the surrounding night lights are just as beautiful! The beds and pillows make for an extremely good nights sleep... We woke at 11.30 today and that was with the phone! Every single member of staff we have encountered from reception to portering to maintenance to housekeeping have been professional, helpful and friendly! We ring down to ask for our room to be serviced whilst we nip out and an hour later it's done... Beautifully! The facilities are exceptional including the pool, the heated outdoor spa, the gym, sauna and steam room! If you enjoy movies then do hire out the theatrette! You are given a three hour time slot in which to use it! There's a choice of beanbags, recliner chairs or an enclosed circular seating area for you to watch your movie and various lighting settings! I would advise you to take your own DVD as there was a problem with their hire machine whilst we were there but a trip to Crazy Clarks for a $2 one soon sorted that out! Our expectations for a movie of that price were low but it was actually really good! Our holiday was simply to chill out and the complimentary in room movies made that very achievable... Great idea! The I pad was also a great idea... Especially as that's what I'm writing this review on! The extras that would have given this hotel ten out of ten would have been a daily complimentary newspaper and hotel in room dining though I acknowledge they have sorted alternatives until this is implemented... There is a minimum order and delivery charge when using this though! That said... The choice of dining surrounding the area is huge but the room is so gorgeous you simply don't want to leave it sometimes!!! Finally... It was my birthday on the day of arrival so later that evening a bottle of bubbly and a card was delivered to our room! The card was signed by six or seven of the staff on duty which made it very personal... Thank you for that! Unfortunately, I smashed a glass in the process of opening it but reception brushed that aside politely and said they would ask Housekeeping to replace it for us... Nothing was ever too much trouble!!!! We're gonna be sad to leave our second home! If anyone is considering coming to this hotel then do it...
