As I looked for hotels, i was not able to find any in several price ranges. First I looked for under $100, and found nothing, so I looked for hotels under $200, and still no luck. So I decided to look in a price range that I never thought I could afford. I looked at $300 and under and all of a sudden all of the hotels in New York came up. The price on the hotel website for The Carlton on Madison, was listed at something crazy like $450. Anyone that is willing to pay that much for a hotel, and especially this hotel is [--] Crazy. So I was quoted the price of $212 for supposedly a superior room. Well if this was superior, I sure would not want to see the regular room. We checked in and went up to the room and the door hit the bed as we entered. Not ok! So we went back down, and asked to a superior room, they said it was, and gave us one with a slightly different floor plan. This time the door didn't hit the bet as we entered. However, the size was still much smaller than any of the pics on the website. The lobby was beautiful, the location was perfect, and the overall appeal of the hotel was great. The rooms were small, the view was pretty lame, and the pictures were decieving. IF I had paid the price that the hotel website was asking, I would have raised hell. But knowing the price of hotels in NY and that it was Valentines weekend, I was pretty satisfied with the place. NO problems to speak of other than the size. The staff was very friendly, the hotel and the rooms were very clean. The bathroom was large and clean and the location on Madison was very central and in a clean and nice area. Close to Subway stops and in an overall great location. Just blocks away from the Empire State building. So go for it, Get a good deal, and try it out. If you dont expect a huge room, you will get exactly what you want. Hope this has been helpful.
