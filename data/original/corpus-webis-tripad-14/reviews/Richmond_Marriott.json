I have stayed at Marriott (JW, Courtyard, Fairfield...and the Ritz) properties all over the US and this Richmond Marriott is the best I've been at. While the JW's and Ritz have nicer rooms/amenities I have not stayed at one Marriott property where the whole package is better than in Richmond. The JW and Ritz properties, as mentioned, have nicer amenities and physical plant but they don't have a concierge lounge and their \"service\" while courteous, is very generic. At the Richmond Marriott the team is very personable. Whether the front desk, the concierge, the bell hops or the valet team everyone goes out of their way to make every guest (not just the platinum elites) feel welcome. I've seen this staff deal with some very tough customers and situations and they always did it with the utmost professionalism and courtesy. The team treats each guest with a genuine sense of warmth and caring...and that's very important to me. Staying for over two years, I have seen the hotel and staff in a variety of situations. Air conditioning break downs, huge conventions, and also lulls during the holidays...etc. The management is dedicated to making things right. When there were problems with the physical plant they were fixed quickly, the maintenance team does an outstanding job of keeping things running smoothly. They recently replaced all the beds and they are a huge upgrade...better than the beds at the JW in Orlando. Really can't say enough good things about this hotel, the management and the staff. I'll give shout outs to some of the staff...and apologize to those I've neglected. Cathy, Crystal, Brian, Nigel, Richard, Mary and John were people I interacted with most frequently and were all fantastic...props to the Richmond Marriott crew.", "title": "Frequent Business Traveler", "user": "Douglas G", "date": "July 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 168176961}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed for 5 nights over July 3-7, and did most of our eating in the room, since our conference was taking place in the Coliseum next door.

The hotel staff also accommodated a few unusual requests and NEVER said \"sorry, we can't do that.\" (Once, I needed a LOT of one dollar bills, and the woman at the front desk cheerfully gave me every last $1.00 bill they had.) The bell staff was also very efficient and flexible - we needed extra time before checking out, and the bell man went away after partially loading the cart and returned an hour later so we could finish getting ready.
