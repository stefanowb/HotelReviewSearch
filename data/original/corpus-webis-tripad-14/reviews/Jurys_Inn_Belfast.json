We also stayed a few years ago and had an equally great experience at this hotel. For the price we paid i think it is excellent value and the location is a bonus. The breakfast was wonderful, would go back just to eat it again!! We had a room with a double and a single bed which was ideal for our trip and the rooms, in my opinion were quite adequate for what we needed. I found it really helpul that toiltries were provided in the bathroom as on the last occasion we only travelled with hand luggage and could not carry liquids. My only tiny criticism would be that I could hear the 'ding dong' of the lift all night but no cause for complaint considering all the positives. will definately be returning in the not so distant future.

Our room was as requested, ie furthest away from lift with no passing traffic.

Fortunately we did not see any of the trouble that did occur. Room was ok, got what we needed, although like previous reviewer, you do need two pillows if the ones supplied are a bit flaccid. Bathroom clean, which is the main thing, but we found the room to be very very dusty, carpets needed a very good vacuuming but as we were only there for one night, we were ok. The new 5 star hotel next door (Fitzwilliam) has only been able to negotiate the window cleaning starting early Sunday morning (6am) so imagine having paid their prices to be woken by the very loud machinery (done by cranes from street so very very noisy) If you were on Fitzwilliam side of Jurys you would be woken too.", "title": "Value for money but easy to improve one or two things", "user": "Cgt76", "date": "March 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 27086748}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "Breakfast was good value to be honest, all very clean and efficient.
