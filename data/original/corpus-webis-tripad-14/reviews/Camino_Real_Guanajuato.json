I've stayed at Posada San Javier 4 times and I would recommend it to anyone. My husband and I always stay in the best hotels and to me this is in par. The only problem I find is the location, to get to town the fastest is by taxi, or take the 20 minute walk. So if you plan on staying one night in Guanjuato I would recommend a hotel near the Jardin (town square), but if you plan on staying a few days, I highly recommend Posada San Javier.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 1, 2003", "id": 986301}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled with family", "text": "spent a weekend at the hotel, built into an old hacienda, nice setting, but rooms in the main (modern built) block (as most of the rooms) are a bit small, and what is not good, no opening window, no balcony (only ground floor have a terace), no coffee free of charge, no outdoor restaurant or bar, a bit a pity in the pleasant climate in Guanajuato, swimming pool is just a pond, bed comforable, room was quiet, quite near centre (about 10 min with taxis) not bad in total, is convenient, but lacks a bit of atmoshpere one could expect in the marvelous town of Guanajuato.", "title": "Conventient, but lacks a bit of atmosphere", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "February 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 54947948}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I decided to go to Guanajuato after visiting San Miguel de Allende.
