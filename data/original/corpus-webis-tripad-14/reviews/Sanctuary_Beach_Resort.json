First of all for the people who complain about their service, let me say something. I have a feeling you guys werent being friendly with them, because they left me on hold on the phone for a real long time, and the service people cancelled the $15 restoration fees for each night. Anyways i got there and check in only took 2 minutes. Bellhop took us to our OceanView Jr.Suite and the view was pretty awesome.I could walk from my room to the beach in 2 minutes. It was great.Deck/Balcony was clean and so was the 2 chairs outside. The little area with the fridge and sink was real nice and convenient as well. Fridge worked well and kept my drinks cold. I remember previous comments saying their refridgerator [--[ but i thought it worked nice. And obviously you have to pay for the goodies in the basket and fridge. You expect them to pay for your dinner and aquarium tickets as well? The sitting area/2 couches was very nice and comfortable as well. Had a nice view of the ocean from the couch. Fireplace and both TV's work great as well. Alot of Channels. 70+ channels. The bathroom is great as well. Theres a his/hers sink, and a shower and a separate bathtub. The best part about the whole room is the extremely comfortable king bed. Their real big pillow is real comfortable.Guaranteed to put you asleep within a minute. This place is totally worth the stay.

The ride down route 1 from San Francisco was amazing. By the time we got to the Marina Dunes Resort it was mid afternoon PST, mid evening EST and we had been up for 15 hours after sleeping for 4. The lobby was small, but uncrowded, and the staff was very helpful. We followed our bellman in our golf cart, named Calamari, to our Oceanfront Deluxe Room. Upon entering the room was small, but clean and we enjoyed the fireplace. The view is what made it special, it was cloudy but as soon as you opened the sliders you could smell the ocean air and hear the crashing waves. We dropped our bags, hit the bathroom and headed to the beach. Neither of us had ever seen the Pacific and it was a thrill just to put our feet in a different ocean. After this we spent an enjoyable afternoon by the pool and hot tub. We went to dinner at AJ Spurs, the food was good and the drinks were strong, just what we needed. Then drove our way back to our room, showered, put on our comfortable robes, cracked a bottle of wine and sat on our deck in the dark listening to the ocean. We only stayed one night before moving on, but it was a perfect way to start our vacation. We got a good deal staying on a Thursday, only $160...

After reading some of the reviews I was a little leary, but would definately go back. Our daughter loved the idea of having our own golf cart and we cruised it around the property. Beautiful views of the ocean, a short walk but fun..The weather was overcast, but made it fun with the fireplace in the room..Staff was excellent and attentive...We enjoyed AJ's restaraunt, huge meals, but great food.. A hint for a cheaper room, Before you book the room log onto monterey they will normally have cheaper rooms at the Marina Dunes than Marina Dunes will have listed on their own website...after you find the cheaper price on monterey.com, call Marina dunes because they will match that price plus beat it bt 5% I believe..anyway enjoy your stay...we did!!!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 23, 2005", "id": 3799164}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Less Than Perfect", "text": "The Marina Dunes is a nice idea--a hotel nestled in dunes by the ocean--but there are many annoyances that make one's stay less than perfect. The resort is a sprawl of townhouses that must be reached by golfcart from the parking lot at the foot of the hill. The construction is flimsy and sound insulation is poor. It reminded me of the cheap apartment that I lived in as a kid when I heard all the noises of my neigbhors (flushing toilets, footsteps, climbing stairs) above and besides me. Ask for a room on the second floor to minimize some of the disturbance. The bathrooms are nice, but the refrigerator keeps the food at about 60 degrees and the gas fireplaces don't do an adequate job when the weather gets very cold. Guests steal each other's golfcarts (God knows why) and our golf cart disappeared three times when we returned late at night to the parking lot. The resort was shrouded in fog 90% of our five day stay in August. If you can put up with some imperfections in your idea of paradise, The Marina Dunes is the place for you.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 7, 2005", "id": 3743393}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "I got back from my Marina Dunes vacation today.
