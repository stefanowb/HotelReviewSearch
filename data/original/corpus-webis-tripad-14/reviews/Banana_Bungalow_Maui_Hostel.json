I started to stay in hostels rather than hotels in 2008 and despite any shortcomings they have I've always been happy with my stays overall. Alaska Airlines had an amzing fare sale to Hawaii so I planned a last-minute trip. The main draw for me was the price. $168 for a week on Maui. Not sure many other places are less than $168 a night! Of course, you sleep in a bunkbed, and are miles from the beach- but- my view is that no matter where you stay or what you sleep on you can still get anywhere you need to go! The hostel provides free tours everyday which give this hostel more value than any other I have stayed at. I did some of the tours, and found that other days i just preffered to use the local bus and tour around on my own.", "title": "One Week here for the Cost of One Night Elsewhere", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lovebeachtravel", "date": "April 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 104074146}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011", "text": "The hostel is in a very local part of town.

A dirty road outside, a local market with all kinds of Hawaiian and Asian takeout within a 1 minute walk, and a cute little downtown area (Wailuku) 5 minute walk away. Local buses that can take you to every part of the island are also just a short walk. Several times I took this bus to Lahaina, Kaanapali, Kapalua and Kehei.

There was a great group of people from all over the world that got together, cooked dinner, drank and went out to Karaoke together. When I felt the need for more solitude there was a hammock in a garden and I spent many hours reading and listening to the call of the tropical birds. Staff were mostly friendly, partied with us and did there best to enforce thre quiet hours so those of us getting up at dawn for a tour could get some sleep. So it was the best of both worlds, you could be social and party, or be alone and get some sleep when you needed it. I had no major complaints at all- no thefts, no bedbugs- in fact I slept better in my little bunk than I had at home! - but I would say the kitchen could have been a little cleaner, the staff a little more attentive- some you really wondered if they were working or just hanging out, and the tour guides could have guided more on the tours. but these are minor details to me.
