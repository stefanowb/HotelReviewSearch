Everyone from the registration personnel, the restaurant staff to the housekeeping staff were both efficient and friendly. Our room was large, well stocked and very clean. Our room overlooked the marina and the ocean. The housekeeping personnel went out of their way to help us. Every morning we had breakfast in the room and it excellent. A little expensive but again you are in a hotel. Dinners in the hotel restaurant were very good. The hotel is in the middle of everything. It is situated next to the convention center and a stones throw away from the marina area. It is within walking distance to the Aquarium of the Pacific and some great restaurants.
