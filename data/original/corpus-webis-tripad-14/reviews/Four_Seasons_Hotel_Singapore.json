Even before our trip to Singapore Nicolai was coordinating the reservation with us to ensure our stay would be perfect, and if it wasnt because of her we almost canceled our booking. Thank you so much Nicolai! We truly appreciate all your hard work. Check in (at midnight) with Aysha was fast and easy, she offered us a seat while she took care of everything and even walked with us up to the room. From day 1 to day 8 they personalized everything and left a lasting memory for our family. Day One we arrived to our room the table was set up with place mats for each of our children with juice, goodies, and cookies spelling out W-E-L-C-O-M-E, as well as bath goodies in the bathroom specifically for the kids. On the last night as we were checking out they told us Happy Birthday for my son (I thought his birthday was the next day, until I realized it just passed midnight so in reality it really was his birthday). It meant a lot to us that they knew his birthday! A few of their team even gathered in the lobby and sang a quick Happy Bday to my son in the lobby and gave each of my children a small toy! Last but not least the doormen always had a smile on their face and greeted us everytime we walked in and out of the hotel.
