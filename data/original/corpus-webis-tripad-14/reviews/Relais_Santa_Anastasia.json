On the 3 km country road leading to the property you see nothing but grape vines and mountains. The property, while remote, is only a 10 minute drive from the gorgeous Castelbuono. Forget going into the town for dinner, the hotel restaurant is fantastic and suprisingly affordable. To be perfect I would suggest complimentary drinking water in the rooms along with tea and coffee (self serve) making facilities. An iron for guest use would also be welcome.Unfortunately the pool water was too cold to enable swimming however the pool area is lovely.", "title": "A must if you are in the area", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tripellen", "date": "October 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 181991395}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013", "text": "My family and I had dinner at Santa Anastacia and we enjoyed it very much!
