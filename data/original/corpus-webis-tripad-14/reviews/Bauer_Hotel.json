I can't rave enough about how fantastic the location of this hotel is. St. Mark's square is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away. Great shopping is right out the door. Harry's bar is just around the corner and right next to a vaporetto stop. The gondoliers at one of the major gondola stops could double as hotel doormen because they are so close. And, the hotel sits along a wonderfully quaint side canal in addition to fronting the busy and dramatic Grand Canal. But, then there's the not-so-good. The hotel is way too stuck on itself and for no real reason. Yes, there's marble. Yes, there are fine woods. And, yes, gilded items abound. But, it's just not THAT nice to have the attitude that emanates from the front desk and the interior of the rooms. In fact, the niceties of the lobby are quickly lost when you venture down the dull, gray-carpeted hallways of the room floors. The bed was the single hardest thing I've ever slept on. And, the pillows were like nice concrete blocks to boot. Our room was large and did shimmer, but the ambience was more cold and stuffy than warm or luxurious. The bathroom did have a generous amount of marble, but the jetted tub didn't work. And, the soap--while it smelled nice--was in the ridiculous shape of a tiny half-sphere that you could never properly grip. Our room did have a nice view of the St. Mark's campanile--which was better than looking at the other antique view coming from the room's obsolete television. The food and mini bar prices are humorous--and I mean humorous: Try 50 bucks per person for continental breakfast--which is obscene in my book even according to the \"resort\" prices I'm often willing to pay. In the end, we paid 170 euros with tax for our room and thought that we paid too much (even though it was the cheapest hotel we stayed at in Italy). I can understand why others who paid 3-4 times that amount were flabbergasted. Finally, I must say that we stayed at the Bauer over Christmas. I'm sure the Il Palazzo is a little better, but I'm sure with a little more attitude as well. Bottom line: you'll be okay here and you'll never forget the location. However, you will also end your trip thinking that you could have found some place just a little warmer, just a little nicer, and just a bit more genuine.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "jonahleon", "date": "January 26, 2005", "id": 3088612}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Classic 5 star hotel", "text": "Stayed at the Il Palazzo from October 10 -14. It is a formal service oriented experience. We booked a standard (Some how standard room at a list price of 600 euros doesn't quite work) at a discount of 350. Prices are cheaper in Aug. & Oct. The room was huge with a fresco on the ceiling. Bath was super. Great location near San Marcos square. The private (Il Palazzo guests only) breakfast room on the 7th floor is beautiful with great views and great food. Only problem is the price of 42 euros per person. That's Venice, all the Starwood hotels charge similar prices for the buffet. We heard complaints that the standard rooms in the adjacent Bauer were very small. We only paid 15 euros per night more for the Il Palazzo, that was a bargain.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 25, 2004", "id": 2785807}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2004", "text": "We were only in Venice for two nights and chose the Bauer because of it's close proximity to St. Marks square. We had two rooms for two nights. Upon our arrival we were upgraded to two suites (they offered and of course we said yes). I had already reserved two double rooms but I was happy to accept the upgrade at no extra charge. Our rooms were huge with two bathrooms. One bathroom had the jacuzzi tub while the other had the shower. All of the staff with the exception of the bartender were very friendly and helpful. The bartender was very rude so I didn't go back to the bar area any more. The room's were huge, very clean but could use a little furniture updating but was definitely worth what we paid. The gondolas are right next to this hotel which was very convenient. We didn't dine at the hotel so I can't say anything about the food. The next time I get a chance to back to Venice I will stay there again. I love that the Bauer is so close to the square where we could go in the evening and listen to the summer concerts.

There is not even place for a wardrobe to put your clothes in, you can hang your clothes above the mini-bar and put them on a board on two meters high (but no stairs to reach that board). The television and remote control (heavy!) belong in a museum, and better ignore the telephone altogether. Shower did not work properly. Only curtains seemed to be thought of during renovation. This surely is not 5* hotel quality. The front desk person told us that this room was were we paid for. Only after insisting and asking if he would like to spend that amount to stay in a cubicle we eventually were upgraded. The deluxe room is much better although not worth $780 by European standards. Location is great, food in the hotel is fine and there is a friendly concierge that informs you on tours. However, if you like to stay in this hotel better book a room in Il Palazzo, the Bauer hotel rooms are not worth it and the superior will spoil your romantic escape.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "AnaHongKong", "date": "September 15, 2004", "id": 2576730}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic experience at this hotel!", "text": "We splurged (for us) for our one night in Venice (Oct 2003) and booked the Hotel Bauer.
