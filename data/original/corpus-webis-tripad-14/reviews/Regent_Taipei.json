The premium is usually quite small (around US$20-30), and for that price you get a great big room in the top floors, LCD TVs in the room and in the bathroom, fabulous service, a premium (but limited) breakfast, free liquor and snacks in the evenings, free meeting room, free internet, various other goodies. And if you are on business, you won't find a better place than the club lounge to entertain your guests.

HOWEVER, when I went into the room, the room was filled will smoke. I called and requested to have my room changed. They did change my room, however I was disappointed with the room! The room was spacious, however it was old and glommy! There are hardly any lights in the room. The TV was extremely small (I think it is only 7 inch) and the TV wasn't functioning well either.
