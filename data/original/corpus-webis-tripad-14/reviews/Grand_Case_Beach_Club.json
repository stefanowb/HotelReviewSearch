I still find myself thinking about the staff at this resort as they were so kind and attentive. I found the staff to be attentive and wonderful on all levels from the cleaning professionals to the waiters to groundskeepers to the front desk. Everyone and I do mean everyone was kind and attentive to my needs. I typically stay in larger resorts so when I first arrived at Grand Case I was a bit hesitant, but immediately the hotel staff made me feel welcomed and all doubts went away. I wish I could remeber the names of all the wonderful staff to give them the kudos they deserve. However, I do remember Ruth and Roselyn who work the front desk...they were wonderful. Dawn, the waitress at the restaurant, Sunset Cafe who was gracious and helpful. Alan and Sebastian who really help me and my family map out my tours. The two wonderful women who worked the car rental were also great and help put me at ease in driving in a country new to me. If you are looking for kind atttentive staff who will sincerely try to meet all of your needs, then Grand Case is the resort for you.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "vcw72", "date": "July 8, 2009", "id": 34272073}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "PROS", "title": "best laid back and friendliest and fantastic place i've stayed", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "doctorbruce_maryland", "date": "July 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 34157262}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "fast and easy check in", "title": "A wonderful family vacation resort with extraordinary service", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "bea0", "date": "July 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33757720}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "beautiful flowers", "title": "Great location, horrible staff", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "jiggastyle", "date": "July 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 33703312}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "we stayed june 24-leaving tomorrow july 8th", "title": "This was a beautiful resort for couple or families", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "gmm103", "date": "June 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33581016}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was 'stuck' in St. M for one night more than I had planned and thankfully this place had a room at an awesome rate for last minute.

Rooms were clean, with well-kept furnishings, and we had a balcony with an ocean view, which allowed us to take in some beautiful sunsets. The grounds were very nice, and a choice of two small beaches with complimentary chairs, umbrellas and water toys added to the relaxed nature of the hotel. Continental breakfast (juice, coffee and pastries) at the Sunset cafe was included with the room. If you wanted more for breakfast, you could order off a menu, but had to pay additional. Also, since the Sunset Cafe is managed separately from the hotel, you could not charge any meals to your room. The hotel has its own security guards and electronic gates, but we didn't really see the need, as the area around Grand Case seemed pretty safe. The main street of Grand case is only a 10-minute walk from the hotel, and there are more than enough great restaurants and bars there. Also, a local grocery store if you would like to buy food and drink to keep in your room refrigerator. Some of the great beaches, such as Orient, Friars Bay and Happy Bay are only about a 10-minute drive from the hotel. Finally, the hotel staff was very nice and accommodating.

It was a 5 or 10 minute walk to most of the great restaurants in Grand Case. Spiga was a five minute walk and the food was excellent. Orient Beach is around a 10 minute drive. Marigot is a 10 or 15 minute drive in the opposite direction. The closest casino is Princess Casino which is past Marigot along the shortest way back to the airport. You can get there in about 20 minutes. We both loved GCBC and would definetly go back. The AC stopped cooling one morning, but was fixed immediately. The hotel staff was great. We could easily never have left the property and been satisfied with our trip. The beach at GCBC was the best beach we saw for children. The sand was great, the water slowly got deeper (no drastic depth change) and it was still very smooth even on a windy day. The beach was never crowded and there was always more than enough lounge chairs for everyone. If you want a quiet place to get away from it all, this is the place for you.", "title": "Loved GCBC", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "MAE05", "date": "August 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8279002}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I recently returned from a five night stay at GCBC.
