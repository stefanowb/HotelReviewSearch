The proprietors Rodrigio and Victoria were friendly, helpful, and responsive to our needs, questions, and requests. The facility was cleaned daily, linens exchanged regularly and they were constantly making improvements to the infrastructure.

This place is really awesome and enjoyable, staff and owners are helpful and nice, they told me where to go and what to do in this vibrant city, it was the best Chile's welcome I could get!. The place is quiet with excellent vibe, the common area is equipped as well as the kitchen, the hostel was always tidy and clean. I stayed in a Single ensuite, big room, furnished, with Tv cable! the bed was large and comfy, best sleep ever, there was a big closet where I put my luggage safely.
