I replied that he and his staff were running a dormitory and not a hotel. Although tastefully decorated, I would never give these people my money again.

I would also have to agree that given the nightly rate we paid, our expectations were not quite met either. Still, it is a large city hotel and the price was \"reasonable\" considering, but for the same amount of money I'll stay elsewhere next time, without the pretty decor perhaps, but WITH all the extras that one enjoys of a hotel.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 11, 2005", "id": 3178599}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great place, great location.", "text": "I stayed at this B&B last August and loved it.

Auberge Le Pomerol is convenietly located just couple minutes walk from bus station. The pictures of hotel on-line turned out to be true -contemporary nice new furniture, styly decorations, rooms and bathrooms are very clean, nice breakfast, excellent coffee, good choice of pastries and jogurt. First night we stayed in a bigger room with double-jacuzzi, TV and stereo-system. It was great. Another night we were in a standard room which was smaller but not any worse than a bigger one. Auberge has its little rustic restaurant with great service. Rue St. Denis is close with variety of cafe and restaurants. People were so friendly everywhere. Great romantic city!

The fire alarm went on every time we took a shower (probably because the room was so small), and it took several calls to locate the internet connection in the room, and it turned out to be behind the dresser and not the desk (which made no sense, so we actually had to rearrange the furniture to be able to get some work done while we were there). The parking attendant was sullen and slow, and there was no laundry or dry cleaning service or any form of it. Finally my traveler's checks were turned down because there were in US dollars, and I had to go to a bank and pay the commission to come back with cash to pay the hotel bill. On the plus side, it was nice to have free internet in the room, and local calls were free. It was also very nice to have a constant supply of breakfast-type foods and beverages downstairs. The restaurant attenant to the hotel was good and reasonable, and had very good service. The furniture in the rooms was nicer and showed attention to details. I think the main problem is that the hotel misrepresents itself in the web site, which makes it look a lot more geared toward business travelers and spacier, with a lot more staff and services than it actually is.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 4, 2004", "id": 2266317}], "location": {"country": "Canada", "city": "Montreal"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 13, "average": 12, "very good": 70, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 100}, "aka": "Auberge Le Pomerol Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.141176470588, "description": "The Hotel Le Pomerol with its ultra-design d\u00c3\u00a9cor filled with finesse and warmth is a real jewel of style and elegance.
