It is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. If the weather had been warmer outside, I would've preferred to sleep on the side streets. I chose the hotel mainly due to price and location. The room was dirty, the staircase could barely fit our suitcases, and the room wasn't even level. I know it's hard to believe, but the entire floor was inclined. My girlfriend and I dreaded coming back to the hotel. We would basically leave in the morning and go back only when we \"had to\" only to sleep. Do yourself a favor, and either pay a little more or stay a little further out in the city. The public transportation in Paris is extremely efficient so getting around is not a problem.

It smells of pee and damp and what\u00b4s even worse: some of the personnel are extremely rude and unfriendly (this does not apply to the young student\u00b4s working extra in the evening). On the day of your departure they practically throw you out. Check out time is 11.00, but already at eight they start tapping at your door with a coin and this goes on for the next hours. I\u00b4ve stayed here several times against better judgement but now I\u00b4m through with this awful place. There are much better budget options in Paris.
