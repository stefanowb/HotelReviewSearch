The staff was really great and made our stay extra special. We arrived early and our room wasn\u2019t ready, the staff was really nice and offered us a variety of things to do while we waited. Since we had a long ride we opted for lunch, the food was excellent. When we were done with lunch our room was ready. I had hoped for a room with a king bed but we got two queen beds but as you cans see from the photos the room was very nice and we were very happy with our accommodations. The room was great and the grounds were simply beautiful. I loved sitting outside our cabin looking at the volcano. My husband really liked the hot springs on the grounds and we saved money since we enjoyed the hot springs on the property we didn't feel like we need to visit the larger hot springs and after talking with other travelers our decision to enjoy the hot spring at the hotel was a good one. The bartender made some really great drinks, I loved that our margaritas were made with fresh fruit juices (no mixes). I was offered a free mud facial, I am not normally a spa girl but I really enjoyed the facial and had a massage as well .

The hot spring (free! for guests) is amazing. Relaxing, beautiful and with a view of Arenal. Wonderful drinks at the bar - tasty food at the on-site restaurant and service of a 5 star hotel.

We spent three nights at Hotel El Silencio del Campo and chose it based on Trip Advisor reviews. It was the perfect choice! We had a spacious villa with two large beds. The location is ideal for sightseeing. We arrived around 1 am and when I took my cup of coffee outside the next morning at 7 am I was delighted to be greeted by the sight of the active Arenal volcano right at my doorstep. It literally took my breathe away. The grounds are just lovely -- lush, well maintained and natural. We all enjoyed the hot springs and loved having drinks and snacks at the bar after a long day. The staff and onsite owners make for a perfect vacation. Every need is attended to with a smile.
