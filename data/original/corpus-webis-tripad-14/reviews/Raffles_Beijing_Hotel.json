Our room was large and comfortable, the breakfast was top notch, the service very helpful and the location was fantastic. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I've been visiting China regularly since 1995 and this was the nicest hotel experience I have had partly because it is quite small so it feels more intimate than a lot of the larger hotels around.", "title": "Blissful", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "newyorkanya", "date": "April 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27466071}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with family", "text": "What a fantastic hotel. I absolutly loved this place!! Firstly, this hotel is very new which is certainly not the case at the next door Grand Hotel Beijing. This hotel is connected to a string of indoor offices and shopping. Also a great location because it is close to a pedestrian shopping street and across the street from the Forbidden City. Since I travelled with someone on business, this gave me time to explore both as well as excursions to the Summer Palace and part of the Great Wall. Our suite was beautiful and had a great view of the Forbidden City. The staff here is great and truely every wish is your command. We had come from the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong and were hoping to stay at the one in Beijing, we chose this one because of the better location to offices. This is no Peninsula Hong Kong but it is certainly very nice. My first dining experience within the hotel other than room service was La Vie which serves a stellar afternoon tea. I found this tea just as good as in the Peninsula Hong Kong. I have had afternoon tea in many places and this was among the best! East 33 is another great restaurant that is traditional Pekingese cuisine. This was my first restaurant to have Peking Duck in China and pretty much had it every night for the remander of our stay! We also ate here the last night and really enjoyed it but had pizza instead that was great. Probably the best place in Beijing for Peking Duck is the restaurant that only serves it, while I cannot recall the Mandarin name, some consider this place a tourist trap although the duck is absolutly exquisite. And as an added plus, at the end of your meal you recieve a little ticket saying that you ate duck number 1 billion...... I still have mine on my desk! I ate two times at JAAN (back at Raffles Hotel) because I love french cuisine. It was absolutly stunning and loved it!!!!", "title": "What a classic, what's not to love", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RitzCarltonfan", "date": "April 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27250199}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We only ate outside of the hotel twice throughout the week (once at the duck restaurant and the other at the adjacent Grand Hotel's Old Peking Restaurant).
