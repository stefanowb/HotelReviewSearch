It was converted into a hotel in 1964. The facade and traditions were kept intact but the interior was redesigned to give travelers the kind of comfort they'd expect of a world-class hotel. At Shanker Hotel Kathmandu, excellent service and superior facilities make for an unforgettable stay. Top features of the hotel include authentic heritage accommodation, beautiful poolside and garden area, professionally managed travel desk, concierge, restaurant, 24 Hour Room Service, banquet & convention center and historical neo-classical architecture. With an ideal location and facilities to match, Shanker Hotel Kathmandu hits the spot in many ways.Shanker Hotel Kathmandu has a long history and many events associated with it are part of the country's history itself. This palatial hotel, which was once owned by a Rana Maharajah of Nepal, is characterized by exquisite and authentic objects d'art, which enhances the beauty of the existing exterior. Nepal\u2019s Late Queen Aishwarya and her sisters were be born in this palatial building. Besides this, it can truly be said to be a monument showcasing the European neo classical architectural style of the Rana regime in Nepal. We have been tenacious in clinging to our roots and by doing so; we stand out as a hotel with few equals, if at all in the historical city of Kathmandu."}
