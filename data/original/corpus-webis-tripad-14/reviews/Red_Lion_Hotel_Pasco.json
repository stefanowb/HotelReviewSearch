The room was clean and the king-sized bed was very comfortable. However, we stayed at this hotel because we were celebrating a friend's birthday in the Grizzly Bar below. It was a Friday night, and there was salsa dancing in the bar. The crowd was probably 99% Latin Americans/Latin American descendants. My husband and I each had a drink and then I went to ask for a glass of water at the bar, and the bartender told me that they only had $2 bottled water available on that particular night. (I understood this to mean that when the Latin Americans were there they only had $2 bottled water and no tap water.) When the bar closed, the bouncers - like 5 of them - corralled us to the door. It was really weird and pushy. We barely got to say goodbye to our friends before they were pushed out the door. They tried to be nicer to us once they saw us turn around to go back to our room, realizing we were hotel guests. Strange. Honestly, if you are going to cater to the Latin American crowd, you need to be more culturally sensitive and let them say goodbye to their friends before pushing them out the door. You can expect it will take them a little while to do that. What's more, I don't think even Anglo-Americans are that quick at getting out the door when the bar closes.", "title": "Poor Service on Latin Dancing Night", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mae S", "date": "November 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121217644}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I was very dissapointed by my experience at this facility. I had reservations for a double King room that was to adjoining to a room my parents were staying. We were in Pasco visiting my nephew and his wife and doing some steelhead fishing. When we arrived to check in, just before 3 pm, my parents were able to check in while I was told my room was not clean. I left my cell phone number and went to visit family expecting a call to let me know when my room was ready. I returned at 9:30 pm to find that the room had not been cleaned and they had not figured out what room I was being moved to. I waited for approx. 30 minutes for them to finally decide that they could not replace my double king and I was put in a single queen. I asked if they would clean it for me to move into the next day and was told no, they were too full. This reasoning made no sense to me as I was willing to vacate the single by putting my luggage in my parents room, but was again told no. The desk clerks idea of compensation was to give me 2 vouchers for a drink at the bar, 10% off at the resraunt or a free breakfast buffet. I used them for breakfast but felt this was a very small gesture for the difference in the rooms.
