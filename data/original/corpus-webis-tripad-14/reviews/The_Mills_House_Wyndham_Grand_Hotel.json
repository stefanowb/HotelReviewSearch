Staff was efficient and businesslike but not outwardly friendly. . Very easy to walk to anywhere in the historic district, just three blocks towards the Battery from Market. We visit Charleston a lot and this stay was a treat. Had dinner at Blossum (walk - four blocks) and breakfast at the Hominy Grill (drive or walk the 3/4 mile)- thumbs up to both.

My son and I were in town for a tour of the College of Charleston. The hotel was very clean and well appointed. The staff was helpful for the most part. The older valet was especially nice. The biggest problem we had was parking. When we arrived the side street was closed due to construction which made parking for unloading impossible. We had to circle the block several times before we could get enough room to unload. This wasn't the fault of the hotel but just very inconvenient. We did use valet parking.The location of the hotel couldn't be better. I had trouble logging on to the internet but called the desk and they connected me to internet support. They weren't very friendly but did fix the problem. We ate breakfast at the hotel. Very expensive! I would definitely stay here again if I could get the same deal through Hotwire.

Everything about our stay was great. The location is excellent for walking to both King St and to Vendue Range for access to the Waterfront Park. Every member of the staff was courteous and helpful. Room was clean and had everything you could want, even though it was a tad on the small side. If you have several people in your party this could be problem. The POOL was the best part! While we were in Charleston it was in the mid 90's with 90%+ humidity. It was wonderful to be able to come back to the hotel and cool off in the pool. The shallow end was a bit small, but it really didnt matter, my son was in it for hours at a time anyway. The restaurant, bar and patio areas were very charming. If you want to get out and grab breakfast, I recommend a small restaurant on Meeting St, two blocks up from the hotel (toward Market Streets) called TOAST. Excellent food, cheap, fast service and the place was spotless. We tried Josephs, but found it to be very dirty and my sons eggs were so overcooked they could have bounced. Plus no oatmeal!!! The hotel does have a very small fitness center on the second floor but it had only a treadmill, an eliptical and a recumbent bike which had the seat bolted so you couldnt move it!!! No weights, medicine balls etc. Ive come to the conclusion that Charleston is not a very athletic town. If you want a serious workout you may want to check with local gyms to see if they will offer a day membership. Overall we had a perfect stay at the Mill House and would recommend it to anyone, but especially to those with children who would like a pool.", "title": "Great Stay, great pool!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "runner4", "date": "July 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 33654374}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "You could not find a hotel in this area more \"Charleston\" than this hotel. It was built in the mid 1800's thus the rooms are small, but that is how they were built then. You are staying in an historic district, expections should follow and it is nice to stay in something not built of concrete and glass. Period furniture and decor just enhance the ambiance. If you want a regular Holiday Inn, go down the street away from the district, there is a brand spanking new Holiday Inn there at Calhoun and Meeting, enjoy yourself. I like feeling like I am in the historic district. The dining room is totally charming and the food is good. If you want a cheaper breakfast, go a block north to Joseph's, they only serve breakfast and lunch and the food is southern! The bells ring every 15 minutes from St Michaels Church, just as they have for how many centuries. You can't hear that when you stay away from this district. The hotel staff was courteous. They have exceptional concierge service. I just feel that if I had stayed anywhere else that the charm of this historic district would have been lost. To visit it is one thing, to live in it is another. I will stay here again without fail. The summer can be hot and very humid here, I am from Arizona and SC is not a dry heat at all.

We were automatically upgraded as a benefit of our Priority Club membership with Holiday Inn. The room was on the small side for two people, but very nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable and we had a nice view of the street in front of the hotel. The only downside to the room (and really the whole hotel) was that the bathroom floor was not at all clean when we arrived. It honestly looked lie they had forgotten to clean it. However, that is about the only bad thing about our stay. The hotel is a couple of blocks south of all the main action, but after you see the crowds and masses of traffic, you'll be glad you stayed a little further from the hub.

It was our first trip to Charleston and I was amazed at the location of this hotel. Restaurants, shopping and most sites are all within walking distance. Parking is either valet or self park. We chose self parking. It was $20/day. We didn't use our car much, so we didn't see the need for valet. The pool is very nice. The courtyard is beautifully landscaped and is a great place to eat breakfast in the morning or have a drink in the evening. The hotel is very close to some great places for breakfast (Brent's, Fast and French, Toast, etc.) as well as being next to 82 Queen, which I highly recommend for lunch or dinner. We ate breakfast in the hotel's restaurant one morning and it was very good (I recommend the shrimp and grits for breakfast). To be such a nice hotel, I thought the prices for breakfast were great ($7-$12/person). Our room was decorated nicely and was very spacious. We were surprised to see the hotel provided Coconut Lime Verbena toiletries from Bath & Body Works, which was a nice touch. The bed was really comfortable also. The only complaint I have is that if your room is at the back of the hotel near the parking garage, you will hear a garbage truck or delivery truck very early in the morning and it will probably wake you up, but I always went right back to sleep. Our room was always very comfortable. The air conditioning felt amazing after being out in the heat. General Robert E. Lee used the hotel as his headquarters at one point during the Civil War, so it has some history to it. If you're looking for a place that's close to everything, I highly recommend the Mills House.

Each floor has ice machines and free soda vending - a pleasant surprise. Staff chatty, helpful and knowledgeable about local sights/restaurants etc. We would really recommend a trip to Boone Hall Plantation. The Buccaneer in Charleston is great for seafood, prime rib etc. 20 bucks per day for parking at the hotel isn't ideal but it's the price you pay for being in right in the centre of a compact city.
