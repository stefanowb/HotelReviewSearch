We were welcomed with a smile and lots of information even when arriving late at night. Compliments to the owner and his wife for the wonderful renovation project they have done to this place. The B+B is located on the first floor up some stairs (no lift) and is on two levels of an old palazzo. ALl the inside has been redone with attention to detail and is lovely to stay in a place that feels new with all new furnishings etc but at the same time with personality and love from the owners. Little wonderful interesting touches everywhere. Room lovely and spacious with a comfortable romantic bed and everything you need including heating. Breakfast a wonderful array of fresh ingredients and nice service with a smile even when you arrive at 7.30am. I would highly reccomend this place for a stay in Treviso which is only 30 mins train ride to venice (station only a 10 min walk from the B+B). thanks", "title": "Wonderful place to stay in Treviso !
