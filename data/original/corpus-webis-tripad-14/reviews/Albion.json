Definitely not super fancy but the room was clean and the staff was wonderful. Family run and owned. Daughter of the owner, Sara, works the front desk and she is a total doll. She's very knowledgeable about the area and gives great recommendations for restaurants. 10 minute walk into the center of town. When walking from the train station don't be scared. The streets into town and toward the river are much nicer and safe. Great shopping as you walk into town. My husband and I didn't book a fancy hotel in Florence because we knew we would be out of the room for most of the day. But this hotel exceeded our expectations because of the great staff. Definitely a good find if you are looking for a medium-price range hotel.

Restaurants are recommended, cars are reserved if needed, tickets to museums are reserved, and every detail is taken care of with a smile.

It's quite difficult to get a Triple room, but they put us in a Family room, so it actually had 2 seperate rooms, one with a double bed and one with two twin beds. Would be perfect for a family, or up to 4 friends travelling together! We actually arrived in Florence without a room and went directly to the main train station to ask at the tourist information desk. So we weren't picky and weren't expecting the world. But for what we got we are all satisfied! The price was 120EUR in total including breakfast AND parking. It's a 7 min walk along the river to the Uffizi Museum. And maybe 5 min into the city area (pedestrian zone, shopping, dome etc.) It's a walk but it's not so far that you need to take a taxi or bus. The staff are all friendly and polite. They even tried to help us in getting reservations into the Uffizi, as waiting in the ticket line can be 3 hours+ long! The breakfast buffet is stacked with croissants and will keep you full until lunchtime. The only thing is that the bathroom was a bit small and the hose attached to the shower head exploded once...but when we told them, they had a new hose/shower head fixture attached by the time we returned in the evening. It is on a street where buses drive by so opening the windows at nite is not meant for everyone.
