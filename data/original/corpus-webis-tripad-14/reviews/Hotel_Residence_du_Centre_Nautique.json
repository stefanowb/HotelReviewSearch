The reception staff was very friendly. The room, view etc. were lovely - really enjoyable and well done. Good sized bathroom for Europe. Window overlooking the water/boats. Just lovely ambiance. Restaurant was delicious - if you are a meat eater do not miss the carpaccio. However, the wait staff was uniformly rude almost sterotypically so, to the point, that it became a running joke between my companion and I that they were going to poison our food. We clearly irritated them to no end. Would most likely help if you spoke French but I'm not even sure about that. Nonetheless the food is so good I would definitely say GO. And re the hotel itself - definitely, definitely go.", "user": "toonceswindtalker", "date": "July 12, 2006", "id": 5459870}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "boutique hotel in a perfect location", "text": "I would recommend this hotel. It has a fantastic location right on the harbour and a private car par adjoining it.

We didnt eat in the hotel restaurant but it is meant to be excellent for sea food. Whilst we were there it never seemed to be very full. We took a boat trip from the quay near to the hotel and i would recommend this as a great way to see bonifacio.", "user": "alfied", "date": "June 22, 2006", "id": 5373994}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lovely boutique hotel", "text": "The rooms are duplex and spacious. I would not recommend them for elderly people or those with young children as the stairs could be a problem. They are quite narrow and spiral . The wardrobe was upstairs which wasnt ideal as we found it too difficult to get the cases upstairs. They had a flat screened satellite tv with all the channels. The rooms with a port view were booked so we had one on the back and the bathroom needed updated. i would recommend a port view if they are availiable.", "user": "toutoute", "date": "March 5, 2006", "id": 4583995}], "location": {}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 16, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 1}, "aka": "Residence Du Centre Nautique Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.645374449339, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}}
