{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 274, "name": "Relais Ducale Hotel", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "I stayed at this 4-star hotel in May 2005, and found it very charming -- definitely the best in Gubbio. It is quite a climb up many steps, but generally worth the effort. Once in my room, I had a view of tiled rooftops (alas, not the broad vistas facing south) and the tower of the Palazzo dei Consoli, whose bells chimed every quarter hour. The 2 \"gardens\" at the hotel are wonderful places to sit with a drink and a book. Above the hotel (and Gubbio) is a lovely park, with a winding path for strolling. As a single traveler, one is always given the smallest room, which is a bit frustrating, but that seems to be normal for Europe. Compared to a 4-star in Rome, it was reasonably priced. I would only have a few negative comments: 1) The room was lovely and clean except that there was a bit of mold in the shower stall near the ceiling. Once noticed, it became bothersome. 2) The employees tend to over-recommend their affiliate restaurant, Taverna del Lupo. For the traveller on a budget, it seemed a bit pricey. A less expensive, but equally nice, alternative, is the Bosone Gardens Restaurant located in the Relais Ducale's sister hotel, the Hotel Bosone. I was surprised that it was not recommended as well. 3) I believe that there was car service which picked up and dropped off some guests, perhaps those who had driven to Gubbio and parked in a parking lot. However, I was not given any information about this (I had informed them that I had no car). Unfortunately, from the train station I had to walk up and down numerous cobbled steps pulling a heavy suitcase. Gubbio is a lovely town, not heavily touristed, but a bit on the \"dull\" side. For those wanting a clean, peaceful, and quiet few days, however, it is ideal, and the Relais Ducale Hotel is the place to pick.", "title": "Wonderful small hotel", "helpfulness": 112, "user": "Soprano_7", "date": "June 3, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3527407}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2004", "text": "we were guests of this marvelous hotel late may, 2004. from the moment we arrived we knew we had chosen one of the best. the staff is extremely helpful, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the Stones City and were thrilled to find flower and chilled champagne awaiting us. the service was consistenly perfect. this hotel will forever be one of our all time favorites.", "title": "Marvelous Relais Ducale", "helpfulness": 106, "user": "Arthur099", "date": "June 19, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2206038}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful and Cozy Home in Umbria", "text": "Just spent six days at the Relais Ducale and enjoyed our stay immensely.

The town itself is a wonder of buildings and charming walkways all perched on a hill, filled with interesting shops and nice restaurants. Gubbio alone is worth a visit for a day or two!
