We had a great sea view in a room that was clean and reasonably spacious but wouldn't be described as either pristine or up to date. Thats the trade off of having real character versus a modern up to date hotel. We ate breakfast at the hotel (good job as nowhere around to eat) and it was more than adequate. The snack bar in the evening also did a reasonable burger or pizza. Seeing the old american cars around the hotel and getting a ride into old Havana waas great and worth the extra 5 CUC for the photos and experience. Its a good walk along the Melacon (sea wall promenade) and great for a jog if you are in to that. There is a real hussle and bussle vibe around the hotel. Staff were mixed but have to say generally sullen compared to the hotel on the coast which probably the difference between this which is government owned and the customer training given by the big hotel chains. Speaking to other holiday makers who stayed at the Anglatere (other historic hotel) it seemed that we had a better hotel with a less central location and they got the more shabby place but one that is in the centre.
