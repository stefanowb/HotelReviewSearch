The rooms are incredibly small, and very hot and stuffy--no air conditioning. We could barely turn around in our room, and the bathroom was also very cramped (with an annoying and dangerous step up into the bathroom). We had to keep the window open due to the heat, and found it incredibly noisy in the morning. The parking lot is small and cramped with very little room to park or exit. Definitely avoid the restaurant--the food was really sub-par--our vegetable appy was stale and unappealing, and our entrees were quite mediocre. I would shop around for a better value--this hotel was not worth the rate we were charged.", "user": "WBinBC", "date": "October 8, 2004", "id": 2643396}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pleasantly surprised", "text": "Having read the reviews of the Days Inn on Harbour after booking, it was with much trepidation that we rolled up at the Days Inn on the Harbor.

We found ourselves standing at the window for ages watching the ferries and the seaplanes come and go. The room was thoroughly clean and contained two double beds, which were firm and well made. We also had complimentary bottled water and coffee making facilities. The bathroom had recently been fitted out and although on the smallish side, it was impeccably clean and had four sets of fluffy white towels and complimentary toiletries. I cannot fault anything at Days Inn...well maybe their breakfasts...the servings are far too large...pancakes the size of dinner plates???!!!", "user": "lazybeachbum", "date": "November 18, 2003", "id": 1491861}], "location": {"country": "Canada"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 49, "average": 102, "very good": 149, "terrible": 16, "excellent": 80}, "aka": "Days Inn Victoria On The Harbour Hotel Victoria", "slim_ranking": 0.614035087719, "description": "Perfectly located on Victoria\u2019s downtown Inner Harbour, walking distance to Convention Centre, Parliament Buildings, restaurants, shopping, attractions and more.
