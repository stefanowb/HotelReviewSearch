You would have to be very fussy and critical to find fault with this hotel,as some of the earlier reviews have been,it definitely deserves it's 4 stars. The location is set back into the hillside which means it is very quiet with a laid back/relaxed pace.The views from the balconies and verandas are stunning but i would recommend that you pay a tiny bit extra for a sea view room as you never get bored of looking at the miles of coastline.", "title": "What to expect", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "simeon_1", "date": "September 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5818911, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The food", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing in particular"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Because of the hotel's location you do have a short walk up a very steep hill to get to and from Letojanni town centre and the beach so if there are older people or people with walking difficulties in your party just make sure first but that said there is a free shuttle bus every 15 minutes and we're only talking 5 minutes walk and my mother and father in law are well into their 60's and didn't have any problems whatsoever, so i don't want to put anyone off.", "title": "disappointing", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "grockle69", "date": "August 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5629299, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The views were great", "disliked": "\u2014 Not as child friendly as I would have liked"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "The staff on reception,in the restaurant,at the bars,in the fitness/spa area would fall over themselves to serve you as quickly as possible and make your stay a pleasureable one.The food in the restaurant was superb with freshly cooked local specialities of a different region of Italy on offer every night and a full hot and cold breakfast option in the morning.Both morning and evening meals are on a buffet basis so you help yourself to as much as you want but usually the quality slips when food is having to be cooked on a large scale, that was not the case here,it was flawless and incredibly tasty. During the day the pizza oven fires up and lunch is available by the pool so everything is catered for.If you like fast food and chips/fries this is not for you as you genuinley get a taste of Italy,which we really enjoyed,what's the point of going to a different country if you're not going to try and soak up some of the culture.", "title": "Lovely place to stay", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "wimair", "date": "June 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5315139}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "Letojanni itself is a small and friendly place with lots of the usual shops,restaurants and cafes/bars lining the beach.It is very \"Italian\" though with few signs of mass tourism so again don't expect exactly what you get at home but then the same point exsists here about soaking up the culture of the place.Taormina is a short bus/car ride away and is a beautiful place to visit,being exactly what you would expect from Sicily but the village is set quite far back from the coast so if you want a beach holiday that is not the place to stay.All in all the hotel and area are just what you should expect from the brochure with plenty to see and do.We try to avoid going back to same place twice just to experience somewhere new but we would definitely stay at the Olimpo again without hesitation.", "title": "Customer Service Problems", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "mcmillankris", "date": "September 15, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3907085}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "I stayed at the Hotel Olimpo with my two children.
