The lobby and pool area are really decorated nicely; it looks much nicer than the photos on their website. The room was also nice with a separate seating area and mini-fridge. We swam in the pool but it was really warm (the temperature of most hotel's hot tubs), which was unfortunate because it was really clean and new looking. The continental breakfast was decent, with Seattle's Best coffee (much appreciated early in the morning), waffles and all the regular continental breakfast fare. We found Yakima a little rough looking (we were concerned to leave our car when we went shopping), but the hotel is out of the city enough to provide a safer environment to leave your belongings.

Biggest change I've noticed? They now have Seattle's Best Coffee in the breakfast room, (finally, good coffee)! Too bad they haven't switched the coffee in the actual rooms yet. Carpets are new, rooms are a good size, rooms are well-kept and clean, free wireless internet. I'd love to see them replace some of the mattresses--I've stayed here twice now, and I can tell that the beds are old--because there's a dip in the bed where people typically sleep (at least in the 2 rooms I slept in)--not so good for my back. But overall, I love being so close to the highway, can't hear the noise from it, but it's easy to get to where I need to go for my business trips.
