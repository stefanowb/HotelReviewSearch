We'd stayed there before on one previous occasion and had had a very negative experience, however our stay this time was much improved. The renovation process seems to have stretched to all rooms in the hotel, including those on the top floor. We stayed in room 301 just beside the lift and found it to be spacious with a very comfortable bed and decent shower. I'm not a fan of those cloth shower curtains as I don't feel they're very higyenic, but apart from that the bathroom was very nice. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel the next day so I can't comment on that.
