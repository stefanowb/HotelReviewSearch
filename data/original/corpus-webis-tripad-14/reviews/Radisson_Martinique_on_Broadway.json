We turned up just before 4pm & booked in straight away & went to our room on the sixth floor. I had asked for a quiet room because of other reviews, the room was fine & a reasonable size but had no view. This was our first visit to New York so we weren't too bothered as long as the room was clean. First impressions were not that good, the lobby was small & very busy with a lot of flight crew. The bar & restaurant was all very open & could do to be sectioned off to give a more intimate feel. We had a meal that night in the hotel & were happy with the service & quality. The following morning we had breakfast at the 1st floor restaurant. $15 for the buffet was more than we needed but the service & food we had was ok. We did see one of the waiters completely ignore a guest & refuse to even discuss there request. There did seem to be a bit of tension so I can't comment on what lead up to this but no one forced these people to become waiters or work in the service industry & to ignore the very people who contribute to there wages by staying in the hotel is completely unacceptable. We decided that we would eat out after this. On consecutive days we had to chase housekeeping as our room hadn't been cleaned by late afternoon, this was after informing them earlier in the day. On one occasion we talked to housekeeping twice & then contacting the reception desk. The mini bar, which we found to be fine & offered $15 credit if you spent $15, was never restocked the whole of our stay. Check your bill on departure as the $15 credit wasn't included in our bill but was deducted when pointed out, I put it down to an oversight. We found the concierge to be very helpful & used them to book tickets to the Empire State & Statue of Liberty (take the advice, get there early to beat the queues). The best thing about the hotel is its location, come out of the hotel & turn right onto Broadway & Macys, turn left & walk to 5th Avenue. The Empire State is only a block & a half up 5th & next door is the Heartland Pub & Restaurant. This place was great for food & service, we ate here quite a lot. Times Square is a 10min walk up Broadway as is Bryant Park. We walked up Broadway to Central Park & down 5th, quite a walk but a great way to see the city, we did this several days stopping for lunch & visiting stores. The restaurant in Macys is worth a visit any time but especially for breakfast as is Andrews Coffee Shop & the Brooklyn Diner. We had lunch at the Stage Deli, it was ok but could do with a make over & is maybe living on its reputation. If you go to Macys make sure to pick up an International Savings Card for 11% discount. This review may not sound very good about the hotel but to be honest it's not as bad as some of the other reviews & most of the staff were very friendly & helpful. The location is excellent & we felt very safe especially at night when security check everyone coming into the hotel. When we go back to NYC we will probably try another hotel but would be happy to stay here again. If you go for New Year as a couple or group of friends then try to stay right in Times Square, after 6pm you can't get near. Taxis from JFK are $45 + tolls ($49), we flew back from Newark & that was $65 arranged by the Doorman.", "title": "New Year", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "SL.123", "date": "January 14, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6595163, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Housekeeping"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Ok, so we knew we'd have to pay an arm and a leg to stay anywhere in Manhatten during New Year's Eve, but we expected at least a clean environment. Due to severe asthma, I made a point on contacting the hotel prior to the stay and requesting a non-smoking room. Well, the room was techincally a non-smoking room, but due to the ventilation in the building and the lack of constant circulation to filter the air, our non-smoking room became a nasty smoking room in the late evenings. When we called downstairs for help with the situation, they offered air freshener! Finally, we did get a maintenance man to unbolt the window and tuen on the heat. When we told the manager about this, he was very accusatory and doubting of our experience. For over $500 a night, I'd expect a bit more! The food was awful in the restaurant as was the service.

In that regard, we weren't disappointed. A subway entrance is right as you walk out the building or, if you want shopping, Macy's is just a few blocks away. You really can't beat the location, but that's if you're willing to suffer through the freezing rooms and the staff's attitudes. As soon as we walked into our 8th floor room (with an excellent view of a brick wall), we went to turn up the thermostat. Alas, it was stuck on 60 degrees, regardless of our attempts to turn it up. We called down to the main desk and after forty-five minutes a repairman arrived. He poked and prodded around, messing with the main unit for a couple minutes (we later realized all he did was press the \"on/off\" button of the main unit), and then declared it would get warm in no time. Twenty minutes later: still freezing! We replicated his actions to no avail. Needless to say, we tried to stay out of the room as much as possible, despite the outside temperature holding steady at 20 degrees. The room was clean, though the lights gave off an odd, bright white light, which is fine if you're working in a high-tech laboratory, but not if you want to read a book in bed. The TV - a flat screen Sharp - had a number problems, including freezing up, making squeeling sounds, and not responding to the remote. The internet was similar. The hotel website boasts high-speed wireless internet, free!, in every room. In reality, every room is equipped with the lowest broadband wireless access, but with the option to purchase high speed for $12.95 per day. Geez! Was the room worth the price? Heck no! Upon checkout, there were two staff members behind the desk, and one was helping another couple. The other staff member was bustling around, but clearly doing nothing. The man before me kept trying to grab her attention to ask her if a box of his had arrived. She said, \"you expectin' a box?\" before ignoring him and moving on to other tasks. His repeated efforts to get her attention were fruitless. Five minutes later, she asks me if I want to check out, completely ignoring the guy who had been desperately trying to talk to her for ten minutes. I motioned to him and said, \"he was here before me,\" and finally she listened to his question and helped. The service was poor, the staff rude and inefficient. The only redeeming thing about the hotel was the bellman and his staff. They were pleasant, quick, and courteous. On the whole, I wouldn't stay there again, regardless of the location.", "title": "Great Location, But Don't Count On Service!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bwrightva", "date": "January 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 53025337}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled on business", "text": "We stayed here for 4 nights.
