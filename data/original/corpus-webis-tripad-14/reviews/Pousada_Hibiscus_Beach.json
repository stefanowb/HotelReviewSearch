The pousada is located near Joao Fernandez beach (a 3 minute walk from the Pousada) and near Ossos (a further 6 - 7 minute walk). Hibiscus Beach is run by an English/Irish couple who have been in Buzios for over 20 years. The pousada was pretty much exactly what we were after. Our room was in a stand-alone small chalet with a small terrace/balcony with nice views down the hillside (and you can see the sea in the distance). Comfortable and well-presented. Nothing fancy, but I could have stayed there for longer with no complaints. Plenty of room for two. Everything you need including a safe (for \u00a31 a day extra). All the chalets are on a grassy hillside behind Joao Fernandez beach (very quiet and serene but you don\u2019t feel like you are lost in the middle of nowhere), but the walk up to the bungalows isn\u2019t taxing \u2013 we stayed in number 3 and you have to walk up maybe 30 steps to get there. It\u2019s no worse than walking up a flight of stairs to be honest. There is a pool too though we didn\u2019t try it as we went for the beaches. Breakfast is relatively simple and the same kind we tended to find most places we were in Brazil \u2013 fresh juice, breads and condiments, yoghurt, cuts of meat and cheese, scrambled eggs etc. Enough to get you going. The breakfast is set up in the main part of the pousada where the reception is located, and is pleasant as you sit semi-outdoors on a kind of veranda/terrace overlooking the pool. We thought the best things about this place were a). the staff who all spoke English and were extremely helpful in organizing transfers, buggies, take-aways etc etc both before and during our stay and b). the location. Joao Fernandez is a beautiful beach just moments away from the pousada. There\u2019s a decent amount going on there (even in autumn when we were there). A few beach side bars selling grilled fish, drinks etc etc. It is also just a 10 minute walk from Ossos which has restaurant options for both lunch and dinner (not many, but the ones there are nice enough, and there\u2019s a great beach \u2013 Azeda, my favourite in Buzios - just round the corner from Ossos). Ossos is on the beachfront and there is a lovely little marina just in front. From there, a walk along the sea front takes you into town. We loved the walk! It\u2019s along some wooden decking, past the statue of Brigitte Bardot etc and into all the bars and restaurants of town which is VERY pretty. Try Brigitte\u2019s for dinner if you want a nice fish dinner, but make sure you go through the restaurant for a table at the back overlooking the beach. And try Chez Michou for crepes! All in all, if you want a stress free, pleasant stay in a good location at reasonable cost, you can\u2019t do much better. You won\u2019t have anything to worry about and we came away feeling we\u2019d picked a really good spot. It\u2019s not absolute luxury, but then again very little in Brazil is and Hibiscus Beach is as good as we found anywhere. Incidentally, taxis to get around buzios are \u00a33 each way (it seems to be a flat rate) but we recommend you rent a buggy. We got them cheap for around \u00a320 per day (organized by the pousada, they\u2019re a bit more in peak season) and they are absolutely fantastic for driving round the peninsula and checking out all the beaches.
