The sand is almost white. The sea is crystal clear. A solitary swim here at dusk is pure heaven. The rooms are built of local natural stone, making them blend in with the landscape. And while it is an understandably popular choice with families, the extensive grounds allow peace and relaxation for those without buckets and spades. But there\u2019s more! It has deer. It has peacocks. It has perfectly mixed cocktails at the Delfini bar. It has first class amenities without any of the associated pretentiousness. I will certainly be back.", "title": "Heaven on Thasos", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PocketJockey", "date": "August 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116790063}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We spend week in the beginning of August 2011 and we had very relaxing vacation.

The bungalows are a little outdated and need renovation and I think they are definitely not a 4 star. The buffet is excellent, definitely 5 star, with great abundance of food, both for the breakfast and the dinner. The dining restaurant is excellent, very close to beach with excellent sea view. The beach is perfect, water was warm, clean and great for small children. Reception and staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the hotel manager. We first booked standard bungalow which was 250m up in the hill from the beach and was difficult to climb several times a day with our child but then we requested another which was closer to the reception and the beach and we were given one without problem. The hotel had good entertainment program at nights. One night they had show with clowns and face painting and the children were really excited. Another night they had live Greek music then disco night etc. There are a lot of peacocks and fawns in the complex and our daughter was really excited. They came in front of our balcony every day and we fed them.", "title": "Great hotel for relaxed family holiday", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Cece1216", "date": "August 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116459310}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Bungalows very good and well cleaned daily, free air conditioning and safe a bonus.
