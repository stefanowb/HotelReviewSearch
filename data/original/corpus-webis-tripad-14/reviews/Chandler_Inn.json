It was clean, the staff was nice and the location was excellent. Just a short walk to the subway, next to the theatre district, 5-7 minutes from Newbury st. Yes the bathroom was small but for the price, you cannot complain. I would recommend this hotel to budget travellers and students.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 31, 2006", "id": 4399939}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Worst hotel I have ever been in.", "text": "Do not stay in this hotel unless you enjoy lying awake all night listening to people in nearby rooms having sex.

The room we had was a corner room which has a much better view so try and request this. The bathroom is on the small side but your on holiday you don't spend 24 hrs in the loo !! It is a very mixed hotel i.e straight, gay, old, young but if you are prejudice then just don't book it and it might stop the bad review this place has gotten. The sheets were clean as were the towels the tea and coffee facilities were fine and the bed was comfy would stay again when visiting..great wee gem of place.", "title": "great stay, great staff , great location, great price", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "sambennie", "date": "September 30, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3980262}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Boston"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 40, "average": 99, "very good": 345, "terrible": 20, "excellent": 218}, "aka": "Chandler Hotel Boston", "slim_ranking": 0.61038961039, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "The Chandler Inn is a small European style Boutique Hotel located in Boston's hip and historic South End.
