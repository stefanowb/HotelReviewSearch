We have stayed at Pompano three times in the past ten years, most recently July 10-16, 2009. Each time we have been impressed with many new services and amenities. Brothers Tom and Larry Lamb along with their friendly and genuine staff work non-stop to ensure that every guest has a memorable experience, and they make it so personable by actually remembering their guests\u2019 names! The entire property is impeccably maintained, the food is delicious, and their private beach is pristine. Beach towels are fresh and fluffy each morning, and all areas on the multi-level property are spic and span, including the pool, several Jacuzzi\u2019s, and all of the many secluded spots in the privacy you can get without a reservation. There is a full-service spa, and a water-view fitness center with up-to-date equipment. We took advantage of the complimentary shuttle service provided by Tom, Larry and the staff when we wanted to go to Port Royal Golf Course, a ferry dock with service to Hamilton, and a marina where we rented a boat and later hired a captain who took us for a \u00bd day exciting reef fishing trip. Pompano also has complimentary water sports and a reef in front of the property that provides excellent snorkeling. There is entertainment nightly, two dining rooms with menus that change daily, and pc\u2019s in the lobby with free internet service. There are many different areas from which to choose to lounge and gaze at the spectacular aqua-colored water and magnificent sunsets.

We were traveling alone but somehow we felt as if we had many friends around since everyone seemed so open to engage in pleasant conversations. If you have the chance to try a massage we highly reccomend it. The services at the spa were better than we have had at any other vacation spot. The setting was spectacular and I will dream of floating in the glorious water until I return.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "movinmama", "date": "July 12, 2006", "id": 5460541}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "We just returned from a 5 day stay to celebrate our 40th anniversary, and it was perfect! The food was 5-star every night, and breakfasts were plentiful and luscious. Our room and its settiing, right above the beach, was everything we could hope for - 2 window walls on the ocean, bath w/ 2 person shower and a soaking tub, big balcony with both chairs and chaises longues - just lovely (it was in their deluxe category and worth every penny). We did get a transfer one of our 5 nights to the Reefs restaurant and found it not nearly as good as the Pompano's food. Other guests echoed the same sentiment. The menus at the Pompano were different every night. All seating has ocean views and there are 2 different restaurants for eveing meals, with inside or outside dining, sunsets included! A note - it was explained that the Pompano can only transfer guests to other restaurants the number who request a tranfer in. They get to do 2 transfers \"free\" each night and try not to let the same couples always have the transfers. The men at the front desk and Kerry are especially helpful - they gave great advice on walks , etc. and were always willing to take us to starting points or pick us up. We loved the lack of waves and the freedom to relax on the floats in the calm sea. Try the lemon-grass stress relief massage at the spa - heavenly!", "title": "Just OK.....", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "beachluvr7", "date": "July 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5441941}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I want to thank all of the people who stayed at the Pompano Beach Club and sent in their reviews. Because of this we had a wonderful week from August 8th to the 15th at the Resort. There can't possibly be a friendlier, more helpful staff from the \"hands on\" owners Larry and Tom to the servers in the restaurants and the staff on the beach. The location is excellent, the water is crystal clear and calm and if you have children I don't think there could be a safer beach. We would like to give a special thanks to the Interns from the Univeristy of New Hampshire and the University of Massachusettes - what a lovely group of young people eager to help and make your stay enjoyable.

We can not say enough. Yes, you can find less expensive, but the service can not be found elsewhere. From the moment you arrive until you leave, it is as though you are their only patron. You actually become friends with the owners and staff. Their friendly nature, caring ways and helfpulness are truly unmatched by any other hotel we have ever stayed at. Then, couple the service with the location, the drinks, the food - what can I say other than \"paradise\". If you are looking for a place that is commercialized and always something going on where you may have missed an activity, this is not the place. If you have a busy lifestyle, expect and deserve unsurpassed service, enjoy the peacefulness and serenity of gorgeous sunsets and have a passion for trying new foods, which by the way is the BEST food I have ever tasted, then without hesitation, contact the Pompano.

The accomodations in their newer ocean front buildings, Angel Fish and Flying Fish, were excellent, (we stayed in suite 84), but our original room #18, although clean, needed some renovation. Due to rain leaking into our room, we were moved to suite 84. All of the staff and owners were extremely friendly and helpful. The food was excellent. Their Monday night BBQ buffet diner was out of this world. We higly recommend this resort and would definitely go back again. (Because their buildings are situated at a high elevation from the beach, you have to walk down about 70 steps to reach the beach. I would not recommend this property if you have any type of leg problems or are very very old.)
