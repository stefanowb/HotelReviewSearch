I read the reviews for this hotel after she had booked it and was even more apprehensive. However, we were in a club room on the 7th floor and had some views. Shame we couldn't open the window more than an inch, it would have been nice to be able to lean out of the window and take in the views properly. The staff were good I thought for Parisian standards - usually stuck-up and extremely uninterested in helping non-french speaking people. It was however, the location of this hotel that made our 4 days in Paris so much easier. Personally I would have preferred to stay in Marais or similar, surrounded by cute shops and in the buzz of it, but if you're going to do the standard sights, then this is ideal.
