The Inn At Deep Creek is a unique place. The area has so many activities& restaurants in a short distance of the inn. Sheri and staff were so helpful and kind in giving us informatiom about anything we ask and I always have lots of questions about everything. The housekeeping staff do a wonderful job,our suite was spotless and updated with a full kitchen & small patio overlooking the lake. The landscaping was beautiful with lovely flowers,hanging baskets and beauitiful planters. The Inn has two very nice common areas with fireplaces,flat screen tv anc comfortable leather couches and chairs to enjoy. Each morning around 7 am coffee&tea are provided alond with packaged breakfast foods &yogurt on some days.Out by the pool area is a very nice grilling/patio area with gas and charcol grills,also a fire pit and very nice tabels and chairs which maker the grilling enjoyable. The Inn also has grilling utilties. Thanks again to Sheri & staff for all your hospitality& kindness. We have been able to travel a lot and have never been to an area with so many activites& and excellent places to eat and drink. Our favorite was Dutch's at Silver Tree,which was one of the best meals we have ever enjoyed in a beautiful setting on the lake.Mountain State Brewing Company had excellent wood fired pizza and salads in a hillside setting. Be sure to dine outside, very affordable.The Long Branch Saloon which is about 8 miles away is a neat drive through the country.Their specialty is beef and on friday& saturday the serve prime rib which was excellent.Another place we loved was J G'S pub great bar food and only i mile from Inn. We loved happy hour at the Santa Fe Grill for margarita's and their beef and chicken nachos are delicious and very inexpensive at happy hour. The Santa Fe is a neat place,again eat outside.Right next door to the Inn is the Honi Honi bar which is on the water.whate a fun place. Live bands on thur,fri,sat,and sundays go and have a blast.Did not like food at Uno's which adjoins the honi food was way over priced for the quality. Other places we liked were Black Bear , Boadwalk wright on the water.For other places talk to Sheri. Deep Creek lake is a beautiful lake you must rent a boat for a day. Some of the holmes on the lake are breathtaking,which you can only see by boat. There are three stste parks with in 5 miles. Our favorite was Swollow Falls with Muddy Creek and upper and lower Swollow Falls.This is a must see. There is also 3 differant places to go horseback riding.Another fun place is Wisp Mountain Ski Area which has the following things to do ,mountain coaster,zip lining,mountain biking,segways,ATV,rock climbing. all of this for all ages. Great place for family fun.Saved the favorite for last .My wife and I are 62 years old andthis was an alsome experience. The white water rafting at Adventure Sports the largest man made mountain top white rafting in the world You experience class 3-4 rapids in a controled enviorment must safer than on a river, what fun it was.I enjoyed it more than river rafting.Even if you decide this is not your cup of tea you must go watch .You can view the course and watchand the view on top of the mountain is spectacular.There is also several white water rafting companys to take you dowm the Youghiogheny river.I hope you understand why we had such a fantastic time.", "title": "Another Good Mini Vacation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jennifer L", "date": "September 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139433466}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012", "text": "We were pleased with our stay 2nd time around.

There is a pleasant lounge area that runs the length of the first floor and within it are board games, books, a fireplace, comfy sofas and chairs, a computer desk and a snack table that is stocked with coffee and danishes in the morning.

We drove up from three hours away that morning, spent a few hours at Wisp and arrived around 2:30pm. This appeared to be the time they started to make our room ready and the desk clerk said it would be an hour. We went to a nearby Pizzario Uno's and returned around 3:40 and still waited another 15-20 minutes. It was Saturday, but The Inn was hardly packed with people and considering most of their guests are driving in from another destination, the delay was a mild annoyance. Our room was on the first floor which meant we could walk right out into the lounge area; in a sense, access to the lounge expands your room size, but, of course, the space is shared with any other guests around. The room itself was as described on the web site. A king bed with a sleeper sofa, kitchenette with microwave, full size stove and refrigerator and a nice size table for eating which is good when traveling with kids. The room was a good size overall ( we usually try to stay in suites when traveling with the kids), but the our bathroom was too small and in need of some serious upgrading. I was surprised to read in their brochure that there had been a remodel in 2010; not in the bathroom apparently. The floors are also a bit thin, so be mindful of walking/stomping above you if on the ground floor. The Inn is also pet friendly, so random barking was part of our experience when its owners left the dog behind for the evening. Our kids loved the sleeper sofa's foam mattress, so that was a plus. The the furniture was in good shape and the room had plenty of lamps, but there was a dimness to our space; the room was not bright in the evenings. Finally, the heat/ac unit was right next to the bed and blew warm air directly onto/across the head of the bed.
