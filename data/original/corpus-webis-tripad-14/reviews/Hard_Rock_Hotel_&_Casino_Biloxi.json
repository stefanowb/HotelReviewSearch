We always thought the Beau was the place, but absolutely love the Hard Rock. Regular rooms are great with good feng shui and great showers etc. One we were able to score and upgrade for free (our room was comped anyway), and it was the most glorious suite we stayed in. Corner of floor with attached glassed in area with jacuzzi and makeup counter right on the gulf. Connected to a huge rainforest show ( about 8x8) and into another bath area with separate toilet area. Also there was a half bath off the living room as you entered. The bed was even more heavenly than the normal beds there! All floor to ceiling glass on entire suite. Will never forget it! Also want to mention that I asked for upgrade when checking in (platinum member) and was very abruptly told by someone on phone that it was not possible. OK....finally accepted normal room and headed to players club to get new card. Forgot mine. When they asked if I was enjoying our stay, I said yes, but muttered something about rude guy on phone. Went back to old room two hours later and phone did not work. Went to frt desk, and they said our room had been changed. Got hubby to help move a few things and head to different room . Opened the door to paradise. WILL NEVER FORGET IT! You can always politely ask.
