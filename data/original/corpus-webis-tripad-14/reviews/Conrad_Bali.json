A real beast of a hotel. The type you see on Getaway that don't actually exist in the real world. But they do - and Conrad Bali is one of them. Firstly it's huge and it has everything - no matter what your game, Conrad delivers. It has seclusion if you want it, social scene, if you want it, huge pools, great restaurants, amazing staff, all the water sport action you would ever need. The business side of things is terrific - conference centre great catering - the place is a real treat and no doubt i'll be back over the next 18 months. There is simply so many staff members you receive constant attention and nothing is too much fuss. I stayed in a suite offering free dry cleaning, discount food, a kiddie free zone, not to mention the suit itself was enormous. If you're doing Bali's elite mass resorts it's Conrad, Ayana or the Grand Hyatt. Being in Nusa Dua also gives you plenty of distance from Kuta - which is absolutely a good thing.

The bellhops and receptionists were very friendly and picked up the tone that we are not middle aged stuffy travelers. The check-in was done without a glitch, while we received a much needed cold facetowel to wipe off the humidity. We were brought to the room which was located on the third wing, which took ages to get to because of the size of the property and were ushered in to a very comfortable and spacious room. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked with amenities. Bottled water was freely available and re-stocked with a phone call to Room Service. Everyone should know that drinking water from the tap is not a good idea so it is a welcome surprise that the Conrad provided the bottled waters free of charge.
