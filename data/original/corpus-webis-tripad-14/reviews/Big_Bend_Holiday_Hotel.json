The Iveys have done a great job in adding lodging space here and the Candililla House is a great example. The two bedroom casita has plenty of room for two couples or a family. The detached washroom and shower (two seperate locations) were fully equipped and met all of our needs.

The house has nice outdoor areas that allow guests to socialize, watch the sun go down, etc. The bathroom and shower areas are very cool and artsy, but they are detatched from the actual house. For our visit, that wasn't a problem. There is very little, if any, traffic near the house. Plus, the owners provide nice bathrobes to walk back and forth between the house and shower. It's just a few feet away, but it's a nice touch.

It's perfect for raucous revelry or a romantic rendezvous, or both...You'll find many things in the Ghost Town in the exact condition they've been in for centuries, and that's great for exploring, but at the end of the day you'll want air conditioning.Named for the reddish mercury ore that fueled the industry that was the Chisos Mine, this room belies the Ghost Town location and offers a rustic yet elegant experience.The fancy indoor bathroom that we're so proud of is -- ahem... -- a short walk down the scenic porch, marked Room # 1B. It's a Terlingua tradition that has caught on big in Europe. erlingua chic, the Candililla House is great for either couples or families. Perched on a hillside, it offers an everchanging view of sunsets, starlight, and thunderstorms. There is a patio outside the walls and another within.The El Patron Suite is suitable for business meetings, but they're frowned on around the Ghost Town. Instead, have a few amigos/amigas join you for a festive evening. Walk over to the famous Terlingua Cemetery to greet the ghosts, or just watch the sunset with everyone on the porch over at the Trading Post. Bring your guitar (but not the accordion.)The Candelilla House gets its name from the local cactus that was gathered by the locals and used in the manufacture of women's makeup products. The owners' family operated both a trading post and a processing facillity that kept this Mexican tradition alive.Just down the road a piece from the end of the earth is the Rio Grande Rock House. This is not some neo-cowboy fantasy replica. It's real by-God Texas history. Built in the early 19th century as a trading post for trappers and settlers from both sides of the border, it's still in the same family.We're proud to be out on the fringe of Texas.
