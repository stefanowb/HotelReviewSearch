After finally locating the hotel and finding a temporary place to park while we unloaded our luggage, we were shocked to find no one there to check us in or even store our luggage. No message or note was on the door to explain the situation. Thinking that the hotel might not even be open for business, we reloaded our luggage and parked in the Catania parking garage and began walking the streets in search of a place to stay. Two hours later, we returned to find someone at the hotel, requiring us to walk back to the parking garage and carry our bags all the way back to the hotel. Astonishingly, we received no apology or even an explanation for the situation; we were merely shown our room, given the keys and asked to immediately pay cash in advance for the room.", "title": "Valuable time wasted", "user": "Jackneve", "date": "April 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 28418061}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel could be a reasonable value for someone who places little or no value on their own time.", "title": "Great place, great fun!", "user": "ChanelBologna", "date": "April 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28251668}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent three nights in this lovable B&B.
