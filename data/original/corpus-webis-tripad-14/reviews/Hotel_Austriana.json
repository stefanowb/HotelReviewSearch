The location is extremely convenient - 2 blocks from a bus stop on Ku'damm that can bring you anywhere quickly, or to a convenient u-bahn station. We paid only 50 euros/night for a spacious room with 2 twin beds, a tv, a shower, and a sink. The beds were extremely uncomfortable but the location quiet and the room was a comfortable temperature when it was freezing outside. We had to cross the hall for our bathroom but we didn't share it with other guests. For the price, this is an excellent alternative to a hostel with a good location.", "title": "Excellent location & price", "user": "pepoling", "date": "December 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 22416469, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and price", "disliked": "\u2014 Bed uncomfortable"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "For me this was a fairly nice budget hotel. Slightly bizarre upper level reception with a friendly worker was following by a very large room overlooking the inner courtyard. Very high ceilings and room cleanliness was passable. Breakfast was fairly nice but during peak periods would get a little crowded. Location in Berlin was ok but not really central. But being about a ~12 minute walk two different subway lines. We bought a 3 day Welcome card which made traveling around flexible.
