The rooms are too small, the AC is so loud you want to cover your ears the whole time you are in the room, and the walls are so thin that even if you turn yours off you'll hear your neighbor's AC (not to mention their bathroom visits). And don't get me started on the pool: tucked away in what feels like an alley behind the hotel (between the hotel's dumpster and the washing facility), with a grand total of five sunbathing chairs -- try fighting for one on a Saturday afternoon - and a bunch of shared couches.
