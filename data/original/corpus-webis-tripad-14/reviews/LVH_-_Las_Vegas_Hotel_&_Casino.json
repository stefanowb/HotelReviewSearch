I stay in Hiltons regularly and was surprised at how dumpy this place was compared to other Hiltons. The lobby was dated and my room was even worse. It appeared that my room had not been updated since the 70s. Wallpaper was torn, carpets stained, toilet and tub were chipped, and the very small bathroom was covered in pink tile. Some of my colleagues were in nicer rooms, so I think I just got a bad draw. At least the room was quiet and had a nice bed. I was also disappointed in the restaurants.
