The entertainment is very bad,they don;t have actual shows it;s just the same people you see working at the resort on stage playing interactive games with the audience such as simon says,name that tune and games like that which would be fine for something extra like a game time but that is not a show.As for the beach it was nice and the small beach was also nice.Now as for the food I have been told by others that the food in D.R is never anything to write home about ,well I can agree to that ,our buffetts were alright the odd time but it should be a larger selection of food.The beef is terrible because they only have two kinds of cows and they graze on mountainsides and are much more active than our cattle in canada which makes the meat tough as can be.The snack bar I found was the best food but you could only get four or five different things,I had burger and fries mostly,very good.All the A la carte restaurants we did;nt like at all.As for alchohol we got by but they only have one brand of everything unless you pay for golden deluxe package and even then the international brands are small selection.And they say fully stocked mini bar but you only get 2 beers a day in fridge and always look at the top of beer cans as all the cans of beer were do to expire in 2-4 weeks .My wife had one just covered in mould on the top ,when bringing it to maids attention she just took the beer,put it under tap and wiped it off with a towel then gave it back .The same thing happenned to two other people,one of which did'nt notice until they were half way done the beer and then felt sick the rest of the day just from thinking about it.One thing for sure I would never advise bringing kids to this resort they would be bored stiff.As for the staff working at our resort I know I maybe should'nt compare but they were nothing like in Jamaica where most of the staff would all have big smiles greeting you everywhere you went ,where in D.R very few would even say Ola[hello] when walkiing by and most were never looking to happy with the exception of Armando from the disco bar who was just great and Fransisco & louis who were also very nice.This resort should spend some time training staff to accomadate their guests as the staff can turn a good holiday into a great one if your treated nice & freindly.Heres something else to remember if you go in january ,chances are slim to see whales until mid February.We were told that we could get two excursions for a specail price-Whale watching & a trip over to bacardi island both suppossed to be half day trips well I can't complain about whale watching even though we never seen any whales after all there were no garauntees given ,but we did see a dolphin for 2 seconds.As for the half day at the island what a joke ,spent $40.00 each above the price of whalewatching trip for 1 and a half hours on island,we also understood that our drinks were free and 6 of us would have our own english speaking guide.We only could get one water or pop no alchohol and we had no guide.The island is amazing but you can get there for $12.00 each from resort.Where we spent $80.00 for practically the same thing and all we got back was a package of coffee and small bottle of rum that may have cost them about $10.00.I know most of my review does'nt sound good but what a gorgeous country and the highlight of our trip was on sunday when two other couples and ourselves went 4 wheeling through the countryside and stopped in all the small villages ,gave candy to the kids and took some great pictures.We made our way to El Limon where we parked are bikes and took horses from there and headed for El L:imon waterfalls,WOW what a awesome ride.After riding most of the way you have to walk for quite a distance on a very rough and muddy trail cross a stream and soon we were there.This place is so beautiful,you can swim here and behind the falls you'll find a cave[awesome].I would definitely say if your in this area go to El Limon waterfalls.Most tours won't go here because of the safety standards but if your in half descent shape and like an adventure this is for you.", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "kingdawg9", "date": "January 24, 2008", "id": 12962331}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I will try to just give facts rather than opinions.", "title": "Better places for the money", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "duckman_doug", "date": "January 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12689729, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The room", "disliked": "\u2014 The beach"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Places I've been to compare to: Paradise Island -
