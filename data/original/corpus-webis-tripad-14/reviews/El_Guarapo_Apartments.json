I will get the moan out of the road first, we were booked into a superior room when on arrival you had a bottle of wine /water / flat screen tv and beach towels not in room 22 as I don't think it was a superior room and it had not been renovated Right that is the moan over. The room itself was clean but very dated it did need renovate ing the sheets were clean as was the whole apartment and everything you needed. The towels once again dated. The staff who looked after the apartments and the gardens where very good no issues at all. The on site restaurant was good I enjoyed the breakfast very much. The pool area was small but kept clean at all times bring something to lie on the beds round the pool are very hard and uncomfortable. The pool is cold. The wifi code you get is only one person code if you have 2 laptops or iPads with you only one at a time on the Internet. Unless you pay for another code. They try to get you one way or the other. To get to the main drag go out of the hotel and turn left about 40 yards on your left you will see a pathway take this path and walk to the end of it then turn right and you are on the main drag about 6 or 7 mins walk or you could go down to the seafront and walk that will take you about 20 mins but a nice walk. Loads of places to eat and drink. Try going to the Sunday market it is very good and very big. You can book a bus about 4 euros each or a taxi is about 20 euros each way.
