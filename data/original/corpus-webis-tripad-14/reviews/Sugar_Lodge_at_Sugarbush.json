Given this, we were pleased with our stay at the Sugar Lodge.

After an exhausted search of all the area accomodations we thought this would be the best bet for the money and we were dead on. We actually spent a night in a regular room before spending the rest of our stay in the queen suite. The room itself is comfortable, but nothing special and not very big, and as other people on here have said, it could use a new tv. But everything worked and the beds were fine. The queen suite was pretty good all around. Everything was relatively clean and in great working condition. It was a good amount of room for a couple, but I would hesitate to say much more than that. The bedroom is barely big enough for a bed and there's no tv, but for a place to stay after a day on the slopes, it's just fine. We also got to peak at the king suite, and that was amazing. It's a much larger, more updated version of the queen suite, so the bed room is large and has a tv. The living/dining area is also conderably larger. Continental breakfast was fine, nothing fancy. Common area is quite nice, especially with the fire going at night. The wine/beer bar wasn't exactly hopping while we were there, but the lodge wasn't all that full, I don't think. There's also a community fridge for the people staying in the rooms, which was clean and plenty safe to leave some food or drinks in, also a community microwave. The staff was very friendly and quite helpful. Location is perfect. It's less than a minute to Sugarbush's parking lot (which came in handy since I forgot my goggles one day). And it's 3 or 4 minutes to the Mt. Ellen base. We are absolutely planning on staying here again.
