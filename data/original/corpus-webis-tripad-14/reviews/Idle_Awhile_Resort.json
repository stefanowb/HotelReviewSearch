This hotel is not for everyone. If you are high maintenance and don't like the sun then don't go to Idle Awhile. I travel often for business and stay in many 5 star hotels. Idle Awhile is different. It's unique. It's a GREAT find if you are casual, laid back and need a great place to relax, sit on the beach, float on a raft in the ocean or want to venture. You do not need to pack much. A bathing suit, flip flops, sunscreen and something casual to wear at night. Bring bug spray (\"off\" worked fine). Beautiful plush gardens on the property. I highly recommend: \"Mis Sonia's\" for patties - look for Mis Sonia out back making each Patty from scratch (even the dough!) and cooking each on wood burning, Norma's (crab back app. is great), Rockhouse for drinks/dinner (best food), pina colada's at Idle While made by the King - the best!!, sunsets on the beach, live reggae by Dolly Man and grilled lobster 2 doors down on the beach (Wed and Sun).

We took our welcome drinks up to the room and loved what we saw. Ours was a deluxe garden view room. The room is the perfect blend of modern caribbean decor.

The shower is open to the rest of the room which gives you so much space to bathe, I love that concept. They provide liquid body soap and shampoo... not sure about conditioner (I had my own).

Every morning Lawrence had our beach chairs sat out for us before we were even out of bed(now that is going out of your way)! We also LOVED the outside porch. We took a nap every day on the outside couch, it was SO relaxing (and romantic). The beach was really nice too. It had a great location & even though it was small it never felt crowded. We scoped out all of the other hotels nearby on 7-mile and we felt Idle Awhile was the best by far (excluding Moondance of course). The few meals we ate there were great (we only had breakfast & lunch).", "title": "Loved Idle Awhile!", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "colleenmarie", "date": "February 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4408014}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "Regarding the recent review about theft--I felt extremely safe there and never had any problems with any of our stuff.", "title": "Best place on the beach!", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "brcorley", "date": "January 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4351475}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "The only negative was the water.

It is absolutely wonderful. The rooms are beautiful and very comfortable. The louvered windows are awesome, and I enjoyed the sounds of the tree frogs at night. The rooms and the foliage on the grounds are even more beautiful than they look on the website. I refer people to this resort all the time and will continue to do so. If I ever pay another visit to Negril, I would not even look around to stay anywhere else. By your second day, you feel like your at home. The beach is gorgeous, don't let anyone tell you differently! My first trip was just me and my best friend and we were completely taken care of and looked after. Carlton the bartender is super awesome. The environment is very laid back, so as soon as you begin to get hungry you need to order your food, b/c it does take about 30 minutes. * The red snapper is great all over Negril, but be sure that it's not the whole fish which has it's eyes and can be disturbing to look at, much less eat. Eat lunch at the Rockhouse and have one dinner at the Hungry Lion. Both of these are at the cliffs.

It is well known. This was my first visit to Negril. I loved Idle Awhile. My boyfriend and I spent a lot of time walking the beach and agree that IA has the best beach, nicest rooms, good security, good beach chairs, nice bar, great staff, and is more upscale than most other places (Without being too expensive). The breakfst is really nice here and the lunches are good-try the fish and chips. There are many other restaurants on the beach: our favorites were Norma's at Seasplash, Kuyaba (pricey), and BEst of the west jerk chicken stand across the street.", "user": "happytravels28", "date": "May 20, 2006", "id": 5183560}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Idle Awhile the Best of Negril - 5 Stars!", "text": "No worries at this place.

We don't care for the large all-inclusives, yet still wanted something with a touch of class, full-service amenities and personal service. The prices for the rooms here are very reasonable and our deluxe ocean view room was just as described and pictured. It was cleaned every day with fresh towels and linens and was very comfortable, stylish and had a great view. Definitely felt like 5-star luxury in our opinion. The restaurant on the beach has a great breakfast menu. We recommend the traditional Jamaican style breakfast for $10.00 which offers a great variety of traditional items. The drinks were great, particularly the pina coladas! They make it far too convenient with running a room tab so you can pay up when you depart. Nice not to worry about cash, funds, tipping, etc. while on the beach. We never had dinner at the restaurant, though ordered their club sandwiches a couple times for lunch. They were good and reasonable for $7.00. The shuttle to/from the Montego Bay airport was very smooth and reliable. Driver both directions was prompt, professional and trustworthy. The staff was very accomodating and the quaint resort had plenty of safety measures and nighttime security just for extra comfort. The rooms each have a safe which is very handy for excess cash, passports, and valuables. We would absolutely recommend this place to our friends and anyone looking for accomodations on the upper mid-level scale. You can't go wrong at Idle Awhile. We met other guests during our stay that were repeat visitors to the resort. They have a wonderful beach, plenty of recliners, provide fresh beach towels and tons of restaurants and bars to choose from in walking distance along the beach. Definitely recommend Kuyaba just about a 10 minute walk down the beach -- and also Cosmos about a 15 minute walk, had great jerk chicken and a great menu much cheaper than other places. No need for taxis or to walk on the busy main road. The location is truly on the main Negril stretch. Photos of the resort are attached. We have stayed at other 5-star resorts (St. Lucia, Barbados and other countries) and feel that this was one of our best finds yet and the total price was more than reasonable.", "user": "awayfromitall", "date": "April 30, 2006", "id": 5022577}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What a way to love life!!!!", "text": "My husband and I stayed at Idle a While while in Negril Jamacia. This is where we would go back too. The staff was more than accomidating. As a matter of fact their wonderful bartender (who we have a picture for and will be sending )used his day off to show us some of the out of the way beautiful sights on their awesome islland. Our room at Idle a while was very clean, the room had a lot of character and a Jamacian feel, the food was wonderful. We got up in the morning and opened the curtains and there was the beautiful ocean. Went to breakfast in our bare feet, to drink a wonderfully fresh fruit drink made fresh each day and eat delicious banana pancakes and fruit in season. Our lawn chairs and umbrellas were set out for us each day by security. Any time a beach sales person would come up to us and ask if we wanted to make a purchase the wonderful security at Idle a While would come and ask us if all was ok. They even helped us cross the street (watch for cars) when my husband would go across the street to get his soda drink. We had to move the last night as we did not make our reservations early enough. We left for the day and came back and all was done for us. The front desk staff were more than accomidating any time we had a question or a concern. I cannot think of a place I have stayed in my travels, which have been many, that was more accomidating than Idel A While. Fresh, beautiful ocean and vegetatian, I cant wait to go back, a piece of my soul stayed.
