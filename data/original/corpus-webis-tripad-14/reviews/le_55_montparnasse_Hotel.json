You get what you pay for in terms of the size of the rooms but that did not effect our enjoyment. Pernety is a great place and ideal if you ant to feel like you are truly in Paris as opposed to a tourist - great little bars and eateries.

The room we had was adequately sized (we stayed in the basic room), fully decorated in a contemporary manner and extremely comfy. Yes there were no wardrobes, and you had to live out of your suitcase, but for 3 nights we didnt really care - we were too happy enjoying the sights of Paris! The beds were typically firm but none-the-less comfortable. We would recommend booking a superior room though if you\u2019re willing to splash out a bit more. The hotel location is ideal - based in a real Parisian town rather than a tourist hub where English is the most common language. However, saying this, most people in the local shops/cafes/restaurants etc did know basic English and were more than happy to help. The nearest metro station (Pernety, not Montparnasse) is a stones throw from the hotel entrance. The metro is the easiest and cheapest way to travel, taking roughly 25 -30 mins from Gare du Nord to Pernety. It can be quite hard trekking around with all your luggage, as there were few stations in Paris with lifts/escalators, so you have been warned! Also, none of the Parisians once stopped to help us carry our bags, not even my struggling girlfriend! The hotel does breakkie for 10 euros, which is a waste of money in my opinion - we went to try it out one morning but by 9am they had run out of eggs and sausages, and their pastries were no match for that of the boulangerie next door (well worth a visit!). Instead, we recommend the cafe \u2018Losserand\u2019 just up the road \u2013 It is modern, friendly and serves fantastic omelettes - the best I've ever had! As we were checking out, a few of the rooms were still in the process of being refurb'ed, but unless the hotel is fully booked, they will now book you into the already completed ones. I would highly recommend this hotel - the staff are helpful and speak quite good English, but do make sure they clarify something for you if you are unsure of what they are saying!
