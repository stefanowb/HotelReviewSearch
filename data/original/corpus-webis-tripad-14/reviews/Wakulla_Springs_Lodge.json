It is something that we have always wanted to do. It was incredible!!!!! The lodge is absolutely gorgeous. No TV, just the traveler and the old south. It was the wet and rainy version of FLorida, but very real. each evening after dinner we sat in the lobby with Joe the alligator who lost his life to poachers, we enjoyed the quiet surroundings and the moist environment. We had several spectacular meals in the dining room. We met Mom's highschool friends and caught up on life. We rediscovered our roots.

Great and funny tour guides, and you can see how they love their job (we even repeated our toures a couple of times). Loved diving from the platform into the cool, clean and crystal clear water, admired jumping fish right in frint of swimmers and a very visible big gator on the other side of the river. Good restaurant and rooms without any TV.

But, with today's safety worries, the highest tier has been removed. But still, the second tier is high enough for plenty of thrills, about 2-1/2 stories high, then 120 feet deep into the water. Don't worry about those gators lounging on the other bank, they haven't eaten a tourist yet. And if you want to see more gators, don't miss the river boat tour. (The glass bottom boat tour is optional, no big deal, but the river boat tour is a must.) Our guide said he's never taken out a tour without seeing several alligators. We saw at least a dozen, plus jumping fish and lots of birds. Many old movies were filmed here, including some Tarzan pictures. The hotel is very old so don't stay here is you need upscale ammenities, but the history is fascinating and the restaurant has great Southern fried chicken and many other good dishes, too. (You can visit the spring and stay elsewhere if you wish; this is a Florida State Park - $4 per carload.)
