I arrived early and there were no rooms available. The front desk agent told me to check back at noon but offered to store my luggage. I asked if he knew where an outlet was that I could plug in my cell phone to charge it so I could make a phone call. He told me he had no idea and that he only knew where the outlets were behind the counter. I then searched around and found one not too far from the desk. I then asked if he could give me directions to Fort Jackson. He gave me a generic map of Downtown and told me to follow Taylor street out till I reached Ft Jackson. Since Ft Jackson was not on the map, I asked about how long it took from the hotel. He replied \"not too long\". I was asking for a ball park here - maybe in minutes or miles. No such luck. I think he just did not know the answers but made no attempt to find out and didn't seem to care that he did not know.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Kathyfm1", "date": "July 22, 2008", "id": 18140749}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is in need of some upgrades.
