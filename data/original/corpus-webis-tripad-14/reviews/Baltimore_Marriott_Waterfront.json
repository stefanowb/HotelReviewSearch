This hotel is so convenient to EVERYTHING! Fells Point, Little Italy, the Aquarium, and Inner Harbor are all easy walks. We were given a room with a view of the harbor on the 23rd floor. The only thing I will say as a \"let down\" was that when we arrived we were asked (we are Elite Members and it was our anniversary) what we would like to have brought to us as a \"thank you\" and we were told that we could use the Concierge Lounge for a free breakfast the next morning and to enjoy snacks and beverages and the view without a charge. We had half a bottle of Chardonnay with cheese and crackers brought to us (this was not expected but nice surprise)...BUT they only gave us one wine glass. Odd. And one set of silverware/napkin. We picked the time for delivery, and it was about thirty minutes later than that time. AND when we went to take pictures on the 31st floor in the Concierge Lounge, there was a sign stating that the lounge was closed for the rest of the weekend. We asked an employee and she stated that since the lounge was closed, we would be given complimentary room service for breakfast. We went downstairs to lobby to make the receptionist aware that it was closed and to ask her for breakfast voucher and were told that breakfast would be $29/person...not complimentary. So that was a let down. The lack of communication, but she was very sweet and gave us wonderful recommendations for dinner that night, etc. Our room had a comfortable king size bed (I love Marriott mattresses), a great view, was extremely clean and the only \"plumbing issue\" I noticed is that the sink \"gurgles\" when the water drained down it. There are two elevators depending on what floor you are on, there is another elevator to the parking garage if you don't park valet, there is a bar now (called Kozmos), two restaurants and a lovely lounge with fireplace. The one restaurant is casual and has a Starbucks as well as bakery, snacks, drinks and incidentals. The fifth floor deck off the pool was not open due to construction (so no pictures there either), but it will make a great lounging area in warm weather. For the views, the cleaniness and friendliness of staff and the location, I would definitely stay here again.", "title": "Wonderful stay and a fantastic location!", "user": "alli565", "date": "November 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120596115}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We surprised our daughter for her 5th birthday and decided to stay at the Baltimore Marriott for a couple of days.

Then they upgraded our room for free, and when we went out to dinner that night they must have tried to sing happy b-day again because we got back there was a beautiful, obviously handmade cake with fondant icing and Happy Birthday written in chocolate around the plate. They even did it for her again the next morning at breakfast! Food was incredible--get the breakfast package--it's worth it. Food is a little pricey without it. The only possible things I could ding them for is no free wireless Internet access in the room--it's $12.95 per 24 hours, and the taxes are outrageous (23% per night) but I would think that is the case anywhere you stay in the city.", "title": "You definitely should stay here!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mermaidswan", "date": "November 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120481473}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I would recommend the Marriott Waterfront without hesitation.

We received expired tickets to the aquarium, so after walking over there and waiting in line we had to walk back to the hotel to request non-expired tickets and then wait in line a second time. Our package included parking, but when we went to validate our parking after arriving back at the hotel after dinner the front desk clerk refused to validate the parking. He actually argued with my husband about this. Then we discovered that our requested feather free room was not feather free (I am very allergic, but I guess this wasn't guaranteed, and we should have confirmed).

I asked for a room with a nice view, and we stayed in room 2443 - a corner room with an absolutely AWESOME view of the Inner Harbor. The room was very nice; very clean with contemporary decor. Room service came with breakfast within 15 minutes the next day. Checkout was quick and the bill was accurate.

Clearly they invested all their money in the lobby area, because my room was on a par with Hampton Inn, i.e., nothing wrong with it just not worth what Marriott is charging. I suggest you ask to see your room before commiting to staying here; WAY overpriced. If you're considering holding a conference or business here, they were not particularly helpful or cooperative, despite our organization spending $70,000 there. Location was good, food was good, staff other than the convention staff were friendly & helpful.
