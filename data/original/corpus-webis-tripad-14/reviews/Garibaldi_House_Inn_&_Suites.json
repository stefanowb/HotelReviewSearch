We got stuck in the same room next to the laundry that someone else mentioned here. We should have asked for a top floor room, but I never think of those things until it is too late.

The owners, Carol and Gene, have completely refurbished an old Comfort Inn into a classy destination you'll want to return to as soon as possible. It's a small, boxy 3-story motel on the outside, but once you walk through the front doors a new experience emerges. The front desk employees are welcoming and friendly, a cozy fire is burning, and wonderful afternoon snacks of summer sausage, local cheeses, Gene's world famous clam chowder, tasty crackers, cookies, popcorn and salt water taffy are beautifully presented for your enjoyment as you settle into comfortable leather couches. Daily local newspapers are scattered about to keep you up to date with the news. The paint is fresh and the windows are clean. It smells like home, if your home is immaculate. Your room is fresh with comfortable beds and cozy linens, the bathroom is sparkling with a good showerhead, clean tub, sanitized toilet, and spa-grade cosmetics and soaps are provided. Breakfast is served starting at 5:00 am, a great convenience for fishermen or travelers wanting an early start, and is a complete buffet featuring a couple of types of real scrambled eggs, link sausages, potatoes, waffles, pork sausage gravy and what appeared to be home baked biscuits, mini-muffins, pastries, breads, juice, assorted cereals and, of course, delicious coffee that always seems freshly brewed. Carol and Gene are always around, cheerful and attentive, and wanting to make the hotel as pleasant as possible. Carol even tries to bribe you with wonderful chocolates, something quite unnecessary but extremely welcome. The rates are a bargain too!
