I found the staff - Orfeo and Laudina - extremely helpful and friendly. They greeted us warmly on our arrival and showed us to our fantastic apartment - Scaglie di Mare. The apartment was perfect for 2 persons - probably a push for any more unless you are very close and intimate with your friends! The view is amazing and the apartment well equipped. We cooked two nights and ate in a restaurant on another night. The whole trip was very relaxing and the Cinque Terre is stunning. Of all the towns I think Manarola is the best - small enough to be quiet and peaceful but with all the shops and restaurants you might require. Sure there are lots of steps to the apartment - but let's face it - you don't go to this part of the world for the flat terrain!!!", "title": "fantastico!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LadyMorgana", "date": "October 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10028815, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The view from the apartment is amazing", "disliked": "\u2014 Having to pay cash is a bit tiresome - get the credit cards working."}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Horrible experience and I'm not alone!", "text": "The only thing I have to say is that payment in cash is a bit of a bore - but in way did we feel threatened or scared by Orfeo.

He demanded cash for both nights (I didn't know they wanted that much and had 3/4 of the euros he wanted- had maxed out on my daily withdrawal from a cash machine.) Gave him all my cash and he insisted on coming back the next day at 10AM. The next morning, I saw him at about 8:30AM on the path and he practically accosted me demanding money!

The location was ideal - up on a hill with a lot of local people around. It was within a reasonable distance from the train station, from the Via dell'Amore - the scenic trail that connects to Riomaggiore, and close to three excellent restaurants in town. It was idyllic. Most importantly, the welcome that we received from Barbara - the owner, and the information that she provided were both great.

It was fabulous, Orfeo (dad), Grazia (mum) and Barbara were extremely friendly and helpful. The view from our large balcony was to die for. We took in some wonderful sunsets whilst sipping local wine. Manarola was gorgeous, not as big as Vernazza, Monterosso or Riomaggiore but that was it's charm. We spent 5 nights there and had a great meal at a different restaurant every night and we still did not manage to visit every restaurant! We would have breakfast by the harbour at the cafe every morning before heading out for the day. If you are going to buy souvenirs or Limoncello make your purchases in Manarola as they are actually a little cheaper than the other villages. We did all the walks/hikes except for Vernazza to Monterosso which is apparently the most challenging. The Vernazza to Corniglia is best done Corniglia to Vernazza as it is more down hill than the other direction. A word of warning! If you are arriving by train Pack Light! It is uphill to Alla Porta Rossa and if you stay in the apartment we did then it is uphill again including steps!
