My boyfriend and I are both well travelled backpackers who've stayed in a lot worse. The reception and downstairs area is fine. Rooms are a bit grubby but our room was massive and had a great view. Bathroom was spotless though! What really lets the hotel down is the shabby corridors, Pool area and poor breakfast. Our first morning we arrived for much needed food to find about 10 pieces of fruit on the buffet people were fighting over! Eventually managed to wangle some toast from one of the waiters. Our rep couldn't apologise enough at our welcome meeting that morning and said reasons for it being so poor was they hotel had miscalculated the number of people needing fed (or something similar!) the next 3 days of our stay, the food was fine, not great but certainly edible.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 5, 2006", "id": 5036884}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "Best thing about the hotel is the wee cat that lives around the pool area - double of our cat at home (if skinnier!) very cute, make sure you feed it!", "title": "AQ loves the Deauville!", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "AQ", "date": "April 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4951131}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Avoid this hotel", "text": "Overall as long as you know what to expect you should be fine.
