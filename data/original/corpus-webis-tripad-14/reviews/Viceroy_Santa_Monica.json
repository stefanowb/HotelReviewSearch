The lobby, bar, and pool area basically become a club on weekend nights, which was fine with us but might not appeal to some travelers. You definitely notice the hotel's age in certain areas, but overall I thought it was kept up pretty well. The decor is great for a hotel stay, but I can't say that I'd want my house to look like this (sorry Kelly).

Everything looked great on the website and the reviews had been mostly positive. As we checked in though, first impressions weren't good. The guy behind the desk couldn't find any reservation details even though I had my confirmation with me. No apology or explanation but a room was eventually found and we were just glad that was that. When we put they key card in the door, though, a woman started shouting at us from inside the room....I turned the light on becuase I didn't know what was going on and turned it back off as quickly as possible when i realised we'd just woken two people who were asleep in the room....a quick 'sorry' as we closed the door was all I could say. At this point I was starting to wonder if this place was up to much since being sent into someone else's room (at night) is surely a big mistake for any hotel to make. We were met in reception by the guy who had checked us in...he rather abruptly took the wrong room key off us and gave us another one, simply saying 'that was the wrong room'. Again, no apology. Over the next few days, my overall impression of the hotel was: very nice rooms, clean hotel, nice location....but a serious 'attitude problem'......the focus seems to be on trendiness and little else. It took about 2 days for a note of apology to appear about the check-in incident and elsewhere things weren't much better. We ate in the restaurant one night and although the food was fine, our bill arrived without us asking for it and when our change came it was clear the bill had been 'rounded up' to the nearest dollar...neither of which struck me as good service. As if to sum up everything that's wrong with the Viceroy, when checking out we weren't asked anything about our stay. I don't mind paying a little extra to stay in a nice hotel, and this is certainly that, but when you're paying what this place charges, you expect good, friendly service. And that was certainly not to be found. When I got home a few weeks later I completed the hotel's detailed feedback form/survey (which I received by email) and gave them my contact details (a standard option).

My daughter was meeting me there so I booked a room with two double beds. Shortly after booking my room, I received an e-mail from their concierge Sean offering to help me with any requests we might have. I requested an early check in as well as a room on a higher floor away from the pool due to the comments I had read about the noise level in the evenings due to the nightlife. I arrived in LA early on Saturday morning and called the hotel around 10:00AM. They said the room was ready and we could come and check in at any time. When we checked in, Sean remembered our correspondence and was quite friendly and helpful. After our complimentary glass of champagne at check in, we headed up to our room. The room was wonderful. I enjoy these boutique type of hotels and thought the decor was great! We headed down to the pool. The pool area is nice and sheltered from the wind off the ocean and we had a great afternoon out at the pool with drinks and appetizers. The service was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Viceroy. If you are sensitive to noise, bring some earplugs as you can hear the music from the pool area into the wee hours of the morning. I didn't have a problem sleeping but it kept my daughter up until it stopped around 2AM. We also had a cocktail in the lounge/bar on Saturday evening and really enjoyed the \"vibe\" at the Viceroy.
