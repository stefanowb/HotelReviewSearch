I was very satisfied with the hotel, and wished I could have spent some more time in the comfortable bed, instead of attending meetings all day (and night) long. To start with, the entrance is well protected against violence. i.e. there is security screening and cars cannot drive directly to the entrance. The staff is very friendly, and even though there are only two persons working at the reception, they undertake endeavours to serve the guests. If you are in a hurry, prepare some time for that. The food is quite good, the snacks in the bar as well. Smoking areas are available. The rooms are well equipped, including ironing board and coffee maker. breakfast served in room is very punctual. Clean. Bathroom amenities good. I had a room with almost no view, a bit dark, and couldn't open the window. Now here are some downsides: Newspaper only delivered one morning, other morning no newspaper. Slippers provided second evening, first evening no slippers. But to conclude - overall a very good hotel.", "title": "Fully satisfied with the hotel - relaxing", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "April 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15108926, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 comfortable bed and nice room", "disliked": "\u2014 business center not attended continuously"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Good Mariott hotel but not well located.
