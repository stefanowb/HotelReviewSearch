For instance, rather than having the feeling of entering a lovely hotel, it feels rather like entering several different restaurants all with completely different designs as well as an open kitchen with waitstaff walking in and out. There is also an immediate smell of food once entering the hotel along with an open kitchen where the cooking is visible along with a sort of chaotic movement of staff bustling about to serve the restaurants. The design of each space is completely disparate so there is absolutely no cohesion. This includes the design of the small reception area which has no relationship at all to the design of the other areas, which also do not relate to eachother. In addition, there is quite a bit of mirror behind the reception desk...the mirror was not very clean, detracting from any impact the design may have had. It is necessary to walk directly through one of the restaurants to go outside in order to reach the swimming pool area. This isn't as negative during the day as the restaurant isn't quite so full. However, in the evening it isn't ideal as streams of people are walking back and forth while people are dining, along with the staff heading in and out of the kitchen.....the streams of people bang into chairs and it simply isn't peaceful but rather chaotic with activity. Once passing through the restaurant and arriving outside, there is immediately another outdoor restaurant and bar area with yet another completely different design aesthetic.....and to the left yet another restaurant, although inside, with again a completely different design. After passing through all of the differently designed restaurants, the swimming pool is beyond. Almost all of the seating around the swimming pool faces north so not facing in the direction of the sun most of the day. In addition, the seating faces directly into a building with open cabanas....it feels heavy and not lovely to look at. Further, the street to the south of the swimming pool is visible so it not only doesn't feel very private, there is also quite a bit of street noise. Finally, the typical rooms within the hotel are inexcusably small. There might have been an issue with landmark codes which may have made increasing the size of the rooms difficult when renovating the hotel, however a stronger effort should have be made because the rooms are extremely small....even uncomfortable for one person...this includes the bathroom as well. On a positive note, the staff is attentive and welcoming.", "title": "Couldn't have had a better experience!", "user": "Mickeyj1000", "date": "September 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 140643330}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you want to enjoy the $ 22 valet parking, make sure to reserve 30 min. waiting time when you want to leave...

Then after I had checked out and was giving back the cash that I had to put back down after my card was already charged I was called back to the hotel and told my card would not go thru so I would have to give the cash back that was giving to me to pay for the room and wait for the authorization hold to drop off my card.
