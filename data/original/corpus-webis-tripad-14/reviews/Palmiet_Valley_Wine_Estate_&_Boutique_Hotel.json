Our wedding day once again was awesome, I will never ever forget my day, it was all that I wanted and more, I wanted my guests to have fun and that's exactly what they got.

The ambiance of the 300+ year old buildings, a blend of reed grass roofs and old wooden structures in the rooms upstairs, but up to date with modern standards inside and the individual decorations of the rooms with antiques, the well maintained natural gardens surrounding the buildings are worthwhile a stay. Owner Fred and his team are extremely friendly, they took care of me, and thus made me feel home (probably even better). The excellent cuisine and service, the flower decorations on the tables and breakfast under the trees - just as perfect as I liked it. Wine and Guave plantations as part of the estate and the Drakenstein mountains in the background round up the location - a tranquil setting. As as for sports: I could play golf in the immediate neighborhood - just 10 minutes away. All in all a dream vacation - better than expected and absolutely recommendable.
