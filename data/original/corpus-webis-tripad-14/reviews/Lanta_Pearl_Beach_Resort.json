Of course there are many resorts on the island - but if you have ever spent some time in Lanta Pearl Beach you will come back for sure. Lovely bungalows and a large garden with huge trees. They also run a nice restaurant with delicious food; and do not forget about the bar run by NIT. Really cool and authentic. And it is family run - no chain-resort - there you can become part of the \"Pearl Beach Family\": So close to real Thai life. Very special. Thank you all for the last years ... I will be back ...

All needs were taken care of by A and his extended family. Not right on the beach but you are close enough to see the water from bar and restaurant.

Semi-outdoor (covered) bathroom which was actually kind of fun. Hammock on the deck (nice touch). Nice bar area with a fun bartender (Ka!) and darts. Less than 5 minute walk to the beach, very close. My only note would be, when leaving Ko Lanta via Krabi airport, TAKE A TAXI. We took a minibus that was packed to the gills with people and luggage- it was pretty uncomfortable.
