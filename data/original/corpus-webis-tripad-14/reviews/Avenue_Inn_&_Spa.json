{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 848, "name": "Avenue Inn & Spa", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with family", "text": "My wife and two young daughters ( ages 4 and 2 ) spent 3 days and two nights in Rehoboth Beach , DE the weekend of Sept 22-25 and stayed at the Avenue Inn. We come to Rehoboth yearly, usually after labor day, and have stayed at the Boardwalk Plaza in the past for that on the boardwalk location. I chose the Avenue Inn because of the great reviews I read as well as the very reasonable room rates. The hotel is just perfect. We reserved a two-room suite that had two queen size beds and a pullout sofa. The hotel is a block from the beach and its front/lobby side is on a quiet, un-busy street. There are slightly larger rooms with balconies, but because the hotel is not on the beach, your view would most likely be other building's rooftops. Check in was a breeze; ythe staff seemed very dedicated to their roles and really take their time to make sure you have all of the hotel's information. They have complimentary breakfast ( mostly cereals, egg quiches, bagels, etc. ), a nightly wine and cheese happy hour and an evening tray of fresh baked cookies out in the lobby until they are all gone. The hotel also has a small pool facing a rooftop terrace with a hot tub that is open practically all day. We did the beach in the afternoon and pool in the evening one day ( to tire the kids out ) and it was a delightful time. My only complaint about the hotel is that the room a/c was a bit loud and for people who do like some sort of view or natural light, we just had one small window at the far end of the room for outdoor light. Othetrwise, we are already thinking of when to return for an adults-only getaway.", "title": "Good Weekend stay at Avenue Inn", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Farmerica", "date": "September 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 5882051, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Room rate and location", "disliked": "\u2014 Small window and noisy air conditioner"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Cheap, dirty, and overpriced.

Like another reviewer said, it's a long block from the beach, but right on Rehoboth Avenue where all the shopping is. The hotel actually is in a perfect location. The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, the room and bathroom were exceptionally clean, and there was a decent view from the balcony (overlooked roof tops, but you see some of the shops/shoppers on Rehoboth Avenue). The only complaint was the sleepsofa which apparently was very uncomfortable - could feel the springs, etc. This was our first stay in Rehoboth Beach and we loved the town, too. Very clean city....a nice change from Ocean City, Maryland. I have to also recommend the Spa adjoined to the Avenue Inn. All five of us had wonderful massages and the massage therapists were very friendly and very well trained. No complaints! :) If you are looking for a hotel in Rehoboth, I totally recommend The Avenue. Would definitely return again! :)", "title": "Great hotel!!!

We thought it was great. We've stayed at Rehoboth many times before, but this was our first time at the Avenue Inn and we'll definitely return. The location is great - about a block from the beach (easy stroll), and right on Rehoboth Avenue for shopping and restaurants. We stayed in a King suite with the kids, and it worked out very well. We had a minor issue with the sitting room (where the pull-out bed is)getting very warm in the evening (it was HOT this weekend), while the bedroom was cold with the a/c turned up, but we just slept with the adjoining door open. We found the facility to be very nice, well-kept, and clean. The indoor pool is very nice, and we didn't use the hot tub, sauna or steam room, but they also looked nice. The hotel provides towels and beach chairs, which is very helpful. The staff was very pleasant and helpful, and we enjoyed the breakfast, afternoon snack, and evening cookies.
