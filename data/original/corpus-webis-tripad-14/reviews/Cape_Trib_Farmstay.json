The cabin was fairly basic but spotless and pleasant - surprisingly great shower. The owners are very friendly and the fruity breakfasts delicious and we certainly tried fruits we had never heard of let alone eaten before. It is centrally located. We loved nearby restaurant the Dragonfly - wonderful fresh food and friendly people and enjoyed our trip out to the reef on the Rum Runner.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "AlYorks", "date": "January 21, 2006", "id": 4367730}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 2, "very good": 12, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 65}, "aka": "Cape Trib Farmstay Cape Tribulation, Daintree Region, Australia", "slim_ranking": 0.125, "description": "Cape Trib Farmstay is cabins, bed & breakfast accommodation and tropical fruit orchards at Cape Tribulation in the Daintree, Far North Queensland, Australia.
