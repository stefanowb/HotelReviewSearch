Every area is beautifully decorated but homely, and the staff could not be more helpful. The rooms are lovely. We stayed in a standard room one night (which being on the first floor had beautifully high windows and was very light but had only a shower, no bath) then one the next stage up, which had a bath but smaller windows as it was in the attic. Both were gorgeous. We ate in the pub one night and the restaurant the next, and actually preferred the relaxed atmosphere of the pub overall but the food was excellent in both. I could not recommend this place more highly, if you are thinking of staying there, then definitely go for it!", "title": "Best hotel for relaxing weekend", "user": "ajw26", "date": "January 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 23722536, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beautiful building and decor", "disliked": "\u2014 No bath in standard room"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Each component part of this hotel is strong yet somehow they are not working together to create the promised luxury package. The house is fantastic - soooo tastefully furnished, and the general ambiance is one of chic, relaxed country house living. The food is great - a fantastic steak and chunky chips, generous portions and cooked just as I asked. My girl- friend had fish which was cooked to perfection. Have the ice cream - it is yum! My only gripe and it is only a very tiny one about the food is that I would have enjoyed the side salad better had it been served on a separate plate. The staff are warm and friendly. The room was smallish and the bath was a real disappointment - much too small for what I am looking for in luxury accomodation. Bedding fantastic - crisp, white linen and soft duvet. So...what didn't work. Essentially what would bring all these component parts together are staff who link them all up. We sat in the lounge and had to ask for afternoon tea - this was despite staff having come in a couple of times, looked around and then going out again without checking whether there was anything we required. Staff brought the tea in and didn't wipe the table down which was dirty from the mess left by previous guests. We then wanted a drink before dinner and had to find staff to serve us. The fire almost went out and as it got colder we chose to go and find staff to advise them of this as there were no logs in the basket for us to keep the fire stoked. That is not what I am looking for on a luxury break. I want staff to be vigilant and attentive to the needs of guests, I want them to pre-empt my requests and be working to create an atmosphere which is cosy, warm and where my having to ask for things is kept to a minimum. This experience will not put me off going again but I do hope that staff have some training/input to help them better align the way they take up their role with what the business is meant to deliver.", "title": "Rectory almost delivers on the luxury package promised:", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HampshireAnnie", "date": "November 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 21505016, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Antiques", "disliked": "\u2014 Staff not confident in their role."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "A very nice hotel with a nice dinner menu.
