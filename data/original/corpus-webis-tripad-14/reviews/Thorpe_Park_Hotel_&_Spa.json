I also wanted to borrow a meeting room in the evening for 30 minutes to join a colleague for a conference call - the hotel wanted to charge for this (I have never been asked to pay for out of hours quick use of a meeting room before). Thankfully the general manager managed to sort me out for a FOC room. On check out, my bill had parking charges on (I had no car with me) and I know that other conference delegates had similar issues - I felt my bill was rather grudgingly corrected.
