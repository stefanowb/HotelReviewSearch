There is a lovely cafe- cake shop at front of hotel, well worth a visit. When you turn left out of hotel towards oldtown the first restraunt you meet is Casa do Chefe, this is a must!!.

Huge pool at the hotel and always spare beds, pool was very very cold but bearable there was only 2 or 3 people in it at any time lol mainly couples and the odd baby so nice a relaxing, nice pool side cafe and bar with lovely staff.
