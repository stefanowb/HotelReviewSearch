Really enjoyed the resort overall and came back from this trip refreshed. Good staff and the entertainment was excellent with the water ballet night the highlight. The main hotel lobby bar had some great musicians to listen to before dinner. It was really nice having our Canadian money at par for the first time. Never had a problem finding something to eat and enjoyed the Italian and Seafood restaurants. There is a smiling lady in a small shed behind the main pool who makes the best home made donuts you would ever want and everyone should experience it. Lots of weddings on the beach during our stay and it looked from our perspective that the staff worked hard getting things ready. Lots of things to do around the resort and the boardwalk along the sea towards the flea market was nice for long walks. Only minor complaint I had was that some fellow tourists would run down early in the morning to put clothing on chairs located under shade and end up not using them for most of the day. This resort was packed solid during our trip and shade was at a premium on the beach. The staff overall spoke English very good and was the best we have ever experienced in Cuba in regards to language. Back in the fall of 2010 our group was thinking of changing resorts due to the very poor reviews showing on this web site. We are sure glad that we stayed with our original booking as we all had a great time.

We went on the horse and buggy ride through Guardalavaca and it was an eye opening experience. We had the driver stop once so we could give a little girl walking along the road with her mother, a colouring book and crayons along with some gum. They were very appreciative of this gesture. We enjoyed the market and purchased a few hand made items to bring back home. I also went on the hobey cat with my sister and we had a blast.
