The resort area was very quiet and relaxing. The views are just amazing and soothing. The rooms were absolutely beautiful. We stayed in a two bedroom suite and the bathrooms were well done! We had trouble with the hot water and maintenance staff came to adjust it as soon as we called. The area around the resort is very well maintained and super nice to take a nice walk early in the morning or late afternoon when it isn't so hot. We went in the summer, so it gets really hot during the day. The resort is a short drive to downtown.
