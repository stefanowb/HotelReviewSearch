Anyhow, go up the fancy elevator to Area 31 at the top, and walk directly out onto the terrace. It would be a crime to sit \"inside\" at this place. The fortunate thing for Area 31 is its building's particular position. Yes, it's on the Miami River, with a view of Biscayne Bay, which is all beautiful, but it's even better than that, because of a little twist in the major road below, it sits in the center and at the very head of one of the most beautiful avenues of modern skyscrapers in the world. The Epic is built at the very north end of Miami's Brickell Avenue, the Magic City's famous and very expensive financial district which boasts magnificent modern buildings built by and for banks from all around the world. You can sit and sip your drink, or eat your shrimp appetizer while gazing down a couple of miles of some of the most spectacular office towers anywhere...they're almost all international award winners. The view is breathtaking during the day, but it's twice as spectacular at night, when all the buildings light up with their innovative multicolored light designs from top to bottom. By the way, what does \"Area 31 mean?\" Well, that's the number of the Caribbean area on nautical charts, and since the seafood is from that area...that's the idea. This is the perfect sophisticated place for a first or last night in Miami, and guaranteed to impress anyone on a balmy tropical evening. It's really beautiful, not touristy, and very enjoyable just to be there. None of the craziness of South Beach, but all the glamor.
