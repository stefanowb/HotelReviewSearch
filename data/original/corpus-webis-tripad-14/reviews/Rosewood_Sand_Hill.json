The breakfast at Madera was pricy, and the waite was long (over 30 min.)! Food was of good quality, however. Check-out was problematic also.... They did not honor the promotion rate we secured weeks ago on the Rosewood's website, and they did not take the credit card on file, either. We had to spent over 30 min. for the hotel to fix the problems at check out, and almost miss our flight because of that. Note: Stayed there in March 2009 when they were just opened...I hope their services and computer system have improved since. But still didn't believe they have any excuse to performed so badly.

They are inside the lobby too and land on you at the bar, in the restaurant. Beats me how to get rid of them in a way that doesn't drench everything with pesticide-- maybe import some fly eating birds ( but then they poop everywhere). That was quite annoying actually. The local taxis are very poor. Every single time we had issues as did other guests. The drivers are frankly unsafe AND don't have a clue where anything IS. Even when we asked to be picked up at the \"oval at Stanford\" which is a local landmark the barely English speaking driver wanted an exact address for his GPS. Then on the return to the hotel he didn't know where the Rosewood was and couldn't spell Sand ( as in Sand hill drive) so my son had to get out his GPS on his phone and direct the driver who turned the wrong way on a one way street.
