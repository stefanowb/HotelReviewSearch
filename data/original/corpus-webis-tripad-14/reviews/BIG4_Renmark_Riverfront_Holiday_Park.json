That time we had a riverfront cabin and we thoroughly enjoyed our brief, one night stay. This time we were wending our way down to MacLarenvale for a festival and had a couple of nights up our sleeves. We couldn't get a riverfront cabin this time but did secure a poolside cabin. I really like this place. I feel safe and secure, the people are friendly, the staff are more than helpful and above all, it's beautifully clean! We will be back. It's not only in a great spot but the town itself is so lovely and friendly. If you have the choice and are not a 'pool' person,go the river front. You get to sit on the balcony and watch the gorgeous sunsets and sunrises (if you're up of course) and the pelicans and ducks will keep you company.

Park is well set out and the cabin accommodation superb. A little pricey but well worth it. We had a mixup when trying to extend our holiday by a night (were told we could but they were looking at the wrong cabin). When we discovered the mistake the staff were amazingly accommodating and moved us to another cabin for next to nothing and apologised like crazy. Very well handled!
