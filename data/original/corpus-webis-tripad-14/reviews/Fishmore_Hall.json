We weren't disappointed. The hotel is beautiful; our superior rooms were spacious and well appointed. The beds are huge as are the walk-in showers. Bathrooms offer thick towels, dressing gowns and Molton Brown toiletries as standard. There are excellent tea/coffee making facilities along with a mini bar full of local produce. Bottles of water are complimentary. There is a lift to all floors. The views from the bedrooms across the Shropshire countryside are breath-taking. The staff were unobtrusive and very friendly.

The situation of the hotel is fabulous.

Breakfast was delicious, served in a lovely conservatory overlooking Clee Hill, with cereals, meats, a basket of toast/croissants and danish pastries and a lovely full english. One day I had porridge with whisky and brown sugar which was also delicious. The waiters in the dining room were a joy and very efficient.
