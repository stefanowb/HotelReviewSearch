The staff were friendly and helpful, most speak English and the hotel couldn't be in a better location for vising the lakes.

This hotel seems frozen in time... appearing very 1950s or 1960s, but it was fun (and I liked the look of it all). The rooms were very spacious (with tubs in the bathrooms). The lobby was HUGE and it had a good bar with an outside deck. It's all nestled in the woods above the falls (though you can't see the falls from any rooms). We had both a dinner and a breakfast in the dininng \"hall\"... and the food was typical eastern European (\"heavy\" but generous).
