Nice hotel located just outside of the city center. The metro is only a 5 minute walk away. This hotel is spotless, brand new and for the budget minded traveler offers great no frills accomodation. The check-in was fast and friendly. The rooms are small, a double bed, or two singles, a shower, toilet and basin, and a small work desk with a stool to sit at and free wifi. There is a small place to hang clothes with about 4 hangers. In my opinion the room is really big enough for only one person, with two in the room, you won't have much space at all, and the only place to sit is on the bed. The room has heat and air conditioning, and a window that opens for fresh air. The hotel sits off the main street by one block so it is in a quiet area. All you can eat breakfast is offered at 4.5euros and will fill you up for your days start.The combined lobby and breakfast area are clean and bright and there is a free computer to use also.", "title": "A nice hotel at a great price", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "yvr1", "date": "March 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153520468}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013", "text": "I was a bit worried about a low cost hotel, but this ibis is quite good. If you don't mind of small places, if you are just in to sleep and enjoy Madrid during the day, it's ok. First it's cheap, second it's clean, third it's quite. Well... I am writting in a cold February and this morning was snowing. No idea how could this be in summer or better months. Not used to such small rooms, everything compacted, but you get the essentials with a touch of class. Nice people that help, nice but simple decoration of reception and breakfast area, a double bed and an extra one for a kid, cheap and good?, i like this place. Remember: February, freezing cold, not many people in the hotel, quite and clean. I hope you find the same, except for the cold, instead i wish you good sunny days in Madrid", "title": "Clean, low cost, good access, nice service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Juan Carlos M", "date": "February 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 153322942}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Community of Madrid", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Madrid"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 35, "very good": 116, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 66}, "slim_ranking": 0.192560175055}
