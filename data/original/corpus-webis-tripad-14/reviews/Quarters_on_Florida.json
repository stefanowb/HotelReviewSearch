Nice clean rooms, in a lovely old colonial house. Staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful. Situation is convenient - 5-10 mins drive from downturn, BUT as opposed to downtown Florida Rd is completely safe to walk along deciding which restaurant/bar you want to visit (I recommend Simply Fish). In fact the biggest danger is likely to be some brainless Durban rich kid showing off how fast his Porsche can go up and down the street - the numerous police don't seem interested in doing anything about that. V close to the new football stadium for next year's World Cup - HOWEVER the global sports agencies have already taken options every hotel room the city, inc here. Durban couldn't even cope with the crowd for the Lions game and that was only 40,000 !!", "user": "Bluftut", "date": "July 15, 2009", "id": 34814692}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We visited South Africa recently for a wedding, and after reading previous reviews on trip advisor decided to book with The Quarters.

Wonderful property in the heart of the night life area on Florida Road. Just walk out of the door and there are dozens of restaurants, bars and nightspots. The four Victorian buildings are lovingly restored, comfortable and spacious. What makes the difference though is the (overwhelmingly female) staff. It really makes you feel welcome every time.

We had just come from An African Villa in Cape Town which was wonderful. Durban was hot and humid and our room was hot and dark. Our A/C unit was not working but the staff kept telling us that it was user error. When at 10 I asked them to please change rooms for us they said that the hotel was full, however 20 mins later when I visited the lobby to at least get a fan, a room came open.

I LOVED the Quarters. Great service - can you believe they packed my breakfast b/c my flight was very early in the morning? Never heard of anything like that. The room is very comfortable, bathroom is excellent. Only one issue: was staying with a friend and there are no rooms with two beds. Ok! They provided an extra single bed. The restaurant is FANTASTIC. Service is more than great. I needed to buy a bottle of a specific wine for my father and they located one place that had this wine and took care of everything for me. I ended up buying a whole box of this rare wine b/c they found it for me. Location, location, location. Very near very good restaurants and safe place to walk around.
