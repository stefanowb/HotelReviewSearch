The initial room that we got we did not like and we were switched the next night for the following 3 nights. They sent us a fruit basket and a bottle of wine for the inconvenience. They also upgraded our room. We had breakfast included and it was very good. The restaurant was nice and had a sustainable garden outside. The room was decorated very pretty and was large.
