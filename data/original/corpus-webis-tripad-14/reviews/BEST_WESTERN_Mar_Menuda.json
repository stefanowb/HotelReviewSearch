We would go back in a heartbeat. This town reminded us most of the almafi coast beach towns. The beach is beautiful and we enjoyed it so much more than the beach in Marbella. This is a LAID BACK, flip flops, casual, authentic spanish beach town. You will not see all the high end glitzy stores like in marbella or starbucks on every corner etc. and we loved that about this town. The beach chairs and beach umbrellas cost 20 euro a day for 3 adults. You do have to \"rent\" beach towels from the hotel. You may want to go into town and purchase some of these beach accessories. I am not sure if the sister hotel provides these extra touches. The hotel rooms need some work. We were 3 adults staying in a room that was very small. Our room overlooked the parking lot in the back of the hotel. The \"newer\" \"sister hotel\" Best Western looked a lot more modern! However, the town is so magical and amazing the room did not take away from our amazing time. The pool is a kiddie sized pool. The breakfast was good..you can ask the waitress for eggs cooked any style. The hotel staff was nice and very helpful . The LOCATION is awesome!! GO to Don Pepe's for GREAT guitar playing music and and awesome sangria. The bar is hopping and owners are awesome!", "title": "magical place, beautiful laid back casual town...hotel rooms need work!", "user": "ntm4", "date": "August 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 8396323, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 lcoation and the town", "disliked": "\u2014 rooms were small for 3 people"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We made our reservation at the Mar Menuda based on the review in Frommer's Spain.
