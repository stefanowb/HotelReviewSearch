We didn't venture out of the hotel so can't say anything about the surrounding area but it had very easy access to the Interstate which was exactly what we needed. I used the laundry downstairs and also the business centre to check email and had no problems with either. The only criticism I have is that the restuarant wasn't great. The waiter had suggested that I didn't have the pizza as I would only complain which I thought was good however then the rest of the food was nothing to write home about. It is only a very small restaurant though and there were other choices around if we could have been bothered to leave the hotel.

Good shower heads & water pressure in the shower.

Breakfast was very good, extensive buffet plus eggs and waffles, french toast etc. cooked to order. (Our sometimes hard to please teenage girls were happy!) Will stay there again if we ever have to return to Bakersfield. Only negatives: 1) There is no view to speak of....dismal industrial view from our room, but we weren't there to gaze out the window. 2) We asked for non-smoking room and got 2 rooms near a smoking zone. The hallways definitely smelled of smoke, but fortunately our rooms were smoke free. Entire family thought the beds were extrememly comfortable. We needed two rooms, so they were able to give us two adjoing room that had communal access.

Spotless, airy reception with seating to the left and a bar and restaurant area to the right. Excellant helpful staff.
