It's quaint, pretty and the staff for the most part are lovely. I did get the impression they don't try quite so hard if you are on all inclusive, but then at least you did have the sophistication of being served like everyone else and not wearing a brightly coloured band to show your status! The best thing about all inclusive, well the only things not included on half board, were definitely worth having which were the cocktails and lunch. With lunch you have the run of the proper menu, unlike dinner where you only have two choices, all freshly prepared from fish of the day, to pasta, or paninis, Three courses too, so washed down with wine, (the house wine is south african and not vino callapso)beer or a gin and tonic either in the restaurant which is very pretty or the bar, was a treat. At night the place is candle-lit which is great for a romantic meal, but seeing as the lighting in the rooms isn't much better, not so good for makeup. Yes, grande gaube is out of the way, but we enjoyed ourselves a lot. There are obviously much more plush hotels, but for the price and it is price that dictates facilities etc, I think it is good value. Food is good, drinks are good, entertainment is done with a lot of fun and laughter, the place is very pretty.....I went with my teenage daughter and she had a good time too, just chilling.....Mauritius is a beautiful island but not one that I would visit again, as I feel in ten days we did most things. Excursions were a disappointment, dolphin watching consisting of loads of boats going round in circles chasing a few dolphins, the seven coloured earth was fenced off and not the dessert like landscape you expect from the postcards, the organised shopping is to tourist traps ie model boat factories.......I get the impression that in ten year's time Mauritius will be spoilt. So if you do want to go, go now. the people are lovely and I would recomment doing your own excursions by taxi. Oh and Isle de cerfs is rather spoilt already, shame that, as I have friends who went to Mauritius twenty years ago and then it sounded like it truly was paradise....but such is progress!", "title": "As good as can be expected......for the price!", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "lila099", "date": "April 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5011582}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great place to just chill", "text": "Have recently returned after spending 11 nights. Hotel nice, small and intimate. Gardens beautiful and rooms cleaned to really high standard. First observation was that there was no children/teenagers, caters mainly for the retired or over 30`s and french. Food was a disappointment to me, often cold, if you like french quisine, small fancy portions you would like this (could leave you hungry). The theme nights did not cater for those not liking that particular theme, but the chef would cook you a piece of chicken if asked. The spa is worth a visit, I had 2 wonderful massages. The trips are expensive particularly the horseriding, but the one not to miss, was the boat trip booked through JR. You snorkel and then go to the island where you are met with a great barbecue, there is lots of jungle juice, singing, music and laughter all the way. Taxi`s are inexpensive and the driver will take you shopping and even wait for you - excellent!! Staff to mention was Danoo in the bar, he was great fun, a real gent. If you like a place with lots going on this is probably not for you, the daily activiites and evening entertainment were below average and even though when we went, the hotel was not by any means full, one evening there was not enough chairs in the bar so we had to sit in reception. The early morning fight for the beach sunloungers was ridiculous, so all you insomniacs will be fine! I doubt if there would be adequate pool seating either in the busiest times. I would advise the all inclusive option because the island is expensive, and keep a note on your mini bar - this was not restocked daily and the spirits, snacks and even the alka selzer are not included in your package. If you require a late check out, try and do this before you arrive at the hotel, this is not sorted out for you and comes at the very bottom of the hotels priority list, the last thing you need at the end of your holiday - believe me. Also note that your A/I package ceases at 2.00pm so you may need to hang onto some money for those last minute essentials. There were a number of problems which frankly could have been handled better but hey, you have to make the best of it. In summary, the view I had from my balcony made up for everything.", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "tokar", "date": "July 11, 2006", "id": 5456876}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect Paradise", "text": "Just to say we had a wonderful holiday here, we were on 14 nights All-Inclusive. This hotel was ideal for us as it was not geared up for young children and teenagers which was perfect when lazing around the pool for peace and quiet and you could sit in the bar and enjoy a drink. The hotel itself is spotless and the food and service is above average, we did not have the same meal twice in the two weeks we were there, and the staff really go out of their way to make you feel special. All the staff in this hotel from the room boy to the Manager were always polite and curteous. We did not go on any of the organised trips, but did hire a car and driver from just outside the hotel which took us around the island at a very reasonable price, the hotel even prepared a packed lunch for us as we would miss lunch in the hotel.", "helpfulness": 21, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 6, 2006", "id": 5431910}], "location": {"city": "Grand Gaube", "continent": "Africa"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 27, "average": 53, "very good": 136, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 239}, "aka": "Veranda Paul And Virginie Hotel & Spa", "slim_ranking": 0.5}
