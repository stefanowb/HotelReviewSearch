We flew into Fort Myers and booked a shuttle through Palm Air Transportation ($89.00 each way airport to hotel). The hotel is lovely, suites are huge. We booked this trip online and had booked a 1 bedroom suite, but when we arrived we found that the suites only have a king size bed, not 2 queens as we had requested. The hotel was able to upgrade us to a 2 bedroom and bargained a bit with the price difference. We paid a very fair price to upgrade for what proved to be double the space and two full bathrooms. The beach is beautiful, with attendants to get you settled on their comfortable chairs , position umbrellas and drink/food service right on the beach. One thing to be aware of, is that the beach is covered in shells which makes walking on it a little hard. Sandals and/or sneakers are recommended for walking. The pool area is on the small side, but we never found it to be too crowded and there were ample chairs, umbrellas, towels and two large tents to get completely out of the sun. Food and beverage was available at the pool also. All the suites have full kitchens and there are 2 major grocery stores just a $6.00 cab ride away. (Any cab ride on the island is just $6.00) There is a small plaza within easy walking distance with a book store, several restaurants, a movie theater and t-shirt/toy shop, but not much more. Having never been to Marco Island before, we were surprised to find that there really isn't much to do other than enjoy the beach. The few shopping centers had many empty shops and really weren't worth going to. There is a community playhouse, but it closes for the season around Easter time. If we were to go again, we would rent a car at the airport , as we could have explored a bit more of the area. This is a beautiful, quiet hotel with excellent service and we would certainly like to stay there again.", "title": "Beautiful beach, wonderful suites, great vacation!", "user": "Karen125", "date": "April 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28650739}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled solo", "text": "I recently returned from a five night stay at the Marco Beach Ocean resort and I don't think they could have down anything better!

We actually we under the impression that we booked a room with two beds, but upon check in we found that our room only had one king bed and a pull out sofa in the livingroom. At first that were reasonable, offered us free valet parking the whole week and would move us to 2 beds the next day when they had a mass move out. The next morning that completely changed their minds, they were difficult and refused to stand behind their agreement. We ended up having to call out travel agent which was somewhat successful in getting us into a 2 bed room. The (2 bed) room is actually a 2 bedroom. It is very large a great for a family. The one room which we were in before is very small for a famiy. The pull out sofa is very uncomfortable and we just put one memeber on it and ordered a roll away. I have never seen this type of roll away, it was a blowup mattress for the floor. This just didn't fit the upscale quality of this hotel. The night before we slept at the Marriott where we flew out and their roll away was a great twin bed. Aside from the room confusion, when we finally got settled into our 2 bedroom it was very nice. The beach is great and the ocean was wonderful. The beach staff sets up your chair and towel and umbrella for you. That was so nice. The little bar and grill on the way to the beach is also very nice which we used several times. However it is extremely expensive. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers and chicken fingers and it was 85.00. One big downfall is there is no place on the property to eat breakfast. The bar and grill doesn't open until lunch. We ate breakfast in out room most days but would have really enjoyed a breakfast onsite. What we have done at other vacations is to eat breakfast in our suites and coverups and head to the beach. There are 3 excursions: Jetski Tour of the ten thousand Islands, Sailboat to one of the 10 thousands for shelling. You can also see dolfins in the bay which we did and our girls were very excited, Airboat ride in the everglades. All three and worth doing. One down fall of this area is that there really isn't much to do except beaching, and those 3 activities. We actually went for the beach so it suited our purpose. My husband loved it but our girls would have liked some more activities to choose from. We went shopping several evenings because their are really no evening activities. Lot of good shopping with in 45 minutes of the hotel.
