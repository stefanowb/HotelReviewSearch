We were in Berlin and we figured out that Prague was not as far as we thought. We left Berlin early, stopped over in Dresden for a few hours, then wound up in the evening over in Prague. We got to the central station, which is a short walk from the famous Vaclavske street, late in the evening. The hotel was close enough to walk to, about 15 mins away, though it took us a little longer since it was our first time and we got a little lost. We eventually found it and check-in was nice and easy. The lobby was simple but elegant.

Breakfast was a continental buffet, very nice and fresh. The location was perfect too, very close to everything but not too close as it was still a very peaceful area so you will definitely get a good night's sleep. Overall excellent value for money.
