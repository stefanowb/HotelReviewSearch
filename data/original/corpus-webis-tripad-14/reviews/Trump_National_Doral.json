The hotel was rather empty and my kids were able to enjoy the pool almost all to themselves. The room was nice and spacious although yes, it is a bit dated. It is an old hotel and it shows. There were also some minuses. Just as some other reviews have noted, their reservation system is not very accurate. Our reservation was book incorrectly. It was fixed later on. The lunch buffet at Windows is nice for the eyes but not as wonderful on the palate or the pocket. It is very expensive and an automatic 20% tip was added to the lunch bill.

When I arrived, the host at the front desk told me they had no record of my reservation, which didn't make sense since I showed proof that I was registered for the conference and the hotel reservation was part of the conference reservation. In any case, they were able to find a room for 2 nights but then I would need to vacate as the hotel was fully booked afterwards. The manager on duty was not available so I left a copy of my registration form and was told they would look into it and let me know. Later, I received a phone message that the manager stated the copy I left showed no proof that the hotel had made the reservation and that I would need to vacate the property following my second night stay. I went to the front desk and spoke to the manager on duty, explaining this was my fourth stay at the hotel, I was a Marriott reward member and that my company was sponsoring a dinner at the property for 400 guests. The manager proceeded to tell me that the property was fully booked but would honor my full stay if I showed proof that the hotel was at fault for not booking my reservation. I once again showed my registration form and explained that either the hotel or the conference coordinator messed up my reservation and asked that they find a room for that last night. If they could find a room if I showed proof then it's obvious I could be accomodated. The manager gave a very stern \"No\" and when I asked how would it be possible to find a room if I had other evidence, I was told \"I could make it happen\". Obviously, this conversation was going nowhere so I complained to the conference coordinator who was able to have my stay extended for that one last night.

The grounds are beautiful, the rooms spacious. However there were a few issues during this stay. When I attempted to check in, they did not have my rsvp. After several attempts to locate it, I finally had to provide my rsvp confirmation. They just gave me an available room @ the rate on my confirmation. I left the printed confirmation with them. Unfortunately as it wasn't yet check-in time, our rooms (we were travelling with another couple I'd booked also) were not yet ready. They offered to call me when our room was ready, which should be about an hour. We headed to the poolside snack bar & enjoyed delicious drinks & snacks. After 2 hours, we decided to check if perhaps our rooms were ready & they hadn't called. Our room was ready, and our friends was not. Not good. Essentially, I think it was confused front desk staff (perhaps new since the switch?) that did not understand who to give rooms to? I don't know. After expressing their discontent, my friends room was also ready. Our room was lovely, beautiful view, comfortable bed. Unfortunately there was so little shower pressure, i ended up rinsing my head under the tub faucet. Other than that, the room was great & the maid was excellent. Our second day there, we returned to our room to find construction going on outside it. Half the length of the hallway was coated in plastic, including above our door. About 7 workers were busy, very polite & apologetic. Not the prettiest experience though. Upon leaving, the hotel attempted to charge me for our room (which had been paid previously). Clearly due to the complication of the missing rsvp in the first place, they also had no record of it being paid for (& sadly, no note of the conf I'd left them with). In the end, we were not charged, but all in all...I hope they are soon through this transitional stage.
