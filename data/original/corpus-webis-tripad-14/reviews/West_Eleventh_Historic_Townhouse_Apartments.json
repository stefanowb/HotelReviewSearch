Keith, who greets you and gives you tips for restaurants, was wonderful. The apartment was very comfortable, clean and great value for money, although it doesn't have a kitchen like some of the other apartments- just a microwave, bar fridge and kettle. The location was second to none with an infinite choice of restaurants, most open until after midnight and it was a short stroll to the subway. However, the street itself was very quiet with little traffic noise.
