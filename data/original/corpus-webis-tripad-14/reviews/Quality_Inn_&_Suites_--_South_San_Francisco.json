My bed was comfortable and despite the roar of 101 nearby I slept very well and the noise didnt bother me. The room had a new fridge, microwave and one of the newer coffee pots that use the small cartridges. The only problem was that the remote on the TV is somewhat difficult to use. What set this hotel apart from others was the exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. When i was exercising in the fitness center Mr Patel came in and checked on me to make sure I had enough air. He brought in an additonal fan to cool me off. He and the night manager were very helpful and answered all my questions.
