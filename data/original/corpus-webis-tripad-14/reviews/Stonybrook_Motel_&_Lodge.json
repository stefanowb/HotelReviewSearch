The place has basically stayed unchanged except for the owners. I suspect that 'Mike\" has inherited his name from the previous owners and Kelly was a no show, however the elderly couple who cleans could possibly be the parents of Mike, all very nice and hardworking. We stayed in the Lodge which is the main building, the five rooms are all upstairs (no elevator) and the recreational area is downstairs. The inside is all log and you really get the feel of being in a Lodge, however the place is of course worn. The game room is comfy and gives you a nice place to hang out if you are with family or friends, we picked up and ate pizza there, played pool, and sat around the large built in fireplace which was not in use that early in the season. The board games are kept in built in bins/seats, are all old and we were afraid to touch them and they didn't look complete as if some were missing, we saw pictionary.The bedrooms are very clean and the bathroom is spotless. Don't expect new and updated furniture or amenities it's just not a hotel. Bring your own toiletries as you only get conditioning shampoo and slivers of soap. There is a coffeemaker and a small fridge, our clothes drawer fell out when we pulled it out . The breakfast is basic, bagels, sweet pastries and cereal, the juice was Tang and they had coffee and tea. The indoor pool felt warm to the touch the day before but the next day when we got in it was COLD, the outdoor pool stayed closed even though it was the labor day weekend and it is supposed to be heated. The motel is comfortable seemingly on par with the other motels in the area. For breakfast everyone wants to try Polly's pancake house which is not far away but was too crowded and had a long wait, so if you miss the 9:30 cut off time at Stonybrook we would highly recommend the breakfast at the Best Western on Wallace Hill Rd, it's inexpensive and good, we went twice. Stonybrook is in a great location if you are going to see the Franconia Notch attractions they are 5 minutes away.
