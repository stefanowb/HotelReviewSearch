We were given the family room which was plenty large enough for the four of us, decorated an a pretty blue and with an ensuit bathroom. We opted for no AC and found that fan was sufficient - an extra one could be requested perhaps. I particularly appreciated the staff who were always friendly and able to assist with extra requests. The pool was a real asset with the children - particularly during the day when it was too hot to sightsee. The kitchen was clean and well appointed. There are a couple of reasonable local resturants nearby and a short taxi trip to Apia centre (4 tala). Also, the close proximity to hospital, and National University of Samoa was handy.", "user": "little021", "date": "January 26, 2010", "id": 54380478}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010", "text": "Based on the online reviews, we booked a weekend stay at the Outrigger Samoa and we were very disappointed based on our expectations from the reviews--we had ensuites with A/C. They messed up our reservations and we were forced to pay for 2 separate rooms thus defeating the purpose of staying in one double room for two people with 2 twin beds to save money. The towels always smelled like sweat as if they had not been washed properly in detergent. The water pump apparently did not work one day and I was caught in the shower with soap and forced to rinse with near scalding water (usually they have no hot water). Most disappointing was the quality of the pool--it was murky and clearly it had not been cleaned on a regular maintenance schedule and did not have proper chlorination. This was important to us because we always stay at hotels that have pools when on vacation. If you don't care much about the little things, than this hotel will do. But for all the pump up in the reviews, its very misleading and as frequent weekend travelers to Apia, we would not stay here again. For just the same cost, we could have stayed at nicer local hotels with better quality rooms and equipped with A/C.", "title": "Below expectations in quality and cleanliness, thus overpriced", "user": "PagoSKY", "date": "January 24, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 54285277}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "If you don't care about the heat and don't need an A/C, then its an ok place to stay--so long as you can request for clean sheets and towels.", "title": "Loved Stay at Outrigger", "user": "-Wandering-Teine-", "date": "January 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 53917797}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled solo", "text": "The Samoan Outrigger was the third place we stayed at in Samoa.

The rooms are serviced daily and the communal kitchen was more than adequate for self catering. It is the perfect location for med students doing their electives as it is only a 5min walk to TTM hospital and right around the corner from a supermarket and a great italian restaurant! It was such a treat coming home from a hot day on the wards to the inviting crystal clear pool surrounded by the beautiful tropical gardens The owners, Claus and Laena are a wonderful couple who really make you feel welcome and right at home. We met many other medical students staying at various other hotels/motels and I certainly feel we made the right choice.

The sheets are fresh daily and even ironed! The pool is well-maintained and offers a welcome relief from the tropical heat. I LOVED the breakfasts--local fresh fruit. The staff is very professional and can help advise tours, sightseeing. They even have a rental car--I should've used them. I met some interesting guests while there. This place combines all of the positives of a classy hotel with prices comparable to a youth hostel. It's easy to catch a taxi out front 24/7 and its an easy walk to downtown. The hotel doesn't have air conditioning in these upstairs rooms but I felt that the fan was adequate.

The hotel and rooms were impecibly clean, the fruit buffet breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the pool was extremely inviting in the samoan humidity after a morning in hospital!
