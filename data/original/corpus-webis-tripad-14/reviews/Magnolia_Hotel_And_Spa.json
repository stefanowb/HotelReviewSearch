The rooms were very open and spacious, with inviting beds dressed with down comforters. Aveda products were in the big, beautiful bathrooms with very nice marble counters and solid bath tubs (sounds odd, but I think a great room with a cheap bath is a let-down) There was a \"greeting gift\" of a small treasure chest with wonderful local chocolates. bottles of water, and passes to a museum. The staff was marvelous, offering suggestions for dining at \"local's favorites\" and everything was within an easy walk. There is also a restaurant/bar attached that is fantastic!
