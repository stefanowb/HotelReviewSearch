Now I went with nine people me my boyfriend my sister her boyfriend and other friend who are also couples. we went with Sunwing and are flight was called on time but then it took 2 hours to put all the bags into the plan and defrost the wings... that alone could have got everyone upset but hey you can't let these things get to you it happens. When we got to the hotel we checked in (it took a while but we waited like every one else) then we got our room which was very clean. Then we were off to eat there was a bit of a line to eat but we waited 5 minutes and we were in. We then went to get our beach towels... There were no towels and we were told that we could only get them tomorrow so we didn't let it get us done and went to the beach anyway... The first 10 minutes my cousin was in the water he got bit by a jellyfish luckily the rest of us didn't I told him to pee on it (which works) but no one believed me so he went to the beach bar and they put vinegar on it which also works but I would advise not to wait and just pee on it its not a big deal. The next day the weather wasn't really on our side and it rained so there goes a day gone of out vacation but that is not the hotels fault nor is the jellyfish they cannot control that.
