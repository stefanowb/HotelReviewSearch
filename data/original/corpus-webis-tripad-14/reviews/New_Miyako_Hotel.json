I was expecting that we would get one of the older rooms as a result but instead we got one of the newly renovated rooms on the 6th (top) floor. I think the key to getting one of the newer rooms is to arrive as close to 1:00 as possible, when they start checking people in. We arrived around 1:15 and got a beautiful room. The renovated rooms really are as pretty as they appear on their website. It was clean and there were tons of great amenities. The beds are probably hard compared to western beds, but we found them to be very comfortable with fluffy duvets. The bathroom was small, but we took comfortable baths everynight after long days of sightseeing. The rooms are very quiet and we never heard anyone in the hall ways through the door or the walls. The location was great, as others have mentioned. We ate regularly at the restaurants in the station. Skip breakfast at the hotel and run over to the bakeries on the first floor of the station. The breakfast at the hotel was overpriced and not that impressive. Dessert though was delicious at the hotel.

It's conveniently located across the street from the Kyoto train station and is an easy walk. We didn't try any of the restaurants in the hotel -- there were too many dining options at Kyoto station, including the floors of prepared foods from the Itsen department store. Our tour book suggested that any location in Kyoto is convenient due to the extensive bus system, but the buses can be crowded and dragging your luggage onto a bus can't be fun. For convenience of getting in and out of Kyoto, I'd recommend staying near the station. Getting around Kyoto on their bus system wasn't a problem (though I recommend getting a bus map from the tourist office in Kyoto station). There's also a main post office at the station, so it's easy to get cash.
