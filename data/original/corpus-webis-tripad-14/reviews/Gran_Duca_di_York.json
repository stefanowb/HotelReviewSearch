The service was five star. They let us check in at 10am...we really needed a shower after the evening flight. I can't remember the last time a Euro hotel let me check in that far in advance. The guys at the desk were very helpful, even offered to switch our rooms so we could get in earlier. One night (pretty late) we asked for another blanket when we got back to the hotel. It seemed like there was a little confusion about what we were asking for but the blanket showed up at our door litteral seconds after we shut it. The bathroom was very spacious and clean. The room was modern, totally quiet, had direct tv, and a little view over the street. My only complaint was the breakfast, it was bad. Walk a couple blocks and get something at a cafe. They did have bottles of water, which I took every morning. The location is also great. Very quite street just a couple blocks from the Doumo (if you cut through the merchants square it's a 2 minute walk). All in all, it was a nice place.

The weather was terrible but we've no complaints about the hotel! Our initial booking was handled very efficiently and hotel staff were really helpful in responding to all queries about the hotel location, etc. On arrival we parked directly outside and our car was whisked away to secure garage parking (pre booked with hotel). Fortunately the garage was very close as my partner realised he'd left something important in the boot! One word of advice if you are driving to the hotel - take great care following the directions! We took one wrong turn and drove for about ten minutes in a restricted area before ending up at a pedestrian only area - there are a lot of one way systems in Milan! In desperation I asked a gentleman for directions (fortunately he spoke excellent English) and he kindly suggested that we follow him. It took at least ten minutes turning up and down tiny back streets and he took us directly to the door of the hotel. As the hotel is located on a one way street he had to drive on even before we had a chance to say thank you. We could never have navigated that route ourselves and are eternally grateful to that extremely kind gent. (And we were told to expect rudeness in Milan!) Our room was spotlessly clean, quiet (overlooking the street) and if you stretched your neck out the window had a view of the Madonna on top of the Cathedral - perfect! The guys on reception were brilliant throughout our stay giving us directions, lending us an umbrella and recommended an absolutely amazing restaurant for dinner where we had the best meal of our entire Italian holiday. Breakfast was excellent too with lots to choose from. So thank you Gran Duca di York - we will happily return and would recommend without hesitation.
