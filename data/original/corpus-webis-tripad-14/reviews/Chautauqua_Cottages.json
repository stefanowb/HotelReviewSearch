We booked three nights in efficiency cottage #603 and loved the experience. The cottage was comfortable and charming, with a full kitchen, dining table, small seating area, queen bed, claw-foot tub, screened porch and WiFi. My only criticism is it could benefit from more reading lamps. Chautauqua consists of about a hundred old cottages on tree-lined streets; some are owner-occupied but the association rents the others like hotel lodging and its historic dining hall serves meals. I enjoyed feeling like we were part of a community and loved the location next to Boulder Mountain park trails. I hiked up a trail, was caught in a passing shower and then saw a double rainbow, which added to the magic of the surroundings.", "title": "Unique and enjoyable", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "calligcat", "date": "December 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 23020020, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Staying in an historic community, surrounded by nature.", "disliked": "\u2014 Inadequate light for reading."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a great place to escape to.

The location was very nice. Our cabin was nice but our friends' cabin was in need of some repairs and updates. What was surprising was that the front office staff was rather cold.

We stayed in cottage #6. It was everything we could have wanted it to be. It had been updated with new appliances, comfy bedding and the heat worked beautifully. I say this because the cottage retains the appearance of something built in the early 1900s, yet was very comfortable. The view out the back screened in porch was beautiful. We saw a family of deer the morning we left. The cottage was only a 5 minute drive into Boulder, we could have walked it comfortably if it had been warmer. There are great trails on the property too. It was a wonderful trip and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this property to anyone looking for a relaxing break from a hectic pace.

The kitchen made it possible to fix dinner each night (we strongly recommend buying meals ready to cook from The Organic Dish) and have bagels for breakfast. If you'd rather eat at the near by Dining Room, the food there was great value and fabulous. We walked into Boulder, went to concerts on the grounds and hiked on all the adjacent trails.
