Spotless Clean.. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Keycamp/Eurocamp staff were amazing and the Kids clubs Macs Funstation for our 7 year old and Base for our 12 year old were just brilliant for them. The children were so happy at this site. The pool complex is fantastic ( indoor pool floor slippy beware).. indoor and outdoor pools were warm and spacious. We had a pitch for our own caravan which is a big twin wheel, and we had no problems with these pitches and they had plenty of space for awning, Jeep ect ... We are going to return next year for 2 weeks to this site. Brilliant facilities as we have a 10month old baby who loved it also.. Baby baths in the nursery and baby facilities were lovely. All round I cannot fault this campsite....Oh and check out the Pain Du Raisins in the shop fresh every morning yummy !!!! 10 / 10", "title": "Amazing Campsite !!

Our Granddaughter grazed the back of her leg getting out of the pool as it had rough stone edges, quite bad when you consider how many children use it. It was expensive to eat and drink, would recommend going off site. The bike hire not too good, the pedal fell off one of the bikes on the 2nd day! Also a lot of parents just let their children ride anywhere they want regardless of age and although the speed limit is 10 m.p.h. there have been several accidents this year.

Location great with a fab little train ride into the town which can also be walked to along the beach. The camp site backs onto a lovely little beach although the sea is very cold. A couple of points to note. I agree, a little, with a previous reviewer about the pool surround surface a it is a little bit abrasive and care needs to be taken.

Dreadful English food in the restaurant (if you could find it open). Drab bar with no atmosphere. Supermarket with french opening times (beware on the day you arrive - bring snacks with you as everything is closed if you arrive between 2 and 4.30). Lack of fresh bread, fresh fruit and vegetables and very limited stock in the supermarket. Good wine though, reasonably priced. The site is really crammed too; not much atmosphere with tents and mobile homes in long rows, a litte too close together. 2 sets of toilets and showers but one permanently locked meant queues as the site was pretty busy.

Site is great for kids of all ages, swimming pool complex has indoors and out, looked a bit strange because the floor of the pools were not blue, but grey ish but otherwise it was great.

There was evening entertainment in the bar which seemed busy, a cafe and take away which looked ok but were not cheap. The enterance to the site is really chaotic which cars, padestrians and a mini train all josstling for space. I imagine there are accidents weekly, it's scary. The site is directly onto a beach and about a 5 min walk round the bay to a really lovely beach on benodet with fantastic ice cream shops very close. The Matthews holidays reps were a very lovely couple and the caravan was spotless, it had everything you would need and was a good size. The pitch was small and we were close to our neighbours, we were opposite people who used Euro camp in a tent and they had even less space (and prob paid a lot more than us!) we had to buy our own BBQ from the supermarket but it was only 15 euro so was no problem.
