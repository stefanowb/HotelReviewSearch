Our room was comfortable, albeit nothing fancy; our bathroom was gargantuan by Italian standards. The breakfast was standard B&B fare, but was ample and nicely presented - and if you want more, there is a great bakery a couple of doors away. The two brothers who run the place are most helpful. It is just outside the walls of the old city at Porta Elisa, but a quick and pleasant stroll into town. It is easy to find once you realize it does not front onto the street (which is probably good for keeping the noise down.) It is a bit of walk from the bus and train stations.
