My husband and I were curious to experience this new hotel where we were assigned for the night. Initially there was a backup at the round reception area due to the numerous passengers checking in from the cancelled flight, but everyone was patient and the process went quickly. We noticed the contemporary lobby, with its plasma screens, and hip decor. Our room on the 5th floor was on the small side but was quiet and worked out very well for the night. Note: probably not the best place for more than a couple of nights, due to storage constraints. The platform bed was extremely comfortable, the shower had two dispensers built in with Bliss products and the decor was modern and trendy. Like others who have written, the shades did allow more light in than needed in the morning. The internet connection was very fast. I made the mistake of having a cup of the \"Steep and Steam\" citrus green tea and stayed up all night from the caffeine. Who knew??? The front desk people were always helpful and friendly. The wake-up call came as requested. The do-it-yourself breakfast area was just marginal. Their version of an eggmuffin was not the best choice, but all in all, I would definitely stay there again.", "title": "Good place to stay when you're flight is cancelled", "user": "Liz1953", "date": "February 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 24356160, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the cool hip theme", "disliked": "\u2014 the do-it-yourself breakfast area"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008", "text": "The aLoft hotel near the Philadelphia airport was a refreshing change to the traditional finds.

A few service issues (room never made up, coffee never replaced), while not major, should be noted. When I went to lobby to request coffee packet for next morning since room was never serviced, staff very apologetic, however it took nearly one hour for coffee packet to arrive. Only other issue is the paid-parking.
