They had the highest ceilings that I have ever encountered but were genuinely ancient and not terribly comfortable. Although meant to be romantic tbh they just came across as old and dusty. The en-suite bathrooms were of the elderly variety and I have never climbed such steep stairs to get to the rooms without a harness attachment! We did ask for the rooms to be adjoining or next door to each other when booking but this did not happen - as we were staying in a big group it worked out ok as we knew all of the other guests at this level but when travelling with small kids it is an added issue. IN some parts of this very old palace the paint is peeling and the it looks like its better days were many moons ago but this is Florence so somehow it works where in any other city it would not. The street that this hotel is on is quite genuinely more like an alleyway so the front is not very impressive but it is nice on the inside. There is a more modern section to this hotel and i would advise booking that as the older section is just a bit too old. However the staff were the nicest and most helpful that I have met anywhere and really did add to the very enjoyable stay. The car park out the back is a God send and the directions and sat nav codes supplied by the hotel will get you through the warren of streets without too much difficulty. Food in the mornings was more than adequete and the buffet spread, attentive staff and hot chololate kept both kids and adults happy. The kids found many nooks and crannies to play in and there was never any sense of the staff getting annoyed with this as can happen elsewhere. And the best bit was the bill - it was correct and nothing more added. They had advertised 4 nights for the price of 3 and that is what we got. The staff are the real high point here and I think if the rooms ( 5 and 9) had not been quite so old fashioned it would have been perfect.", "title": "The perfect place to stay.", "user": "nardii10", "date": "January 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148533515}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "this was my 2nd stay here and the first for my 18 year old niece. we were both thrilled with everything. beautiful common areas. the staff is friendly and helpful. our room was unique and so comfy. i only wish i had more than 2 nights. the breakfast was quite nice and plentiful. very close to all attractions. walking from the train station was not bad with light luggage. i will always return to this hotel when i visit florence.", "title": "Exceptional hotel in Florence", "user": "NWOhioOhiofamily", "date": "December 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148355946}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Monna Lisa was just the right combination of quality and price, making it a great value.
