We were on the top floor - window would not close all catches broken so very dangerous considering we were in a family room. The furniture was all broken/bare wires everywhere, it was called ensuite - what a cheek it was a stinking shower and toilet in what i can only call an airing cupboard. As we were only staying for one night we decided to make the best of it and went in search of a pub not to return until midnight. Considering how stinking/shabby everything looked we decided to pass on breakfast and checked out by 8.30am just to be out of there. So my advise to you is not to stay here - even on a budget you are being robbed as this place is surely a health hazard and should be closed down.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 19, 2006", "id": 5362433}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Corbigoe Hotel then...", "text": "I booked into this hotel primarily because this was the cheapest I could find in London and our New Zealand dollar (at that time) would only fetch 33 English pence.

My supposed en-suite room had the toilet along the corridoor and lots of people used it which meant it was dirty. The so called continental breakfast consisted of cornflakes and toast - not a huge selection. Overall the place needed a good clean and more towels!!
