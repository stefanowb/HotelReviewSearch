The location is terrific: close to shopping and the subway, and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from in the lively Bloor and Spadina area. (On the other hand, there are plenty of homeless people on the streets in this area, which means you are liable to be bothered for change every time you walk down Bloor.) The price for a room is very competitve given this hotel's downtown location. Check-in is always speedy and the long-time staff recognize me when I arrive, which is nice. I also like the parking garage: you don't need to take a ticket and there is always room on the first level (yes, at $22 a day, it is pricey, but everything in pricey in Toronto). For breakfast, I avoid the cafe connected to the lobby and head to Tim Hortons which is just down the street. The hotel has been refurbished over the years and my room is always clean. In 30 visits, I have never been bothered with noise from other guests.
