It was within walking distance so I didn't mind. the woman with whom I spoke promised to arrange for double Marriott points. Since I am an elite Marriott member I was pretty psyched about the offer. Having stayed in the Westin for one night, I checked with the front desk of Marriott to make sure that they had a roomf for me. The man I spoke to could not find my reservation although I provided the confirmation number. He had to get a manager to locate it and they informed me that I was only confirmed for one night -- not two. Regardless, they eventually found my reservation and, more importantly, a room for my second night. When I arrived in my room, it had a bit of an odor and it was very close to the elevator. It was a bit of a downgrade from the Westin. Although I've stayed in the Marriott Marquis many times over the years for various conferences, and find that it's a convenient hotel, I was a bit perturbed by the whole experience but nevertheless the double Marriott points I was promised were worth the hassle. Which leads to me to this review... I have called the Marriott twice and spent a good deal of time talking with several people about the points that were promised and never received. I was told that a manager would call me right away, but that was days ago. It seems that no one there knows what the other person does and reservations/confirmation numbers are lost.

The rooms are exactly the same as when we stayed in 2004 and despite paying extra for a room upgrade, the room we were given certainly was not 'superior' and the amenities felt like it was the entry level room type. Cleanliness of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired with the bathroom not cleaned to a satisfactory level (hair on the floor, dirty toilet). My main concern and disappointment came when upon leaving our room on two occasions I noticed one of the hotel cleaners styling her hair in a guest room with the hairdryer. Once the cleaner noticed me looking, she promptly pushed the door shut - makes you wonder what happens in your hotel room when you are not there. I found this service to be unacceptable and very unprofessional. On several occasions during our stay we also checked our bill for the room to review our charges and noted that the hotel had charged us for internet useage we had not used. We brought this up with the front desk on several occasions and it was not rectified until check out where we had to justify that it be removed as we had not used the service.
