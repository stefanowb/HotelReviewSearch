That's it, no top sheet (maybe this is an English thing, but I don't remember lacking a top sheet in other European hotels). The room was warm, but I was too cool with nothing and too warm with the comforter. Ugh, had to sleep with the window open, but it was only allowed to go up about 3 inches. The plumbing in the entire hotel was such that I had to flush 2 or 3 times to get \"everything\" to disappear. Again, this may be one of the things one needs to expect in a charming older property.

The breakfast offerings were good and plenty to please all. The food and drinks offered for meeting attendees in their break area was enjoyable -- LOVED the fresh squeezed OJ and the cookies! Both days for lunch, we were offered thin sandwiches, tiny salads (both days with fish on them, which many in our group did not care for, anchovies on the Caesar and tuna fish on a mixed green salad) along with meat kabobs and mini sausages. We all were longing for more salad and veggie offerings across lunch and dinner. I also wished they would replenish the water and glasses in the meeting room and would've left the fruit and desserts for us to enjoy for the afternoon, but they would whisk them away at the end of lunch.
