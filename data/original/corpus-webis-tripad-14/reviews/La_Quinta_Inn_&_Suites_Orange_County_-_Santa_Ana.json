Our only regret is that we should have stayed at La Quinta instead! The front desk was extremely friendly and prompt and the room was superb. The value is incredible and included a microwave and fridge along with their standard breakfast. Outstanding pool and spa facility and the grounds were immaculate. The front desk offers Disney tickets at a considerably reduced rate from the front gate, which was a plus for our son and his family who met us there. On our next visit to Disney we will definitely make this our home base. It is too far for a shuttle, but for the oustanding accomodations and great value, it is worth driving the 9 miles and parking in the Disney lot. Another winner La Quinta!

We left for the day, and returned to find our keys didn't work, went to To the front desk, and learned When our room was booked they only booked us for one night instead of the two we requested, they charged us over $30 more for the second night, and suggested we take it up with the manager the next day. Spoke with the mgr the next morning and was told that we didn't have proof that we scheduled 2 nights with them and there was nothing they could do. This after, not checking out after the first day and leaving all of our stuff in the room? Wouldn't that be proof we were to be there the second night?
