However, everything else was booked so I didn't have much choice. I was very pleasantly surprised. Although it is obviously old, the room was clean, the bed comfortable and and the amenities satisfactory. It's not the Ritz but, for $90, what do you expect. The continental breakfast is very basic - just danish and coffee. It's very convenient to Highway 49 and not far from the main part of town. The only negative - I had my dog with me and there was really no good place to walk her.", "title": "Basic but good", "user": "crosswycke", "date": "September 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 140453261}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "we came from redding Ca. to Grass Valley, a place we love.

When you drive up you can tell it's an older building, but it's well-maintained and has lots of charm. You can tell that someone put a lot of work into the garden, the pool is clean and open, and the breakfast patio area was so pretty. The breakfast was modest and simple but did the trick. It's free, afterall. And the price of our room was very affordable. We stayed in one of the theme rooms- I forgot what they called it but it was cute! Reminded me of a movie from the 50s or something! Anyway, the front desk ladies were kind of professional. Overall I approve!

But when we got there that was a whole different story. The people stared at us like we were from a different planet ? And the office staff seem over worked and didn't know what they were doing? The room looked like it was dirty and the bath towels were well? I didn't want to use them? And the airconditioner keep failing on us? And the refer wasn't working. Also, we tried to go to sleep at 10:30 on saturday night and there were smokers out side our room the NON SMOKING ROOM and talking loud and using foul words and our kids heard the bad words and we couldn't go to sleep because they were so loud. I peeked my head out the door for a second time and said something to the people who were talking loud, They said \"sorry\" and went in a few minutes later. The next day we got up got dressed hated to take a shower cause we had to use their towels, but we couldn't get out fast enough. My daughter and I went to check out gave the staff person the key and she said thanks, turned around and said nothing else and she looked at us like \"you can go\" and the breakfast table was empty, the guy who was suppose to set up the table walked right by and did nothing and seem as if he didn't care? I care enough to send this information to tell you as a traveler beware of where you stay really do your research before you enter into a hotel.
