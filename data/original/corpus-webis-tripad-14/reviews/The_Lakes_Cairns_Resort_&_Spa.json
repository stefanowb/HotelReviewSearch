I was a little worried reading some reviews about resort noise, aircraft noise etc. OK, some planes fly over during the daytime. But they are not that noisy & most of the people complaining about them presumably flew into Cairns on a plane! The resort is near the centre, so it is also near the airport making for very short & pleasant transfer times! We had a room opposite the bistro bar & were never disturbed by any noise from that. The resort itself is amazing - beautiful pools & so clean & perfectly maintained. There are a couple of blocks with no lift, so I would suggest contacting them prior to arrival if that would bother you. We had staff take our luggage to our room & back to reception when we left, even though we had a lift. The reception staff could not have been more helpful, calling to book trips for us from our brochures, advising us (very accurately!) on the best days for snorkelling due to the weather conditions - we arrived at the end of a cyclone. You get options of daily or weekly cleaning - we only wanted weekly but had daily charged by mistake but it was very easily resolved. The restaurant food & wine was excellent quality & the courtesy bus into Cairns was efficient. It's not a very long walk, maybe 20-30 mins, but you wouldn't get a resort that size with all the pools etc right in the centre. Taxis we found were very cheap (approx A$12) & reception will book those for you, also easy to find in town to get back again. Great pool & beach areas for kids, would be better if there were a few more sun loungers. If elderly, not sure how you would climb from one pool area to another.
