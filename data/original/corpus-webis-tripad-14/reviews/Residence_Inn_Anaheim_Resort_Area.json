Well my kids were in heaven. The breakfast's in the morning were delicious. Try having the potatoes with cheese sauce on top and green onions. My husbands favorite. This is the perfect hotel to stay if you are travelling with children. They show movies on Thursday nights, and every evening from 5pm till 7pm they have a snack or you can call it supper if you like. While we were there we only caught it a couple of times as we were usually at the park until it closed.
