Flight got cancelled by US Air at the last minute at 7:30 p.m. at Westchester County Airport. They suggested La Quinta (which has a free shuttle, and will come if you call them). The hotel is about 5 minutes from the airport. The hotel was just fine. Great water pressure in the shower, a quite large room with two double beds, good tv reception and channel choices. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel. Marc Charles, I think. They do have room service (or I should say, they will deliver to your room. You cannot charge it to your hotel bill. You must either pay cash when delivered or give them your credit card number to bill. I must say the restaurant is rather pricey. Much more than what you would expect attached to a La Quinta. I think my cheeseburger was $13 approx. After thinking about it, then I realized why. This, I believe, is basically a \"business\" hotel for traveling business people and is set in a corporate park environment so hence the higher prices at the restaurant. I'm sure most meals there are invoiced off by business people. I must say the burger was very good though. Nice, thick, juicy and cooked perfectly. Since I was only there for one night, hard to comment on more, but what I saw and experienced was just fine. Comfy bed, good a.c./heating, etc. When checking in I also told them I needed a ride back to the airport the following morning and I took the 8 a.m. shuttle which got there right away. Tipped the driver a couple of bucks. All in all, a good experience. Would recommend. Oh! One heads up! Upon trying to check into the room the first time with the card key, the door would not open even though the green light flashed. Went back to the front desk (which was a walk from our room). Clerk said insert the card and lift the handle UP. Voila! Who knew?!
