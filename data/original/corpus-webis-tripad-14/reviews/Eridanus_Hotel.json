Our pleasant stay there was due mainly to our room, No. 501, which is on the top floor with rooms (the hotel's restaurant, Parea, is above, on the roof), and which has a large outdoor patio with a dining table and a terrific view of the Acropolis. The highlight of our stay was having a simple dinner (including french fries among the best I've had) from Parea on our patio where we enjoyed the privacy, the warm evening air, and the view of the Acropolis. This opportunity alone recommends the Eridanus. Our room was spacious and clean, and included a large flat-screen television, and the service and complimentary breakfast were very good. The drawbacks were that the hotel did not offer a public computer with access to the Internet (although Wi-Fi was available to those who brought their own computer); its location on a noisy street (although in No. 501 noise from the street was slight); and its distance of several minutes by foot from both the Metro and the area around the Acropolis.
