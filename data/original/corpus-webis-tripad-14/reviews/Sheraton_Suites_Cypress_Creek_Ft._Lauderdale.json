Lauderdale", "reviews": [{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Somewhat disappointed", "text": "I stayed for 2 nights in this property with husband, 2 kids and in-laws. The reason I chose the hotel is, according to the description I saw on Sheraton Website, this is a two room suite and has a living ( with pull out sofa) and dining area. This should be perfect for us and of course its the Sheraton. The location is very convenient to the downtown area, walking distance to different restaurants. The negative thing was, its also near a railway. You can definitely hear the train when it passes by. The lobby was nice and clean and they have christmas decoration up already. The check in process I experienced was not good. There is only one agent in the counter and I have to wait for a couple of minutes. I asked the agent if what type of bedding do they have for the rooms. Thats when I learned that it is only a one bedroom suite with a separate living area or should I say a separate living room with pull out sofa. That according to the front agent is considered a two room suite, one bedroom and one living room equals to two rooms. I was so disappointed. How can I explain to my in laws that they will not sleep on a bed but on a pullout sofa? Well, I dont have a choice but to accept whatever they have.Then check in was done, I asked for assistance for my luggage. I waited for again a couple of minutes, cant ask the agent coz he is talking to another guest and then I waited waited..then I saw my husband outside waving for me to go outside. We end up just carrying all our things to our room without any help from the hotel staff.", "user": "mommy77", "date": "December 4, 2007", "id": 11244939}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Newly Renovated Hotel", "text": "The room interior is beautiful, new carpet, furnitures, two flat screen tv's, small dining table which seats four, miniref and microwave, very very small bathroom and bath tub ( had a hard time giving the kids a bath).

When we came back they said it was fixed, well it was worse, it was midnight we were tired so they moved us to another room. When we arrived at the other room it was nice and cool, the AC was very noisy. This was the final straw, we get into bed and all of a sudden we here a train right outside our window.
