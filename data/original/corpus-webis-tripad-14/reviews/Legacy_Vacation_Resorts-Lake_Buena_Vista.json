It was 3 bedroom, 2 baths both with jacuzzi, full kitchen and 1/2 kitchen, living room, dining area. We had 2 temp controls for either the master or guest side of the unit. Grounds were nicely landscaped. Unit was clean with all amenities as expected. Very jazzy miirrored master bedroom with walk in jacuzzi. Centrally located (almost across the street from Disney World entrance). My only disappointment was the pool. It was rather small but since it wasn't crowded there were really no problems. It was clean and well maintained. If you have an opportunity you will not be disappointed. There are no eating establishments on premises though.", "title": "Pleasant surprise", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Fly_the_world", "date": "September 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117839293}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "This was a last minute vacation (to see Mickey) and didn't expect much. But it was clean, roomy, and had a super master bedroom! The 2nd bath was big enough for the two teenagers and the two under-10's. (One drawback was the pull-out couch/bed in the third bedroom. The young kids were fine on it, but if an adult had to sleep there, they would not be happy.) The kitchen had all the amenities and was big which was nice with the large living room. TV's in all 3 bedrooms and new towels and linens everyday if we asked. The pool was nice -- but not great and the hot tub was was more like a warm tub, lol, but served its purpose. The \"playground\" was quite small, but we didn't have time to even think about using it.", "title": "Great value.

Had originally booked a mini suite, asked to upgrade to a 1 bdrm suite for only 15$ more a might. So worth it!!! Our room is recently remodeled, and quite nicely done with full kitchen, stackable washer/dryer which saves on expenses. Very clean & new, so no complaints. Recepcion was very nice & very patient even though we wanted to change rooms. Very, very pleased. Ample space for a family of 4 staying for a week.
