The resort relies on non-All Inclusive guests using a pre-paid card system for buying drinks, snacks etc. You top up the card with a minimum of \u20ac5 to start and you can add to this as you go along. Bar staff debit the card as you buy. Any unused amount is paid back to you at the end of your stay. For some reason they will only accept cash to top up the card - couldn't use credit cards etc. Given the location of the Arenella resort, they could exploit guests by over-charging for drinks and snacks but they don't.
