Another reviewer noted that the map is wrong and that was very good advice because the traffic arrangements around there are complicated to say the least.

You do need a car if you stay at this hotel in my opinion. Verona is just over an hour away and well worth a visit. The hotel is only a little over half an hour from Treviso airport. We saw Aida in the Roman Arena in Verona and even if you don't like Opera it is well worth the experience to see it. If you do and you have a car make sure that you park in the Arena Car Park and get there before 6.30 pm or you will have terrible trouble parking. Lake Garda is little further on and is lovely.

The restaurant has decent food and reasonable prices although the town of Padova has some very nice restaurants. If we go back to this part of Italy this hotel would be our top choice.
