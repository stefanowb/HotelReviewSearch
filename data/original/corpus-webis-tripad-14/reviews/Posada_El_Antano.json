The inn is very small, only about 10 rooms. Obviously a converted house, with all the guest rooms off a small courtyard in the rear of the building. The lobby, reading room and guest rooms were all decorated in good taste with charm, very rustic feeling with lots of candles. Our room was comfortable and generally clean with twin beds. We would have preferred a king - we saw some of the other rooms that looked great - but they were sold out so we had to stay put. All the rooms have windows that look out into the courtyard, so if you are looking for privacy, you might want to keep this in mind. Also, our shower could have been updated, it was the only part of the experience I would say was barely satisfactory. There was filtered water dispenser in courtyard which was great to have access to, I used it alot. Breakfast in the dining room was basic, eggs and rolls and I forget what else. Overall, it has such great ambiance, the hotel felt very true to the charm of Antigua and was within short walk to everything. I would definitely recommend!", "title": "Charming little place!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "CA_Ski_Mom", "date": "January 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6693144, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Rustic charm, nicely decorated, short walk to everything - 2-3 blocks off main square.", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of privacy (although not an issue for us), shower could stand to be updated."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2004, traveled on business", "text": "I've been to Antigua 5 times in as many years and came upon the Posada El Antano by accident. I should have accidents like this more often. A true hidden gem, I love this hotel! it's about a 5 block walk to the park. Clean, very secure, wonderful staff and the free breakfast of pancakes, eggs, coffee and orange juice is a nice way to start the day. The rooms are a nice size with king, 2 full size, and even 3 twins available. Also a honeymoon suite with canopy bed. The TV's are small but who's watching TV anyway. They have a living room type area with great photo books and a bigger TV. Nice way to meet other travelers. Relax on your off time on the rooftop terrace with views of the volcanos puffing clouds of smoke into the mountains.", "title": "Best kept secret in Antigua", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "smokemon", "date": "November 6, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4089927}], "location": {"country": "Guatemala", "region": "Sacatepequez Department", "continent": "Central America", "city": "Antigua"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 4, "very good": 9, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 15}, "aka": "Posada El Antano Antigua Guatemala", "slim_ranking": 0.633802816901, "description": "Posada El Anta\u00f1o is a boutique hotel located in the heart of Antigua Guatemala.
