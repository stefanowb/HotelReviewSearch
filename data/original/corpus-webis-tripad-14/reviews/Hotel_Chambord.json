To start with the positive things, I found the staff very friendly and helpful. Written information said wifi would cost, but actually it was given for free (24 hrs) once you got an access code form the front desk. And it worked perfectly. About location, the hotel is ideally situated between the EU offices in the Troon area and downtown Brussels. A metro entrance is just outside the hotel door, so very convenient. My room on the fifth floor was clean, with a little veranda, and a nice view of Brussels. This would have been excellent in summer, but it was winter and it was cold. The little heater could not at all keep the room warm when the temperature went below zero. Another negative was the water pressure in the bathroom. Maybe because it was the fifth floor, water was only trickling slowly out of the tap, making a shower a demanding task. But it stayed warm as long as I showered. A colleague experienced cold water only after a few minutes. Another colleague complained about the smell of sewer in the room. There is no minibar, so if you get thirsty, you have to go down to the ground floor with the miniature elevator and find the vending machine having a limited variety of drink options. The breakfast was good, although the access from the ground floor was up through a steep and twisted staircase.

I was here on business but added the weekend which is when I stayed here. As my wife didn't come I wanted somewhere cheap but central and the Chambord matched that description perfectly. I had a single room on the 7th floor which was very small but met my needs. A warning for anyone with heavy bags though - the lift only goes up to 6. The only thing which didn't suit me was the fact that the bar was closed for the weekend. Breakfast was included in the price and on the Saturday I was down fairly soon after opening and all was well. However, on Sunday I had a bit of a lie in and got down later. There was no coffee, no juice, no cheese, no knives and no croissants. When the coffee machine returned there was a bit of a stampede and so I waited for it to pass rather than queue - bad move, When I went up the cups were gone! However, the cheese was restored as was the juice, although the glasses were gone now. Eventually I got a glass and a cup and felt a bit more cheerful but the croissants were never refilled. I don't mean to criticise the girls who were doing their best. They were simply overwhelmed. Maybe they need a more efficient dishwasher so that the girls can concentrate on keeping the food supply flowing. I don't want to finish on a negative note. The staff were very polite and helpful and they were probably the finest asset of the hotel.", "user": "AJMacD", "date": "November 5, 2012", "id": 144622803}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointing", "text": "I have been accommodated in the hotel from October 25 till October 28 (3 nights) in a single room on the seventh floor.
