The staff were friendy and attentive and went out of their way to locate us in a quiet pleasant spot. The choice was reasonable and the prices were fair. I had a tasty duck egg in cream sauce with chorizo for a starter and chicken breast with dauphinoise potatoes for main course. My wife had sea food for starter and a generous portion of pork belly for main. All were well cooked and tasty. Service was efficient if not rapid, but we were happy to take a bit of time.
