The first problem was the lift - there was not enough room for me (small), my husband (tall,blocky) and 1 small suitcase - we had to squash in! We travelled downward to the basement area. Our room was tiny - a very small double bed pushed right up to the ensuite wall. There was a two foot aisle left in the room! The view from the window was diagonally opposite the neighbouring window and was surrounded by a triangular concrete tunnel - there was daylight somewhere at the top! Extremely dungeon like. The ensuite was long and very narrow - bath/shower way too small and quite grubby. The TV had no english channels. The breakfast room has no daylight at all and a very small breakfast buffet.", "title": "Good overall value", "user": "GillHarman", "date": "March 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 7208118, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 A little out of the way of the centre"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007", "text": "This hotel was recommended by a friend who'd stayed there previously and it did not disappoint.
