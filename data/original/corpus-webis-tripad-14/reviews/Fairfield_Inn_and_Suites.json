After complaining that the size of the room was just not conducive for a family we were told they hear that a lot and sorry but they were catering to more \"business class guest\". We left for the day to return around 6pm to a room that had not even been touched by housekeeping. We did however receive clean towels when we went to the front desk to ask for them. If we had been told that up front it would be very tight quarters for a family of 5 we would have chosen a different hotel.

I'm glad I did! The hotel was modest, the room small (as with most Fairfield Inns), and finding the place was difficult since it had no sign visable from the highway. But the place was squeeky clean, everything was fresh, the staff was extremely helpful and gracious, the breakfast bar was one of the best I've encountered, and overall our stay here was excellent. I even asked upon leaving if the hotel had just been built. Surprize; it was several years old! Parking is only on one end of the building. Our room overlooked a 4-lane road though it carried little traffic and was quiet at night. Something else about the breakfast bar: the variety was great, and it was GOOD FOOD!

Location wise, it's conveniently just down the road from Fort Gordon but there's not much around besides the gas station next door. It seems like the hotel is new or newly renovated compared to most other Fairfield Inns that I've stayed in. The rooms and bathrooms are decent sized with flatscreen TVs. My only complaint was that my room's carpeting and linens felt a bit moist/damp. I think it might have had something to do with me being in an end room and the summer heat mixing with the air conditioning. There was free popcorn each evening which I prefer to the free cookies that a lot of hotels do. The continental breakfast is also the best that I've ever seen in a Marriott property.

He is very good, and travels to tournaments across the state of Georgia. This time we were in Augusta, and rather than brave the almost three hour drive back to Warner Robins, we elected to stay the night. I picked this hotel because it is a Fairfield, and I have stayed at them before, and have always been impressed, and this one was no different. This Fairfield is relatively new, and it shows. Very clean, very updated and modern. It is right off the highway, so it is easy to find. My GPS found it easily. We chose this Fairfield location because it was close to the Augusta Tournament Center where my son had his tourney. The location is okay...there are not a lot of eating establishments nearby, except for at the Augusta Mall, which at Christmas time is a mad house. There is nothing close to the hotel. We drove up at about eleven thirty am, and asked if we could check in early. The lady at the front desk on this day, the 11th of December was outstanding! Very friendly, professional, and classy! Terrific service! The housekeeping lady we met in the elevator was a sweetheart too, very friendly and amicable. Great employees! We were offered a handicap room, as it was the only room available that was clean at that early hour. The room was bigger than a standard room, which was nice..the bathroom was huge! The room seemed clean, although there was a white hanger underneath the chair in the corner...there were no bags in the trash cans which I thought was odd, but hey, whatever makes it easier, I guess. One thing that I find troubling with Fairfield's of late...is the lack of a refrigerator or microwave in the 'suites'. Actually, both are expected and found in bargain rooms I have stayed at. Even the \"West Bank Inn\" in downtown Augusta has them both, and that is a Mom and Pop motel. I think a refrigerator should be STANDARD in a hotel of this class. Hilton Garden Inns have them, and that is Fairfield's main competitor. I get tired of having to go for ice that melts in less than an hour...a cool drink out of the fridge would be a nice thing to have. The rooms are very quiet for a hotel. The doors are very heavy, and when they shut, they slam! We were so worried about disturbing other guests, but it is the way the door is set up, it is made to slam at the last six inches. Something with the shock absorber. One thing Fairfield needs to think about, something that the Hilton Garden Inns have done, is use dispensers in the shower for shampoo, creme rinse and body soap. It makes it more hygienic when staying with more than a spouse, and it is less messy and you actually have enough shampoo for the entire group! This hotel is a smoke free/pet free hotel which gets a huge atta boy from me! I despise cigarettes, and while I have pets at home, I don't like pets in my hotel rooms, and prefer a pet free stay. Great rules, Marriott! Love it. Overall, this is a really nice property, you will feel very safe and secure, the rooms are clean and acceptable, the employees are terrific, and the rates are reasonable. What more could you want! A great place to sleep.
