We have always been happy to come back - until this time. The apartment we were given P242 was in the furthest block - it was right next to the main road to Morro Jable, which for a small place has traffic backward and forwards 24 hours a day! It sounded like being on the M1! The apartment balcony had absolutely no view whatsoever except for some tree branches. The bedrooms looked out onto the space that is used for the hotel's rubbish. This meant that if the bin wagon hadn't woken us up at 5.00 a.m. on it's regular visit, the workmen from the apartments refilling the rubbish bins from 7.30 would have - not the sound of their work but their very loud conversations outside the window as they stopped for a ciggie break. (why do the Spanish always have to shout at each other???) None of this made for a relaxing night's sleep. In addition, the room was not cleaned ONCE during our stay, neither were the sheets changed. Towels were placed in the room each day but were just left there (the dirty ones werent taken away!) so we were left with about 15 towels in the room by the end of the week!!!! The cooking utensils etc.. and general state of the room were grubby.", "title": "Our last visit to this place!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "hesketh27", "date": "December 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 23134140, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 lack of cleanliness in apartment"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "After being happy previously, we are upset to see this place go downhill like this. Talk about the block of apartments that was forgotten! We can't even say that this treatment was reserved for the British because we had German & Scandinavian neighbours who got similalry poor treatment. A German customer satisfaction questionnaire had been left on our table from the previous week & the criticisms were damning (I speak Greman). When we first read it at the start of the holiday we thought it was hyper critical - by the end of the week we agreed with everything written. Jandia is a lovely relaxing resort, miles away from the awful 'British' resorts of the north of the island, so we will go back - not to the Sol Jandia Mar however.

We only ate twice at the hotel. The breakfast was quite good value but not exceptional. The other meal was a BBQ by the pool which was tasty and good value.
