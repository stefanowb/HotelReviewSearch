The location was great ,near everything. If you take a local bus it is an inexpensive way to see Granada, we took one up to St. Nicholas church for a fabulous view of the Alhambra and Granada then walked back into town. Parking expensive, but it was more convenient than trying to find parking. Breakfast expensive so we ate local. Watch out for the gypsies near the cathedral. Use the free wifi in the lobby.

Upon arrival, he confirmed the transportation, made couple of reservations for dinner, and was very, very helpful. The rooms that we were given were excellent. They were all in the convent section, immaculately renovated. My husband loved the terrace that came with it. The two things that dampened my satisfaction was: the first morning, there was a bit group at the breakfast and the service was much to be desired. Coffee pot was never refilled. By second morning, the group was gone, and we had a civilized breakfast. Second night (June 8th), there was party at the terrace until after midnight. You know how Spanish people talk!
