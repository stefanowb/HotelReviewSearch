I had traveled there with my wife to pick up our daughter who was in the area for a summer program. We intended to travel around the area to see some colleges and then grab some fresh lobster just over the border in Maine. We did not want to stay in the city as our flight left from Providence and the location of this hotel would shave at least 20 minutes off of our trip to the Providence airport. The Marriott was a great alternative to a City Hotel. It was a modern clean hotel off of the interstate, albeit in an office park in the not so exciting city of Quincy. Nevertheless, we just needed a clean place to sleep that had easy access to the highways. The Quincy Marriott was the perfect answer. Of course, for the most part, you will need a car unless you want to get a ride to the nearby T Station which I probably would not recommend using at night. Parking was free and the buffet breakfast was fresh and reasonably priced assuming it is not included in your room rate.
