For the money, Rio Selva is a good choice. It is simple, comfortable, older property with limited amenities, but better than a typical hostel. The few rooms are large, have aircon, a ceiling fan, and TV. The owners are very friendly and nice. The queen-size bed was comfortable, but I think anyone over about 6 feet tall will find it short. Rio Selva is located on a quiet edge of the town where you can hear birds in the morning. It is about a 15 minute walk into the center where the restaurants and shopping are, though the hotel next door (Los Troncos) has a very good restaurant. This hotel has a small outdoor pool, which is a treat on a hot day. Wherever you stay in Iguazu, if the weather is warm, choose a place with a pool. You'll be glad you did.", "title": "Good, basic accommodations", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Massimo1", "date": "December 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121396950}], "location": {"country": "Argentina", "region": "Litoral", "continent": "South America"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 3, "very good": 4, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 0.342105263158}
