The rooms were clean, the kitchen was beautiful, and Robbert and Ellen were as gracious and accommodating as they could be. We did not dive behind the hotel, mainly because of the boat traffic, but several other guests did and said it was a great spot. I don't know any dive sites on Bonaire that are not great. The dive locker on site was very convenient, as were the outdoor showers. The grounds were well maintained and housekeeping came every day. Just a very lovely spot - we would most definitely stay here again. Good food at Bistro de Paris and Sunset Cafe.
