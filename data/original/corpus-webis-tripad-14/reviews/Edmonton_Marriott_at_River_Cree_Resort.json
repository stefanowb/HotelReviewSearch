We got an excellent deal for rates which was equal too a far less rated hotel than the Marriott. It is about a 5 min drive from the mall using the 178th st. entrance. They do offer free shuttle bus which runs about 19hrs / day every 1/2 hour to and from the mall also. We had a double room on the second floor which was just down from the pool. Front desk told me all 2nd floor have fridges in the rooms, In assume there were other floors with the same. Also a nice large LCD T.V in the room. Beds very soft as well. Right from the door greater to the staff passing in the halls, they were all very friendly. The room was very clean and they were quick to accomodate you with any requests. We had requested a feather free bed and it was feathers when we arrived. Within minutes 3 maids were there and stripped the beds and re-made them feather free. We never tried any of the dinning options at the resort but they all looked very nice. The place smells marvelous, it is also only 2 years old. The day we left Mr. Donald Trump and his sweatheart were to be checking in for a stay while in meetings in Edmonton. Also Mr. Marriott is to be arriving next week also, his first stay at the hotel. I would not hesitate to stay here again and i would highly recomend that anyone stay here. The only downside is you have that drive to and from the mall or dinning if you venture out, but you would have to drive the same from any other hotel near the mall.
