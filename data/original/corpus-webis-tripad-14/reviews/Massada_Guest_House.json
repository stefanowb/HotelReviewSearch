This hostel is freshly renovated just some month ago. A very nice place, the rooms are clean and equipped with big bathroom, water boiler, fridge, air con and three-chanel-TV. The food is tasty, there\u00b4s no snackbar or something around, so you have to eat dinner in the hostel. You have internet access to moderate prices. Staff at the reception is very friendly, provides you with bus plans and packed breakfast if you ask for it. Unfortunately the huge swimming pool in the garden is not used, at least in the moment.", "title": "Nice place to stay", "user": "Christiane_80", "date": "April 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14748493, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 climbing up Massada early in the morning", "disliked": "\u2014 swimming pool is not in use"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Stayed here for 1 night in September 2011 with my husband en route from Jerusalem to Eilat. I chose the property based on its proximity to Massada, which is about a two minute walk from the front door of the hostel. Check in was very easy and we were allowed to check in early which I appreciated. You can pay in either shekels or dollars but the rate they charge is in dollars if you book on the internet. The property itself is really stunning. It looks more like a hotel than a hostel. The grounds are very nice and expansive. There's a great deck that overlooks the Dead Sea which is a great place to hang out at during the evening. The only thing that actually makes this a hostel is the rooms, which are bare bones and no frills, though very clean. Our room had a tv, air con, beautiful view of the Dead Sea, 2 beds plus a bunk bed, a mini fridge, small table and separate toilet and shower stall in the bathroom. The beds were comfortable enough, but certainly not luxurious. We didn't use the pool since it closes rather early, but it looked very nice. The breakfast was really a treat; a plentiful buffet of eggs, hummus, salad, breads, cereal, fruit and a variety of beverages. The property also has a small snack bar that sells popcicles, ice cream and other treats, but other than that there is no food available for purchase anywhere near the property. Unless you have a car, this isn't the most easily accessed hostel. We had a rental car and found the drive into the resort area to take about 15 minutes. There's plenty of food and shopping in that area as well as the best beach for soaking in the Dead Sea. The front desk staff was very friendly and super informative and told us the best time to wake up to hike to Massada. We woke up a little late so in an effort to see the sunrise, we did a pretty brisk hike up the mountain which took about 35-40 minutes. If you're in good shape, it won't take you an hour to do the hike. If your objective is to experience the splendor of Massada, you should definitely stay here. It's also the cheapest place to stay in the Dead Sea and a tremendously good value at $100/night, including breakfast.", "title": "Nicest Hostel I've Stayed In", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "November 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120639675}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hostel is right at the base of Massada.
