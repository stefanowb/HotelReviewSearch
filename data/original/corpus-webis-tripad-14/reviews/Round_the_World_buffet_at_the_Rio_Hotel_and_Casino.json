Well 1st off its almost 90 bux for two. What happened to cheap las vegas buffets? 2nd the all you can eat lobster which is what I was looking forward to, is the size of a craw dad and had absolutely no taste to them. I said ok, I'll try other stuff which was mostly fried food. Not worth the money or time. Go elsewhere!!!!
