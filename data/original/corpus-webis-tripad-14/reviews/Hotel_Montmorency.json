It was our 4th visit in the last 5 years and it is still as wonderful. This year we went for the magnificent Bastille Day celebrations - a night to remember. It isn't the cheapest place in Carcassonne, but you couldn't find a better location being right outside the walls of La Cite. The spa is a new addition since our last visit which means i'll probably be tempted there out of season too now that there is an indoor pool as well as the beautiful outdoor one. This trip we stayed in room 21 - lovely view from the garden area but as other reviewers have said the room is on the small side but for us and for a few days it is big enough. My parents had room 28 which was bigger and had a fabulous bathroom but no view of La Cite - always a compromise!! The entrance area of the Montmorency has been totally transformed since our last visit and I do think the rooms need a bit of a facelift now too. However, the gardens, pool area and communal areas are beautiful. It is a real hotel, staffed by real people with personality who know how to look after their guests and that's what makes this hotel so special. I have no doubt that I will be back again next year.", "title": "Our 4th visit and it just gets better.", "user": "juliemtalbot", "date": "July 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115400665}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Decent enough choice", "text": "We stayed here for one night, and like others, found the room incredibly small.
