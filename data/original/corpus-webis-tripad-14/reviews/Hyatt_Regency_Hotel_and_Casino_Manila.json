Never had any kind of problem with anyone. I'm glad I stayed in old Manila vs. the newer Makati area. I really got a feel for the city. If you are the type that needs to be sheltered from the harsher realities of life, then Makati might be a better fit for you. It's nice and new and shiney. In Manila, you will walk down very crowded dirty streets, little naked street kids will beg you for change while rubbing their bellies indicating they are hungry, you'll be offered watches, old american collectible coins, viagra, very persistently (just smile, say no thank you and keeping walking). I made the trip a few blocks to Robinsons Galleria Mall every day and a few blocks in the other direction every night to the Baywalk and never once felt at risk for anything. But like anywhere else, be smart and stay alert. Be very careful crossing the streets, and try not to have a cornary when riding in a taxi, it doesn't look like it , but they do know what they are doing. Just let go. If you take a taxi from the Hyatt, security will write down the taxi's information and where you are going. Everything is so cheap there. Man, is it hot!
