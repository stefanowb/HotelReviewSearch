We really liked the atmosphere of the hotel, it didn\u2019t felt outdated for us. We had some drinks in the excellent maritime bar. Our room was as expected very good. But our positive feeling changed at 11 pm when very loud music started somewhere in the hotel. I called the reception where I got the confirmation there was a party in the hotel ballroom. The person I got on the phone seemed to be annoyed with the situation and asked if we wanted some earplugs \u2026 when I insisted how loud the music was he said he would ask to turn the volume down which actually happened after 10 minutes, I fell asleep but my wife said she still heard some music later in the night. I have to say I was seriously disappointed and I rather felt I was in a 2star hotel somewhere in Ibiza but not in the Hilton. Next day the breakfast was very nice and the personnel at checkout were concerned about what happened last night they did apologize and did a commercial gesture which was very well appreciated.

The hotel itself is in a stunning building. The restaurant and lobby look fantastic but when you get down to the service, there's a lot of room for improvement. We booked the weekend on the Hilton website and got a special weekend deal so when we checked in, we were surprised and pleased to be told by the receptionist that breakfast was included. I asked for the Wi fi password and was told that Wi Fi was charged at \u20ac5 per hour or \u20ac15 per day. In my experience, the vast majority of hotels in Europe offer free Wi Fi. We didn't avail of the service. The room was fine. During the night, it was oppressively hot and airless and we had to put the air conditioning on to sleep. The bed was reasonably comfortable but the pillows were not. Breakfast was a decent buffet with a good variety but nothing exceptional. When I joined my boyfriend at our table one of the mornings and asked for coffee, the waiter removed an almost empty coffee pot from the table he was clearing and used it to half fill my cup before leaving me the empty pot and disappearing. On checking out, we discovered that the cost of breakfast had been added to our bill after all. We queried this and were told that on no circumstances could this have been included in our rate. After much discussion, the hotel agreed to remove half the charge from the bill as a gesture of good will but we were still left with a bad taste in our mouths. We wouldn't normally bother with breakfast and certainly wouldn't have bothered had we known we'd be charged for it. We left our luggage for a few hours after checking out and when we returned to collect it, I went to use the loo in the lobby before leaving and discovered you had to either use your room card to get in, or contact reception to get them to open it. That's the kind of thing you expect in a cut price establishment, not in a Hilton. We travel to Antwerp a couple of times per year and normally stay in a different hotel in the Diamond district. The location is not so great but service is much nicer and the rooms bigger, roomier and more comfortable for 75% of the cost.
