It is in a good central location (although Prague is not big so most hotels are reasonably located) near the Charles bridge. The service is wonderful and they have perfected the art of knowing who you are without even asking! I had a room in the older part of the hotel (dating back to the late 1800s) which had high ceilings and a genuine Bohemian chandelier - a really delightful spacious room with all the facilities you would expect in a top hotel. The bar is equally welcoming and cosy. I did not make it to the gym but apparently that was small but first rate. So there is nothing to fault it. The issue is simply one of price. There are a lot of good hotels where you are paying 100-200 euros a night. So if you are going to pay 375 euros a night (including continental breakfast) it gives some pause for thought. Incidentals are similarly priced. 75cl bottle of water $10. I was here on business. If I come back with my family I would like to stay here but I will be seeking a cheaper option. Other people may well feel you get what you pay for.

It was a very hot evening in Prague, and the whole city seemed to be partying. Obviously this also meant a great demand for police and ambulance vehicles that all moved along the street on which the hotel is situated. Since I had a room facing the street the signal horns were a bit disturbing. If I were to choose this hotel for a very special private trip I would definitely book a room not directly facing the street (although they do have double-glazed windows but I can imagine it is difficult to install windows of the highest sound-proofing class because of the irregular window shapes in the attic).", "title": "Just short of perfect", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ilangelo", "date": "June 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 165016566}], "location": {"country": "Czech Republic", "region": "Bohemia", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Prague"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 22, "very good": 85, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 395}, "aka": "4 Seasons Hotel Prague", "slim_ranking": 0.0357142857143, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}}
