There was little or no noise at night so we slept very well and breakfast was served until a decent time in the morning so no early mornings.

The hotel itself is, as the name suggests, all about art, and the unique rooms are great fun with colourful murals and fun features. The room we stayed in was a good size, and the bathroom was super funky with a decent shower. There's a few details about the place which prevents it from being up there with the best - our room, although perfectly clean, had a bit of damp on the outside wall and peeling paint - there were also no curtains, just a blind, which the brief early morning sunshine easily managed to penetrate.
