It must be said though that the city of Trento does not offer that many hotels to begin with. It is primarily an important University town and is often overlooked by tourists, hence the infrastructure for visitors is not as well developed as say, Milan, Venice, Florence or even Verona. Despite that, we decided to stay for 2 nights in Trento as it provides an ideal base to explore the Trentino region of Italy and the Italian Alps.", "title": "Terrible experience in this hotel!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SingaporeGuy10", "date": "November 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 120377181}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel provides a basement garage for cars which it charges 28 Euros per day per car.", "title": "Superb", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "EuropeFF", "date": "November 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120221763}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Firstly, the reception staff.

We chose Trento as it was perfectly in the middle between Pisa and Munich so broke up our journey nicely. The only thing I wish we'd done now is booked longer as Trento is such a lovely little town! I will definitely be coming back! The hotel was what I call a proper hotel - we had been staying at small B&B's throughout our trip whereas this was a big hotel, and quite fancy! I didn't expect it to look like it did, despite seeing pictures. It had quite a luxurious feel to it. The room was a pretty good size and of a really high standard. The bathroom was also very nice and modern, and quite big. Everything was spotlessly clean and tidy. The location was great, about a 5 min walk from the centre so really useful.
