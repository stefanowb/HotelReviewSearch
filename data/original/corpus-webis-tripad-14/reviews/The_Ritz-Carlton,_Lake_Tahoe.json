I wished we could have stayed longer than 2 days and 1 night. Our 13 month old daughter was with us and every employee here took their time to make her laugh and feel welcome as she walked all over the property. The club room here had great views, great food and drinks, and awesome service. It is a ski in, ski out property which is nice for all the skiers, you are basically steps away from the slopes. It also has a tram that takes you to the Village at NorthStar where there's shopping, restaurants, and an ice rink.

The Lake Tahoe Ritz is my 13th RC property and this rivaled any property in style and service. The only negatives, and they aren't specific to the Lake Tahoe property, are the exorbitant nightly valet fee ($35) and daily resort fee ($25.)
