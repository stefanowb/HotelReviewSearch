The chalet was well equipped with 2 bedrooms (king beds), kitchen, living area, separate toilet and bathroom.

It was clean and modestly equipped. The camp sites appeared somewhat cramped. The kitchen had appliances but inadequate fridge space and unfortunately no dishes (not even a can opener). The bathroom facilities were among the more outdated and lines seemed to form to take showers. We really enjoyed the mineral spas (guests get a discounted admission fee) and the pools are great \u2013 but beware the waterslide, it is no joke. The amoebic Meningitis warnings also did not seem particularly well displayed and were never enforced by the guards. Overall, facilities were not among the better we\u2019ve seen in NZ but would consider staying again for the water park and pools.", "user": "modkiwi", "date": "January 30, 2007", "id": 6715096}], "location": {"country": "New Zealand", "region": "North Island", "continent": "South Pacific", "city": "Taupo"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 25, "very good": 90, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 109}, "aka": "Taupo Debretts Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.352941176471, "description": "Choose to stay ahead of the game with our awesome Luxury Accommodation \u2013 self contained villas, lodges and spa chalets, providing an indulgent escape and complete with panoramic lake and mountain views.
