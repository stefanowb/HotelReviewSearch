I recall staying at the same establishment when it was a Roadway Inn two years ago and that was surely depressing..... dated and musty! The new owners have done a complete 360' with renovations.

The bedrooms were recently redone. They are beautiful and comfortable. On check in we were told that all though the bedrooms were redone they still had to get to the bathrooms (they just recently bought the hotel) so I was prepared for a subpar bathroom but found it was fine. Nothing wrong with the bathroom. The staff was very helpful in suggesting a great restaurant for dinner. The pool was a nice break from the rain we had while we were there. There is a nice playground out back and couple of charcoal grills for cooking. We really enjoyed the stay. My daughter was even able to work on a project for her summer classes as there is free WiFi and it worked well from our room. Like a previous guest mentioned, the one thing I would change was breakfast. There were two types of cold cereal with only whole milk. Very small, bite size muffins, donuts that had been frozen (still cold in the middle) and the make your own waffles. The waffles were great but one waffle maker for many people so it took a long time to get everyone through. I think they should add a second waffle maker and then have a better variety of bagels and bread with a toaster and maybe some fruit.", "title": "Great place, great price, nice people, breakfast not so good", "user": "MAtrigal", "date": "August 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37883793}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "The room was alot larger than I expected!
