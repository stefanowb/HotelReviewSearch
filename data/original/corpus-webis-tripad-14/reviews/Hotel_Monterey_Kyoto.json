No wi fi unfortunately but a cable to plug your lap top into - unfortunately we dont travel with a lap top. I wasnt going to write a review as I felt all other reviewers have said it all but felt I needed to pass on my experience. We were woken by the fire alarm at 2 O Clock in the morning with a voice saying there is a fire on the 8th floor please evacuate. It was a farce, all fire doors were looked - people half asleep panicked dragging their suitcases to the lift where there was a large queue of people trying to get out. When we got to the ground floor there was no assistance and the bemused night staff who didnt speak English and didnt appear bothered in the least - I assume they were not aware the alarm had gone off. As guests mingled in the lobby most of us decided it was a false alarm and went back up in the lifts. It was quite worrying as there was no advice and for all we know we might have been going back up in the lift to a fire. Later on we heard a fire engine in the background and voices in the corridor - assume it was the fire men checking out the building.

I paid $140 per room per night. Given how expensive things are in Japan, I thought it was a good value. But before I go any further, in the spirit of full disclosure I have to tell you about the decor. One of the TA reviewers described it as \"gothic\" but I'd call it more Disney Haunted House meets Vegas wedding chapel. This hotel serves as a \"church\" many times per week for weddings complete with a fake movie set-like sanctuary, alter, pews, etc.. The fake \"church\" is not hidden off on the third floor somewhere, no it is the first thing you see when you walk into the hotel. The rest of the main floor is black marble with recessed art and sculpture, and chandeliers that look just like Vegas to complete the \"castle\" look. But heck, for the price I was willing to overlook the decor. The positives about this hotel are many. The staff are extremely helpful and speak a reasonable amount of English (much better than my Japanese). The hotel is brand new and the furnishings are perfect. The beds are firm and comfortable and the linens are pristine. The bathrooms are perfect, new with all the gadgets. The rooms are small but adequate and the strange decor seems to stop at the first floor. The location is really convenient. From the Kyoto Station take the Karasuma line north 3 stops to the Karasume Oike station. Exit the South exit. Walk south, past the bookstore, past the Starbucks, and another 1/2 block and you are at the hotel. I had wanted to stay at the Hotel Granvia at the Kyoto station but found it too expensive. But in retrospect, the Monterey is a much better location. We spent the Spring Break week in Kyoto. We never ate at the hotel but grabbed breakfast at the blessedly convenient Starbucks every morning. If you are there for more than 4 days, one suggestion I have is a day trip to Hiroshima. Easy with a JR pass. We took the 7:33 train, spent several hours on Miyajima. Then about 3 pm headed for the Hiroshima Museum which is very moving. Took a stroll through the Peace Park, had a nice dinner and took the 7:50 pm train back to Kyoto.

We told her that we had just arrived and were waiting for check-in, of course we didn't have any reservation in a restaurant. She took us to a restaurant, there were only two customers except us.

I recommend that restaurant. After lunch we came back to the hotel lobby to check-in. The process was too long. Finally we went to our room. The moment the elevator opened, the smell of tobacco was sooooo...... When we entered the room, the smell of smoke was unbearable. I asked what it means and she said it is a smoking floor. Rooms are very small, even double. So, all smoke is living there forever. I said we didn't book the smoking room. We came back to the lobby and for 40 minutes we had to explain that we didn't book that smoker's shelter. I showed the confirmation e-mail letter in Japanese and told her there is no kanji \"smoking\". She went to the office and printed out a jalan webpage where our plan is listed as smoking. I told her that that is not our plan, our plan has a different price, not the one that we paid and we booked through yahoo page, not jalan, with no kanji \"smoking\".
