You basically have to drive to get anywhere from the hotel. In addition, they offer a shuttle to the airport and let customers park their cars there during their trips. They don't seem to manage the number of cars in their lot so it was absolutely jam packed - we had to park completely on the other side of the hotel on Saturday night. Having so many cars parked long term also prevents them from clearing the snow from the lot. We were there in early Feb - it was an absolute mess - about 6 inches of bumpy ice everywhere! Very dangerous! The other thing to look out for is that our room was facing the atrium / pool area so it was very noisy during the day. It didn't bother us because we only got back to the room at 10:30pm at which time the pool was closed.
