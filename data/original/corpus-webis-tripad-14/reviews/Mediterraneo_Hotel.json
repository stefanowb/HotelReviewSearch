We had a pleasant stay. The hotel is located within a few minutes walk from the termini station and about 15 minutes walk to the colloseum and trevi fountain. Most places of interest are within walking distance as long as you are prepared to walk on average of 25 minutes to get there. Rooms are reasonably sized and clean with a flat screen tv. We had a classic room on the 8th floor and to be fair it was slightly nicer than the pictures up on tripadvisor. Breakfast had plenty of variety and gave us a great start to the day. The only negative I have about the hotel is the service we received from the reception staff. Even though it was functional we didn\u2019t feel that they were as welcoming as we have experienced at other hotels in Europe.

The reception at the front desk was cold and unwelcoming. Once we got into our room that we payed good money for, we discovered that the air conditioning was broken. This is a big problem in the hottest month in Italy. When kindly asked if someone could check our AC in the room, the hotel did not respond. It took 3 calls and a visit to the front desk before they sent someone. Also, when my friend had needed ice for an emergency medical situation, she was told by the UNFRIENDLY staff, \" We can not get you ice. You may have that in hotels in America, but not here.\" We have travelled all over the world and have never experienced such laziness and hate from someone in the service industry.
