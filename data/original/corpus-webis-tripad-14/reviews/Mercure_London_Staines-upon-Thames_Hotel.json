This is not a luxury establishment, but it was clean, good sized bathroom and somewhat \"quaint\". The breakfast area (great full English) was also right on the River and afforded some great views.

In the beginning it was very good, but the last 3 times we have visited have been gradually worse. This time we arrived in a mini heat-wave to find the room allocated was tiny, very hot and frankly tired looking. We requested another room but the 2 we were offered were no ireal improvemnet. Still we accepted a new room on the ground floor and tried to switch on the AC, it didn't work, neither did the fridge. We asked for a fan which was delivered and did cool things down a little. Next morning my husband went straight off to a business meeting after having paid for the room and for breakfast for me. Breakfast is until 10pm on Friday's so I went into the dining room at 9.30am, I was ingored by the waiter who seemed to not have a clue about what he was supposed to be doing. I eventually got his attention and ordered white toast and strong black coffee, he brought me no toast and week tea!! When I mentioned that this wasn't what I'd ordered he looked confused and wandered off. I helped my self to cooked breakfast when the waiter came back with coffee but...no toast, which was when I found a foreign object in my breakfast!! It was a bit of black plastic with some kind of hair/string attached, obviously this put me off my meal, but I called the waiter over - who unsurprisingly just looked even more confused. The manager came at my request and apologised assuring me that the cost of my breadfast would be deducted from the bill, but that didn't really take the edge of what was a nasty experience. All in all the hotel is tired and grubby, the staff not really up to the job and you are left with the feeling that you are just a number - not very welcoming to be honest. Worst of all the best price they could give us was \u00a3130 for one night without breakfast, very high for not a very good experience.
