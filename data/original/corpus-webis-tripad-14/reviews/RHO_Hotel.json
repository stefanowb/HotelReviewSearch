But as with all hotels there were a few faults. Beds were very soft, we were on the 4th floor so it was very hot, could of done with air conditioning. We had to leave the window open all night and, as we looked out onto a street, we could hear loud music and people leaving bars at all hours of the night. There also seemed to be a shortage of large towels which lead to us asking at reception repeatedly.", "user": "SugarStar", "date": "July 2, 2006", "id": 5417545}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Clean,but wouldn't go back", "text": "For the amount of time we actually spent in the room though it was fine for us and we would stay again.", "user": "a happy trip advisor", "date": "June 14, 2006", "id": 5349065}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Reasonable value, but silly payment policy", "text": "We stayed at the Hotel Rho @ the end of May.
