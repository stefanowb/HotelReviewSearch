My first visit to New Orleans in 2002 was ruined by the Ste-Helene Hotel experience. As the other reviewers report, it is rather disgusting. Old, dirty, a/c didn't work and lots of dripping noises. Fake advertising is the only way they get guests to come, I guess. When I first checked in, my room was so hideous and nightmarish that I went back to the reception and requested a better room. Okay, they were accommodating and did assign me another room but it was only a marginal improvement. At least it didn't look creepy, dark and gothic - but still old and filthy. Being without resources, I told myself to suck it up for the 3 nights. How much time does one spend in a hotel room. But it really does affect your mental state if you don't get any sleep over 3 nights. If I revisit, I'd want to pay more for another hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "IntrepidfromMontreal", "date": "March 20, 2004", "id": 1734242}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Valentine's Weekend nightmare....", "text": "Basically everything you read in previous posts is correct. We stayed over Valentine's Day weekend and had a host of problems: furnace which constantly blew warm heat and didn't adequately cool the room (and I was afraid to sleep with the window open...); terrible bed (comforter had too many \"unknown\" stains....) and the pillows were even worse; bad t.v. reception; and and intermittenly working hairdrier. We never even tried to find the continental breakfast or happy hour, but the staff never told us it was available, either. Overall the staff was nice and helpful, but this didn't make up all of the shortcomings. In the end, you get what you pay for, and for $150 the location was great - but I would have preferred the Omni at whatever price across the street.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 18, 2004", "id": 1659667}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Hotel Ste.
