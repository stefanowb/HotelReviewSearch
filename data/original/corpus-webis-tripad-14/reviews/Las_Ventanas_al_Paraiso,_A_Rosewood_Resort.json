I appreciate all the reviews I read about this property so I want to return the favor. Like most who stay at this property, I would say we are pretty well traveled and stay at first class properties. (hope that doesn't sound too hoity toity) I researched a lot of new places because this was the first time my husband and I were able to get away sans child. I am from Boston so the travel required more than I wished (ie, no direct flight) but it was so worth the longer travel commitment.", "helpfulness": 30, "user": "lcookster", "date": "June 16, 2006", "id": 5353993}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "This Place is the Best. If You Can Swing the Cost, Book It", "text": "When I had originally booked with the resort, the category of room I wanted was not available. I booked something which would have required we switch rooms and then frequently checked back in to check on cancellations. I was able to book a roof top ocean view suite. I don't think there is a bad room on this property. I liked the ocean view because it seemed more private, yet still was really very close to the beach. The room was great (although if you have stayed at Cap Juluca their bathroom is bigger and better). High ceiling, ceiling fan and AC! Wow- did we need that given the mid-90 degree and above temps all week. One thing we have experienced in Mexico is that the typical hotel mattress is more firm than we prefer. I called housekeeping and requested a foam top. I did have to call back to remind them but it was on the bed before I went to sleep that night. Made a big difference. The outdoor living areas were really wonderful. We used the rooftop area several times but pref'd the somewhat shaded patio area. Housekeeping service was top notch, although one evening turn down service was skipped and one day the room wasn't cleaned until 3 pm. However, the room looked pristine and all of that was terrific. If you are going to obsess on any small, you will miss the much bigger picture.", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "PHL2", "date": "June 12, 2006", "id": 5336001}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "more than expected", "text": "We stayed for 6 nights and were really in desperate need of R&R when we got there. As a result, we spent a lot of our time 'on property.' We did rent the mini-coop for one day. We drove up the Baja coast and went to Todos Santos. The town wasn't that great- very tourista- but the ride was beautiful. Really glad we did it. On the way back, we stopped for lunch at Esperanza. That was terrific. That evening we went for drinks at Palmilla. I had looked into all of the properties, frankly I am really glad we chose Las Ventanas. However, all 3 are stellar places. We did the $50 dollar tequila lesson, which was really fun. We almost blew it off, but it turns out to be the best value at the resort. ha! Small group of us, tasted 5 Tequilas (all of increasing age and value), got free ceviche and guac etc. We also got a diploma, which we all thought was a hoot and would look good framed in our home offices.", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 2, 2006", "id": 5026554}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "We ate at the Sea Grill as well as the Restaurant. I loved the bartenders at the Sea Grill, in fact everyone there was wonderful. The restaurant is more formal and there was only one person there who gave me 'attitude'. Everyone else was wonderful. At night they had twin brothers playing flamenco guitar. Wonderful. The swim up bar was a hoot. Usually when we vacation we are not into 'socializing' but I have to say that a group of us congregated there every afternoon for happy hour. No one intruded on anyone's privacy but it was great fun. A group of us have agreed to return again same time, next year. Everyone who was staying there thought the place was incredible. Also, I don't like to get too dolled up on vacation. It may be different during 'high season' but a lot of folks were more casual than I had anticipated. I loved that. So it is a first class property but also felt very relaxed.", "title": "Unbelievable resort!", "helpfulness": 27, "user": "Vickie", "date": "April 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4967256}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Place", "text": "I had two spa treatments- both fabulous.

The food is excellent, incredibly fresh and we ate foods mostly from the sea. The portions are large and filling too. No need to eat outside Las Ventanas al Paraiso unless one desires an evening off the property. The ceviche and sushi bar vary daily and are fresh and delicious. Spa accommodations are sublime. We had one that includes body, mind and spirit and centers with a 3rd eye oil drip ! It was crazy in a great way. Also had mani-pedi and other spa services which were professional and topnotch. The Rooms on the water are Stunning, with beautiful patios. We spent our evenings watching the stars, The star-scapes are breath taking. And the BEST part of the trip bar none, was whale watching from the room, and beach every day. All day long there were baby and mother whales and pods swimming and frolicking close to shore line.
