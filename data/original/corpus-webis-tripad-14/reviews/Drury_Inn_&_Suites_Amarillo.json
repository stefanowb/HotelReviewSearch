There is NO WAY it could have been nicer than the Drury. After a long day of driving back from a Colorado ski trip, my family was in need of a place to stretch out and sleep good. THIS WAS THE IDEAL PLACE! I walked in and was greeted by a front desk clerk with a huge smile and wonderful attitude. We were booked for relatively cheap in a King Suite that had a king size bed in one room and a sofa sleeper and a recliner in the front room. In the middle was a mini kitchenette. In the morning, we were pleased to get a full hot breakfast buffet with eggs/bacon/sausage/french toast/waffles and many pastries. Also, free wifi was convenient in what was our favorite hotel stay in years. Do NOT Book anywhere else in Amarillo.
