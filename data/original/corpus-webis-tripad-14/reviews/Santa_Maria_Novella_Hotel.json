We had to keep asking the front desk to activate our lights from their main computer. We even had a worker come to the room to try to repair it, but we were told \"its broken and we can't move you\". These people must not talk to one another because every time we had to call the front desk (inexplicably the lights would go out at least once daily) we had to argue our case. They kept telling us to put the key in the electricity slot as if we were the problem. Also, outside the room there is an indicator light that tells them whether or not the room is occupied. Well, of course our indicator light was never on and on the first day a worker walked right in the room while we were dressing to go out for the evening. He apologized profusely but we were not pleased. Also, the front of the hotel was undergoing major construction. The main entrance was not accessible and the side entrance was a bit difficult to find as they did not have it clearly marked. I noticed they did put out larger signs after we checked in.

What a great hotel with a great location. The rooms were large and very tastefully decorated. We had a junior suite on the top floor in the newer part of the hotel facing the Piazza. The only drawback was the elevator did not go to the sixth floor and we had to walk two flights to get to our room. If you have trouble walking do not stay on this floor until the elevator installation is complete. I did not mind the walk. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous. There is a small bar where we enjoyed drinks each evening. A special thanks to Monika who made our stay even more pleasant. The staff at the front desk were all great and very helpful. The hotel is close to the train station and near where all the tours leave from. This made it very convenient for us and the tours we signed up for to Siena and wine country. It would have been nice if the facade of Santa Maria Novella was visible. It was covered in scaffolding. The Piazza was a great place to people watch from our windows. The construction noise was not an issue when our windows were closed - they appeared to be pretty soundproof. The hotel provides a great breakfast with many choices so we hardly ever had to buy lunch. I would have a gelato in lieu of lunch.
