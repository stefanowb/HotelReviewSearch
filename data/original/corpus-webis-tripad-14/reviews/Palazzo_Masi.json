If you have a car, don't stay in the city! Parking is very restricted. The city parking lot near this hotel charges 1.60 euros/hour with no maximum. There is a free lot rather far away that was full on 2 of our 3 nights.

I didn`t find this hotel as comfortable as other budget accomodation but it is good value - we paid 180 euro for 2 people 2 nights. The buses from train station are confusing so ask for help, it would be too far to walk with luggage.

She is very nice, but if you want to check out early in the morning, she will make you change your plans the evening before you leave so that she doesn't have to get up early to check you out. The towels were really rough and smelled horrible. I have stayed in Siena three times and this was not the best. I will say if location is important to you, it can't be beat.

I found the bed way too hard, unfortunately. It was sometimes very noisy due to its location right near Il Campo but that is also one of the best things about it -- being so close to where the action is in Siena.
