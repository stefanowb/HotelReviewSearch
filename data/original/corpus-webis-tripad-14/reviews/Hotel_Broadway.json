With a cockroach, previous guests hair, dust, and so on. The bed was very hard. And the door had a huge gap under neath so all sounds in the corridor could be heard. There was also a call too prayer at sun rise. I slept very poorly the 2 nights in the hotel. But I've also heard from the other guests that there is a big difference in the rooms. So be sure to check what you get. That said they were very helpful. They organized breakfast before opening hours for me and a tour group. I was slightly worried about eating in the Chor Bizzare restaurant, given the cleaning level in my room. But it was excellent, with very nice staff, and good food.

This room had clean beds and clean bathroom facilities with reasonable aircon. Other than that it was pretty shabby. When we had slept and got up to go out of the hotel, the receptionist advised that our 'superior room' was now ready. We were shown to a very smart room, spotlessly clean (room 22) at the front. It felt like we were in a different hotel. It's worth checking to see what room you are in. The road outside however, at the front, was really noisy. Vehicles going all night. On balance it was a great place to stay. I can't comment on the value for money as it was part of an inclusive deal. The restaurant was good, always busy, you need to book yourself a table. Breakfast included a choice of hot food and the usual toast, cereal etc. The staff were a little stiff (in that slightly brusque Indian kind of way) but after a couple of days they were really friendly. Prices for the phone and room service were cheap, i'd expect to be paying over the top in Delhi.", "title": "Great little hotel", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "Kirm", "date": "April 12, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7341651, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean rooms, and great restaurnant", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}], "location": {"country": "India", "continent": "Asia", "city": "New Delhi"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 11, "average": 31, "very good": 34, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 12}, "aka": "Hotel Broadway Delhi", "slim_ranking": 0.267676767677, "description": "Located between Colonial Delhi and the old city, Hotel Broadway, India\u00e2\u20ac's first ISO-9002 hotel has 26 guest rooms, a pub and is home to the celebrated, Chor Bizarre - India'\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant.
