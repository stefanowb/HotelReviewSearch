Great location - central to all things Corpus Christi. Front desk personnel were welcoming and friendly. The casual dining restaurant on the 2nd floor serves a super breakfast - it's pricey for sure, but very tasty and the table service was outstanding (thank you Anna!!). We didn't upgrade our room, so our view wasn't the greatest, but the room itself was clean and very comfortable. Love the fact that the sliding door was operable, so we could step onto the balcony in the morning to see sunrise and smell the gulf air.
