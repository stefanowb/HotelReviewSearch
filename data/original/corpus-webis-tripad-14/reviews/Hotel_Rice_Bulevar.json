The hotel needs some refurbishing. Our room had frayed bedding and draperies desperately needing to be changed. The heating/cooling system never worked and the wi-fi was off/on all the time we tried using it. We did have a view of the cathedral, but that was looking over apartment buildings and construction. The final straw was trying to have breakfast and finding that a tour group of well over 50 had occupied the entire breakfast room leaving no place to sit or little food. The price we paid wasn't too high, but I'd not return here again and would advise others to look elsewhere first.", "title": "Disappointed", "user": "highdesertbadger", "date": "April 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 157942806}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed here on a trip through Spain with teachers and students. Hotel was booked by our tour company, but I was very, very pleased with it. Rooms are clean and modern. Staff is courteous. Hotel is a short walk from the main plaza of Burgos, with shops, restaurants, cathedral, etc. Our group was in Spain for 12 days and stayed at several different hotels. This was my favorite. I would definitely stay here again. Can't comment on cost, since tour company booked the hotel, but I don't think it's very expensive. Out of all the hotels we stayed in, this one was the cleanest.", "title": "Would definitely stay here again--modern, clean, great location!", "user": "she23", "date": "July 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 133645233}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011", "text": "The photos of the hotel and the exterior look nice, modern and comfortable.
