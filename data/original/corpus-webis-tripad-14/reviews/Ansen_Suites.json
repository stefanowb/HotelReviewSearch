It was very quiet, nicely decorated in neutral colors and had a very calm feeling. The king-size bed was firm, but not hard, and the linens were excellent. The bathroom was spacious, with amenities, bathrobes, and luxurious towels. A very wide person could have a problem in the stand-up shower compartment. Water pressure was strong. The kitchenette was equipped for two people and had a fully stocked mini-bar/refrigerator and a dishwasher. The free WiFi had a strong signal. The included breakfast downstairs was a real sit-down breakfast: omelettes, cold platter, bread, coffee, juice. The owner was charming and gracious and the small staff friendly and extremely attentive. They all couldn't have been better. The restaurant downstairs is excellent. There is a small Dia supermarket about a half block away. The only minor negatives I can think of are that there are no blackout curtains (it still gets dark enough), that the rooms tend to be a little underlit, and that the door could have a more substantial lock (not a big concern).

The staff is friendly enough and their English is pretty good. The room was clean and the service was marginal, they forgot to replenish toiletries and kitchenette supplies. Internet connectivity was free but a little spotty, especially at night. The location is not all that bad across the Golden Horn near the Galata Tower. A problem did come up when I went to pay my bill. Because I had already had a few scam issues come up in Istanbul I was a little gun shy, I was kind of worried about the bill. I booked for a room at one rate for three nights which meant I would get a 10% discount, as clearly advertised on the web site and through e-mail correspondence. When I arrived I was upgraded to a better quality room because the room I booked was not available but it was clear I would pay the same price as my original room rate. It was great to get a better room with a better view for my original rate. It seemed like it was a forced upgrade, but in any event it was nice to get the upgrade. When I went to pay my bill I was told that the 10% discount only applied if I was paying in cash. I know this scam because it had already been tried on me twice in restaurants, i.e., can\u2019t take your credit card because the purchase price is to small (actually the game/scam is to act like your credit card doesn\u2019t work on those neat little \u2018at your table\u2019 credit card processing scanners). The gentlemen at Ansen kept telling me that I got such a great deal with my upgrade that the full price was really fair, which didn\u2019t have anything to do with paying cash. After going around and around for a while Ansen 130 Suites won out and I paid the full price with a credit card and no discount. Another Istanbul lesson learned. Count on some sort of scam for just about everything. To protect a little from this I would suggest that you totally, totally try to get clear on all Istanbul transactions before the bill arrives (before you commit to the purchase).
