The room we had was about 11 x 11 not including the bath area. So definitely on the smaller side but I think they have some bigger rooms. Everything looked new. I am a clean bathroom freak and was so happy with the cleanliness of the whole place. I can't get a room this nice with breakfast in bed included everyday for this price (about $110/night) in the states. The staff even offered to give us box breakfasts to take with us when we had early morning tours. They had hair dryers, irons, whatever. Very accommodating. I will always stay here when I come. The metro is a 5 minute walk, 10 minute walk to Vatican, great shopping one street over. FABULOUS !!!! Restaurant next door is great and no service fee. Beds were very comfortable and big. Once I learned how to use the a/c system (about 3 days in I realized I had it on fan and not on cooling ) it would.
