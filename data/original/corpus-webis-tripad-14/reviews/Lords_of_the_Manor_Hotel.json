From my early emails to the concierge trying to get \"a feel for what the Manor was like and how would we get there\" to our send off this was truly a memory maker. We took the train from London and were met by a taxi sent by the Manor. We were then greeted like royalty from the staff in the drive in front of the Manor. We felt like we were in a scene from Downton Abbey .Paul the hotel manager attends to every detail and runs one of the finest hotels in all of The Cotswalds. The Manor is comfortable, not oppulent. Crackling fires, warm staff who are happy to get tea or offer activity suggestions or who leave you alone to enjoy a book in a soft chair are what make this an incredible experience. I love that it feels you can do nothing at all but stare out the beautiful floor to ceiling windows and be doing just the right thing. THe rooms are comfortable and cozy and have everything you need. The bathroom is spacious, modern, and sparkling clean. You feel like you are staying in a large comfortable home. The food is amazing and deserves it's Michelin Star. The wait staff is superb and the sommeliar was extremely knowledgable. You will not find another experience like this tucked away in the Cotwalds. Long quiet walks through countryside that is literally right out of a book. I almost hate to give such a good review, the place will be mobbed.
