B.C was in the middle of a heatwave. Got news when we checked in that the aircon was down. When asked how long has the aircon been broken, it was broken for about a week! Come on!!! That's a lot of time to fix the damm airconditioning! Anyways the apartment itself was decent, had good amenities. However the thing that turned me off was the broken aircon and sleeping with the windows open. Why was that a problem? It was because of the huge noise level from the parking lot outside the apartment. I could hear people walking and talking in the wee hours of the night when I was trying to sleep. COuple of fights broke out too, and cops came. Overall.... I think my experience in whistler would've been a bit more pleasant if the airconditioning was fixed, because I would've been more well rested.", "title": "sleepless.... but okay i guess....", "user": "mojojojo79", "date": "August 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 37696854}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled solo", "text": "I needed a place to stay in Whistler for one week that had covered parking and internet.

Some annoying things about the apartment were; the glass screen of the shower which was broken and would come off the rails all the time, the stove was not the best and difficult to cook in and the toilet blocked up once - they did come and unblock it as soon as we rang in the morning so no complaints there however it wasn't pleasant for the night it was blocked. They also left the plunger there so not sure if they expected us to unblock our own toilet if it happened again. A friend stayed on the sofa bed and said it was very uncomfortable sagging a lot in the middle. The apartment was very noisy at night as it faced onto the carpark - some nights we could not sleep with the bin trucks and snow clearing trucks driving through the carpark especially cause we had to keep the window open otherwise it was too hot. Also on Fri and Sat nights there was a lot of noise from drunk kids running through the place. This could be remedied with earplugs however we kept forgetting to buy them. It also was difficult to keep the apartment at an acceptable temperature and was always too hot even though we turned the heating to the lowest it didn't seem to make any difference.", "title": "Marketplace 1BR Condo 236 very comfortable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BoiseBusTrvlr", "date": "February 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 24091887, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Relative bargain rate for the location"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "During our stay the apartment was serviced weekly and towels / bedlinen replaced but the cleaning was sporadic.", "title": "Accommodation is fine", "user": "OxfordKeenskiier", "date": "March 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 14548456}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I had some misgivings about staying at Marketplace Lodge, given the negative comments of some reviewers, but it turned out to be a great choice.
