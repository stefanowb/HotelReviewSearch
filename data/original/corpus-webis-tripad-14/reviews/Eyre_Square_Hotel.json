What can I say.... Awful hotel, awful receptionist so bad that we checked out at 11pm and drove 3 hours back to Cork. To start the rooms are old fashioned, miserable and kinda depressing! Dont expect to have a restful stay because the music will keep you awake for most of the night. The receptionist was so rude and unsympathetic when we checked out that I was forced to write a letter of complaint when we got home. I have never written a letter of complaint! I received a reply letter about a week later and all I can say is it was a pathetic apology and a she attached a copy of our booking reference which stated that 'there was a bar in the hotel and that you may experience some noise'. SOME NOISE.. Come on?

This hotel is in a great location right at the edge of Kennedy Park and within a short distance to all the shops. This was a great advantage but it also had its disadvantages, one of which was parking. It cost \u20ac8.50 a day to park in the nearby Forrester car park. Another disadvantage was the noise at night time. The first night we arrived we stayed in room 313 which overlooked the main bus depot. This meant that buses were coming and going all the time and we could hear the intercom system quite clearly. This noise went on until late at night and started again at 6am. We requested a change of room and were immediately accommodated. We found the receptionist on duty very pleasant and helpful. We were then moved to room 305 which was an inside room and much quieter but very hot and stuffy. We found the food in the dining room very average but edible. We did notice that they had out of date yougarts at breakfast each morning which we felt was not good enough for a three star hotel. All in all we enjoyed our stay in Galway but if you are looking for good food, luxurious surroundings I would consider a more upmarket hotel.", "user": "dubgal07", "date": "May 9, 2007", "id": 7571517}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Stayed in Better Hotels in Galway", "text": "I booked this hotel before reading all the negative reviews and I'm glad I decided to see for myself.
