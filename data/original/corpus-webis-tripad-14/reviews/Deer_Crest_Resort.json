It was a great place to watch the many hummingbirds right by the table as we munched on cheese and crackers with a glass of wine. One afternoon we even saw a small black bear run across the grounds -- wish I would have had my camera ready! The resident marmot is also pretty entertaining. The staff is very pleasant and we wanted for nothing. The location is great, close to Rocky Mountain Natl. Park on one side and only about a mile out of Estes on the other.

Most accomodations in the area are for small families at over $200/night so Deer Crest was a much more affordable option for just the 2 of us. The location was pretty good because it was just a short drive back to the downtown area or along the way to the Trail Ridge entrance of RMNP. The room was large, clean, and well-maintained, however, it was rather dated in my opinion. It has the same toiletries as you'd expect from a hotel.
