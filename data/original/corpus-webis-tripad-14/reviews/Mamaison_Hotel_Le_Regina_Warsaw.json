The exterior belies the modern interior, rooms and facilities. We visited with our children (aged 15, 13 and 11), and parents-in-law, and everyone was happy. From a very efficient welcome and check-in (even though we were early), to the service received during our 1 night stay, everything was first class. We had an adjoining room with our kids, which was a plus. The rooms were very comfortable with excellent bathrooms. The breakfast buffet set us up nicely for a day of sightseeing. The pool and sauna were a welcome escape from the snowy weather during our stay. All in all, I couldn't fault the hotel and its staff, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

The location is particularly poignant given that the hotel stands all of 50 yards from the edge of the erstwhile Jewish ghetto (the location of the ghetto wall is marked in the pavement). You can get round most of the key sights in a weekend (we took a 3-hour private tour arranged by the hotel - not cheap but worth every penny) and the vibrance of the city is a testament to Warsaw's resilience in the face of the unspeakable horrors of its past.
