The room is adequate in size & the bed very comfortable. Internet is free & that is a plus. They have computers in the lobby, but they will supply you with a wire to connect in your room (at no cost too). The breakfast was adequate with hot & cold offerings. The restaurant opens at 7 PM & we ate there 2 nights because we were too tired from working all day. We were unaware (our error for not checking) that the restauarnt is closed on Sunday evening.
