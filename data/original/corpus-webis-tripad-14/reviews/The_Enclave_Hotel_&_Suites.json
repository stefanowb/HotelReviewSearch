My party of 11 stayed in 4 different rooms, 3 in block 1 and 1 in block 3. The only complaint was my in-laws room located next to the communal wash room where other guest would use the facility's late at night (midnight) and keep them awake. This problem was reported and reception offered to move them. The rooms were all clean and kept tidy by the maids every 3rd day. The on site shop was handy, stocking all the essentials and the pizza hut was quick and tasty if you don't want to go out. As a guest traveling with virgin you are entitled to a complimentary cooked breakfast in a separate dining room from other visitors. The breakfast was hit and miss, somedays sausage or bacon others gravy and biscuits but always fresh fruit, ommelets and eggs. The pools and grounds were always clean and felt safe with regular guard patrols. The location is perfect with many restaurants and shops in walking distance, universal 5 and disney only 20 minutes drive away. Everybody in my party agreed, we would stay here again! If you want to stay in a place like the Hilton then save up and book there, if you want a clean, friendly convenient place this is it.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "John B", "date": "May 14, 2012", "id": 129938253}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for 7 nights while we were visiting the parks.

The room itself was very large with a separate \"living\" area with a sofa. We also had a big balcony with sunbeds. They lay on free shuttles to universal , not sure about disney as we didn't go. Only disappointments were 1. the \"free\" breakfast, really just a token gesture of a cereal bar, piece of fruit and tiny carton of juice.

The 2 outdoor pools have vending machines and jacuzzi's which was nice, just one small thing was the caribbean style music, i would have preferred a radio station or something a bit more up to date.

Our room was on the 5th floor in Block 2 with a great view from the balcony over the lake towards Wet & Wild. The room we stayed had 2 bedrooms and it was so clean and included in the kitchen area a new dishwasher, a very large microwave and a four ring cooker as well as a large fridge freezer. It also included all the cooking utensils you could need, a coffee machine and plenty of storage space. The 2 outdoor pools were always kept really clean and on Fridays they show a poolside movie at pool 1 as well as a barbeque on a Saturday which is great for the kids. We have been to Orlando five times and I have to say that without doubt this was the best place we have stayed in to date. We will definitely be requesting the Enclave Suites the next time we go.
