We had lower expectations of Cuba based on past experiences but were totally blown away by this resort. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and clean. We had adjoining rooms with our oldest children. The only complaint was that there was no cot available for our yougest so we had to rig up a bed for him on the bench- type sofa. Cribs were available for babies. Next time I would bring a portable side rail. Our ninja teenager loved the open air rooftop yoga/ tai-chi/ martial arts area. All our kids loved the ice cream stand and the kids shows - monkeys and clowns anyone? The Japenese restaurant was bizarre, cream cheese sushi and miso soup that appeared to be chicken broth with cubes of cheese, not tofu. Otherwise the food was fine with enough choices. Wine was terrible. A smart group from BC brought their own! The test of a good resort is how they handle problems. I became very ill on my last day. On our request, the front desk arranged for late check out and found a van to take us to the airport so I could sleep. They were solicitous and kind. I would return. The resort is mobility friendly with ramps to a boardwalk overlooking the beach.", "title": "Would return again", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "multigentraveler", "date": "October 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 85166408}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "This 5 star hotel is awesome.!

When we got there the hotel looked fabulous, very safe and beautiful. Staff was friendly. We were starved from our trip, the food was at the tail end of lunch so it was not very good but our expectation for food in Cuba was not very high to begin with. We wanted to have fun and relax. Our room was okay but had that damp feeling the whole time but at least the air condition worked the whole time we were there, mind you the weather in October was very comfortable, not too hot and not too cold. The beach was nice. Always had a spot for us 5 under a palalpa. And then it rained. But the staff's spirit was up and made all their guests feel comfortable. The Bahama Mama's helped....yummy!!! It rained all night but the next day was beautiful blue skies and hot sun. The pool area is clean and the entertainment staff has some good eye candy (for the women)!! Don't worry boys...plenty of eye candy for you too!!! We only stayed for 4 days but it was the best time!! Overall the hotel's service was very good. Our toilet was malfunctioning at 1:30 in the morning and someone came to fix it in half an hour. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly and our maid was very accomodating. So the if you don't have high expectations for the food you will not be disappointed but the entertainment and relaxation part of the trip was tops!!! The food was not that bad, the buffet always had variety.
