The one in the living room didn't work great, the volume would not go very loud, and with the loud air conditioner, it was too hard to hear the TV.

The complimentary breakfast was great and there was plenty of variety and quantities despite the number of people there each day. Staff were also friendly and helpful.

The free breakfast the Hampton provides is pretty good, the hot choices change daily and the area is large and can hold a good sized crowd. As others have mentioned, the parking area is small and if you arrive late you may have to park over by the Chevron station or by the Sizzler.
