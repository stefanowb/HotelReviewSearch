From the moment we checked in to the moment we left nothing was too much for the staff. From champagne on arrival (courteousy of the management) to organising taxis, from carrying your luggage to your room even before you've had a chance to check in to having a guest reception with home made cocktails and canap\u00e9s. These little touches all contributed to a simply wonderful weekend. The apartment itself was fantastic - with the free standing bath and tv in the bathroom a particular highlight. I would recommend The Chester Residence to anyone who wants a little but of luxury whilst in Edinburgh.

The mews apartments are a big bigger than the other apartments and my worries about them being dark (being in the basement) were unfounded. The apartment was very spacious, well equipped, stylishly decorated and the staff couldn't have been more helpful with our various and numerous requests. There were two ensuite shower rooms plus another bathroom which we, at first, thought excessive - until we discovered the TV in the bathroom with its floating remote - bliss!

While there's a great deal of construction on Princes to build the controversial new trams, making taxi rides and driving a little more complicated, it doesn't take away from this gorgeous city. We chose the Chester Residence based on the ranking from TripAdvisor, so we came expecting something special, and we were not disappointed! The apartment we had on Chester street was very large, the ceilings high, we had a kitchen, private garden and large living room with a sky-light, and furnishings chosen by a keen eye. Literally the only thing I could find wrong with the place, if anything, would be that the plumbing in the en-suite bathroom was a little noisy and the tub would fill a little when flushing the toilet, but considering the age of the building, and the fact that our apartment was lower than street level (but with a great amount of light), it's a very minor issue - we've experienced worse, noisier plumbing in other hotels in the UK.
