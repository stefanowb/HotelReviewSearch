The hotel is beautiful and the rooms lovely. A lounge area separate from the bedroom with a great bathroom etc. We did have some sort of problem with the heating on the 2nd night, but not enough to worry us too much.

We were in a ground floor room which overlooked a little court-yard in the centre of the hotel. There were tables and chairs in there but as it is uncovered and it was still cold in the evenings, hardly anyone use it so our room was really quiet.
