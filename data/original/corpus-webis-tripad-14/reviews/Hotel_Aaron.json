Mainland hotels tend to have lower rates than equivalent hotels on the main island, and it's hardly an inconvenience: Venice island is just a short bus ride away on the frequent ACTV bus number 2 which stops close to the hotel. Travelcards for riding the ACTV waterbusses in Venice also cover bus travel on the mainland, including to and from Marco Polo Airport.", "title": "Small but perfectly formed", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AndyInLondon", "date": "October 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 47660973}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Veneto", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 36, "very good": 111, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 58}, "aka": "Hotel Aaron Province Of Venice/Mestre, Italy", "slim_ranking": 0.328125, "description": "Hotel Aaron gives you modern accommodation, a friendly atmosphere, and a convenient location; 200 metres from Mestre Station.
