The hotel had a very convenient parking garage attached for $18 a night. You need to get your parking ticket validated by the hotel before leaving. The check in process was quick and we got to our room within 5 minutes. Overall the room and bathroom were clean and updated. However, the AC/Heat element-vent was dirty and old, was from the 1970s complete with dust and grime. (This grosses me out at any place) The room was very tight for 2 Queen beds \u2013 so one bed was pushed up against the dirty AC thing. Less then desirable but oh well\u2026standard for most older hotels. We had dinner at the hotel\u2019s restaurant. The menu was diverse and all price ranges. The bartender made some good drinks for us. The waitress was EXTREMELY slow\u2026but the food was good. There was a small food court with fast food and coffee shops and CVS. The hotel was quiet for a few hours sleep. The checkout process was quick and we were at the hospital within 10 minutes. I\u2019d recommend this place if you are traveling from out of town or local and have an early morning appointment at one of the hospitals.", "title": "Good Location to Local Hospitals", "user": "Daphne418", "date": "October 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 20829415, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location to hospital/parking/restaurant", "disliked": "\u2014 dated AC/heat unit, small room with bad view"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This Best Western is nicer and cleaner than most Best Westerns. Initially, we had some trouble finding the lobby to check in, but only because we went in through the food court/CVS entrance. At the front desk, check in was hassle free, but the desk staff wasn't friendly at all. He mumbled something about our room having been given away, so we had gotten a free upgrade to an apartment suite. We were a little confused, but hey, it was a free upgrade. The apartments are in a separate part of the building from the hotel, and aren't bad really. The hallway once you exit the elevator is a little small and cheap looking, and there was a bag of linens (clean or dirty, I'm not sure) sitting in the hallway for the entire duration of our stay (granted, we did only stay one night). But, once you enter the apartment, it is cozy and simply decorated, and the kitchen is even outfitted with dishes and paper towels, etc. There were a few things I noticed which might bother some people, but didn't really bother me. One is that there were some noticeable holes in one of the walls which just need a little spackle. Another is that there was a teeny bit of mold/mildew in between the shower tiles, and the shower curtain could have been a little cleaner. Other than those small things, the apartment was nice, and clean enough. The hotel itself is only a 6 block walk from Fenway, and in the same building as a food court/CVS. Also, the Longwood restaurant on premises is actually pretty good, and not expensive.
