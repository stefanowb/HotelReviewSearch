They are located next to each other and from what we understand, are not affiliated with one another. The Peg Leg Inn is definately the nicer of the two places. The Motel had a comfortable bed, but that is the only good quality of the place. For $150/night, I would expect a lot more than what we got. We wore our flip flops in the room b/c without any A/C, the entire room was damp. The decor is very dated and you only get two towels. The Motel is directly across from a small beach area, but the Inn is literally two buildings down. A lot of people confuse the two and expect the Inn and get the Motel. Both are walking distance from downtown and are in great locations.", "user": "kirev", "date": "August 3, 2004", "id": 2363470}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 7, "very good": 22, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "Eagle House Beachside Hotel Rockport", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
