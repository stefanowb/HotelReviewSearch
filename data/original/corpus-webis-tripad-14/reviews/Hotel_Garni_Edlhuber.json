It's a good 15 minute walk to Mittenwald and if it is raining (as it was for us), it might as well have been 30 miles.

If you like hot coffee with your breakfast...you are out of luck here. For some peculiar reason, coffee was always delivered after our family had finished eating our food from the breakfast buffet. Requests for coffee with breakfast was met by contempt. If you don't show up at 8am (which we decided on our 2nd morning might not be a good idea...so we cruised in at 8:20am), you are screwed by a run on the food and slim pickins. We got aced out by a run on the muffins and bread and the lady/owner simply replied 'No More'. I know these complaints might seem petty, but when you are traveling as a family of 5 and required to rent 2 rooms to accomodate the kids and you represent 30% of the occupancy, you would hope for a little respect. We did not get this. Questions regarding hot in-room refrigerator, bathroom usage (we had to share one bathroom), directions to town were met with hostility. After 2 days, we wanted to pay the bill and get out of town quickly. Surprise, they don't take credit cards (or so they said). They only take cash. Well it sure would have been nice to have known this a head of time as we didn't have enough cash on us. The lady/owner's response...hike to town and withdraw it from a bank. It truly was unbelievable. We spent 25 days in Europe and this was by FAR the least hospitable hotel (actually, we loved all our other hotels) we encountered.
