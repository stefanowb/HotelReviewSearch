In the morning I went to a meeting before check out only to come back and find out that the room had been stripped and that the housekeepers were in it before check out time.

The breakfast is cooked to order, not buffet so hot and fresh. Cereals, fruit, yoghurt and juice and more toast than you can eat. Dinner we had Table D'hote menu with carvery which was fresh, nice and well presented. ALL staff friendly and the men really enjoyed the golf courses and they know their stuff! The pool also was good. If its golf you want, then go for it....really pleasantly surprised. It is a golf place though, not luxury spa!!

Although we had to walk outside to the function room this was undercover so not a problem. The ball was organized really well and the food was lovely. The DJ didnt get off to a good start but after some guests spoke to him the music did improve however this is personal choice I guess. There were Scottish pipers at Midnight which was a nice touch.

All of which were a precursor of the horrors to come. Our room was to say the least, dated but more to the point, it was filthy. There appeared to be what looked like blood stains on the wall and carpet, thick dust pervayed the room as we disturbed it from the top of furnishings. Unpleasant looking stains were everywhere on the chairs and bed cover. The carpet and bathroom floor were so dirty that to remove ones shoes wouldve surely have been a health risk! We made an immediate complaint to reception who advised they would send someone up to our room. A housekeeper and cleaner duly arrived mop and bucket in hand. After pointing out all of the above, a sense of resignation came over the housekeeper and we were told that we were not the first to have complained ( and I suspect not the last) about the general standard of the place. Also that the complaints fell on deaf ears when the hotel owner had been told many times that the place needed attention! We left after only half an hour in the dreadful room/hotel.
