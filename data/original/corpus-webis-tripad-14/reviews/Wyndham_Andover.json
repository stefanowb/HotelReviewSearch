But it's great that even when there is six inches of snow on the ground, you can still enjoy our indoor pool and hot tub. For those who can't stand to miss even a single workout, we have a recently renovated Gym & Fitness Center, with individual monitors and great views. If you can't seem to find enough hours in the day to finish work, head to our 24-hour Business Center. When you're finally ready to relax, head to one of our over-sized hotel rooms; many even boast private outside space. Our Grab-and-Go Market is the perfect place to pick up a sandwich, salad or a much-needed aspirin. But if dining by candlelight is what would hit the spot, stop by our On the Bone Steakhouse. And for something tall and cold, check out our Characters Sports Bar or the Lobby Bar. Naturally, room service is an option almost anytime. Those planning a professional gathering or stylish wedding will be sure to appreciate our customize-able event space, with a grand ballroom and outdoor gazebo.Not only does our property have everything you need for leisure or business, Andover has a cornucopia of things to do, right near the hotel. Historic Lexington and Concord are the home of the first battles for our country's independence, and they're just a short drive away, as is magical Salem, Massachusetts. For those who'd like to get their hearts racing, Canobie Lake Park with roller coasters and log flume is a great choice. Or for a different kind of adrenaline rush, try some tax-free shopping at Rockingham Mall. Nature lovers will enjoy exploring Lowell National Park. And kids of all ages will love to see all the creatures at Zoo New England. We are conveniently located between Boston Logan international Airport and the Manchester Airport, which are both less than 30 miles away."}
