We booked very last minute and left the next day! Was a little apprehensive after reading some reviews but we went with no great expectations and had a lovey time. The apartments are spacious but basic. (Yes hard beds too, but a request for extra pillows helped.)They have a small kitchen area set aside in the living room with a fridge/toastey maker/kettle/mini cooker with 2 hot plates. (We didn't cook at all as it was cheap enough to eat out. Its end of season now so all the bars/restaurants/tours are reducing prices. We had a nice meal and a few drinks for @ \u00a330 for 2, cant grumble!) The apartments also have a nice balcony and living area. Nice pool area too. My only gripe with the Candon is the bar/restaurant staff. As per previous reviews they really have no customer service skills and I found them totally unworthy of my money due to this. Shame really as the food they serve up is good! Loved Marmaris as a location. Plenty of friendly banter with resort staff vying for business but not in a pestering manner. I found a polite No Thanks always worked. We booked some tours with Mustaffa as recommended on here and had a very good albeit wet jeep safari and practically free moonlight boat trip thrown in for booking this. Like I said its nearing end of season so its probably the best time to go. We ate at Summer Rain, Bonos and Natalies steak house, again as recommended on here and all were good. (Bonos has a recommended reservation policy for Saturday nights!) I would recommend you taking English Money and changing it in resort as the pound is very strong at the moment and this was the recommended option but you can buy in Euros and pounds too. Weather was lovely. We only went to the beach once but didn't have a problem with dirt as per previous reviews. Sand is shingly so sea shoes recommended. Lots of people smoking everywhere so be prepared if you don't like this. We don't smoke and have a dislike of inhaling other peoples smoke especially when we're trying to enjoy a nice meal but with it being quieter you can normally pick a spot away from people! As for reviews about the mosque and its calling, we too were only woken on our first morning by it and found it didn't bother us after that. Earplugs helped :-) This hotel is really suited to families with small children. All in all had a lovely, cheap and cheerful holiday.
