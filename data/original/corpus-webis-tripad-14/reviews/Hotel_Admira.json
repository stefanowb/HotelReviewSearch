The staff is moderately friendly and shows signs of indifference. The hotel mainly charters to the international business traveler, which is quite surprising in this remote area, as you wonder what business in the region actually supports this kind of business. However, there appear to be a number of businesses in the region that support international business. The rooms are spacious and well kept, but internet access appeared to be non-functional. There is a mini-bar and working desk provided. The breakfast buffet is decent, but mainly caters to the German traveler. Overall, this a place you can stay in, but you should not expect more than just a stay in a poorly designed setting.", "title": "Decent accommodation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "redwrangler8", "date": "June 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 17189374, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Convenient location for business I had to attend", "disliked": "\u2014 Horrendous interior design"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed in the hotel a few times and was pleased at first, but during my last stay, things got bad. I checked out early and paid in advance. Prior to leaving I aksed the receptionist to make sure I was not billed for the final day. He said OK but did it anyway. It took three days for them to agree to refund the overpayment, then when I asked for a reservation the following month, they refused to even answer my request. Totally unprofessonal.
