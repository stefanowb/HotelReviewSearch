You can park your car in the nearby multi-storey which costs \u00a310 for 24 hours but with the discount voucher from the hotel you get a reduction of 25% reducing it to \u00a37.50 which is not bad for city centre parking! However, when we paid we were only charged \u00a33.75 for some reason, which was even better. Rooms are clean, modern and compact without being too small and bathroom was a decent size. The breakfast had a wide selection and the quality was good. It is advertised as self service but the morning we were there it was extremely busy so the staff were serving, presumably to speed things up. However, in this instance the service was poor and very rushed and thus the presentation was poor.

The reservation stated that we could not book in until 16.00 on a Sat but as we got there at 12.00 we though we would check on the off chance that we would be able to book in early. I was greeted at the reception by 2 very pleasant young men and they asked what brought us to Liverpool and if it was for a special occasion. I explained it was our wedding anniversary and he said that he would do his best to get us a nice room. After a little discussion between themselves we were informed that they would upgrade us to a suite. The room was fantastic with view of Albert Dock and the River Mersey. We spent the day at Liverpool one shopping centre which is just over the road and the night at some of the many pubs in Liverpool city centre.
