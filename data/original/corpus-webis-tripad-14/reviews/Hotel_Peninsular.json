{"user_rating": 3.0, "review_count": 241, "name": "Hotel Peninsular", "reviews": [{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great value!", "text": "I stayed at the Peninsular for 4 nights and found it very accomodating with a terrific location, close to everything. I traveled as a single and received a room with 2 twin beds for 50 Euro. I would definately recommend this hotel for the budget traveller who expects no frills. The staff was friendly, the rooms and hotel are kept clean and has a quaint feel to it. I agree that you can hear people come and go, so if you are a light sleeper earplugs would help. I had no problem though. Remember to bring a wash cloth if you use them, as they are not provided. Breakfast was standard fair, an assortment of 3 types of bread, coffee & orange juice. They do have a hair dryer you can use from the lobby, but you can find one for cheap if you don't have one with proper outlet. Definately a great bargain!", "user": "SantaMonice123", "date": "October 27, 2005", "id": 4066218}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Good position", "text": "The good point about this budget hotel is its proximity to Las Ramblas and from there to Calalunya square for the buses etc.,the waterfront, tourist information and gothic area. It is down a narrow, mostly traffic free, street off Las Ramblas, which connects to the Montjuic area so lots of people about. It is very clean, the rooms are small, very, very basic but the bathroom was fine. It did have air conditioning. Other Tripadvisors' recommendation of being out all day and just using the room to sleep in is about right but it does help to bring ear plugs, you will need them. The hotel has an atrium with small walkways all around on each of the four floors so the sound of anything carries up and around. The old doors have gaps under (it was a former convent) and on several nights it was very noisy as students use it and were coming back late at night when we were in bed. The breakfast was two fresh bread rolls, butter, jam and a little plain cake with tea/coffe and some orange squash (not fresh juice). The owners were friendly and kept things in the hotel safe for us. It is a good budget hotel for a short sightseeing break but I would not like to have it as a main holiday or for more than 5/6 days. A minus for us was that we had booked a twin room (for two girlfriends) and despite confirming this again by fax only got a small double bed which they couldnt change until the last night and then we couldnt be bothered to change. Just a word of warning: please be so careful with your bags, my friend's rucksack was tampered with on an escalator but nothing stolen at the Barcelonabus station which was full of unsavory types and the bus driver had to chase some off when we arrived. Do all the usual safety checks - there are now lots of police about all over the city (but not at this bus station at night) and everyone tells you to watch your bags. There is even a notice on the breakfast table telling you not to leave your bag - it does make even a seasoned traveller a little alarmed! Rucksacks are such an easy target especially those with easy opening zips at the front and do look so touristy.", "user": "TreesDorset", "date": "October 7, 2005", "id": 3998999}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Cosy place to stay and such a kind stuff", "text": "The Peninsular Hotel is a perfest place to stay - I am quite often in Barcelona and I always stay at the Peninsular - the stuff is gorgeous - always friendly, always good to chat with - like a big familiy. - Yes it\u00b4s a cheap hotel, and the hotel can not be blamed, when guests come home late at night, making noise !", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 21, 2005", "id": 3794619}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "dont trust the staff here!", "text": "It not fair when guest grumble about the Peninsular - it is cheap, perfectly located, the rooms are clean and it is nonsens to expect luxury if you consider the low prices of the hotel!

When we arrived at the hotel there was building work underway and everything was very dusty. Our room certainly was very basic and monastic but clean. We were a little concerned at the lack of bedding as it was a cold weekend. When we requested more, we were told we could not have any until the next day. One of the great features of the hotel is its beautiful courtyard and atrium - shame it\u00b4s out of bounds to guests after 9pm. We decided to go and explore Las Ramblas - this really is a great central location although the street could be a little scary at night for women on their own. As we went to leave the room, we noticed that the window was open and when we tried to close it, we found that a large pane of glass was completely missing, giving direct access to our room from the roof! Having found what we felt was a nicer hotel just a short stroll away for only 10\u20ac per night more, we decided not to stay at the Pensinsular.", "user": "Javea03730", "date": "February 3, 2007", "id": 6738266}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great moderately priced hotel", "text": "We found the hotel by accident and it turned out to be a little gem.", "user": "sharon65", "date": "January 1, 2007", "id": 6532257}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Moderate hotel", "text": "Fabulous location a hundred meters or so from Las Ramblas, but away from the noise.", "user": "haiwaiyou", "date": "December 8, 2006", "id": 6347075}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic place", "text": "Hotel has a faded granduer feel and the central atrium was stunning.
