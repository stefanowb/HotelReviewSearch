He was absolutely wonderful and really hospitable. It's so nice to see such passion for your own establishment and we raved about the hotel to friends and family. We couldn't ask for a better level of customer service from himself and all of the staff at the hotel. We stayed in a suite, room 109 and it was fab with a roof terrace that had amazing views of the coastline and our own place to chill out. It also had a jacuzzi bath in the bathroom and rooftop shower, so you can leave your modesty at home but that's what makes Spain :) There are steps down to Burianna directly from the hotel too. I was getting married in Nerja and had a hair and make up trial on Saturday morning and they let me use their facilities downstairs for it even after check out time. They also presented us with a bottle of champers when we were leaving to check into our apartment for the rest of the week.

Upon arrival he were greeted by the owner who proudly gave us a tour of the hotel and showed us to our room. We had a sea view room on the upper floor, no 208, The room consisted of 2 seperate rooms, one room housed a setee, coffee table, fridge dressing table and a tv which didn't work. The front room which had a superb sea view had ample wardrobe space, a safe, double bed and a very large tv. The room led out to a large balcony which was shared with the next door room. The bathroom included a large air bath. The hotel grounds are very nice and feature a small pool, jacuzzi and a nice garden which has some sunbeds.There is a long flight of steps down to the beach which features numerous terraces with sun beds and ornamental pools and a fountain and provide quiet private relaxation areas. The hotel is rather dated in many areas but this doesn't distract from the overall enjoyment. Breakfast is a delight and features an extensive buffet which is enjoyed on the outside terrace. The position of the hotel is superb, be sure to get a seaview room as these enjoy fantastic views of the beach far below and the coastline.

Nerja is a wonderful seaside town with an old town area and a famous beach (check out Ayo\u2019s restaurant for amazing paella). This hotel sits on a cliff directly above the beach and is only 5 min walk from the town centre and about 15 min walk from the Alsa bus stop (easier to get a taxi) to reach Malaga. We actually used a private pickup service (Nerja Transfers) from the airport to the hotel (69 euros) and were taken over in a very plush Audi A8! The staff at the hotel are very friendly and welcoming. On this occasion we stayed in the \u201cPenthouse\u201d suite or Attico in Spanish. This occupies the top floor of the hotel and is huge! There are two large seating areas, a kitchen, dining area, two double rooms and a twin room (all with air con, doubles with flatscreen TV) and two bathrooms. The one with the bath has the better shower, the other bathroom for some reason was a bit smelly and could probably benefit from a plug-in air freshener \u2013 but this is fairly picky. The really amazing feature is the location, with huge windows facing out from the living room looking down over the hotel, the beach and brilliant views of the sea and mountains. There is a private terrace (same view) with sun beds and a dining table and retractable awnings for shade. The flatscreen Sony TV in the living room (with PC plug in point if you bring your own laptop to watch DVDs) has many English and German channels. The breakfast is decent with good choice. There is a nice pool and plenty of sunbeds scattered around the gardens, patios and also on the terraces that are spread down the cliff along the steps to the beach (private gate access). On the Monday, the hotel puts on a free barbecue with stacks of wonderful food and also free beer, wine and spirits \u2013 there is usually some singing and merry making to finish the evening off. On leaving, the hotel gave us a gift as thanks for staying there. This hotel isn\u2019t plush and modern as you see in so many modern (and fairly sterile) hotels, but it is clean, comfortable and has character.
