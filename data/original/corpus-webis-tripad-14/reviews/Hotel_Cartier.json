The hotel has a modern d\u00e9cor with comfortable beds and air conditioned rooms which are relatively spacious in comparison to other hotels in France. Across the road from the hotel is a little bistro called \u2018Le Biniou\u2019 which was very reasonably priced and quite tasty! There are an abundance of restaurants around this hotel so finding somewhere to eat isn\u2019t an issue. The only drawback to this hotel is the parking. It was a nightmare trying to find parking outside the gates of the old town. We drove around for over an hour trying to find parking as there are no spaces available for guests in the old town. We dreaded leaving in the morning time as we knew we would find it difficult to park on our return that evening. That aside, the hotel itself is very pleasant and reasonably priced, I would recommend it.", "title": "Nice Hotel in a Great Location", "user": "mgirishrover", "date": "October 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 47209227}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I travelled with my mother on a Brittany Ferry 'Stroller' break and chose this hotel because of the good reviews I had seen of it.
