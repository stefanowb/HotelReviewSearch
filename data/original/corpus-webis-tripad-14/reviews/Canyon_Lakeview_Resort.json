There is 1 bedroom with a queen size bed and they also had a set of bunk beds. The bathroom is really nice with a great shower. The kitchen has everything that you need for a short stay. Microwave, coffee maker, stove, fridge, oven and pots/pans/dishes. They even include all linens and towels. A very nice stay for sure. The A/C works quite well. They have a long porch with tables/chairs and several porch swings. There are many deer in the area and food is provided for you to feed them. They will come right up onto the porch and eat out of your hand. They also have an area that you can use to grill your meals. You are not too far from the water if you decide to go fishing or just take a swim. We would definitely stay here again. Just far enough from home to think you went somewhere but close enough that it is not a long car ride to get to.

I, too, had an awful experience with reservations. I was booking this trip for my mother and I. The date I booked did not work for her, so when I finally got through to reservations (the same day I booked) to change the date, they refused to accommodate me, stating that a change in reservation was the same as canceling (Groupon fine print with their 14 day window). I was just trying to change the reservation and still experience their resort, but they said I was out the money. The manager at Canyon Lake was not flexible at all.

Started emailing and facebooking and finally got a response- they had too many grouponers calling. The whole process of reserving a room took about 3 weeks. I was very flexible with my dates of stay, yet they were still unable to accommodate me (within the tight constraints of the groupon checkin and use by dates) . They told me that I had to spend an additional $100 to get in under their constraints, but I would be given a bigger cabin. I didn't need the bigger cabin, that's why I bought the groupon for the smaller cabin. So I spent the extra money, as I had money invested in it already. The pros on this cabin are that the views are quite lovely, the cabin itself was clean, and the hot tub was nice, and we had a good time feeding the deer. The cons: The reservation process, the extra money spent. The tape over the hole in the couch, the cracked tiles in bathroom and kitchen, the plunging of the toilet every time we used the bathroom(and yes, we only put toilet paper in it) and the leaking ceiling when someone took a shower upstairs. I would certainly not pay the full price of $550 per night to stay here.

Cabins C-F have a fire pit located in front of them if you want to do smores. The deer came out and greeted us as soon as we arrived. The kids LOVED this. The resort provides food for them.

Plenty of room to park the boat by the lodge. We used the hot tub everyday. It seemed very clean upon check in.
