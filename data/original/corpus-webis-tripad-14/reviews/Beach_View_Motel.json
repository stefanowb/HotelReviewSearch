The location cannot be beat for a 7-year old, because it is right next to Funland, the amusement park, and in the ocean block. We could see the ocean from our balcony. We greatly appreciated being able to park our car, change, and shower after being at the beach when we arrived very early on the day of our check-in. The continental breakfast is ample, and we also drank the complimentary wine at 5, and the chocolate chip cookies at 8! The pool is tiny, but my daughter still liked it, and we were there for the beach anyway. Very close to a bunch of good restaurants for kids (Grotto's Pizza, Green Turtle, the Royal Treat ice cream parlour). Very nice staff at the hotel.
