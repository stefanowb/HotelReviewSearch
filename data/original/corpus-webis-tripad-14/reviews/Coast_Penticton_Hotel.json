We were extemely surprised by the rooms. They have been recently renovated and are beautiful. The bathroom was one of the nicest hotel bathrooms I've seen in a while. The exterior could use an upgrade, but don't judge the outside of the hotel. The staff are extemely friendly. The pool could use an upgrade but was still in great shape. The hot tub and the waterslide were a big hit with the kids. We stayed in room 301, and had two double beds. pillow top with memory foam pillows. Highly recommended and great deal for price. We paid about $100 for the room. A few years back we stayed in Edmonton for 1 night and paid $150, and that place was a dump!", "title": "Beautiful Rooms!

The rooms have all been redone around 6 months ago, and they are great inside! My dad and I were in Penticton visiting family, and we were unsure where to stay as we stayed at the Ramada before and it was too loud. The Sandman had awful reviews so based on Trip Advisor, we chose the Coast. The front desk was very friendly and helpful, and we got a good rate as it was also off season. We had a one bedroom suite, which is smaller than it sounds but still perfect for two to sleep separately. Big screen TV, renovated bathroom, small flat screen in bedroom, etc. Quiet but of course, could hear people above slightly as with almost every hotel I have ever been in.
