On the whole our stay was excellent, but I will start with my major criticism. It's always nice to be able to get to the airport with the minimum of fuss after a long holiday, and the Hyatt with its free shuttle bus and proximity to the airport supposedly provided this. However, our experience was the opposite. After boarding the shuttle, we were then driven around the airport but the driver failed to take us to our terminal, despite us highlighting this to him; after a 20+ minute journey we ended back at the Hyatt. It was a busy Friday before the Labor Day weekend and taxi queues in the airport were lengthy. The driver started to pick-up non-Hyatt customers trying to flee the airport, and filled the bus to capacity. Once back at the hotel, the hotel manager seemed unconcerned by the fact that we had been on a mystery tour of the airport, which had unnecessarily delayed our international check-in. He tried to say that the bus can be used by anyone - an interesting statement in my mind - but even if that was the case, then surely not to the detriment of Hyatt customers paying good money to stay at the hotel. After insisting we be taken directly to our terminal, he then said the bus would need to follow the standard route, meaning that our terminal would again be the last drop-off. Customer service at its best - not - and it is unfortuntate that our lasting impression was a negative one. Fortunately, the driver saw sense, and took us straight to our terminal. On the positive side, the hotel was clean and tidy with very good facilities, including the pool and gym, although it is disappointing that a hotel of this standard does not provide complimentary Internet. Our room on one of the upper floors overlooking the airport was quiet with tremendous views. Breakfast was of a very high standard and we ate in the restaurant on one evening; the staff were friendly and attentive and the food delicious. River taxis were the most direct means of getting to downtown Boston, but use the 'massport' or 'T' taxis which are significantly cheaper than the others available. Overall, an enjoyable stay, let down by poor attention to detail and customer care by the management; the restaurant staff on the other hand were excellent.", "title": "Quality and Convenience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DesertDrifters", "date": "November 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 146516567}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012", "text": "Great location, patio dining is just fun.
