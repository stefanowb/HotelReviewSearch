Il Pereo is fantastically located, exit the building, turn right and you can see the Duomo, and to reach it takes less than a couple of minutes, absolutely fantastic.

If you are in Florence and want to spend lots of time in a bathroom then stop wasting your time and just go home. The beds were comfortable but the pillows a bit hard but that is just a personal thing. Breakfast was simple but good and the happy hour a nice way to end the day, before heading out for dinner later. We could buy large bottles of water at a very cheap price and fill the smaller ones we used during the day and you could get a good coffee and tea any time. The staff especially Lara were fantastic. They were helpful, with tips about restaurants, how to get to where you wanted to go, what to see or assisting with booking side trips. I would recommend this hotel.

The first thing after I booked the hotel, the owner emailed me asking me if I wanted to get a reservation for Uffizi and Accademia. For a small fee (that goes directly to the museums), it saved me hours of waiting in line for the ticket, so it was totally worth it. The hotel is probably a 5-10 min walk from the train station, and a stone's throw away from the Duomo. It's situated kinda in between the Accademia and the Uffizi, so all the major sights were within walking distance. When I got in, the owner personally showed me to my room. She spoke perfect English (I think she's English!) which helped tremendously in the communication. It was spacious and very clean and modern. The bathroom was a bit small, but you are not in Florence to spend time in the bathroom. It was clean and the water pressure and temperature was perfect. There's free internet as well. Free breakfast is ok, but I am not very demanding on the quantity as long as the quality is good. The owner also helped me book a trip to the outlet mall, which was fantastic and better than the ones I have been to in UK and France. Checkin & Checkout were quick and easy. My room faced the street, but the windows are sound proof that I didn't hear anything.
