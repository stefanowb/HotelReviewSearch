Our rooms looked directly into an adjoining hotel, with a dirt construction pit down below - no indication that you are at a tropical beach location. The guest rooms had poor ventilation systems, as did the public restrooms. (Upon returning home, even the clothes that weren't worn needed to be laundered because they smelled moldy.) The dining room was a zoo, with young children darting in and out of the buffet lines, and mothers trying to squeeze strollers through the closely arranged tables. Even though almost every table was still occupied at 10:30 a.m. when the breakfast buffet closed, the restaurant management turned off the lights and all of the fans to encourage the patrons to leave. Even when dining in the specialty restaurants, there is a rushed and noisy atmosphere.

It is the best beach because it has plenty of mature palm trees and swimming in the ocean is pleasant in that area.

I gave them a copy of all my paper work. Wasted nearly 2 hours and then \"no problem\" -go have dinner and we'll sort it out after. Not sorted out after dinner so said will see you in the morning. In the morning saw manager #3 who again asked for copies of our papers (emails) figured out the problem and basically said so sad where's your credit card and here's your bill for $800 US! Management saw the problem, recognized the tour company we were operating with, recognized this had happened before, and yet would not honor the rate quoted and instead said we would have to pay the rack rate of $400 per night (going up to $500 next month) and that was it. We left the hotel getting 1 night's rate credited back to our card after another hour or so at front desk.... The management there just doesn't care that it is a big deal for some of us to get down to Mexico and that a) online reservations should be honored, b) the rack rate should be disclosed before anyone gets a room key, and c) they wrecked this potentially wonderful holiday... that is a really big deal for us as we won't be down for some time again. The hotel next door was the exact opposite: simple but spacious condo rooms, clean, great pool,and very very friendly and helpful staff. It was called Playa Del Sol Grande and we were really relieved to still have the wonderful beach experience at a much more reasonable cost with good people.
