Rooms was very nice looking and clean. King size bed was HUGE!!!!! Jucuzzi was very nice, but could have used some detail cleaning and one of the knobs was broken off, but it still worked fine. Tv was nice LCD, had a huge armoire, very nice decor, no view though, just dead bushes from being winter. I was hoping to have a river view. Had a few drinks in the lounge on a Saturday night around 8pm-9pm and we were the only ones there. Bartender told us they don't get busy until all the crowds from everything nearby come in for the night. Ordered extra towels and pillows, not a problem and was delivered in minutes. Checkout was as smooth as checkin, took less than a minute and I was on my way. Hotel is easily within walking distance to the entire waterfront, easy to drive in and out of. Getting there, depending on the time of day can be bad with Pittsburgh traffic.
