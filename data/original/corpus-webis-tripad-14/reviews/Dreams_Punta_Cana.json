My husband, our 2 adult children and I enjoyed everything about the resort. The beach is also spectacular, and yes it does have rocky areas in the water but if you walked a little to the left of the resort you could play/swim in the ocean safely. The free form pool is amazing and you can access it from each building quite easily. There was some minor construction going on while we were there but it never bothered us in any way. The new owners are going to great pains in making this resort wonderful with added landscaping, walkways and coverings over the walkways. The food at the World Cafe (buffet style) was incredible with the hundreds of choices it offered. The \"French\" and Seaside Grill restaurants were excellent. The only warning I have is that the food at Himatsu and El Patio were very salty and it all tasted the same.

Once we arrived, all of our worries disappeared. Check-in went smooth, waited about 45 minutes at the bar and then went to our room. We stayed in room 6212 which is a club building right by the pool bar. We didn't have club privelidges, but for the 40 or 50 bucks a night it just wasn't worth it. We had the honeymoon suite and it was great, although we spent very little time awake in our room. There are plenty of restaurants to eat at. Our favorite was the Japanese restaurant. The rest were Ok and the Buffet always had something enjoyable for us.The pool, service at the bars, service at the restaurants, and the extremely friendy staff are what sets this resort way above the rest. These people work so hard all day and everyday, always with a smile. My spanish vocabulary is very slim and I never ran into a situation that was unmanageable. I would also like to give a special Thank You to Julio from the entertainment team. I don't know how he does it but be brightens the days of so so many people every single day. By the time we left we felt like we were leaving life long friends. And it wasn't just us, it was a lot people at the resort. It was very touching watching this 8 or 9 year old little girl hugging him good bye with tears in her eyes before we got on the bus to the airport. There Entertainment team really makes everyone feel special and are halarious as well. I can't comment on the actual shows that are put on in the theatre every evening because we always seemed to be busy doing something else. As far as the ride to and from the airport, the ride went smooth both ways and it's a reality check on how well we have it here in the US. If you really want to see the city I would definitely reccomend the ATV tour. It's about a 2 hour ride starting on the beach at dreams and along the shoreline then through some small neighborhoods and a pretty funny little store.

I can't believe that some of the reviewers stayed at the same hotel we visted. This March was our 9th or 10th visit to the DR, and our third stay at this hotel. Every visit has been fantastic! The staff cannot do enough for you, and they are very proud of their English which they have worked to improve over the years. Many of them, suprisingly, given the number of people they see, remembered us from previous visits and the registration staff have even greeted us with \"Welcome home!\" The food is at least equal to, if not superior to most of the other hotels where we have stayed ( and there have been many) - there is something for everyone - the variety and quality is excellent! Is everything like what we have at home? No - but if I wanted everything to be like home, I would stay home. The one thing I do agree with is that there is hoarding of the pool floats, and there were parents who even allowed their children to take 3 or 4 floats so they could stand up on them, or jump onto them. We asked once if we could have one, and the parent told us to go find another one. But that couldn't ruin the great vacation! Our room was very quiet and clean. Every day, we came back from the beach to find our bed decorated with flowers or animals made from towels. These people work very hard, and a kind word goes a long way. Any noise that we heard was from some of the guests, not from the staff. I remember a stay at another hotel where the cleaning staff would yell to one another in the hallway at 7:00 am. I never once heard a cart rolling or heard the staff in the hallways here. As to the beach, we walked several hours each day, and the beach was beautiful! The staff work very hard to keep everything clean for the guests, and they are constantly going around cleaning up the drink glasses and bottles left around by some of the guests. As to the sea grasses that washed up on the shore - how could anyone blame the hotel for that? There was inclement weather and rough seas, so it washed up. I saw the staff out there most of two days with huge trashcans and rakes trying to stay on top of it and clean it up as it washed ashore. We were there over spring break and Easter - the staff really tried to make Easter special for the children with the parade/show and with the Easter Bunny arriving on the Beach by helicopter. By the way, we did not have children with us, but we thoroughly enjoyed watching the Explorer's Club Team interacting with the children. The children appeared to respect and enjoy the staff, and seemed to really be having a ball! The activities group worked endlessly to keep people engaged - do they ever rest? We travel a lot, and our vacation to Dreams, Punta Cana is the one we always look forward to; we come home relaxed, rejuventated, and anxious for our next trip there!

The casino is a joke...it's the size of my bedroom at home and personally, I think there is some \"funny business\" that goes on there, so don't expect to win. The service is poor...drinks were brought to us at the pool or on the beach few and far between, and the staff (especially the front desk and concierge) are rude and don't care to treat you well. And, nobody at this resort seems to pay attention to details...little stupid, annoying stuff....like our toilet paper holders being broken in the room, the shower having a cracked, discolored ceiling, housekeeping \"forgetting\" to turn down our bed (and bring us towels) half the nights, the burger bars by the pool/beach being \"out\" of ketchup, mustard and other basic condiments three days in a row, the lack of booze poured into mixed drinks...those things are obviously not big deals in and of themselves, but add up to a frustrating experience overall. Some reviewers seemed to have enjoyed the \"entertainment team,\" but I don't see how...they were annoying, and responsible for \"Who Let the Dogs Out\" and other cheesy songs from a 1998 Jock Jams CD being blasted from speakers around the pool area. Lastly, the guests at this place seemed to be mainly families and senior citizens, with a few slimy 50 something year old drunks taking advantage of the all inclusive bar.

However, as we were checking in, there was a woman speaking to management (who was being extremely kind and tried to assist) about a problem she was having with her room. Whether she had a valid complaint or not (after hearing what it was, she did not), she was so rude and disrespectful to the staff it was embarassing. I just thought to myself \"these are the types of people that write horrible reviews and say everything was terrible - they can't be pleased either way!\" Our check-in was super easy and we had a swim-up room in building 5, which is closest to the lobby. My preference was to be closer to the beach but I really didn't mind. The room was a bit datedbut clean and comfortable. Not a fan of the swim-up rooms - a little too much activity for me. Everytime I went out of my room on the patio, there were tons of people at the pool across from the room. Not relaxing but since I am a beach girl, it didn't matter. And speaking of the beach, it was lovely. Never had a problem getting a chair, even when we arrived at 10/10:30. It never seemed crowded at all. However, though the beach is large, there is only a small section you can swim in. ne section is for snorkeling and one you can't get into at all because of the rocks.

After a long and very bumpy drive from the airport, we arrived at Dreams at around 6pm all excited to start our holiday. First impressions really good, lobby looked absolutely lovely and quite glamourous but very hot - but hey we were in the Caribbean what do you expect, hot climate is part of the reason for coming. Friendly hotel porters were quick to offload our luggage and label it ready for transporting to our rooms. Upon joining queue at check in desk we were greeted straight away by a friendly waitress with an ice cold glass of champagne or fruit juice if you preferred. This was a good start and made us feel very welcome, and this is where the good holiday feeling ended. Everybody seemed to be checking in ok and when we arrived for our turn (we were near the back of the queue) we had a sheet torn out of our ticket book and told to go and sit in the lobby area which we did and had a cold drink while we waited we assumed for the bellboys to take us to our rooms (we were a party of six adults, parents with two daughters and their partners). Well, we sat and waited and waited. After about half an hour we decided to make enquiries with reception how long we could expect to wait and were told that someone was going to come and talk to us. We thought this rather strange but went with the flow and sat it out for a bit longer. Another half hour passed, further enquiries and were told same thing again. Beginning to lose patience and finally after two hours sitting there with no explanation of delay decided to start stamping feet and demanding information. The senior receptionist finally came over and informed us that the hotel was overbooked and that there were no rooms for us (we booked this hotel 18 months previously, how could there be no rooms - they had known we were coming for long enough!!) When asked what was being done about it, the staff informed us that he would get back to us. Oh, no, this sounded familiar and yes, you guessed, we were still sitting there at 9.30pm hot, tired and with nowhere to go and the hotel staff just shrugging their shoulders. Well, tempers were flaring by now with the hotel staff just disappearing so we contacted our rep on the emergency number she had provided us with on the transfer coach (thank god, she had and not waited until the welcome meeeting). Fair play to our rep, she was there within 10 mins to help us and put her foot down with the hotel who had still done nothing to help us but ply us with free drinks which is all well and good but would rather have somewhere to stay. We were eventually at 10.30pm offered an alternative hotel which was a 20 min drive away (which actually turned out to be more like 45 mins). We were disappointed because we wanted to stay at Dreams having seen all the lovely pics on the internet and didn't know anything about the hotel we were being transferred to, but couldn't really complain as we had nowhere else to go. By now, we just wanted to get away from Dreams. They offered us to transfer for one week and go back to them for the second week which we weren't happy with (we didn't want to keep packing and unpacking, if we wanted a two resort holiday we would have booked one) but decided to accept just in case the alternative hotel wasn't very good but with the option of staying there if we preferred it. Preferred it, best thing we did - the other hotel was absolutely lovely and far superior. We also found out that another family had experienced the same problem and had taken the option to transfer back to Dreams after one week (they were transferred to the same hotel as us) which they did and regretted it. If you are planning on staying at Dreams, take a tip and check availability of your rooms nearer to your departure. It's a shame we never got to see the rest of the hotel and resort but with the attitude of the check in staff we have decided not to try Dreams again.
