It was spacious, with a huge bathroom, a small kitchen corner, and unfortunatly, a twin bed, but we knew that there was no double bed available for these dates. The only thing I didn't really like about the room is that it slightely smelt of dampness: the carpets, the curtains, the chaires. It also needed some renovation, the curtains, the couch and those kind of stuff used to be white and looked rather used and a little bit dirty. However the bed itself and the sheets smelt normal and fresh, so it was ok with me. I couldn't have slept in a bed smelling dampness, and I got used to the smell of the room too. The view from the terrace is fantastic, especially on good weather. You can take the chaires and the table out the room to have breakfast or a drink by your own on the terrace. The actully used the kitchen to cook very simple meals. There is a big supermarket close to the place. The only thing that lacked in the kitchen were small things like salt, oil, napkins, dish soap, things you don't want to buy for 5 days. However, it was enough to ask for that and we got it. We asked for the homemade jam and salad for our first self-cattering breakfast and had it all for free. I also recomend to try the breakfast served in the hotel itself. It was a great value. For 5 euros by person, you get all sort of homemade jams, eggs to order, pancakes, fruits and vegetables. It was really worth it. The animals (a couple of old dogs and a few cats) which have access to the public area are not ennoying at all. Even my partener who doesn't like animals didn't mind. The owner, Filomena, was very nice. She spoke French (we are French). We were also offered a promotional rate for a 5 days staying, although on the internet it was intented for a 7 nights staying. By the end of our trip I asked for homemade jams to buy and we were offered two huge bocals of pitanga and goyava jams for free, although I had the intention to pay for it. It was very nice. I would recommend this place. We hired a car, so we didn't have any problem with going downtown or close villages. There is no specific parking lot, but it's safe and convinient to leave the car just outside the main door, in a small street.", "title": "A welcoming place", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "anka4u", "date": "June 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16705989, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the service, the breakfast and homemade jams, the independence", "disliked": "\u2014 smell of dampness and need of cleaning of white curtains, carpets and coach"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with family", "text": "From the moment we arrived we were made very welcome. Filomena gave us a guided tour of the hotel and grounds. The view from our bedroom was stunning- looking over the sea with the sunshine all day. Breakfast was substantial with cereals, fresh fruit, bread and cheese and ham and even a cooked breakfast on request. The home made jam was terrific - made with fresh fruit picked from the garden. If required, lunch and evening meal could be obtained if booked that morning. All the staff were very courteous and were always eager to please. We were encouraged to use the private facilities of the hotel and had free access to the internet. There was a cosmopolitan air around the hotel - guests from Germany,Sweden, Denmark, France, Brazil, England and Scotland. On booking, guests had a choice of Self catering or bed and breakfast.
