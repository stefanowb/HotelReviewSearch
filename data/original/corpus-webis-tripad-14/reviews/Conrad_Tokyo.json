The concierge staff go out of their way to help in whatever way possible, which is very useful especially if you don't speak Japanese or if you don't know the city well. The rooms are slightly dated, but still well maintained and housekeeping is excellent and responsive.

We have stayed at many Relais & Chateaux properties, for example. This Conrad rates high on our overall list. The lobby is on the 28th floor and the hotel occupies floors 28-37. We stayed on the 37th, Executive Floor, next to the Executive Lounge. The decor is elegant and attractive. Special to us was the spaciousness and quality of the rooms, as well as the many amenities. The power shades were not only efficient, but they truly were room-darking. The rooms also were very, very quiet. So, we had superb sleep and could sleep late in a very dark environment. (The closet door did not block the hallway, as it occupied 50% of the passage.) We could not contemplate anything more for the room in this high-rise hotel in a major city. The restaurants we attended, for which separate contributions are placed on TA, were quite good in general, albeit not tops in Tokyo, except for the buffet breakfast at Cerise (see below). Service was spectacular: housekeeping, turn-down, information, restaurant staff, and concierge. Indeed, this hotel had the best concierge service imaginable. We got reservations at top, hard-to-reserve, restaurants with limited seating; excellent sumo and kabuki tickets; travel instructions/ directions; etc., etc. You just name it and these folks delivered with verve and efficiency. As for location, the hotel is around the Shiodome area, which is a short walk from the Ginza shopping district, a walk that can be done largely underground or on and elevated walkway. We had taxi rides of 15-20 min to all of the fabulous restaurants that we opted to dine at. As to the breakfast (see separate TA review on Cerise), yes, the Eggs Benedict mentioned elsewhere, which we were wise enough to not order, looked pretty poor on another table. But what can one really expect for this dish in Japan. My wife is an Eggs Benedict fan and they rarely please her anywhere in the world. The absolute best was at the NYC Plaza's Palm Court some years ago, and we have not had anything comparable since. You could smell the lemony Hollandaise in that dish from 10 feet away; it was perfect and there was plenty of it. The point about Cerise for breakfast are the great selections at the several buffet tables; an amazing diversity of food items! So, if you are staying at the Conrad, it is highly recommended that you stick with the outstanding full buffet. The free standard internet was adequate for all of our many needs, not slow, but we did not stream video. We could have had free premium internet, as Hhonors Gold people, but we had no reason to do so, and we used our computers and devices a lot.

Which leads to the biggest problem, the Gordon Ramsay restaurant: The food is actually pretty good (although I think the New York restaurant was honestly one notch better). However beware because, the service is very, very slow. The waiting staff try to act courteous, but really lack attentiveness. When we had lunch there, we ordered their recommended courses, but our finished plates were left on the table for over ten minutes, dessert took 30 minutes to arrive, and another 20 minutes for coffee. This is unacceptable in a busy city like Tokyo where guests would like to enjoy the atmosphere, but not spend the whole afternoon there. (We had to delay an important appointment afterwards.) But, the real killer was that during our lunch, the waiting staff were extremely courteous and prompt to their OWN hotel staff - as we watched a manager of the hotel who was dining some friend, arrive later, receive better service and finish eating much earlier than we did! I understand that the waiting staff would like to get on the good side of their boss, but this should not happen at the expense of other guests getting delays in their service. I consider that unacceptable and this really annoyed us.
