We enjoyed the hotel and would stay here again. It was tough arriving at 8 pm and lugging our rolling suitcases down the very bumpy and dark street to the hotel, but once we arrived we were happy. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations. On the street towards the center there are 2 good pizza places and one nicer restaurant, which is convenient. It is less than 10 minutes to walk into town, basically on one street. We liked the quiet location and did not find it \"shabby\" as another reviewer called it. It's just a regular residential district, which is less fancy and kept up than the downtown area -but I like that. The rooms were cheerful and the bathroom clean and fine.

Definitely a conservatory room, NOT a patio.
