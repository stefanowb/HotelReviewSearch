The concierge staff was very helpful in getting us into Central London in the most convenient and least expensive way. The breakfast that was included in our room price was extensive and the service in the restaurant was impressive. The fitness center and pool are very nice but the pool is so overly chlorinated that just being in the room for too long caused our eyes to burn. The ventilation in the pool area needs to be massively improved to make swimming a pleasant experience. Our room was large and pretty standard for a Marriott hotel.
