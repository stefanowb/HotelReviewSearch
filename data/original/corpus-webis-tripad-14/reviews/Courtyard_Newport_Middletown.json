We were visiting Newport for our Anniversary. This is a great location when visiting Newport as it is only 5 minutes from Newport and in an area full of restaurants and other shopping if needed. The room was clean and the $8.95 breakfast buffet was very good. It included waffles, bagels, toast, yogurt, eggs cooked to order, bacon fruit and several other items. It was very convenient so we ate there each morning. While the room was very clean it was on the small side (see picture). The pool which is both indoor and outdoor was also very nice. There also was a hottub. I would recommend this hotel for a trip to Newport.", "title": "Great place to stay when visiting Newport", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "BornToTravel", "date": "June 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5367646}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "We have stayed at the Newport Marriott and Newport Harbor Hotel & Marina. Neither is as good as the Courtyard in Middletown, RI. It is about 10 minutes out of Newport. The rooms, bed and bathrooms were clean, spacious, comfortable and remarkably quiet. A combination indoor/outdoor pool was very nice. The breakfast buffet offered a reasonable selection and was only $8.95 (it's double at the Newport Marriott). Free parking. Friendly and attentive staff. We were impressed when we saw the hotel General Manager, Patti O'Brien, helping to serve breakfast - - it showed a very guest oriented approach to service. Other hotels should take lessons from the Middletown, RI Courtyard.", "title": "Great hotel close to Newport", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "QualityTraveler", "date": "September 6, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3847126}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "This Courtyard is a pretty good value for visitors looking for a hotel close to newport but don't want to spend more than $300 a night.
