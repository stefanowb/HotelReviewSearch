When your traveling with children a microwave and fridge is a neccessity, they not only have that in the rooms but a dvd player and free movies. I could not have asked for a better weekend. Then when we checked out, they told us about there May LegoLand rates and since we have annual passes, $89 a night is so worth the stay.

The rooms have a small microwave & refrigerator. The bathrooms were nice & complimentary toiletries were given. Towels were in very good condition. The hotel is about a 40 minute ride from Seaworld & about 7 minutes to Legoland. They also have complimentary breakfast 6am to 9am. Good for free. One morning we had a gentleman who was very nice & made my grandson more sausages when none were there. Next morning was a woman who was always filling the breakfast bar.
