The location is by far the best of all of the hotels surrounding the marina, and the quietness of this somewhat vintage hotel was marvelous. They have free parking and it's close in! The staff is very courteous and helpful, the maid service is outstanding, and the marina view is simply breathtaking. There were a couple of quirky little glitches -- our phone didn't work (but we had cells, so it was no big deal) and the elevator went on the blink for a brief couple of hours, but other than that we had a wonderful stay and will definitely come back again. One day, we walked over to check to the \"big\" expensive hotel across the way, and found that place to be a little stuffy and impersonal. We were glad we chose our hotel instead.
