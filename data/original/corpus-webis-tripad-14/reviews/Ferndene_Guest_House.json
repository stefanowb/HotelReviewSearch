After reading all of the excellent reviews on here we were looking forward to our short break and from the moment we arrived at the guest house we were not disappointed. Both Christine and Richard were so friendly and nothing was to much trouble for them. We had a room on the top floor which was super clean with a lovely en suite. Within the room there was a list of local restaurants which was very helpful. One of the main highlights of this room was the wonderful views. The breakfasts were enormous and delicious and there was something on offer to suit everyone's taste. The location of the guest house is perfect and only a 2 minute walk into the centre of Keswick.

Firstly, Richard and Christine are so genuinely friendly and helpful it was like being at home with the family. Secondly, they've also made such a fantastic effort with the guest house it has to be THE best place we have ever stayed in. The room not only had beautiful views but it was immaculately clean and fresh and just so comfortable, better than home. Breakfasts were just out of this world, very local very fresh and very generous as per a previous review we too tried to not go over board the next day due to over indulging on the first morning. Location is perfect and the free parking is always a great convenience even if a little snug.

Our room was in the annexe and it wasn't the best. The double bed was almost the size of the room and there was little room for much else, including my husband and I to walk around. The bed looked like it was 2 singles pushed together. This was disguised by an old duvet underneath the sheet that we were to sleep on. There was an immediate smell of damp in the room and it felt very cold. There was only one little radiator in the room. The bathroom was smaller than an airing cupboard with a shower and a toilet. The wash basin was in the main room where we slept, so if you were getting washed or brushing teeth while someone was sleeping I could see this being annoying. There were tea and coffee facilities in the room. The cups weren't the cleanest and the kettle still had water in upon our arrival. The tea and coffee wasn't replenished. The shower wasn't cleaned daily either. As there was a water drainage problem in the shower and the water took ages to drain away, the soap scum was still visible on our so turn to the room at night. Breakfast was in the main house. It was very nice. Good ingredients and hearty portions. Overall, I was disappointed in this B and B. I have stayed at a few in Keswick and this is not the best I've stayed in. The breakfast was lovely, but at nearly \u00a3300 for just a nice breakfast and to be not looking forward to returning to our room at night isn't good enough and not good value for money.
