The staff is friendly enough, and the location is convenient to bus, underground, and train transportation. There are tons of other hotels and restaurants in the area, and the hotel did have a brochure listing about 10 nearby restaurants supposedly recommended by the guests-we tried a couple, and they were ok. Beware, however, that the Paddington area attracks some low lifes, who can be a hassle on the streets; when I was in one of the restaurants recommended by the hotel's brochure, one of these punks came in, started hassling me, and eventually punched me before running off.
