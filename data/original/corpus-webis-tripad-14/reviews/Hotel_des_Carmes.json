The headboards of the bed had a velvet texture but looked disgusting, there was no way I was going to sit up and read in this bed! The bathroom had a dirty greyish brown carpet and was sticky. I thought it was extremely unhygienic to have a carpet in a bathroom. The door into the bathroom was very dirty but nothing that a good scrub with soap and water wouldn't sort out. Why this hadn't been cleaned was beyond me. Our room was on the first floor overlooking the square, a word of warning, do not book a room at the front of this hotel! We could not sleep til after 5 am each morning with the noise from the square. The hotel does not have a staff presence during the night, guests are given a code on arrival which you must use to access the premises.
