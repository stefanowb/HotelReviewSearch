The apartment was luxurious, spacious, clean, and simply the coolest place we stayed at.

The Yazoo Pass coffee shop, next door to the lofts, is a newly opened space featuring fresh-baked pastries, strong coffee, and light meals. It has already become a hub of downtown activity with lots of sunny space where you can get comfortable, read the paper, or open your laptop to start the day. Morgan Freeman's Madidi Restaurants is half a block away if you are looking for truly fine dining, and for lunch, Ox Bow Diner is a block and a half in the other direction. There are other restaurants near by. These are just the two we tried and enjoyed. The Lofts feature free wi-fi internet access, a full kitchen, widescreen televisions, one and one-half well-equipped bathrooms, a comfortable king size bed, and a walk in closet.
