Checkout the view from under the bridge, or take a trip across it to Washington. The west wing has the room you'll want, and book a room on the river. This is the perfect spot for visiting Multnomah Falls, the dam downstream, go hiking or just chill out in the pool. Add a massage for more aaahhhh. Breakfast is included and it's delicious.

I wear earplugs anyway, so I had no problems. Ear plugs were supplied with the other bathroom amenities anyway.
