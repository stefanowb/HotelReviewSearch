Noticed they had a golf special, room and golf for 2 at $269, this was in mid june. As I am a preferred member, used their reservation line and got an even better price of $209, golf for 2 included. This is a great rate as non hotel guests are charged $130 each to play and hotel guests are charged $115 each. So we basically got the room for free. the front desk upgraded us to a lodge suite, a very nice room with living room, small kitchen with a lake view and great new bed. Bathroom was a little dated but renovated and very workable. The shower was really good. Had a late diinner at the bar in the hotel and the burger was excellent. The golf course is really nice and a lot of fun to play with some great views from the course. My only complaint is that they charge a \"resort fee\" of $25/day. I hate resort fees. But as a Preferred member, they gave me an $25 credit that negated the resort fee.", "title": "a great day of golf", "user": "tmd03", "date": "July 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133859729}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The place is really nice, and has a good feel inside.

Our children go to sleepaway camp in the Lake George area, and we decided to turn visiting day weekend into a mini-vacation. We opted to stay in the less expensive lodges,which are not far from the main building of the resort (if you ask to be put in Lodge areas 1, 2 or 3). It still isn't cheap, with tax and resort fees, just under $400 a night, but the hotel amenities, great service, and proximity to Lake George make it worth the price. The lodge rooms are very basic, it would have been nice to have a refrigerator in the room to store some drinks, but it was nicely air conditioned and perfectly fine. Even though the hotel has been around forever, they did a fantastic job of updating the main resort, spa, fitness center, and restaurants. They also added a beautiful pool that overlooks the Lake. The food and service by the pool area are very good. I got to the pool late one day, and the only lounge chairs that were left were ones without an umbrella for shade. I asked if there was any possibility of getting an umbrella by my chair, and a pool service person moved a very large umbrella for me over to my chair. It was very nice. They did that for other folks too upon request. My husband and I rented a small speed boat on the property and boated around Lake George for awhile. It was lovely. I had a spa treatment that was very good. I also used their tennis courts, which were well maintained har-tru courts. If you have kids, it is also a nice family vacation spot. There is an enormous Rec Room with mini-golf, a mini-baseball diamond, video games, ping pong, and more. There are multiple restaurants at the Hotel, all of which are lovely but we only ate dinner in one. We ate at the Pavillion which was right on the Pier of the Lake. The view was fantastic and the food and service were good- but not excellent to be honest.

We stayed in the lodges and when we arrived around 2:00pm and our room was not ready. The other families stayed in the hotel and their rooms were ready.
