We drove up & down Panama City Beach stopping in various hotels - but none of them felt 'right'. In spite of our fatigue we decided to continue towards Destin - and we were sooo pleased that we did. The Courtyard Marriott Sandestin was a soothing oasis. The young man at the desk was extremely pleasant and accommodating. The entire hotel is very clean - rooms are large & the beds are just what a tired traveler needs. The common space in the lobby is clean & inviting (& contains a computer with internet access if you don't have your own laptop). We used the free shuttle to eat at Mitchell's Fish House (food was wonderful & female bartender made fab drinks) - lovely evening so we walked back (it is not a long walk). Our plan was to drive to Pensacola the next day, however, we were enjoying our respite too much so stayed another night. Did some shopping at Grand Boulevard Shops - drove around the Sandestin properties & ate at the Bayfront Wharf & checked out some of the shops there. We are usually not fans of 'planned' communities / resorts but have to say that Sandestin seems to do it right - the place felt real & comfortable rather than planned & programmed. The grounds of the resort are gorgeous & perfectly manicured; staff everywhere were pleasant; good selection of shops & restaurants.", "title": "An Oasis", "user": "wisnat", "date": "January 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 23505347, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Loved everything", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing to dislike"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The staff at the Courtyard Sandestin go out of their way to help.", "title": "First Class Hotel", "user": "Paul A", "date": "January 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23382475, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Very Helpfull", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Free internet, nice clean rooms!", "title": "Wonderful hotel and experience", "user": "aggiejlh", "date": "November 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 22220601}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Sandestin is very nice and Courtyard Sandestin is a great base to see everything.", "title": "Very Nice Place to Stary", "user": "SiteSeeingInAmerica", "date": "November 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 21913617}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "5 or 6 very nice restaurants within 1 mile.", "title": "Loved It!", "user": "Faith128", "date": "October 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20968422, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location to Beach and Shopping"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Not crowded at all and very nice.", "text": "My husband and I stayed at this Courtyard the weekend before Thanksgiving.
