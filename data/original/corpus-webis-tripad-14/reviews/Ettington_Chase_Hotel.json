Upon arrival, the hotel did not have my reservation although I had a confirmation from the travel agent. They gave me the \"last room.\" Hotels like to say it's the last room, so I am always a bit skeptical. After a 15 minute checkin process I arrive in my room, 302. This was a diabled accessible room, which normally isn't an issue but it had 2 twin bed and a shower area vs. a normal shower. The shower would have been fine but the room smelled like a nursing home and it was quite dirty as I assume it doesn't get much use. I called and asked to be moved, after almost 30 minutes I was move to another room, 315, even though I had the \"last room.\" This rooms was smaller, but a standard room except it also had twin beds. Not wanting to spend much time in this awful space I went to the bar to meet some colleagues. The bar was nice enough and the service was good. That would be the end of good service for this hotel. Following our drinks reception we went to the restaurant. Given that we were approx. 80 people and most of us arrived at once, I expected things to be a bit slow, but we began a very weird dinner experience. Firstly, someone came to read us the dinner options from a pre-set menu, although other colleagues were allowed to order from the regular menu. Then the server took our room numbers, although the dinner was covered by the supplier. We then got water and bread, followed by dinner orders being taken from the limited options. We were now about 15 minutes in and no one had taken a drink order. Finally after dinner orders were taken, they took drink orders, however, the bottles of wine we ordered took almost 20 min. to arrive. The food began to arrive and it was definitely not worth the wait. One of the driest pieces of beef I had ever had (no one asked how I wanted it cooked), cold mash, and overcooked veg. The soup was ok. After a rather unimpressive evening, we all retired for the evening. The next morning at the very average breakfast of undercooked sausages, slow coffee service, and cold scambled eggs, we all identified that most of us didn't sleep well as the rooms were stuffy with no aircon and windows that only opened slightly. Curtains that did not block the 4:30am light, and noise all night from some kids staying in the hotel. The other thing that stands out to me is the poor lighting everywhere in the hotel. From the bathrooms in the bedrooms to the restuarant to the common areas it's all very dark. The aircon in common areas also doesn't seem to work well and I spent most of the day sweating. Overall a great conference but not a great venue. As a person who chooses venues frequently for my own business use, it did, at least, give me some things to make sure we never do or allow for our participants.", "title": "Extremely Disappointing!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "EP05313", "date": "July 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 133421871}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Booked this for a sisters weekend away, Had an executive room and a twin room and the difference in quality was huge.

Overall the hotel is fine but definitely not the 4 stars it claims to be and definitely not stylish. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place with a bit of character, I think a previous reviewer likened the hotel to a glorified travelodge and I think that sums it up nicely. Our room was in the block which was similar to a nursing home and was incredibly dark and dated. The bathroom was tired and we had no minibar in the room (again making me think of a travelodge). My main issue like others is with the reception staff. The hotel's website states that you can use superfast wifi access via a pincode from the hotel. When I asked the hotel receptionist for the code she said that there was none and was incredibly unhelpful. NOT great if you're a business traveller. Checking out took 30 minutes as there was only one receptionist and a huge queue. Why no one thought to have more than one person amazes me? BUT the nail in the coffin that convinced me never to return is being woken up on the day of check out by cleaning staff looking to service my room at 9.55 am on a Sunday.
