I took advantage of the excellent location, 1+1/2 blocks, to the Carre Opera House and snagged last min. seats to sold-out \"Le Mis\" ! The grocery and tram stop are nearby, plenty restaurants, with the Artis Zoo and Botanical Garden just few blocks away . I found the apartment cozy and bright, and LOVED the decadent spa/steam-room shower and comfortable, restful bedding. The stairs can be a consideration, especially to the top sleeping loft. There was surprisingly good wine & beer available, other drinks, gourmet Illy espresso/capuccino maker, fridge, microwave, dishwasher, lite dining supplies, etc. Claudia obviously puts a great deal of care into her innkeeping reputation and it shows. I never felt neglected, always pampered, (even when personal tragedy, death of Claudia's father, suddenly and sadly occurred during my stay). Both units have the same features with the loft sleeping area at the top being the only significant difference. I enjoyed the privacy and convenient features of an apartment with the luxury of a breakfast basket full of fresh goodies left at the doorstep to enjoy whenever I decide to wake up. Bliss.
