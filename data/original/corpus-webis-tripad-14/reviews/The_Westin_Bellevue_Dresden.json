Staff on reception really friendly, helpful on arrival, gave us tips of where to go, map etc. Dresden is a hidden gem - cobbled streets, lovely old buildings, great bars/resturants. Really recommend drinks on the roof terrace of the Yenidze (an old tobacco company in the style of a mosque) which gives you sweeping views of the city. We took a trip by train to Coldiz Castle POW camp - if you're doing this do the official tour - takes 2 hrs - absolutely fascinating. Also 4 hour boat trip up the River Elbe (fantastic views - if you're doing this - get on boat early to ensure outside seat). Really recommend the Westin and Dresden.

The woman at the front desk was exceptionally polite and helpful, from recommending where to eat, what the hotel offers, helping with map directions, to telling us about all the other Christmas markets in town (besides the Striezelmarkt). I have preferred status at Westins so we stayed on a nice quiet floor with an amazing view. The view was a free upgrade and while unexpected, quite a nice surprise. From our large room we saw across the river to old town (beautiful buildings) and it was beyond picturesque with the architecture, partially frozen river and glistening snow. Also we had the chance to get breakfast on Sunday morning, 2 people for the price of one. There was quite a spread of wonderful morning goodies. All around I would highly recommend the hotel. If you do travel in winter though notice that there are multiple temp controls in the room. We missed this after returning from our afternoon on the town, didn't realize that the control on the wall was simply for air, even with temp adjustment possibilities. The radiator on the wall was the way to get warm but we did not discover this till early next morning when I opened the curtains.
