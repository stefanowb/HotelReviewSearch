The location is remote - which is a positive if you are looking for peace and quiet in a naturally spectacular area. The accommodations are very clean, spacious and modern. The property is unusual as it is covered with gardens. The staff seem quite friendly. Be aware that if you book a Cavern room, you'll have to park your vehicle in a field up the hill from your room.

The Living Room and Bedroom is separated by a see-through Fireplace with the TV perched on the Mantle above it. The TV can be rotated to be seen from either the Living Room or The Bedroom. The Living Room also has a table and chair where the phone is and a place to put your computer. There is also a small refrigerator, a coffee pot and tea pot. There is a flagstone stairway to each Cliff House and adequate parking close by. The Pool is within walking distance and very relaxing since it is Saltwater rather that Chlorine purified.
