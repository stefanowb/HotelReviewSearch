Reception staff were really friendly and helpful - told us how to get to places and gave us internet sites for long term accomodation. Had buffet breakfast for $10 each, was very nice. Location is excellent - walking distance to chinatown, Darling Harbour, central station and CBD. I don't remember an Irish pub being downstairs but it's a large hotel so it may depend where your room is. All in all a perfectly fine stay - good value, great location.

I stayed at this hotel as a conference-recommended hotel and it seems like a fine choice for a budget traveler. In response to one of the previous reviews, yes the TV seems to be reception-only (no cable or sat TV) but there were a number of stations and as a US-expat living in Asia I enjoyed watching Letterman and USA morning shows at the wee hours of the morning \u2013 so the reception and channels were fine enough. The location is pretty good \u2013 you can easily walk to places like Darling Harbour and Hyde Park (both about 15 mins walk away). There were many and frequent buses right out at the street that take you directly down to Circular Quay (5 min bus ride). There are a ton of restaurants in the area \u2013 especially if you crave Asian food (there are plenty of non-Asian choices also). There is a major grocery store 2 blocks away \u2013 and keeping yourself well-stocked was no problem and very convenient. I was not a fan of the breakfast \u2013 the choice is somewhat limited. Although the setting is bright and cool, I only ate breakfast there as it was a convenience on working days. The young staff was very friendly and helpful \u2013 and after so many days I had a lot of contact with them. One downside was that some guests seemed to attempt smoking in their rooms (which is not allowed) and set off the fire alarm - - this happen at least twice and having to evacuate is not a pleasant experience. Overall, it was a pleasant stay.

Short walk to City Monorail and around 20 minutes along Pitt Street (the main shopping street)to Circle Quays Harbour and Opera House. Supermarket/ travel companies and internet cafes all around. As already reported reception is tiny but there was a locked room to store lugage. Staff helpful and friendly. Rooms compact with furniture looking a bit tired but nonetheless clean.

The location is rubbish - there is nothing of interest nearby. There is only ONE lift for the entire hotel to use which is utterly ridiculous.

When you walk into the hotel the first thing you see is tons of luggage lying around as there is no storage room. Anyone can walk off with somebody else's suitcase. The rooms was VERY small - the floorboards creak and the reception on the TV was appalling - unwatchable. The beds are uncomfortable.
