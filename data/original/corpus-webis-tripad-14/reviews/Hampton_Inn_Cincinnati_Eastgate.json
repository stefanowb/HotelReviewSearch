I called for towels on the first noght (only had 2 and we had used them after coming from the ball diamonds the first time) and was told they could not bring them to me but I could come get them. 7 people in line at the desk and no clerk, so I waited and when she finally returned I was told no towels, sorry maybe tomorrow.", "title": "Average at best", "user": "my2girlz2331", "date": "June 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 114496933}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The breakfast was very inadequate for the number of guests at this hotel.
