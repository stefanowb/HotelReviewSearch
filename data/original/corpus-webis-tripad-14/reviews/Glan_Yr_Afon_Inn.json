Paul, the chef, barman, and chief bottle washer seemed to be on duty from first light to last orders but always with a smile on his face and a quick wit, and always ready to be of assistance.

Chris and Karen are the new proprietors and the place had been decored to perfection! After questioning Karen as to who was now the chef we were delighted to learn that Paul the original chef was back on board and actually got to chat with him which was lovely. Karen is a lovely landlady and we chatted while there which I feel makes it appear so much more friendly and welcoming. We didnt stop for dinner but are going back on Monday night, tonight they had a wonderful set valentine menu for 2 adults for total \u00a335 including a complimentary glass of pink champagne! However the main menu was phenomenal, I talked to Paul (chef) about the time he was last there and his home made chicken nuggets or gougons which are on the childrens menu! He actually made a portion of these for our adult pickie eater and made them with beer batter and they were gorgeous! What I love about Paul is everything he makes is with his fine chef hands and its wonderful to know he's back. The menu has a good variance and if you can not find something on their for all palates then I dont know what you are expecting. There is also a fine selection of beers and my hubby was in his element knowing they had Directors but they also had a local brewed Flint bitter. I had lager Italian Birra Moretti absolutely gorgeous, but you had the norm also of Fosters and Kronenburg! The accomodation has all been renovated to a high standard! The restaurant is lovely and their is still an additional room to hire our for private functions! You can also eat our in the bar which is of comfy seating, and a wonderful fire in the lounged area with a log burner between the dining area and lounge! We will be back Monday evening to sample to food and from past experience a few years ago when Paul was the chef we could not fault anything! I have a very pickie food family, but this chef will put his hands to anything if you request it!
