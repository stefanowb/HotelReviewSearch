We arrived early but this was not a problem, they were able to get us into our room immediatly. The \"water park\" was really just multiple pools with various activities in them (waterfall, volleyball net, etc), there was one water slide and a lazy river (which was so lazy the kids wanted out). There was a nice eating area/bar with a ton of variety but very overpriced ($8.75 for a bloody mary in a 12oz plastic cup). The package included dinner at one of the restaurants. They lost our reservation but quickly arranged for us to be seated anyway. To our surprise the dinner was a buffet, which was not mentioned in the advertisement. It wouldn't have been bad execpt there were not a ton of child-friendly options. Me and my husband had the steak (yes, served on a buffet) which was terrible. They had some activities going on in one room of the hotel which was I assume the remainder of what they offered for their New Years celebration but we did not attend, at this point we were happy to go back to our room and watch movies. But when we got back to our room we noticed very loud music coming from behind our room. We couldn't see well enough to know what all the commotion was from but we thought it was part of the festivities that would end at 10 (according to the package deal). At 1:00a.m., when it still hadn't stopped I called the front desk to see if there was anything that could be done about this. They said they would notify security and couldn't even tell me what was going on there. Nothing was done and the music didn't stop until after 2:00a.m.! Turned out we were right next to a ballroom with a New Years party of their own going on. Needless to say, we got the worst night's sleep ever at a hotel. We got up early and left as soon as we could. We chose this place because they advertised a nice, low-key, family oriented New Years special that made it so our family could be together and we weren't out too late.

It is a huge place with several different sections for lodging and meeting rooms. Be sure to bring good walking shoes! The weather was unseasonably cold, but we still enjoyed walking around the area. They have beautiful landscaping throughout with ponds and pools. A big perk is the fabulous spa right next door. Superb massage!! There are also excellent restaurants within walking distant.
