Neighborhood is fine with a lot of cafes and restaurants within 4 or 5 blocks. Hotel is on a busy street. Location is good if you want to stay in Montparnasse neighborhood. I much prefer Saint Germain or Latin Quarter. My problem with this hotel was the room. The triple was the smallest triple that we had during our 2 week stay in Europe. We paid over $200, and the hotel had no charm, room was small, and we had view of back roof. This is not a charming hotel, service was unfriendly, and definitely not worth the price.", "title": "Not worth the price", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "bayhomes", "date": "June 28, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3618342}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "Stayed for 3 nights from June 14-17 in a family room that had two rooms with 3 beds.

Can't say anything about the breakfast, because we never checked it out - there are enough bakeries and caf\u00e9s in the neighbourhood. The area is nice and safe and everything is withing reach by subway.

Room 305 was very spacious, compared to our hotel in London. 2 single beds we pushed together, big windows, (Parisian style) air conditioning, night stands, a desk, mini fridge, and a small wardrobe. Yes the shower was a bit small and we kept accidently turning it off while showering, but the hot water never ran out and the nozzle was detachable. My hair dryer didn't work, but i had brought my own so I didn't say anything. One of the men at the front desk was a bit crabby so we tried to be brief and stay out of his way. I think we got one of the non-soundproofed rooms though. Even with the windows closed, we could hear everything on the street. We stayed on the same side as a previous poster, with the Pizza Hut down the street. We could also hear the people in the room above and my husband said he could hear the people below us \"having a good time\" if you know what i mean. We were in Paris after all!! I wore some wonderful earplugs though and didn't hear a thing each night while sleeping. So I recommend earlplugs...I loved loved the neighboorhood we were in, can't say enough good things about it, the metro and RER right there, Monoprix, markets, a Sephora, great cafes nearby. A quick note about the RER when arriving. Not sure if there was another way out, but the way we exited, you need to go left at the top of the stairs and walk a few blocks. It's also about 2 blocks down the street from the McDonalds, on the same side of the street. We ate breakfast twice at one down the street, got a huge breakfast w/coffee, oj, bread, croissants, eggs for 11 Euro i believe, plus great service! We arrived on a Sunday and walked around and there were alot of stores open and some outdoor markets. Buy some flowers for your stay--the French can grow flowers like you wouldn't believe! A word of advice for visiting Paris: take a step back from all the touristy stuff (of course do some of it) and just enjoy the city and the lifestyle. You won't regret it! As for the hotel, I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Paris!", "title": "Loved It!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "amandah72", "date": "May 30, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3511225}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "My wife and I stayed here for four nights in early May. I booked the room based on reviews on this website and am glad I did. The room was small, but there was plenty of space for the two of us and our five bags. We were very comfortable. The Metro and RER stations are very handy. The Metro is across the street, and the RER is just around the corner. You can get where you want to go quickly and easily. The trip in from CDG Aeroport is easy, but awkward with a lot of luggage. I noticed a lot of debate on whether to use the breakfast buffet. We tried a couple of cafes and bakeries in the area and decided the buffet at the hotel was best because you can get a second cup of coffee, juice, yogurt, an egg or a slice of ham, which can really run up the tab elsewhere. The staff was always courteous and helpful. If you book early on the Best Western website, you can get a really good rate. All in all, Le Nouvel Orleans helped make our trip to Paris a wonderful success.
