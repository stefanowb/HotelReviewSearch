The carpet was not new, and there were a few small cracks in the walls, so it wasn`t the new perfection of the Bellagio or other $$$$ hotels, but everything worked well. The shower had a high water pressure that made me understand why there is a water shortage in Nevada! I wandered the food court looking for a good place for dinner without success, but ended up enjoying an excellent quick meal with outstanding, friendly service in the Italian restaurant upstairs. The poker room staff were also uniformly competent and friendly. Yes, when I went to my conference at Wynn`s, the marble everywhere, the new carpets and fixtures were in another class, but still I think I prefer the casual friendly ambience (at 1/3 the price) of Bally`s.

Also, they ding you for early check-in. I've read a lot of Vegas reviews complaining about lack of free internet, lack of a kettle, etc. in most of the hotels. The simple fact is that NOTHING is free in Vegas. It is all about spending, not giving. Esoecially if you stay on the strip, you are a captive of major enterprises.
