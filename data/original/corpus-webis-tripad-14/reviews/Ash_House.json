Tiny en suite....shower not working on arrival and stayed that way for the two days of our stay this resulted in trekking through the house for a wash. Smell of cat food constantly pervading living quarters. Cats running over kitchen work surfaces! Breakfast was ok-ish. No sense of being welcome - bordering on disinterest. Very disappointing and would definitely not recommend this B&B.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "DebJD", "date": "August 24, 2008", "id": 19301721}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled solo", "text": "Ash House is a super B&B on the edge of Holmfirth, the town famous for being the setting for BBC TV's Last of the Summer Wine.
