The hotel is set up like a prison where the rooms face in toward an open balcony. There is an open courtyard that runs from the top to the bottom floor so every bit of noise echoes throughout the floors. We were on the 7th floor and could hear guests in the LOBBY! We could hear guests running and jumping above us, below us and up and down the hallway outside our door. After patiently listeneing to the ruckus for over 1 hour, I called the front desk to complain and was told that they would send security to ask the guests to be quiet. Two hours later the issue was still not resloved. I then went down to the front desk and asked to be transferred to another area hotel. The manager asked me to stay promising me that they would comp our room and that the noise issue would be handled. Sadly, after an hour of waiting, there was still no reslove. So at 12:00am at night I had to pack up my 6 month old twins and truck ourselves to another hotel. They could'nt pay me to stay at that hotel again! It was the worst experience I have ever had with any hotel from the noisie to the terrible customer service.

The Sheraton was a clean, presentable and comfortable stay, located in downtown Springfield. The property is an older one but seemed to be well kept. There were assorted restaurants in the mall accessible from the lobby which was handy. Room rates for the weekend I stayed were higher than I expected and nearly 3 x that the following weekend under the same booking codes. Can't speak to the internet other than it was expensive, like $15 a day which seems well out of place in today\u2019s wireless world. Also noted that parking was another expensive fee considering the location of the hotel. Dinner at the sports bar downstairs was comparable to eating in an airport in the way of cost and value. I stayed down the street in a Homewood Suites property the week after my stay here and had a much better experience and found much better value for my money.
