Having stayed at a number of B&Bs in my travels, I can honestly say that I have never been made to feel so at home and a part of the family.

However, it was the extras provided by the staff where this B&B was truly outstanding. A marvellous welcome upon arrival - being greeted with a cup of tea is always important to an Australian! The wine and cheese discussions in the evening with heaps of vigorous \"liberal\" politics debate with Laura (A good glass of red after a lot of walking, again very important to Aussies!) . Great tourist advice and eating recommendations. Fresh and simple breakfasts with the host and other guests around the dining table in the morning.
