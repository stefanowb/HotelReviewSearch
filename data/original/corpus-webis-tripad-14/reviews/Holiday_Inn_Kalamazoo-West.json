We were there as part of a baseball team for a tournament, and the staff was very accomodating - helping us set up an impromptu pizza party on the patio, for instance. We were able to book a block of rooms. The pool was great for the kids. Everything seemed really well taken care of and clean. The rooms were small - two double beds for a family of four. The bathroom was also smaller, but for the price we paid the value was great. Again, everything was clean. Elevators were prompt. There was a great restaurant that offered kids free meals with an adult meal purchase, we used it for the tasty breakfast buffet.
