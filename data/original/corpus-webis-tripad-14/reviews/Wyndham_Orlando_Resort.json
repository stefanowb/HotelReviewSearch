We waited 2 1/2 hours for the rollaway and when I called housekeeping they said they would be there soon! and then hung up on me. Finally 4 hours later the bed arrived. Day 2, no clean towels, when we called housekeeping they said the machine broke down and they had to limit the towels. 2 hours later we received 3 towels from them. Day 3, our bed was changed but they put on dirty sheets with cigarette holes in them...we called and complained and after an hour my husband took the sheets to the lobby(which was crowded and let everyone know what was happening). Man...housekeeping showed up a hurry after that and changed our linens with clean sheets this time. Day 4 we didnt want to take a chance on the sheets being dirty so we kept our do not disturb sign on the door, when I called and asked if we could get clean towels at least they said they would bring them righ up. 3 hours later they finally arrived, and the woman apolagized but said that the person had said that he delivered them hours before.

I spent 7 nights with a family of five. I had adjoining rooms in building 10 which were spotless and spacious, one was fully carpeted the other had beautiful wood floors with area rugs. The bathrooms aren't the most modern, but they were very clean and well kept. The grounds of the resort are immaculate and serene, the staff as usual were super helpful and always friendly. The resort has 5 pools, and even though the weather was in the 90's most days they were never overcrowded and chairs and towels were always available. The hotel is right on I-Drive with all it's traffic, but you would never even know it. We did Disney and Seaworld while there, and the hotel provided a free shuttle to Seaworld which left on time and picked us up at the park on time. It worked out better to take a cab to the Disney theme parks, cost around $30 each way. The hotel had a paid shuttle to Disney at $15 per person, and you had to call 2 hours ahead of time so they could pick you up at the park, cab ride much easier. Housekeeping did an excellent job, always had lots of towels which was very important with 5 people. My only complaint would be that because the property is so vast, and building 10 was all the way to the other end, it literally took 10 minutes to get to the lobby and front of the hotel. Taxis are allowed to drive right in and let you off at your building, and when we didn't feel like walking we'd hop onto the golfcart with the bellman and he'd take us right to our building. Everything is right nearby the hotel or you can hop on the trolley for $1. Food and ambiance at Ming Court, Bahama Breeze and Wild Jack's is excellent. Also try Tony Roma's on Mondays, it's \"all you can eat\" rib night, as well as the Premium Outlet mall, great stores and great buys. Don't listen to the negative reviews about this hotel by some people, go see for yourself.

I do not know what I was thinking booking this hotel, located on the busier end of I-Drive right next to Ripley's Believe It or Not. This \"resort\" truly is undeserving of this title. My room was one of the few that you had to enter from outside, like a motel. It was also facing the street, which allowed street noise to filter in the room. The room was old and in need of renovations, evidenced by the stains on the loveseat and bed throw, the chipped paint and scuffs on the walls and doors, and food crumbs stuck on the promotional info cards on the nightstand. I had to fight with the door to get it open because of a warped door jam. There is a very bright light on the patio of every room that you cannot turn off. The curtain in my room would not completely close, so it might as well would have been daylight in the room when I tried to go to sleep for the evening. The bed was as hard as a rock. The pillows were also too firm and very uncomfortable. The sheets were so thin and stiff, I thought I would get a paper cut. My toilet made a flushing sound every hour on the hour. I did go to the front desk and ask to change rooms, because I couldnt stand it anymore. I should have left. While they did accommodate me with a slightly better room, I still could not wait to leave in the morning. I expect a 3 and 1/2 star \"resort\" to have a certain level of quality (not luxury obviously, but at least comfortable) and this was underwhelming at best. I did not see the rest of the property, so I cannot comment on anything except my room, which is comment enough. I left in a rush and later in the day realized I kept scratching the back of my neck.

The room smelled a little musty, but it was not too bad. We opened the sliding door to get the smell out. The back sliding door of this room looked out to a pretty lagoon. The front door opened up to an interior corridor. The bathroom is very small with one sink. The faucet was backwards, cold water was to the left and hot to the right. Same as the bathtub. By the end of the week we got used to it. The tub was a bit old and had marks in it making it look dirty. There is a safe in the room big enough to put your laptop in with a charging station. Our room did not have a fridge but my friend's room in Block 14 did. Bed was comfortable enough, although it was nothing at all like my Tempurpedic at home. Decor was okay, just like you see in the pictures. I spent a lot of time at the pools. Two large pools and hot tub are in the middle of the complex along with ping pong and pool tables. The largest pool had plenty of seating and shade. There is also a small kiddie pool, bathrooms and a restaurant called Gatorville in this area. Pool #2 was slightly smaller but still big. It had an ice cream & coffee shop beside it and also the health complex. The workout room is pretty well equipped and had more than what you would normally find in a hotel. There was a guy doing P90X in there and several others on the machines who seemed to enjoy the room. Spa services were also available. The 3rd pool was called the West pool and was at one end of the resort, outside the restaurant Augustine's. This pool is not heated so I was able to enjoy a whole day being the only one using it. Everyone else was at the other 2 heated pools. There were plenty of nice lounge chairs and tables at all 3 pools. Breakfast buffett at Augustine's was $12.95. It was pretty good, nothing bad there. The Convention Center was nice and big and had free internet access. They have a free shuttle going to Universal at 8, 10, and noon. Housekeeping knocked on our door 9am every morning and were very kind when I wasn't ready to leave the room. One morning, the housekeeper must not have heard me answer her knock because she walked right into the room with me standing there in my underwear. She said sorry and excused herself. Scared the crap outta me but I got over it. One thing I didn't like was the strong smell of bleach in the tub. Oh well, at least it was clean.", "user": "CosmoMaui", "date": "January 11, 2011", "id": 92492533}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Minor problems...but quick fix!", "text": "The airlines had broken the latch on my hubby's golf bag. He called front desk looking for some pliers at midnight. They were gonna try to find one for him. In the mean time, he went outside and saw a worker on a golf cart. Hubby asked the guy if he could borrow some pliers or a leatherman. The guy was so nice and stood outside in the hall helping my husband fix his hard shell golf bag. 10 minutes later they were done. Hubby gave him a $5 tip just for being kind and the guy thanked him and said he wasn't expecting anything.", "user": "Travelbug10210", "date": "January 10, 2011", "id": 92403656}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Comfortable mid range motel-style accommodation just off I4 and I-Drive", "text": "So overall, my fears were put to rest about this hotel. The hotel is nice in some areas and okay in others. It's a fairly large complex but still walkable, and the grounds are pretty. There were people always working on the grounds every day. It wasn't the most swank hotel I've stayed in, but definitely not the worst either. Just middle of the road. If Wyndham updated everything, then I would be able to say that this place would be awesome. But until then, it's fine.

BUT my husband crawled in bed and started inspecting the sheets and found a black thing...I told him it looked like a dried up mascara, and he pulled back the sheets and a HUGE spider crawled out!! We called and requsted new sheets at like 12AM it took them 1hour @least to change the sheets for us. The next morning we asked to change rooms, the manager was very nice and moved us quickly...with an upgrade! Side note: The room next to us was under construction and that is where the spider probably came from. We probably will not stay here again but it is a OK property and needs a few upgrades the rooms are very noiisey and you hear EVERYTHING at night. The staff were very nice and fixed what they could. Another thing I was not pleased with...NO WIFI in the rooms. Plus you have to pay for the regular internet $10 per day!! the breakfast buffet is like $12.50 a prson and it is not that good!", "user": "Cashewfeni", "date": "January 2, 2011", "id": 91469457}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 474, "average": 491, "very good": 644, "terrible": 527, "excellent": 358}, "aka": "Wyndham Orlando Hotel Orlando", "slim_ranking": 0.759878419453, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "description": "The Wyndham Orlando Resort welcomes you to an unforgettable stay in the heart of Orlando\u2019s famous theme parks and attractions.
