Montaneros is located in Lionshead, there are great restuarants, bars and ski rental located next to the building. The gondola is only 150 yards away. Once we arrived we never used our vehicle again. Everything is located within walking distance. Vail Village is also a short walk, if you get tired of walking you can hop the bus which will take you back to Montaneros door step. This is our first visit to Montaneros since they remodeld the exterior, it looks very nice. We stayed in unit 208 which looks like it was completely remodeled too. We have booked the same unit for our next trip.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 1, 2005", "id": 3237517}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Vail"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 7, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 42}, "aka": "Montaneros Condominiums Hotel Vail", "slim_ranking": 0.0909090909091}
