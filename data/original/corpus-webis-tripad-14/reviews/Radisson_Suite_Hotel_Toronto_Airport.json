There were 2 tv's and a desk to work on a laptop. We were resting and wanted to watch some TV on and the remote wouldn't work at first then after working the buttons a few times it started to work a bit. I wanted to use the wifi, set up my laptop it connected fast but there was no visible outlet around the desk, had to move the couch to get to the outlet. We had the adjustable numbers beds and it was comfortable. In the morning we were going to have a shower and the slide in the spout to direct the water from the tub to the shower head was stuck, my wife couldn't move it up and I had a hard time but got it moving and I kept moving it up and down till it was freed. In my opinion the room hasn't been used for a while. When we checked in the staff were very friendly, helpful and check in was quick.
