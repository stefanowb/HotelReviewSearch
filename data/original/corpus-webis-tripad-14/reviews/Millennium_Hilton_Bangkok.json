Not sure placing sun loungers in the water a good idea since very limited place to put your belongings and easy to drop your book or mobile phone in the cold water. Sun loungers uncomfortable and hard to adjust. No complimentary water service. Large, modern and excellent gym at the same floor. Hotel entrance impressive. Flow restaurant with stunning river views is excellent! Really pretty d\u00e9cor. Tried their buffet which was outstanding. Cheese room alone is worth exploring! Recommend to take one hour private canal tour organized by hotel on their own boat (not longtail).
