My husband and I have stayed with Bruce and Jeanette four times in the past two years whilst researching and realising our retirement plans and every time has been as good as the others. We have slept in two of the four bedrooms on offer and both are exquisite, immaculate, comfortable and offer those extra touches that epitomise Bruce and Jeanette's thoughtful hospitality. I have no doubt that the other two rooms that we haven't stayed in are just the same. Breakfast is the stuff of fantasies. Afternoon and evening tea trays in the garden room are always on offer as is advice and information about local facilities. They have booked restaurant tables on our behalf and even rustled up information about local house prices. They have returned to my home address forgotten items left in a chest of drawers before I had realised they were missing. They had the good grace not to look horrified when we announced we might be neighbours! I recommend West Acre House and the hosts, Bruce and Jeanette, unreservedly.
