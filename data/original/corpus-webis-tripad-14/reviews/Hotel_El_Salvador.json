Rooms are quite small and a little on the musty side, the shower pressure is very poor and soundproofing is non-existent. We were kept awake all night due to our \u2018neighbours\u2019 snoring and the next guests that moved in knew we were from Australia because they could hear us on a telephone call. There are no fridges in the rooms which makes it hard to keep any food. There is also no air-conditioning, which wasn\u2019t a problem for us as we were there in winter but I would imaging the rooms would get hot during summer.", "title": "Bearable but glad to leave", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NTLibran", "date": "December 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 23118862, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 You get what you paid for.", "disliked": "\u2014 Poor shower pressure and non-existent sound proofing!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled solo", "text": "There is a Metro station about 3 blocks away from the hotel but as first timers to Mexico City we didn\u2019t find the location was all that suitable to tourists, the hotel is situated on a street of electrical shops \u2013 if you need a remote control, a TV or a memory card you are set, however, if you are after food, a laundry or anything else you will have to venture further.
