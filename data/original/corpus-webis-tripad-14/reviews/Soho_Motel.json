The location was very convenient - an easy walk to the city center and close to the hospitals. The room was very small - there is just enough space for the bed and 2 bags. The mattress was on the firmer side, although fairly comfortable. There was, unfortunately, no fan in the bedroom which would have been nice to drown out the city noise! There was also no fan in the bathroom, which got very steamy after a shower. The shower had a very fine line between hot and cold water, you had to get the tap in just the right location which was a bit annoying. If you like to have an extra pillow to sleep with you'll have to ask at reception, as the only extra ones were the decorative type covered in not-often-washed covers.", "title": "Decent hotel in great location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "a_wanderer777", "date": "November 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146396391}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have booked Soho for 2 nights stay via agoda.com.
