As for reading other reviews both myself and my family were not treated as gringos but welcomed by all staff who went out of their to be helpful and friendly.

This was a business trip, we were attending a career fair at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez. My boss and I shared one of the deluxe rooms. It was spacious to say the least and had a great view. We had two king size beds in our room. Continental breakfast was included but unfortunately we had to be out of the room for work before it was served each day, we were told they would bring a bag of food to our room but it never showed up. We were also sad that we never got to use the pool because it was only open between 10 and 7, we did not return to the hotel until 8 each night. The tiki bar was awesome, bartenders were great.

I cried when it was time to check out and the sweetest girl who worked there handed me a Christmas ornament that said Villa Cofresi Hotel on it.

Hotel Cofresi has that older hotel feel but is maintained and staffed at a high level. The hotel is located right on the beach and has a medium size pool that was kept very clean. When I was there it was staffed by a lifeguard. My room was clean and well decorated with teak type furniture. From my room balcony I had a clear view of the beach and ocean. An incredible sight at sunrise. The best part of the hotel has to be the bar, right by the beach. The bartenders/ grill cook are amazing. The night I was there, the bartenders kept providing me with cold Medella, even though the bar was packed.
