I was pleasantly surprised mostly because I wasn't really sure what to expect going to a smaller town like Spokane. There are two things that I would mention. First, there are two different buildings across the street from each other. One is a historic (but modern and renovated) building, and the other is a newer tower. Just be clear on which hotel you are booking at. I didn't realize this when I was booking and checking-in. I actually thought the historic building was code for old, but it actually was in great condition. It had obviously been modernized at some point, but they still kept the charm of it being a historic building. By having two separate buildings, there are actually lots of amenities between the two, and you have access to all of it. The other, more minor but annoying issue was that their irons are awful. As I said, I was there for a conference, so I wanted to iron my shirts. The iron in the room didn't glide smoothly over the shirts. It stuck to the material and ended up ironing the creases into my shirt, that I couldn't get out. So, I called for a different iron. Another iron was brought to my room. It also had the same issue, but this one oozed this brownish liquid that stained my shirt. I was able to clean it out, but now my shirt was a mess. I called for yet another iron, and this one was at the very limit of sufficient but would likely soon no longer work as it should. So, come with a backup plan if the irons aren't any good in the room. Maybe get them pressed somewhere nearby if you have time or bring a travel steamer to steam the wrinkles out.
