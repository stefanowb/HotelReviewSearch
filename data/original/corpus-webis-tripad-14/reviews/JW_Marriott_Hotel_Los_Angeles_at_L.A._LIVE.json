People who requested a late check-out were only given an additional hour but the staff handled the check out process efficiently for the large number of people attending the conference.

The bellman was very nice and helpful as was the valet. The staff at the reception desk were very polite and service oriented. My request for a high floor was accommodated and the room was very clean with a city view. We hd access to a concierge lounge on the fourth floor which provided free food and beverages. I attended a conference while my family stayed behind. Unfortunately there is nothing to do for kids in the immediate area, but there are several restaurants. One day I needed something from my car, and the valet attendant took me in a golf cart to my car to retrieve the item. Each time I took my car out, the valet attendant got it very quickly. Joy at the concierge desk was wonderful and helped us book a tour the same day. The hotel was quiet. Each day housekeeping checked what time my family was leaving the room and returned to clean it later. It was really a wonderful sty and I highly recommend this hotel.", "title": "4 Nights at JWMarriott for Conference", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Angie F", "date": "February 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153118975}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed 4 nights at the JWMarriott in LA as I was tagging along w/hub.

Hotel itself is beautiful & the rooms clean/spacious. Ours had a mini-fridge which was AWESOME b/c I almost had a coronary at the $25 chicken salad avail at the hotel! Walk 3 blocks over to Ralph's Grocery Store & stock up. Also, we had great view of JLive area, but our window/room was part of a lighted sign on the building. This means there are bars across the windows that block the view. If you care, make sure to ask for a room not a part of the sign. Workout room is awesome!

I imagine that taller hotel guests would really appreciate this. Also, the room had two complementary bottles of water that were replenished daily. The room decor was west- coast modern...some orange furniture mixed with some more classic pieces. I never ate at the hotel restaurants, so I can't comment on those. There is a Starbucks right outside the back doors of the lobby for anyone like me who really depends on their latte fix.

Service at the bar very slow and laid back. Food at the restaurant was just terrible- went there only because there arent many options in downtown LA.

They gym and spa were part of the Ritz Carlton located next door so they were very nice although the spa was quite expensive. The Executive Lounge is normally not open on the weekends which could have been a big issue but our meeting organizer arranged to have it open for our meeting.

When we asked for directions to a shopping area they sent us 8 blocks in a very \"shady\" area where their were street vendors. Not quite my idea of a shopping area. We also were told to ride the Metro to get to Long Beach. Not a big deal to us, but it would have been nice to have been tipped off on how long it would take 1.5 hours and what areas we would be traveling through.
