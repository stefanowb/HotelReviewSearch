Than we had room 809- super!!! big room, nice view, they left a lot of towels for all of us, Breakfast was incredible good- Fresh Orange Juice, cheese ( a lot of), ham, everything- and the staff at the entrance of the restaurant - very nice. Internet is expensive. But we were in holiday so it was perfect- bus nr 19 is in front of the hotel- you can go to city center and to the Railway Station (Nord Renfe) , nr 20 -to the beach. Museum of Arts & Science- 15 min walking - Comercial Center &Carrefour- 15 min walking.
