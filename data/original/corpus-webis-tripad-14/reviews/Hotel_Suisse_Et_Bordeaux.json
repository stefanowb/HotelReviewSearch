The hotel being just next to the main train station and walking distance from city centre and all the attractions is very helpful. The tram/bus stop is just next to the hotel too. The breakfast is average but feels expensive. Its a non-smoking hotel which is a good thing for non smokers. The single rooms are a little cramped. I once returned to my room with my window open after room service. Open window had made the room very cold in winter! They have old fashioned heaters which do not heat the room very well. The bathrooms dont have heater in them. The shower was fine but the shower curtain did not contain the water very well and the footrug in the bathroom got wet. I wish they had more modern plumbing. The toiletries provided were not of great quality. Hairdrier and steam iron were provided by reception upon request which were good. Overall, I would say its conveniently located but overpriced.", "user": "Dudnic", "date": "December 4, 2011", "id": 121392987}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Rhone-Alpes", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 12, "very good": 8, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 0.647058823529}
