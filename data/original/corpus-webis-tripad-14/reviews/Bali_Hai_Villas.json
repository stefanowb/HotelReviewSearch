I was a bit concerned by the negative reviews but we had no choice as we got it from a time share exchange given to us by a family member. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked into our 2/2 condo. New appliances, very spacious rooms and comfortable beds (even the couch that our younger daughter slept on.) If you're looking for a sunny ocean view- this isn't the place. If you're looking for a comfortable place to relax after a long day of sight seeing, surfing or snorkeling- this is great!

There is a grocery store five minutes drive from the condo and it is the same distance to the magnificent Bali Hai Resort which has probably the best patio to eat dinner (or go for a drink) and watch the sunset anywhere on the Island.
