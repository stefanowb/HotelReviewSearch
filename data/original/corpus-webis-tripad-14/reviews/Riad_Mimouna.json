The riad sits right along the sea wall. Rooms facing the ocean have really cool weathered, pane windows that open to allow in the fresh sea air and cool breezes. The strong surf breaks on rocks about a hundred meters from the hotel, making for spectacular views and sounds, making even your room a great place to just hang out. We sat for nearly two hours with the windows open, bathing in the cool breezes and the crashing waves.", "user": "HopGod", "date": "November 7, 2012", "id": 144893470}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Stunning Views and Lovely Riad/Hotel", "text": "If you are into that sort of thing, the riad has in-room television and does have wifi, however, you can't use it in the rooms. You have to go into the lobby but there is plenty of lounge area. The showers are about the same as all that we have found across the country: A good supply of hot water and a detachable shower head that has been detached a few too many times, probably because most Moroccans haven't adapted the western practice of standing under a shower head, but there are no issues with the facilities, whatsoever.", "user": "PandDBlackburn", "date": "November 6, 2012", "id": 144723614}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent service", "text": "The rooms are nicely furnished with a simplicity that fits Essaouira perfectly.

If you are in the mood for wine (and Morocco has some really good wines, lemme tell you), you cannot order them from the menu, but a discussion with local taxi drivers can get you directed to places that will sell it, and the riad allows you to bring it in and consume it.", "user": "kpod2", "date": "October 26, 2012", "id": 143781291}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Hotel, amazing sea views", "text": "Beyond the restaurant is the roof top, which gives an excellent view of the old city and the ocean.

The room, with 2 windows facing the sea, and 2 more facing the side of the Riad and city walls, gives you a 270 degree view of the city, the beach and the fabulous crashing waves ! The views from the Terrace are also spectacular. Breakfast is above average - the usual breads, orange juice, coffee, tea, cake etc plus yoghurt, cheese, boiled (or other form on request) egg, bottle of water. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Wifi is available in the Reception area, but not in the Rooms. There is also a PC in the Reception area for free use by guests.

It had all we needed - comfy bed, chairs, wardrobe space and the bathroom with shower was fine. It was heavenly to lie in bed and watch the seagulls flying past and hear the waves crashing on the rocks below. The breakfast was plentiful - baguettes, Moroccan bread, croissants/pains chocolats plus boiled eggs, yoghurt, cheese, jams, cakes, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee - it kept us going all day...The room next door was a suite - much more spacious but you don't come here to stay in your room and there's so much to see/buy that you could spend your money better in the medina! The location is absolutely fabulous and we did not find a better place to stay. True, if money is no object you could stay at the Heure Bleue Palais for \u20ac300 a night but it does not have the authenticity of a Riad and at three times the price, more or less. The team on reception were great with tips on where to buy the best quality goods. Wifi in reception is fine - there are plenty of areas where you can sit and the fact that it is not in the room is really not a big issue - life is for experiencing not wasting holiday time on emails!
