The hotel was wonderful and the location was so perfect ! If you want to be close to Times Square, the theatre district and the Empire State Building (all two blocks away), this hotel is for you. Plus if you plan to explore the city like we did, it is within walking distance of so many attractions and is only 2 blocks from the subway for the things that you can't walk to. Speaking of subway, we took the subway from JFK ( sooo easy) to the 42nd St station - came up the stairs and just walked two blocks east and there was our hotel. We checked in, went to our room, and held our breath as we opened the curtains - there it was, the view of the Empire State Building as I had requested on my reservation! We both did the happy dance! It was especially neat at night when it would light up in red, white and blue lights in honor of Presidents Day. So when you submit your reservation, make sure and request a view of the ESB! The room was really nice, especially the bed! It felt like we were sleeping on a cloud - with an amazing featherbed and fluffy down comforter. It was great after a full day of sightseeing. The staff were so nice and helpful - they were happy to give us directions and and gave us great recommendations for restaurants and bars. P.S There is a great Irish pub right next to the hotel :-) We would also recommend taking the Grays Line Double Decker bus tour (catch them at Times Square) which was a great way to see all the attractions and sites in Manhattan because you can get off and back on as much as you like. Make sure you get a seat on the top if it's not too cold! The room was a lot more than we normally spend on a hotel but it was worth every penny for the nice, clean room in fabulous location!", "user": "Livelife2fullest", "date": "February 27, 2008", "id": 13897803}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was a great hotel for my first time actually staying in New York. The location could not be better, we where right in Times Square. Everything was in walking distance and the subway was at the end of the block. This is a perfect place to stay if you don't want to hear the ambulances or police sirens going off because you are slightly off of the main street but only by a few steps. The concierge in the lobby was great for site seeing info. We didn't get a chance to do the bus tours, but we did our own site seeing via the subway which was not bad at all once you learned which way to enter for the subway trains. The rooms were nice, we stayed on the 2nd floor ,and of course we didn't have much of a view, but that was ok. The room was more than adequate and clean. The bathroom was a nice size and very clean as well. On check out, we asked for a late check out, but of course because there we so many people before us asking for late check out, all they could do for us was 1pm but they stored our luggage in the hotel at no additional fee as we continued to explore New York further.
