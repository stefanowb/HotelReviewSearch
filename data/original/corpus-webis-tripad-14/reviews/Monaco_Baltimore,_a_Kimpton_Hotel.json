We also loved the fact that we could control the temperature of the room instead of just having the air either off or on. We were also glad that the room had a flat screen TV (like what we have at home), and that the cable was NOT limited (like it is in other hotels). In our entire three-day stay, we only left the room maybe three times; out of those three times, we only actually left the hotel once. The other two times we left our room, was to eat at the hotel\u2019s restaurant (where the food and service was exceptional) and to explore the rest of the hotel.

Our room was a two double bed room. The room was cozy...a little small, but we didn't feel crunched in. The room had a \"bonus\" room, which was very odd. The bonus room was empty and really had no function as it was very small and probably could double as another closet. The bathroom and room were very clean, even spotless. The kids enjoyed complimentary cookies and milk in the afternoon. The hotel also had a Wii gaming system available in one of the lobbies for the guests to use. The hotel is very close to most attractions. We walked to Camden Yards for a Baltimore Orioles game. The Ravens stadium is just a little further, but certainly within walking distance. The National Aquarium and the Inner Harbor are also just a short walk from the hotel. The B&O Brasserie Restaurant at the hotel was clean and had courteous service. They ran a special where kids eat free through the summer time... BONUS! Took other Trip Advisor's recommendations and parked around the corner in the public parking.

The room I was in, AC worked flawless. Very comfortable in the room. Also, tried room service twice (late night), both times unavailable. But they gave us numbers to places that delivered late, problem solved. There was a dog, so i'm assuming its pet friendly. But the quesion is, would I stay there again? Without a doubt, YES. Would I recommend it to others, I'm telling you to give it a try. I'm not picky, so unless you are, this hotel is above and beyond.", "title": "Plesant surprise, Plesant People, Plesant Stay.

Our check in was quick and easy and our room was extremely clean and comfortable. It was quiet, cool, and the bedding was wonderful. I'm a bit OCD when it comes to hotel rooms so I even double checked and there weren't any bed bugs!
