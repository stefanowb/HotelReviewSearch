It was a 5 minute walk to the train station, which was very convenient for us, but to get downtown was about a 30 minute walk. The hotel in itself is pretty nice, there is a cute lobby and a handy luggage storage room for when your train comes in early and your room isn't ready yet. Our room was pretty much average. It was clean and a good size (a 3 person room), and had an actual bed instead of a pull-out couch for my daughter (3rd person) to sleep in. The bathroom shower was excellent, because it had one knob for pressure and one knob for exact temperature (35 degrees, 40 etc.). The bathroom door wouldn't close, probably because of the high humidity in Germany it had expanded and couldn't be shoved into the frame. It didn't really matter because we were all family and would just not go into the bathroom if we knew someone was in there, but it could get uncomfortable if it were two friends staying there instead. All in all, this was an average but very conveniently located hotel that I would recommend to anyone planning on taking the train the next morning.", "title": "Very Convenient, Average Rooms", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "dogbone1002000", "date": "August 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5589812, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Bathroom door wouldn't close"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Depends on room", "text": "This hotel is within easy walking distance to the main train station.

The second room for our kids, #309 was so small someone had to get on the bed so the second person could go by to the bathroom.
