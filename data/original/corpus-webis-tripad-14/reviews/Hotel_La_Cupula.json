This place is only 5 minutes walk from the bus drop off. We had a double room and it was by far the best place we have stayed in in Bolivia. The room was perfect and we even got given a small heater. The showers were hot and just outside we're some hammocks to chill in the sun. The views are spectacular too. We ended up eating at the hotel 2 nights in a row as the food was excellent. Ask reception for the hot spa as its an awesome way to see the sunset. The spa is located outside overlooking the bay. Very friendly German owner who was very helpful.
