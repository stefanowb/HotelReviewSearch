It's 20 min by taxi (DK 180-200) or a 10 min walk tot the nearest metro station. The managers/owners are very, very friendly; the reception is very enthousiastic and personal, it's like you stay over at a friends house. The location is unique: the hotel is located in the main river of CPH right next to one of the 2 main bridges that connect east and west CPH. It's only a 10 min walk to the city centre and most interesting places to visit. Right next to CPHLiving is a floating restaurant Viva which is quite alright. The rooms, altough not extremely spacious, have a very smart layout, all necessary is there. Comfortable bed, good shower, clean and offcourse brand new. The (introduction) price of DK 1,000 (apprx Euro 145) per night is worth every penny. Even if the prices would rise after this introduction period it's still value for money. No restaurant facilities, but enough choice in the direct neigborhood.", "title": "Great place to stay in CPH", "user": "TheDutchFamily", "date": "October 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 45781490}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Next time we visit CPH we will return to this hotel, no doubt.", "title": "Stylish and comfortable", "user": "Shlumptyknees", "date": "September 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 41515096}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Please don't tell anybody about this hotel, otherwise it will become to popular!", "title": "the must amazing hotel in copenhagen!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TSh_9", "date": "September 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 39655954}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Hotel CPHLiving was a real find at about \u00a3100 per night for a stylish, immaculately clean floating hotel with views of the City, close to transport links to the airport. The decor is simple but of a very high quality. Wet room bathrooms, firm beds and quality linens. It was a pleasure to wake up on the water with views from your bed. The river (or inlet) is fairly industrial in appearance due to it's shipping past but attractive on a sunny day none the less. All attractions are within easy walking distance. There is a restaurant next to the hotel called Viva which is also on a boat. Lovely food and wine, lively atmosphere with great staff. Ideal if you want to treat yourselves on your first night without putting any further starin on sore feet after sight seeing. The canal and Metro is 3 minutes, Nyhavn with it's pretty restaurants and lively bars, 20 minutes. Tivoli 10 minutes and shopping district 15 minutes, all on foot. The local area is residential and has it's fair share of alcoholics but the road outside the hotel is quiet during the night and we didn't worry about security at all. The deck of the hotel is a nice place to enjoy a free coffee in the mornings while planning your days activities and there is lots of tourist information and usually someone to help in the reception. If nobody is around, they leave their telephone number on display and miraculously appear shoud you need them.", "title": "Floating Hotel", "user": "Toronto_lassie", "date": "August 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 39088519}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "It was my first trip to Copenhagen, which I found to be an attractive city with plenty to see and do, whetever your tastes or interests. Great museums and galleries, plentiful restaurants and lots of lively bars for post-dinner drinks until whatever time you choose. I would recommend that you see Tivoli at night with it's lights as daytime is a little dated and crowded. Another must do is a Bruch in Nyhavn or if you want peace and quiet, on The Lakes.
