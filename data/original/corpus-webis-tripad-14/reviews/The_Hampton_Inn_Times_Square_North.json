We walked to Central Park, Lincoln Center, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and Broadway and Off-Broadway theatres. The a/c is silent and not the type that has those noisy blowers. There is free wi-fi and complimentary breakfast (although the lines for breakfast are very long). The bathrooms are on the small side but are very clean. In fact the entire hotel was immaculate. Free coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and fruit are available all day in the lobby area. The hotel is near some excellent restaurants, and there is a grocery store nearby if you want to purchase things for your room. The beds are very comfortable, and the flat screen TVs also have a nice choice of channels. We did not use the concierge, but she was always assisting guests with suggestions for tickets and museums.

Complementary breakfast was good too, not too keen on the hot dishes , but plenty of fruit, juice,toast ,bagels and muffins so there is something for everyone. The hotel is close to everything, as you come out of the hotel door turn left and walk straight up the street and you are at Columbus Circle at the beginning of Central Park, the park itself is beautiful, with lots to see it is worth taking a bike trip with one of the guides, we would recommend Kenny from the Gambia, he told us everything about the park and it was really interesting, once you have been on the bike ride you know exactly where to go and spend time at your favourite parts of the park. Also turn right from the hotel door and walk one block, cross to the left carry on down the street and you are in the middle of Times Square and Theatre Land so close to everything. If you are looking for good food and friendly staff I strongly recommend the Harmony View bar & grill which is situated between Broadway and 8th Avenue.
