Boy, what a treat this place was! We're not big fans of resort areas, but we loved this hotel. The architecture and design elements were amazing, the view was spectacular, and the service was great. We had a brief glitch at check-in when we were given a room that hadn't been cleaned yet, but no big deal -- that happens sometimes, and we were just grateful that they were letting us check in at all because we arrived considerably before check-in was allowed. They immediately moved us to a prepared room, and later sent a bottle of champagne to the room (I presume to apologize for the inconvenience, even though there was none). The grounds are beautiful. The way the hotel is built, guests in effect have their own private cove, and it's lovely. It's quite perfect for people who don't need the hubbub of a true resort, because you are isolated from Ixtapa. But, if you want the hubbub, a quick cab ride can get you there. Some of the food was lackluster (a poolside lunch was really fairly typical of hotel food, which is a shame for the price), but other food was memorable (the $20 US breakfast buffet that includes tip).

I was on the 11th floor, which is pretty close to the beach, but doesn't have much of a view of the beach because of the trees. The lobby bar is beautiful. People were generally nice. They do seem to come by at odd hours. Someone came by at 10pm to see if I needed more towels. And a maid came by at 7:30am the day I was checking out. It is kind of far from town, which makes it harder if you're trying not to taxi everywhere and I found the front desk staff not that helpful when asking about where to catch the bus.

In my opinion, the previous two reviews are very accurate. Las Brisas is architectually stunning. It's so well laid out that you forget it is a fairly large hotel. The private balcony with a spectacular ocean view is worth the price of the room alone. We were on the 15th floor and had a great view. I think rooms on the lowest floors would have views compromised by trees (floors 10 and 11, perhaps). We also requested a room that was in the west wing of the hotel. These rooms are closer to the stairs leading to the pool area ( a lovely, lush walk) and the restaurants. Our room was very clean and nicely appointed. The shower leaked water onto the floor at times, but this is a minor complaint. The mattress was too hard for my husband, so we rectified this by sleeping on top of the down duvet, instead of under it (which was sometimes too hot, anyway). The service during our stay was exemplary - I wish we could get service like this more often in Canada! We went with the all inclusive plan through Air Canada. It is a great deal, even if you choose to eat dinner outside the hotel. Food is very expensive at Las Brisas ($ 4.50 for a large bottle of water, $ 5 for drinks, $ 10 for guacamole etc). We got room service for breakfast one day, and the bill was almost eighty dollars! So, the all inclusive paid for itself even if we just had breakfast, lunch and snacks at the hotel. It also eliminated the added stress of worrying about how much we were spending every time we wanted to order something. We loved the Brisas II for dinners when we did choose to eat at the resort. The Italian restaurant is very good, too. Make sure to try the mango flambe for dessert. It's not on the menu, but you can request it. The only caveat to this glowing review is that there are conventions held at this hotel. During our stay, a large Mexican group took over the hotel for a few days and disrupted the laid back touristy ambience that usually prevailed. Loud music one night, microphones on the beach, and very busy at breakfast. Not good. On our next trip to the Brisas, we will check with the concierge, in advance, and try to work around any large gatherings.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "darthestar", "date": "February 27, 2008", "id": 13897056}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Las Brisas de Ixtapa is a lovely hotel - prior to staying there, our favorite hotel was Hilton Checkers in downtown LA.", "title": "Las Brisas is fabulous and I am somewhat picky", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "ADJPDX", "date": "February 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 13742368, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The atmosphere (design aesthetic, service, beach).", "disliked": "\u2014 The bed was very hard and the restaurants were pricey."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Las Brisas is Charming, Romantic & Relaxing!", "text": "The service is top notch at Las Brisas, the grounds are jungley with windy stone and paved paths (lots of gorgeous stairs, but there are elevators too) and the restaurants are very good (though pricey).
