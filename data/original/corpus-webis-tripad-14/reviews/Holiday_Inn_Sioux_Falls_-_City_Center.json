The hotel and location was really nice and appreciated the complimentary wireless internet access. We stayed on the 8th floor and had a balcony overlooking the downtown area. The Holiday Inn Sioux Falls staff was wonderful and gave my wife a ride to a nearby store. The kids enjoyed the pool and we ate in the restaurant several times because it was a little cold outside. All the downtown stores are really unique and within a couple blocks of the hotel. We plan to go back sometime in the summer because the front desk said we were located right next to Falls Park and a bike trail.

My room had a small window with a view of the roof of the porte cochere and was obviously used for storing extra furniture, because it was crammed so full I was unable to open the drawers in the corner armoire. The mechanical noise from the HVAC system was very loud; I had to use earplugs to sleep. I never would have accepted this room if I hadn't paid only $48 a night, and I seriously doubt they'd even offer this room to anyone they considered a real guest. The hotel's elevators are VERY slow and the public areas reek of cigarette smoke because the bar is open.

It is exactly what it is, a 3-star Holiday Inn that has been around for awhile. That said, having just stayed in a 3-star old Holiday Inn near downtown Raleigh the week before, I can say that this one in Sioux Falls was much better. In what way? Well, the lights in the room worked, the AC worked, and the free Internet access worked! Our room was clean when we arrived, and kept clean by the hard-working staff. Check-in was friendly, and I love that they don't require a credit card to be kept on file, if you have prepaid as we had, via Priceline. We got a better deal for it off Priceline ($45) than we had via Hotwire for our stay at this same location in November of 2008 ($59) and in January of 2008 ($65 via Hotwire). We find this hotel to be consistently friendly. This was the first time we have tried breakfast in the hotel, and I love that their food prices are very reasonable, especially since most hotel restaurants are expensive. We did not get the breakfast buffet, but I believe it was less than $9, and that included chef-made omelets from the kitchen. We wanted a lighter meal, and they were happy to oblige. Service and food were both excellent. Bar prices are reasonable at this hotel also. Another rarity for hotels. Free parking, also. A very rare thing for downtown hotels in general, but it would be odd for a hotel in Sioux Falls, I would think. Still, it's nice to not be charged for what should, imho, be standard for hotels...parking and internet.", "title": "I like this Holiday Inn", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LovedToronto", "date": "May 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 29693099}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I love the location.
