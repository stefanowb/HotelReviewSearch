It is a great place to relax and unwind, and would be a fabulous setting for a yoga retreat or similar sort of vacation. The staff is very friendly and helpful (owners are USA-born, so it's easy to schedule your stay and ask questions), and the spa services are inexpensive and convenient (I recommend the facial). The only thing that was unanticipated was how close the property is to the Pan-American Highway, which is convenient (it's a $1 cab ride or a 15 minute walk to Vilcabamba) but does mean you may hear traffic along the road occasionally. The food at the restaurant is good but not spectacular (soup and salad is always a good bet).

In a word it is a destination..relax and enjoy. Swimming pool, Spa and resturant are all above average. The staff is bilingual and always helpful and attentive. The owners live on the property and are engaged in the daily operation. The Kitchen is immaculate and the food stuffs are fresh daily. They grow much of their produce and fruits..you will see fruit trees outside you cabina. The bread was so good I got a loaf to go..baked on the property. The menu is excellent (under priced vs quality) and we only dined out once (lunch) away (disappointed with what was touted as a great Mexican spot).
