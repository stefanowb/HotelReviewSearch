Used the KAL limo buses from Incheon airport, 15,000 won. Efficient and comfortable. Stopped right in front of the lower lobby door. Hotel reception was polite and efficient. Check-in was quick. The room was a nice size, bed so comfortable and the bathroom amenities (Hermes brand soaps and lotions) was a nice touch. We requested a computer in the room, and as platinum member, it was brought in at no charge. There was 2 bottles of complimentary water plus nespresso coffee and teas in the room that were refilled every day. Breakfast down in the ARIA restaurant was included. Many selections. It was quite busy when we stayed here. Had one breakfast in the executive lounge, limited sections but was sufficient to satisfy our morning hunger. Also visited the lounge at the evening happy hour, thought the refreshment choices and the wines served was excellent. Westin Chosun is conveniently located in an area of many shopping and restaurants. The subway station is close by but it is a nice walk to many destinations. If you want to exchange money, do it at the Namdemun market which is close by. You can get a better rate there, many places to change money , so get some prices. Overall a very relaxing stay in Seoul, will be back again.", "title": "Rest and relaxation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "alank1101", "date": "April 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 128367755}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I have been returning to Westin Chosun for 25+ years and still find that no other hotels in Seoul come close; I will sometimes choose Grand Hyatt for its pool in July, Shilla if I have a car and a driver for the stay, Park Hyatt for meetings in Kangnam, but my first choice is Chosun.

With the boom in the economy, many have followed in recent years and often this poses a difficulty for the 'old' hotel - which can then lag behind in decor, technology and innovation. Not so the case with The Westin - which remains at the top of its game. You can tell there has been extensive refurbishment over the years, as the product looks super throughout. Smart, stylish Lobby, matches the impecible staff and service. The rooms are a generous size, with everything you would expect from a five star hotel (my only complaint would be that they charge for WiFi). There is a great range of restaurants and bars and although the pool/gym was being refurbished when I was there - alternatives were in place to keep guests happy. The Executive Floor offers a nice private lounge environment - perfect for breakfast, business meetings, or a sunset drink. The location is also superb - being close to both the business districts and Royal Palaces. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
