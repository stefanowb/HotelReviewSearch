The Majestic was warm and cozy...great service and the feeling of truly getting away without really \"going away\" was wonderful. Perfectly located...steps away from the beautiful beach and in the other direction a quaint little town with shops and little eateries (go to Nagles for any meal and especially the ice cream!).
