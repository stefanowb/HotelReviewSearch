I wondered for a while if it was even the same hotel I stayed at. I booked this hotel because I had a very early morning flight and just wanted a place near the airport. I did hardly any research on Newark Airport hotels but figured the nicer hotels would be more then I wanted to spend, and having stayed at Days Inn before they were always good enough for me. I payed about 80/nt or so, which for Days Inn seemed a little high, but oh well. Upon check-in I was greeted by one of the rudest front desk people I have ever met. It was if she was doing me a favor by checkin me in. She was very snappy and not helpful in the slightest. My room was large, but as bland as possible and stunk of smoke. ( even though requested non-smoking). The bed had some questionable marks on it, and there were sticky stains all over the counter tops. The lighting in the bathroom was unsually bright, which normally would be good but this was the kind of the bathroom where you wanted to see as little as possible. Shuttle service was prompt and friendly, so that was worth something. Two months later I again had to stay at Newark airport for an early Sat morning flight, this time I researched and found about 20 other hotels for nearly the same price. The Hilton i stayed at was a world of difference for 10$ more. My advice, stay somewhere else.", "title": "Were you people at the same hotel?", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "icem2829", "date": "February 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4564272}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Don't be fooled by the exterior", "text": "Don't be fooled by the drab exterior of the Days Hotel, by Newark Airport.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "mrpink7", "date": "February 14, 2006", "id": 4460205}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Newark"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 12, "average": 65, "very good": 207, "terrible": 17, "excellent": 121}, "aka": "Holiday Inn Newark Airport Hotel Newark", "slim_ranking": 0.0952380952381, "description": "Announcements The Holiday Inn Newark Airport is now accepting reservations for arrivals after April 17, 2011."}
