It's a great country inn with two rooms on the first floor, set in a quiet hamlet within easy driving distance of a handful of lovely Cotswold towns. The shower room is a little small, but this is compensated for by the excellence of the shower itself. The bed was very comfortable-almost guaranteed to give you a great nights sleep and the room was very pleasant, including tea & coffee & complimentary bathrobes too! We were welcomed by landlord Jamie, who was a genial, charming, interesting and friendly host, who did all he could to make us feel welcome and ensured we enjoyed our stay, which we did in every way. He runs a tight ship and its clear every guest is valued. Make sure you try his rum home brew - you won't be sorry!
