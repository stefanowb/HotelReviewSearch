The buffets always had a nice selection of fresh fruits and vegetables. I also appreciated the changes to the daily menu. The specialty restaurants didn't offer better food, but the dishes were beautifully plated and it was nice to be waited on. I don't understand the reviews that criticize the food so harshly. Everything was very fresh and pretty tasty. I wasn't expecting Jean Georges every night. Also, I had no problems booking reservations. There was no line, I just walked right up to the guest services woman and booked reservations for the whole week. It took about 3 minutes. Los Olivos, the Mediterranean restaurant, was the best of the three, I thought. I was always stuffed to the gills afterwards, but some people have complained about the portion sizes. If that's an issue, you can always ask for another portion or just run to the buffet or the pizza place, La Piazza, afterward.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 22, 2005", "id": 3492599}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "lovely property, musty rooms", "text": "I'd never been to an all-inclusive resort so I was a bit apprehensive, but I think I might consider it again in the future.

OR there was a WEDDING RECP. going on there. We had 2 ADULTS AND 2 TEEN AGE BOYS. They asked for another meal (BECAUSE PORTIONS ARE VERY SMALL) and they said NO. So every night we had to go up to the pizza place, wait to get our pizza 30-45MIN. I thought ALL-INCL was as much as you want?? AFTER 10PM the only food AVAILABLE IS THE PIZZA PLACE. Nothing is already made to go. You have to WAIT FOR EVERYTHING. The BEACH LUNCH you have to sit down W/SHOES,SHIRT, SHORTS AND you can't take food out of THE REST.
