On all three occasions the rooms were very clean and looked recently updated to some extent. The staff seemed to try to be helpful when asked. I was placed in a wheelchair accessible room and after I left the office the manager came out and informed me she had found another room for me. The gesture was very nice. The breakfast was not much, just muffins, nutri grain bars, coffee, and apples. The location is nice, right by the freeway, but not close enough that any noise is heard. The bed was comfortable. The one thing that I did not like is that the TV was very small. It looked out of place in the room and was hard to even see. I don't think they upgraded the TV's when they upgraded the rest of the room. Overall a nice clean stay considering we were in Tewksbury.

In concept, these appear to be stripped down Residence Inns. We were greeted by a brusque, rather aggravating desk attendant. There was a problem with our reservation--a form had not arrived via fax for our stay--and the attendant was simply not helpful or understanding about the situation. After assuring her that everything would be squared away, we were given the room key. The room we were assigned was nice. It seemed clean and the bed was comfortable. The room, however, had a very strong, somewhat rank odor. We opened every drawer, every door, looked under the bed to see if there was anything dead in the room. Finding nothing, I opened the windows and turned on the bathroom exhaust fan to try to clear the odor while we ate supper. On return, the room seemed better so closed the windows and shut off the fan. Within 30 minutes, the smell was overpowering. I called the desk, explained the problem, and was told, \"I called your room and asked how everything was after you got here. Now something is wrong?\" I explained that I thought we could simply air the room out during dinner but that it had not worked and room smelled. On the other end of the phone were numerous grunts and sighs and I was told they couldn't do anything tonight--all the staff had gone home \"hours ago.\" I was again made to feel like I was the problem and that I was somehow unreasonable. After a short conversation, they agreed to assign us a different room, which smelled fine. After about 1.5 hours in the new room, my head cleared and my nose stopped running. The new room did not have wash cloths in the bathroom and had an ant infestation. We stayed, rested fine, and reported both things to the office the next morning. The night staff had made no record of the odor in room 210 for the day manager, so I reported this as well. The day staff was understanding and accommodating. I would not stay at this particular hotel again, though. The breakfast was two kinds of cold muffins, some Granny Smith apples and coffee. Not quite the \"grab and go\" breakfast that one would expect.

They seem to have the attitude that if you have the \"Marriott\" name then you don't have to do anything for the guests, which is exactly how they act. Don't dare to ask the staff for anything extra likes sheets, towels or room service that is above their minimal levels. If you do ask, they look at you like you have three heads, you can see they don't really want to do it, it is only grudglingly that they will end up doing anything. Also, the place is very dirty. We purposely left some dirt on the floor to see if the housekeeping would vaccum it, and of course it was still there when we came back. When I brought this fact up to the front desk they could not believe it, and continued to insist that they cleaned the room right. The supposed \"grab and go\" breakfast is really a big joke. They consistently ran out of the few things they were supposed to have, and the muffins for two months on end were always blueberry. I know these guys buy in volume, but can't you buy some different muffins?
