The staff were incredibly friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy our children. As we were wanting a relaxing family holiday we spent most of our time around the pool or on the beach. The tide seemed to be out during the hottest part of the day so we either were having a siesta or swimming in the pool. The water had very little chlorine (specialised filtration system) and was like swimming in a fresh water pond. Great with two little water babies! We did venture out on two snorkelling trips and hired a bike to explore the other resorts. Returning, with relief, to the peace and quiet of Musket Cove. We will be returning again to enjoy the quietly luxurious, yet low key atmosphere.
