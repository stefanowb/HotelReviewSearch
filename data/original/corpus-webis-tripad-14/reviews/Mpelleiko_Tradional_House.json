Set in the quaint town of Stemnista, nestled in the mountains we found a traditional home from the 1600s that Nena Gkrinitzia has turned into a bed and breakfast. The house was Nena's grandparent's home and she has lovingly renovated the property while leaving in tact all of the charm. The house overlooks the town and mountains, and there are views from inside the home as well as the garden areas. The rooms themselves are large and nicely appointed. The house is decorated to reflect the traditions of the local area and also has all the modern conveniences. We stayed in the downstairs room which had a double and a single bed, a private entry way and a terrace with a view. Breakfast is served in the dining/sitting area which has a wonderful view and a homey atmosphere. Breakfast consisted of home made bread and marmalades, a kind of traditional dumpling filled with feta cheese and herbs as well as fruit and yogurt. Nena is a most gracious hostess and helped us plan our time in the area. She had great suggestions regarding hikes and sites to visit.

Nena was so accommodating upon arrival and offered us tea, coffee or whatever we liked. Also on hand were some delicious homemade cookies. Our room was for my husband, step daughter (16) and me. It was spacious, immaculately clean and warm. The view from the terrace was awesome! Nena told us that Stemnitsa is home to a jewelry making school (we asked about how the economy was driven and one thing the area is known for is its jewelry), and there happened to be an exhibit in the nearby town of Dimitsana. We went there and were not disappointed at all. Not only did we visit a lovely little town, we were able to shop for reasonably priced jewelry made by local young people. In the morning, we were treated to the homemade jam another reviewer wrote of, and the spinach pies! Just a fabulous stay and we highly recommend it.
