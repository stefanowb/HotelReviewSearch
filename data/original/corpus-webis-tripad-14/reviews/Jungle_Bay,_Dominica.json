Saying that, the whole experience of being at Jungle Bay was very pleasant. The owners were quite personable and the staff were very friendly. The massages my wife and I had were also expensive and disappointing - my own near-$100 massage felt like something you would experience from someone who'd watched a video of a person giving a massage and thought \"ooh, that looks easy - I'll give that a go.\" I was underwhelmed, to say the least. If you like swimming, you might be disappointed with the pool area, too - the pool is not large and there are nowhere near enough loungers, towels and cushions for the lodge's guests.
