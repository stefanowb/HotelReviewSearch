I was in town for a mix of Doctor appointment & short vacation. I must say, the staff here are what makes the rating a 5 star. The gentleman at the front desk who checked us in around 5pm was exceedingly polite and informative. I wish I'd gotten his name. He got me extra pillows within minutes of my check in. On Tuesday we realized we'd used all the bath towels. I called front desk & they had the towels, I kid you not, at my door within less than 60 seconds of calling. Breakfast was enough to tide us til afternoon. Oranges, bananas, mini muffins, sausage or bacon, eggs (not the best), biscuits/gravy, English muffins, oatmeal, toast, waffles, cereal, yogurt, and milk/OJ/apple juice/milk. Pool is very intimately small albeit warm on a winters night, and hot tub was relaxing. Plenty of pool towels. There is no view, but you are centrally located to beach (5 min), freeway, plenty of eateries, and downtown is maybe 10 minutes max. I did not have an issue with parking, but was there on weeknight. Furnishings are a hair worn, but comfortable and clean, and beds were nice. Housekeeping was great, and I tipped them $20 for their effort. They earned it. Nice little place for the price tucked in an odd corner right off freeway. I would choose this again, and I am a San Diego native now living in another state, so I know the area well.", "title": "5 star rating for an unusual motel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "FireWindRain", "date": "November 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185545501}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "One night stay", "text": "Staff extremely helpful and friendly.

Great value.", "text": "I normally stay in 5 star hotels when I travel. I'm really picky about what hotels I stay at normally. When I travel with my 2 pitbulls and chiweenie, I don't have much of an option. I never have issues with my dogs at La Quinta so it's my hotel of choice when I bring the pooches. And honestly, I've enjoyed my stay at the la Quinta just as much as any higher rated hotel. The customer service is on point. The rooms are clean. The breakfast buffet offered a lot of options and it wasn't really crappy food. It was actually an enjoyable meal. I felt like I got a lot for the price I paid.
