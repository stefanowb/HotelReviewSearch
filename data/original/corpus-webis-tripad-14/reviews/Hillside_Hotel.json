However, it is alongside the main road out of Ventnor and was noisy with the bedroom windows open to cope with the heat. We booked and had confirmed a room with a bathroom, but got a shower room and the owner denied any knowledge of our 'with bath' booking. It did not start off well being told that we were not allowed to have food or drinks in the room, that the main door would be locked and the building alarmed at 10pm and you would have to wake the owners up if you came in after that. We know that we should all save energy, but to be told that we should turn the shower room light off as soon as we came out added to the makings of an impending youth hostel experience. We were told that drinks would be served from 6pm (we arrived at 6.40pm and the owner checked her watch to see if we should still be served drinks) and that dinner was at 7pm, a couple who arrived at 7.10pm had their starters put in front of them as they sat down. For the first night you selected your main course before arriving, fish, meat or vegetarian, however it turned out there was no choice of starters or deserts, which was a problem as both were dairy based. We declined to dine in on the second night and ate at the excellent Michelin starred Hamborough, although their three hour tasting menu meant we did not get back to Hillside until after midnight, which did not go down well with mein host when he had to be woken up to let us in. I went down at 8.30am to say we would not require breakfast to be told \"we will clear your table then\". It gets worse we went out that day and were pursued across the island via telephone messages to our mobile and via our children at home!! (who were obviously worried, thinking we may have had an accident) to contact the owner urgently.
