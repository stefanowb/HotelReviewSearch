We had our reservations having read the reviews but were willing to keep an open mind. On arrival around 9pm we went in to the reception at the Plaza side and were told that our room would actually be in the Plaza Regency side. I have to admit that my heart sank having read that this was the \"poorer\" of the 2 sides. I needn't have concerned myself. The staff at reception were friendly and efficient and check in was done quickly and smoothly. There were 2 lifts, one slightly larger than the other and both in working order, if a little slow. Our room was on the second floor and we had requested a side sea view room as we wanted to make sure that we had a balcony. What we were given was a front sea view room with balcony and with absolutely breathtaking views of the sea. Even lying on the bed you could not miss the ocean views. The room itself was fairly small, but it was spotlessly clean and comfortable and the bathroom was adequate for what we needed. When we are spending time in our room on holiday we are usually on the balcony anyway so the size of the room is not really an issue for us, but it may have been a bit cramped if we were there for 2 weeks. Being on the second floor meant we had quite a lot of noise from the street so if you are a light sleeper you may need a room on a higher floor, but it was fine for us. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels provided daily. The beds were changed at least twice during our stay which was fine as well.", "title": "Pleasantly Surprised!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "saoirsechick", "date": "June 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132393378}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012", "text": "The hotel itself was quite basic but the rooftop pool and terrace were lovely and had great views.
