We have long been loyal customers of the Starwood Brand and have decided to try Le Meridien. Needless to say, we were greatly disappointed. Upon arrival to the hotel, we were greeted with a valet, when my husband inquired as to where the cars were parked, he was informed that the parking was 5 blocks away. Understandable, but when my husband inquired if it was secured, the parking attendant rudely replied, \"this is San Francisco, what do you think?\" We had no issues with the parking, as our concern was the shopping bags in the back of the car. Okay... the valet was rude, but we decided it would not ruin our stay. Upon check in we discovered that the room with the king sized bed that we had requested was unavailable and that we would be in a room with 2 double beds...that too was fine as we were both tired and my husband was beginning to have a headache. Later that evening, my husband's headache was beginning to get worse and so I decided to call the operator to see if there was any Tylenol on the premises that we could purchase and was advised that the concierge would have some. However when I called, I was informed by the concierge that she was incredibly busy and she \"cannot deal with me right now\" as she put it , as she had several people in front of her. Now we have stayed in hundreds of 5 star hotels in cities around the world and NEVER in my experience have I been spoken to by a hotel staff so rudely. Needless to say, it was getting late that evening and my husband and I decided to retire for the evening. However, that would not be the case- at 3 am in the morning we were woken up by the sounds of what sounded like people having a party in the next room. We called down twice and were informed that the noise would be taken care of, we even requested to switch rooms, but we were assured by the management that the noise would be taken care of, but that was not the case as it continued on until 6 in the morning as the noise would die down shortly after being told, and then start again. My husband and I did not sleep that evening. We decided to check out early and when asked by the woman how was everything, we told her about our dis-satisfaction and she basically just nodded and proceeded with checking us out. Which makes me wonder if she is just required to ask, but obviously does not care about the satisfaction of the customer as she failed to offer solutions.
