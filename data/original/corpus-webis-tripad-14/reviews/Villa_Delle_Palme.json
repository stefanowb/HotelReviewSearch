We were quite pleased with this hotel -- for starters, the staff was very friendly and helpful, especially at the front desk and breakfast room. We loved the rooftop terrace and our room came with its own private balcony as well. Those on here who complained about the smallness of the bathrooms (in general) probably have never been to Europe before. We loved the quiet area which was so close to downtown Lido, and really enjoyed strolling the streets, The concierge even recommended a restaurant for us and booked the cab as well, which was great. The breakfasts were really nice and the eating room quite pleasant.

One thing which was not specified in the bookng was that the \"standard\" double room we booked was not \"standard\", since it had a bathroom for people with special needs, which made it less confortable for us to use...I asked for a room change but it was obviously impossible, because the hotel was fully booked, so the receptionist told us. The breakfast is another negative point: we arrived at 9.40, serving stopped at 10.30 on Sunday, when we got there (we weren't the last guests), the bread had finished, there 2 slices left of salami and cheese for the savoury things, and only a couple of croissants. We asked the only person who was doing the breakfast service for some bread, she first said she was sorry but they didn't have any anymore. When we clearly showed big disappointment and surprise (well maybe indignation), she asked for a few minutes, after that she came back with 4 small panini, which had gone from freezer to oven. In the meantime another couple of guests had arrived, and decided to recycle coffee, tea, and even a croissant leftover from other tables, since noone was there to attend them! They definitely need more people to work there, and more food for breakfast, where the overall choice was rather limited.
