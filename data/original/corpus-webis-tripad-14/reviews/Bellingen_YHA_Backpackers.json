It looked like a cool little place to stay, so on the way up the coast we booked 3 nights. Those 3 nights turned into 6 and would have been much longer if we didnt have other plans on the go) Bellingen is a tiny little town, but has the coolest vibe- funky and relaxed at the same time. The hostel just has a great atmosphere and overlooks a peaceful pasture. Its just one of those special places where you can just be there, and you don't really even have to be doing anything, but you just enjoy yourself anyways. Rooms and bathrooms are clean, grounds are nice, nice social area on the patio, well equipped kitchen and Bella the cat is a cute addition :) Go across the bridge and see the bat colony on Bellingen Island, and join the hostel's tour of Dorrigo National Park.
