The rooms were beautifully presented clean tidy and modern. The staff were very nice and helpful directing us to a lovely restaurant on our first night just around the corner. However the real beauty of the place is its location, I don\u2019t think you can find a better spot. All the major sites are in walking distance and you are the right side of town to pop over the river and spend your evenings in one of the many bars.

We used many sources, including Tripadvisor, to select suitable accommodation in the centre of these historic cities. The Smeraldo stood out as being in a very good location for us, and the comments by other people indicated that it was a very clean, very good service hotel with a commendable record. So we booked it well in advance, fully expecting to follow through on our booking. However, shortly after arriving in Europe, I developed medical complications, and we thought it advisable to return home. As soon as was possible, we cancelled all tour, travel, and hotel bookings. All hotels in other cities had no problem with the cancellations even though their dates were much closer. But not so with the Smeraldo. We were aware after the booking was made that the one night deposit was designated as non-refundable. Our pleading that our case was different got little sympathy and they refused to refund. On my sugestion that they could at least use our deposit as payment in a future booking got the response of a one year limit and only during the slow periods. Not suitable for us. We believe the non-refundable deposit policy of the Smeraldo to be inflexible and unfair, especially considering the booking was still a month away from time of notice. We want to make people aware of this situation in booking this hotel.", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 14, 2004", "id": 2703062}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just Wonderful", "text": "Earl H--- Manitoba, Canada", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 11, 2004", "id": 2695683}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Bait and switch?", "text": "The Hotel Smeraldo is perfect. It is in a central location right down from a major bus stop where you can catch a bus to just about anywhere (Rome's busses are surprisingly easy to use) and they sell bus tickets at the desk so you don't have to go to a Tabacchi. Despite its central location, it is in a quiet little corner of the area with only a small amount of noise from passing pedestrians (and no car noise). The hotel is beautiful, especially the circular staircase, the rooms are small but clean with no smoke smell (a huge issue with other hotels in Italy), and the breakfast is fairly comprehensive with muesli and yogurt available in addition to pastries. The desk staff was always nice. For the price, this is an incredible value and I would definitely stay there again.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "good2be", "date": "October 10, 2004", "id": 2686885}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great hotel - Great location", "text": "We made reservations over 4 months ago for Hotel Smeraldo for 3 rooms.
