Un except able , Would highly recommend that any one reading this review not stay at the Marriott Residence Inn in Los Alamitos Ca. This manager does not define Marriott as a whole, she ,I would recommend seek out additional training that Marriott Corporation has available for there Management staff. 2nd recommendation is that all \"sofa Bed mattress be remove & up graded with new mattress. Obvious fact basis on high occupancy mattress especially in \"sofa beds\" which are un-comfortable most of the time have a short shelf life. In fairness other than that Hotel was clean, 99% of staff excelled in there position with in the Hotel. Over all fixable, treats to contact police un-called for. Management should lead by example, motivate by experience & above all assess all situations with integrity. We are all human, there fore we all make mistakes , And we the customers are not always right .Conclusion for all, Police intervention when all avenues have been exhaustible. And when in harms way , with out a doubt. But not for any other reason especially to a 60 yr old Grandmother taking her 2 Grand children to Disney Land. I mean Really. Thank you for reading.

Stayed here while attending a conference in Anaheim for several days/nights. We arrived at 3:15 on Thursday. When I walked up to the front desk no one seemed to care that I was there. Once someone acknowledged my presence I was told that there were no rooms available despite there being a 3 PM check-in. I understand, but you are a corporate focused property, have the rooms available when the guest arrives. Fortunately I had to go to Anaheim and drop off an item which I knew would take about an hour. The front desk clerk told me she would upgrade the room for my trouble and she would call me to let me know the room was ready. I returned about about 5 PM, not knowing if there would be a room for me. The front desk crew had changed and no one knew anything. When they keyed my name into the system I was assigned a room. I asked if this was an upgrade and was told no. I was also told if I didn't like the room they would move me to another room. The room I was given was TINY and very uncomfortable. I went to the front desk and asked to be moved and was moved to a 4th floor room w/a fireplace. The problem with the room.....old worn out appliances. The ice maker was hanging in the freezer.
