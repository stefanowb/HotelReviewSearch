Our second visit to this hotel and this time we chose the 1-bedroom apartment. The location, just behind the Plaza Hotel at Central Park, is fabulous and within walking, subway, bus or short taxi distance from almost anywhere in NY. Around the corner form Carnegie and 5th Avenue is at the end of the street.The apartment is great, although I think the kitchen utensils need to be improved for people who actually want to do some cooking - and yes I do know that NO-ONE cooks in New York! For the rest of us, Whole Foods at Columbus Circle is only a couple of blocks away and there's a great wine shop on the way. The staff at the hotel are helpful and there's a nice bar on the ground floor which is unfortunately usually empty - shame because it's very nice. The hotel can arrange cars to and from airports at reasonable rates if required. This is our second stay and we'll certainly come back again.

Straightforward and business-like, the hotel feels more intimate than its 130 or so rooms over 12 floors: the staff is cordial and helpful. (A container of large umbrellas appeared by the door when rain was forecast.) And breakfast in the hotel cafe is part of the charge for the room: a good range of choices on the menu--bacon and eggs to fruit salad. The room was spacious enough, the bed very comfortable, and the maintenance top quality.
