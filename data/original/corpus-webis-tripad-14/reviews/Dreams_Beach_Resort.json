We have not stayed at the Dreams Beach before, have been to Sharm 6 times and will be returning to this hotel. Hotel staff were second to none, they could not do enough for us. Rooms were spacious and were very clean. We had a ground floor sea view which was lovely especially when you looked out in the morning. My only moan was that there were no tea/coffe making facilities in the room although when we asked they told us that they were only provided for the first night of your stay but they still had some sent to our room.", "title": "great break in the sun", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bookedanotherholiday", "date": "April 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 105677921}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is situated right near the sea, the beach is spread onto different levels which we liked as it meant you are not squashed in like sardines but you can't really paddle in the sea unless you walk along the sunken jetty.
