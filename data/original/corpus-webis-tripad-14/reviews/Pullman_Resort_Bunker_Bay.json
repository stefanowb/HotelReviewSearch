We were not disappointed. The rooms were well appointed and the beach was great, with very few people on it. It was an easy drive to go down to the Margaret River wineries and we visited several of them. The pool at the hotel was great but it was all spoilt by the flies - we aren't sure if this is a seasonal thing - but they were a real pest. It's impossible to sit outside to eat without being bothered by them here. The food in the restaurant was excellent, as was the breakfast buffet. All the staff are friendly and helpful too.
