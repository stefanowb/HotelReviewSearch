My husband and I are horse people... we have horses at home and practically spend more time in the saddle than on the ground! The idea of riding in Costa Rica was a dream. We were not disappointed. The guides, who are also great horseman, took us on the rides of our life! We experienced a part of Costa Rican that that most visitors will never get to see\u2026 primary rainforest, rural villages and even a visit to a local dairy farm! The horses were wonderful ... My husband and I had the opportunity to ride their Costa Rican gaited \u201cCriollo\u201d horses. We were very impressed with these horses\u2026 they were incredibly sure footed, had amazing endurance and energy but were gentle and calm all at the same time. I was also very happy to see that Debbie (a horsewoman herself) is incredibly conscientious of the well being of her horses and has taken great measures to introduce \u201cnatural horsemanship\u201d to the local community\u2026 she has done a tremendous job of improving the welfare of the horses in the area\u2026 she has several rescue horses that are in the process of being rehabilitated. They have also created a therapeutic riding program for local people with disabilities. This is the kind of people they are... they not only have a wonderful resort, but they also give back to the local community and the environment.
