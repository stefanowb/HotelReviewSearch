The proximity to the airport was not a factor for us, but it was very close& the hotel offers a shuttle. Just outside the main entrance are a few restaurants. Bonefish & the NY Diner to name two. We only had breakfast at the hotel once & it was the typical Hampton breakfast, which was fine. We chose to have brunch two days so we ate at the NY diner, but the Hampton breakfast is fine if you're on the go & need to get out quickly. We has a king suite which was very large. The bed was great. The pillows were a little too soft for me, but that's because of my preferences. My husband thought they were fine. The hotel was very close to the highway.
