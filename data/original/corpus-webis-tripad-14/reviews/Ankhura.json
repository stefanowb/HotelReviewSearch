We hiked through Tuscan forests following the dog's amazing noses, and found several white truffles, which is much more exciting than it seems when you realize how tiny they are, and how hard it must be to find even one. One exceptionally amazing truffle was the size of a small potato, and we learned that it could later be worth as much as $2000!
