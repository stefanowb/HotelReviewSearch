Like the previous reviewers, we found this place to be a nice (but not stellar) boutique hotel in downtown Portland. Its in a great location - within walking distance of most of the city and near the fareless tram lines. The staff is friendly and helpful (despite some billing mistakes, which were quickly remedied) and the food was adequate. I thought the room was well-appointed and cozy, though small. Surprisingly, the bathrooms are rather large in comparison. Nice Aveda amenities, very clean (super nice and efficient house-keeping staff), etc. But overall, kind of boring, average and not very unique. Like a previous reviewer, we too were placed on a floor that was practically teeming with photos of prominent Republicans. I understand the concept behind the photography exhibition throughout the hotel, but still found the number of photos to be a little unnerving, plus having so many together on one floor really gave the impression that the hotel had some kind of agenda. Had I known about the photos on our floor beforehand, I would have at least requested to be on another floor.

It was my first trip to Portland--which was, incidentally, full of exquisitely blooming trees that weekend--and I'd gotten the sense that the Lucia was the newest and most attractive of the city's boutique hotels, so I decided to pay the $150 for a room there. My experience was mixed. First, the good part: the rooms are beautifully lit--there's almost too little light, but it's genuinely warm and welcoming--and the linens and toiletries are all what you'd expect. (I was even introduced to some Aveda product I'd never tried before, and I'm an Aveda fanatic.) But my room was *painfully* small, about the size of the Hudson in New York (maybe 150 square feet); in Portland it seemed gratuitously tiny. This wouldn't have been a problem if there hadn't also been nearly constant noise from the hallway, as other people returned from their St Patrick's Day nights out, some of them with a lot of shouting. A hotel doesn't have a lot of control over guest behavior, I realize, but it can make design decisions that privilege quiet; the Lucia did not make these decisions. The infuriating part of my experience was, however, the following morning: when I brought up my lack of sleep with the front desk attendant at checkout, and said that I would not be staying at the Lucia again, nor recommending it to my friends (many of whom end up in Portland occasionally), the guy just smiled at me and said, inexplicably, \"Thank you.\" I said, \"No, I don't think you understood me. I *won't* be staying here or recommending it to other people.\" He smiled again, shyly--it wasn't a language comprehension question, his English was clearly just fine--and handed me the bill, and I knew that it was hopeless. Transparent walls are one thing; unresponsive customer service--how much would an apology have hurt?--is unforgivable. Seriously, folks: I love independent boutique hotels, and have stayed in my share of them, but I've never seen this kind of blithe indifference to a guest's problems with his or her stay. My advice: if you're hearing-impaired, can sleep through anything, have a thick skin, and are very thin (for dealing with the room's tight corners), you may want to consider this place; otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere.", "title": "Small room, thin walls, occasionally clueless staff", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Upstate_Exile", "date": "April 12, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7338607, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The lighting in the room", "disliked": "\u2014 Thin walls, and the front desk's casual way with customer complaints"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here in December 2006 and absolutely LOVED the hotel!
