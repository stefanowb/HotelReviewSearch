What a find! The hotel is in an excellent location in the \"Paris\" end of Collins St. Everything is within an easy walk- transport, great food, theatres, shopping, nightlife etc. The 1 bedroom apartment was very spacious and as it was recently upgraded when Quest took over from Oakford, everything is new and sparkling. Having a spa bath was a bonus too. There is a complimentary guest laundry which was very handy as we stayed for a week. We had no problems with noise from other guests or from traffic. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, and gave us a fabulous deal for the week. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.", "title": "Will definitely stay again!", "user": "L.Northam", "date": "July 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 18187148, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, price and large rooms.", "disliked": "\u2014 View of neighbouring wall."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled solo", "text": "This hotel is fine - it is currently undergoing a much needed refurbishment and should be great when completed.
