We took valet parking as it was included in our package (first family package). The receptionist was extremly friendly, showed us on a map where everything was located and guided us to the elevator where he wished us a nice stay and sent us to our room. Exiting the elevator i suspected the worst as hearing children crying around in nearly every room. So all family first bookers are in one floor obviously. Normally we should not complain as we booked it too, but our child, me, was 17.
