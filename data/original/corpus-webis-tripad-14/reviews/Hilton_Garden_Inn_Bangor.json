The AC worked, however, the thermostat in the room was unable for most of my weekend stay to trigger the heater once the temperature dropped below the desired level. A cold weekend in Maine didn't help the heat problems, especially for my girlfriend whom was accompanying me on the trip. With hockey and a holiday weekend sale that brought oodles of Canadians over the border buying anything in sight for Christmas, all of the hotels were sold out and there were no rooms left within any reasonable driving distance, so I didn't have any real leverage. The heating problem were reported when they happened after the first night and mentioned at check-out and did receive an apology. I was visited by a maintenance gentlemen but he was really unable to determine the cause and had no real answer for the problem.
