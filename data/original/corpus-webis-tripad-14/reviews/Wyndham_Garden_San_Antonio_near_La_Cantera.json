The room reminded me of the Aloft rooms minus some of the cool. Clean, comfortable and quiet. The covered patio area was really nice and wish we would have had more time to enjoy that and the hot tub area (little cool for the pool when we were there). After a recent crummy stay at the Westin up the hill (supposed to be nicer - ha!) I have to say the Four Points had much better service, from the really nice front desk guy to the bartender and housekeeper, everyone had a smile and was there to help you with anything you needed.", "title": "Great stay - wonderful staff!", "user": "jodi_123", "date": "October 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 182557097}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Convenient location if you are visiting UTSA or Six Flags.
