I'd agree with an earlier reviewer that, in some ways, it's a glorified gastro-pub. In my view, it's simply not the sort of place where you'd expect the manager to contact you during your stay. The rooms are, mostly, built into the land behind the hotel. There's a seaside theme (don't worry, not horror Blackpool-kitsch). They are spacious and clean. The fact that the place is called the White Horse should provide a clue. It's a pub, or rather a pub restaurant. Expecting a non-smoking lounge in a seaside pub/restaurant in Norfolk is, in my view, totally unrealistic (much as I'd welcome there being one). This is not the metropolis (thank god).
