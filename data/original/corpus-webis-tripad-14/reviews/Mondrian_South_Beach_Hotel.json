I don't think I've ever before been presented with a breakfast menu, where the first page is cocktails! The decor and theme is minimalist white with quirky touches. I had a lovely large room, with a studio design and small kitchenette. It was a little too bare for my taste and things had been done a bit on the cheap. However, it suits the Miami style and clutter does not go well in the heat. The staff are friendly and helpful. Public areas all centre around the pool and outdoor bar - which have the wow factor and get a great sunset. The restaurant is fine - but not busy and the food was pretty average (I had some very dry chicken). Some people may be put off by the location, as it is not on the beach and there is not much on the doorstep. Still, the price is reasonable and it's a nice addition to the party theme of Miami.", "title": "Chic, White Party Palace", "user": "Globaladventure", "date": "July 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 115191652}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My favorite part of this hotel is the POOL.

Also took me awhile to figure out how the shower worked but I really liked the overhead spray. Only problem was the length of time it took for them to bring our bags up when we checked it and that there's no ATM in the hotel. It's ok though :) This was part of my boyfriend's surprise bday trip and he LOVED the hotel! He's totally metro so it was perfect for him.

My experience in South Beach was so much more incredible. Upon arriving to the hotel, I was met by a wonderful staff that seemed authentic in their greeting. The rooms are unique with functional style, and clean, clean, clean. I loved the kitchen with the perfect feel of home. I knew I could make this my home away from home for the next week in Miami. Although Mondrian is on the western edge of south beach, I much prefer this over to the more popular eastern side of south beach. For one, the view of the city is amazing, which only becomes more spectacular at night. The eastern edge has the ocean view, but that's it, and at night there is no interesting skyline, and no fabulous sunset. Let me tell you about the best part, the service is amazing. Coming from a small city in northern California, I felt like a celebrity at the Mondrian, Miami. Everyone was personable! I felt like Norm from the TV series \"Cheers\". Everybody knew my name.
