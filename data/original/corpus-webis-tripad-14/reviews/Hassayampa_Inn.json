Unfortunately, these were the best parts of our experience at the hotel - the following comments have nothing to do with the hotel being a historic landmark and therefore not \"modern\". Despite the fact that we were the only people in the lobby during check-in, our greeting from the front desk consisted of the young man asking for a driver's license and credit card after we gave him our name, then telling us that we could only use the elevator if one of the staff was available to operate it. Housekeeping was spotty and inconsistent: trash cans in the bedroom still contained items from the previous occupant, the corners of our shower and the track that guides the shower doors needed a good scrubbing with bleach and a brush to remove mold, and although our used bathroom glasses were removed by housekeeping each morning, for some reason we had to request replacements. And historic hotel or not, the bed situation was a mystery: at an average cost per night of $160 for 5 nights (not including meals), bed linens should be new and crisp, mattresses should replaced frequently enough so that they don't cause guests to roll to the center of the bed during the night, and pillows should be replaced when the filling starts to separate and bunch up.
