She also booked us with the best tour guide at the Ufizzi gallery as we had forgotten that the weekend we were there was a bank holiday and was quite crowded. We were worried a bit as the first stop on our tour had no line whatsoever, but, it worked out great, and we just had an absolutely fabulous weekend.
