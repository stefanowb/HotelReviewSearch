You can walk down to the beach - but you can't see it from the hotel - there are no views. My heart really sank when we drew up outside a massive carpark - which by the way costs a fortune to park in! We actually moved out of the hotel into another one because we were so disappointed. The swimming pool overlooks the car park and the road. It's basically a functional, average business type motel. The room looks big on the web - but it's not, it's small. Definitely not for kids or families or holiday..
