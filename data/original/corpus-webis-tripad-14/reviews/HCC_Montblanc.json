Our room was fairly small but very clean and pleasant, maid service every day with clean towels, etc. The hotel pool was closed for winter but looking at it, I wouldn't bother getting wet - more like a large bath! The hotel has a restaurant for evening meals but not used much when we were there, there are many restuarants within walking distance. Overall, an excellent hotel with a superb location, 5 min walk from Catalunya where the hop on, hop off tourist bus stops, well worth paying for a 2 day bus pass (22 euros), as you can do the two routes, north and south on 2 consecutive days, getting on and off as much as you like, each loop takes about 2 and a half hours if you don't get off.

The hotel position is very close to all the sites and is just off Plaza Catalunya. Everytime you entered the hotel we were greeted with a hello and a smile. On the last day we were leaving the hotel at 2pm we asked if there was a room we could leave our bags as we were supposed to have checked out at 12 midday. We were immediately asked what time we were checking out and given permission to stay in the room until we did so. They very kindly phoned for a taxi to take us to the port. The breakfast was substantial and very filling and was available till 10.30.
