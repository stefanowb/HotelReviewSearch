Despite the recent re-fit, this place still doesn't live up to its potential. The problem, quite frankly, is the staff and I think the kitchen is where the real issues lie. The wait for food is absolutely ridiculous considering most of is made up of 'ding ding' meals. On several occasions I have overheard bar staff, including management, moaning about those working in the kitchen. But the bar is far from perfect either - I have seen glasses outside go uncollected for up to an hour which renders tables unusable, and the bar is often unstaffed when I am in there. If it had a better reputation for food we would pop in on a regular basis, but at the moment the best they can hope from us is the odd drink every now and again. Needs selling to the likes of those who run the Devon Doorway, who could strip it out and start again.", "title": "Still got so much unmet potential", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Peejdj", "date": "May 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 130695712}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "oh dear - where to start? Its not good and as I live locally I would love to visit to eat as well as drink. I tried the pub again recently and was told there was a one hour (at least) wait for food, this has happened to me quite a few times. I dont get it. They serve pub food, which I assume has been heated up or cooked in a microwave because it tastes and looks like that. So how can they not cope when the numbers are up. Last time I went they had a function on but let people buy drinks and then told them they would have to wait a long time for food and handed out free bottles of wine. Message to the brewery.

Understandably busy with the egg run being on but not impressed in the slightest! First when we tried to order a drink at the bar was told someone would come and take our order at the table, 15 mins later when this had not happened I asked someone who said they would get someone to come over. 5 mins later someone came and took our order for drinks and food, it then took 20 mins for 2 of the 4 drinks we ordered to arrive, almost 10 mins later I had to ask at the bar if there was any chance we could have our other 2 drinks!! When our starters arrived we were given a plate of nacho crumbs which came with the added bonus of peas!! We asked for them to be changed only to be told there was none left! Our other starter the combo was ok. When the mains arrived the chips were luke warm and one of our party who had ordered a medium rump steak was dissapointed when he steak was well done and very dry!!
