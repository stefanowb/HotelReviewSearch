I did not stay long enough to experience the restaurants or breakfast, however room service was prompt, with great meals for like $10 - 15 AUD. The bar just off the lobby (I thought) was a bit small, but offered a wide range of drinks and hot snacks. The crowd in here was quite jovial, with a mix of locals, English, Americans, and fellow Aussies. There were a couple of big TVs, one seemed to show only soccer, on the other I got to watch us play India in one day cricket.
