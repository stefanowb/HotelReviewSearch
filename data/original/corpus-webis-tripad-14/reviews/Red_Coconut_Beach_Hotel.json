What a rip-off. If you are considering staying here (Red Coconut) - THINK AGAIN! The smaller 'sidestreet' resorts have better accomodations. If you can afford to stay at Red Coconut - you're better off spending your money else where - go parasailing. First of all, the room was sleazy - I can't even compare it to a motel. The sheets were dirty - we had to pour alcohol all over it. I didn't bother to use the blankets. Itty bitty TV. Disgusting bathroom - dirty toilet, clogged sink, the works! stains all over the place. Even the towels were way below acceptable standards. It was so raggedy that you're better off using your own clothes to wipe yourself dry. Breakfast buffet -----! You can tell that the spoon and fork was still dirty. The food was terrible! I hate this place.
