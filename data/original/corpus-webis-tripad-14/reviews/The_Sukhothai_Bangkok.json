The hotel is inconspicously tucked away from the main road and is surprisingly quiet despite fairly near the busy road.

A one-to-one hotel staff will escort you to the room and explain to you the amenities and facilities offered to its guests. A stayed on the 4th floor in a standard room which faces the court yard with its pool. The room is clean, comfortable with a big double bed enough for 3 adults to sleep comfortably. Pillows are aplenty with a choice of the type you wish for from a pillow menu. A working table with an array of electrical adaptors for different devices is available. Internet in the room is free and of decent speed even when watching HD on You Tube. The bathroom is well designed and there is a deep, long bath to soak your tired body and legs after your shopping. My room has a coffee making machine with a fair selection of quality coffee powder in air-tight capsule. I did not use the gymn or swimming pool. The subway MRT (Lumphini station) is just about 8 min walk from the hotel. From here you can take the subway to Sukhumvit station (3 stations away) for 20 BHT. From Sukhumvit station you can take the BTS to almost anywhere within the city. Breakfast is standard with Japanese and a bit of local fares (Dim sum, noodles) and European pastries. You are welcomed by your name if you happen to stay for more than 1 night! I was impressed by this as I believe no other hotel does that. I want to single out Ms Yim whom I think is the restaurant captain on the 6th and 7th Aug mornings when I had breakfast at the Colonnade.

Tuttle's design has created an oasis of calm and serenity, with fountains, reflecting pools, shady arcades, greenery, Thai sculpture and architectural details. In fact, it is the attention to detail, especially in the spacious and comfortable guest rooms, that really set The Sukhothai apart from other 5-star hotels I've stayed at in Bangkok: there are just so many exquisite design touches, uniquely Tuttle, that personalise the hotel, and make it intimate rather than monumental. It is an interesting contrast to the adjacent Banyan Tree, which, despite the name, is a mammoth concrete tower projecting dozens of floors above the city; The Sukhothai is a mere four floors high.
