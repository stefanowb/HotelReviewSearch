From the bridge with the same name, you can see the dome on St. Peter's Basilica, i.e., a short walk to the Vatican. The single person room I stayed in was more than adequate. The window in the room openned to the enterior courtyard. I visited in late April so the weather was very comfortable. I'm not sure if the room even had an air conditioner, but for my stay it was not needed. You might ask them if your sensitive to temperature/humidity. Breakfast at the hotel was enjoyeable with plenty of variety to choose from. I was never partial to runny scrambled eggs and soft cooked bacon, but this seems to be the norm in resturants from Asia to Europe. They had enough of a selection that there was plenty of others things to eat. The staff was pretty helpful through-out my stay. If I was planning to revisit Rome I would not yesitate to stay at the Ponte Sisto Hotel. The exterior is a little intimatating, but don't be but off by that.

Or just sit and read for a while. The room was not huge, but it was certainly adequate and it was very nicely appointed and very quiet.
