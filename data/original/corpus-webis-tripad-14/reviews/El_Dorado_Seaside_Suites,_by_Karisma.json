We ended up getting the El Dorado Seaside Suites, which is the oldest of all 3 Karisma adults-only resorts, but we were still very happy with our deal. The food was INCREDIBLE. The environment was very relaxing. The entire time at the resort, we were treated like royalty. It was secluded and clean...not commercialized like other resorts near Cancun. The beach was beautiful, but the only problem was you could not walk very far away from the resort because then the beach got dirty. We just had the basic room and we were very pleased. And have I mentioned the FOOD?! INCREDIBLE!! I had never heard of gourmet all inclusive until this trip, but it was well worth it. This was a very romantic resort for couples...not a place you would go to party hard, but they did have a good social atmosphere as well. It was also interesting because there were lots of Europeans at this resort, which we were not used to. And if you go and listen to an hour presentation about their Exotic Traveler's Club, you get a voucher for spa services, excursions, etc. We used our voucher to check out Hidden Beach next door...which is Karisma's version of a nude beach.
