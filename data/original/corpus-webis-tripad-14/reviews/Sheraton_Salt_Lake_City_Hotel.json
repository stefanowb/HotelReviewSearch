I stayed at the Radison on a previous visit and I prefer that hotel and location. Staff was very helpful. $10 charge for in-room wifi (free in the lobby). Free shuttle to and from the airport and they will hold your bags before or after check-in/out. The shuttle will take you to areas near the hotel, but you may have to wait awhile, because the airport shuttle is the priority. The train is approx 1 block from the hotel.

I'm here for a conference and those facilities are very good. The pool is nice. The hotels rooms seem to be a crap-shoot. Mine, on the Starwood preferred member level, had a burnt out bathroom light (got fixed), has a broken towel rack, has no lounge chair or ottoman like you see in all the photos on the website, and has a broken curtain rod. I've heard troubling stories from my colleagues about their rooms as well. Parts of the room feel like other Sheraton rooms I've stayed in, other parts feel like a Motel 6. The wifi in the room ($9.95/day extra) is also very slow. We had a dinner for 200 tonight and it was just plain bad. The beef was dry and tough as were the potatoes. The chocolate desert resembled something from Hostess, but dry as well. The wait staff did a wonderful job. I'd like to like this place better because the conference is going well but sadly, I just can't.", "title": "The good and the not so good.", "user": "buffalo52", "date": "July 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 168250960}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We only had a couple of days, so time was of the essence.", "title": "Mini-Vacation/20th Anniversary Celebration", "user": "OldTownFavorites", "date": "July 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167713948}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled on business", "text": "My wife and I recently stayed at the Sheraton Salt Lake City for two nights.

I stayed for one night in May with a dog. The hotel has been renovated with the new Sheraton livery / theme in the past few years and is generally bright and comfortable despite the fact the the building itself is a little dark and feels a bit old. The hotel has a main tower with multiple floors and a courtyard with two stories of rooms around it. I got a suite with a view on the courtyard and didn't spend too much time in it. All fittings and fixtures worked well, the room service was fine, and the bed was comfortable. It's five or six blocks to the most interesting parts of downtown, which on a good day in Salt Lake City is a pleasant walk.
