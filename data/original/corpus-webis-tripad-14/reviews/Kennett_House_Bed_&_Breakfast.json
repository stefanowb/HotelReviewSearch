We were looking forward to meeting Carol and Jeff the owners of the B and B who received very high ratings based on their gourmet breakfasts and personal touches. Unfortunately when we arrived, we found out that they had sold the B and B recently.. While the new owner was accommodating and pleasant, the breakfasts were not of gourmet caliber. They were very basic with pancakes being served one day and french toast the next. There was nothing creative and the owner was not even there for the first breakfast.. The other negative was that even though you get a private bathroom, you have to walk down the hall to get to it.. We are big b and b people and I have to say this one did not stand out. My recommendation to the new owner is to work on making those breakfast truly gourmet and different and provide some ideas as to what to do in the area. The inn is lovely and snacks are provided along with soft drinks, Again it would be a nice touch if the cookies provided were home made. Effort has to made to keep up the wonderful reputation of the former owners. Hopefully things will improve once the transition period has taken place. The suggestions I am making may sound petty but the b and b's that stand out are the ones that have these special touches.", "user": "Jason_AMBLER_PA", "date": "March 13, 2007", "id": 7156294}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fabulous organized inn with terrific hosts", "text": "The location of the Inn is good within walking distance of Kennett Square which is a charming little town.

There is also a discount book store run by a senior citizen group which has a wonderful selection of deeply discounted books. Fun to brouse in..The Kennett Square Grill was very good but the Kennett Square Inn was not impressive. We did enjoy the wineries and the Chadds River Museum and Longwood Gardens.

We stayed in the Delaware Room, which is actually a two room suite including the enclosed former sleeping porch; it was cozy and just large enough for the two of us and our stuff for three days. The bed linens were sumptuous and the decor is wonderful. The breakfast was outstanding and included fresh fruit in season and an omelet made from fresh local mushrooms. The building itself is an outstanding examply of early 20th Century Architechture, and we became intrigued. As we checked out, we hated to leave and gave Gilja a big hug and told her we'd definitely be back.

I am traveling nearly every week for work, and it was refreshing to feel like I was at home for a week. Gilja made me feel welcome, comfortable and relaxed. The room was gorgeous, with fresh linens, a soft bathrobes and luxury soaps and lotions! All of the little details really make a big difference. Each morning, Gilja made me a delicious breakfast with several options, hot or cold, and fresh fruit from the local farmer's market. When I had some free time away from work, she suggested I go to the Longwood Gardens. This was one of the most beautiful places to visit, any time of the year! Kennett Square is a quaint little town with plenty of room to explore. For business travelers, it is only about 45 minutes to an hour from Philly - a nice esape from the city! If you need to get the airport, Gilja was very helpful at giving an alternative route to avoid heavy traffic!

The food, the room, the atmosphere, their attitude and enthusiasm was all better than expected and made a lasting impression. The rates were more than fair and affordable. I highly reccommend this establishment to anyone spending some time in the Bradywine Valley who wishes for extra comforts and wonderful food to enhance their experience. Anyone can stay at a hotel, but how often has a generic hotel added to the vacation? The Kennett House will guarantee that your experience doesn't began when you leave the hotel and end when you come back to rest.
