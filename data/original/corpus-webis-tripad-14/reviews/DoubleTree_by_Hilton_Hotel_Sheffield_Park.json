Our room 305 faced the main road but when we closed the double glazed window it was exceptionally quiet even with cars and lorries continually travelling up and down. The room was very comfortable & clean. My only complaint would be the depressing of the toilet flush in the bathroom. With my arthritic fingers it was not easy. The food in the restaurant was of a very good standard although, surprisingly, I ordered the same starter and main course from the A-La-Carte menu on both evenings. That was because I had enjoyed it so much the first night, and yet both courses were slightly different on the second night and not quite as good. The staff were very friendly, courteous and polite. The main question would be would I return - yes if I needed to visit Sheffield again.", "title": "Very Quiet - Even facing main road", "user": "Wanderer74Wigan", "date": "July 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115365049}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Kept awake till 1 a.m. by noise from doors shutting along the corridor.
