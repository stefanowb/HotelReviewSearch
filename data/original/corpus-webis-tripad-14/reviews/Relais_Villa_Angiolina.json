It is a family-run operation and the family -- mother, daughter, and two brothers - could not have done more to make our stay with them just perfec, including picking up four weary travelers at the bus stationt. The B&B is built on the property owned by their grandmother and is named after her, Angiolina. Perhaps that explains the great care and attention that were given to the decor, each room being named after a flower (orchids for us), with the orchid theme being carried throughout. The rooms as well as the bathrooms were spacious and well appointed, a rare find in Italy. And it is located a quiet, beautiful setting with flowers everywhere and just a short walk to town. Breakfasts were fabulous with a wide variet of cereals, fresh fruits and breads.But it is the warmth of this family that impresses most. They could not have been more helpful and hospitable and we would highly recommend Villa Angiolina to Anyone. You will not be disappointed.
