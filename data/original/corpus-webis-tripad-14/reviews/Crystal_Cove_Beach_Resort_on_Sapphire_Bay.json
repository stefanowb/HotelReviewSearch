I love the fact that this is US,reasonably close to the East Coast and for an island,not that expensive You can \"chill\" or have as much activity as you need . There are some great bars---Latitude 18, Duffy's Love Shack,Molly Malone,etc If you need \"high end\",that is also available.

We stayed in a condo in the B building. It was absolutely beautiful!! We had some trouble finding the check in area but someone from the lobby was kind enough to drive to where we were and show us the way. When we arrived, we were told that the cleaning service would come every other day. They came and did an excellent job every time!! The concierge service was excellent, they made all of our reservations and also recommended an excellent sailboat trip to St. John and Greater St. James. We were able to enjoy some of the best snorkeling during that day. From the first day that we arrived, the front desk gave us complimentary snorkeling gear which was very useful during our stay. My husband and I also enjoyed sitting out on the beach chairs at night and listening to the ocean. St. Thomas was the perfect choice for our honeymoon! It was very romantic with a lot of secret areas. We spent a tremendous amount of time exploring the island.

I also liked having the murphy beds for the kids which I think are more comfortable than a sofa bed. Having two full baths is also a plus. The condo complex itself is very well maintained, the grounds are beautifully maintained, and sapphire beach, which is literally steps away, is beautiful and lives up to its name. Using the 1$ safari bus's we could get around to do grocery shopping and into town (although it is strange why they only go in one direction). The next week we went to the Marriott, but in terms of the beach and convenience, Crystal Cove was probably better.
