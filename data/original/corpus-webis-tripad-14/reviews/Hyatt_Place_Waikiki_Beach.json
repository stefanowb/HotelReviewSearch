The hotel was very clean, had up-to-date decor, and a good, comfortable bed. Looking out our balcony view we could see Diamond Head. The one down side to the room (#1840) is it is in a corner and sounded like a loud wind tunnel. So, the first night it was hard to sleep as the wind was so loud (also heard 4 ambulances but it was St. Patty's night so that is probably why). The wind tunnel noise was not quite as loud the 2nd night or maybe we were just more tired. The first day my husband spent a long time on the phone as our free room internet service was not working (he was transferred 3 times and they explained that they only had so many numbers available and they had to create a new one for him--we went downstairs to the lobby to use their computers as they couldn't get us set up for at least an hour.) There is a free continental breakfast which is about average for offerings and taste. There is a small pool but no hot tub. There is also an exercise room. The only parking available is valet at $25.00/day. Hotel checkout is at noon and they do not have a separate room you can shower and change in if you have a late flight. We had a 9 p.m. flight so they held our luggage from noon until 5 p.m.; however, we couldn't change or shower there after spending the day at the beach.

There was also work going on at that side of the hotel and when we encountered very loud drilling we did ask to be moved and they said they would gladly move us. The only real problem I had here was when I had an early departure and was to be collected by the Speedishuttle. I called ahead to inform reception that I was expecting them and to make sure they knew my name as I wasn't down on the booking, in case they arrived early. As predicted speedishuttle came early and the hotel did not inform me so when I cam down I had missed the bus and had to wait 40 minutes for another one. This was partly because the manager was very relaxed and said they would arrive and i should just relax and wait, it was only when I spoke to another member of staff that the mistake was realised.

I'm sure Hyatt Regency is noisier with the police station across the street, which is one reason I changed my mind. Breakfast choices here are multiple......2 kinds of hot sandwiches each day (biscuit, egg, bacon, cheese, bagels), french toast or waffles, mixed fruit, cottage cheese & berries, various cereals, granola, yogurt, breads & toasts, muffins, pastries, every juice you can imagine, coffee, tea. If you can't find something to your liking, you've got a problem! Never had a problem finding a seat, but choose close to a wall or it's windy....or use the tray provided in your room to carry breakfast back to your room to eat it at the small table or desk. Small pool and we didn't use it. Walked across to the beach instead. It's just a block. Bought meals often at the Hyatt for about $9 a meal. Very helpful & friendly staff.

The price was more than reasonable so I didn't expect much. But I'd have been happy even if I'd paid quite a bit more. It's not beachfront. A couple of blocks off the main drag in Waikiki. The benefit is peace and economy with proximity to the action. Lobby inviting, designed with a Zen-ish feel. There's an appealing \"galley\" with snacks and drinks, open 24 hours. Business center equipped with good computers and offers free printing. Staff attentive, genial, professional. Room big, clean and stylishly furnished and decorated. Exceptionally nice bathroom. Seemed newly renovated. Street view from second floor window, but who cares with such a lovely room in which to luxuriate. And the best part: the full-length mirror was elongating! It's hard not to fall in love with a room that makes you taller and thinner. Beware $25 valet parking. I was lucky. Valet area was full and the very nice attendant directed me across the street to a $10/day garage. Would recommend this option to all guests with rental cars.
