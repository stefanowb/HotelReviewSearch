I am glad I purchased the room via hotels.com because I was able to have them move me to another hotel. I don't think I would have had much luck with the dealing with hotel management.

The man and woman at the front desk were extremely helpful upon our arrival. Providing us with a tourist map and writing notes and directions on it. We were escorted to our room and shown how to work the AC. The bathroom was adequate size and the shower had decent pressure. Although not near most of the attractions of Rome, it is only a 10 minute walk to the Vatican museum line, which is the best place to start a tour of Rome in the morning. Breakfast was good; cereal, yogurt, pastries, coffee and juice. The only complaint I have is that the second bed in the room was too small. My mom and her friend stayed in the queen size bed and I was assigned to the single. I am 6 foot tall and from the ankle down was hanging off the end. We paid $135 USD and were not disappointed.

We finally found by accident ( the wrong floor pushed on the elevator) the crappy hotel that we had booked on the internet. It was better that the flop house room we had mistakenly thought was ours, but it wasn't what we had seen on the websites. The desk clerk spoke NO English, only Italian, there was no internet connection or any possibility of getting on line, there was no coffee machine, clock, tea kettle - only a lousy TV, and lumpy bed. A lady started agruing with her husband every morning at 6, waking us up. The worst was that because of a lousy reservation system, we mistakenly had reserved 3 rooms instead of one, so the stupid manager insisted on having us pay for all 3 rooms for the first night. The so-called breaksfast was bad coffee and stale rolls. This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in my life.
