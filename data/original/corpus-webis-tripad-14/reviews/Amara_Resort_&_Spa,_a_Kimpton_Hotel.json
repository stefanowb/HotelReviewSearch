They also have a free shuttle that will take you anywhere you want to go within a certain distance of the hotel. Their pool and courtyard areas with the beautiful view were our favorite places to hang out. In the evening they offered free wine in the lobby and there was a pianist playing out in the courtyard. It is a pet friendly hotel, (we do not have pets) but there was no evidence such as smell or fur anywhere so their housekeeping staff must do a wonderful job ensuring all areas are cleaned thoroughly. All the staff were very friendly, greeting and visiting with us each time we came through the lobby. We would definitely stay there again and strongly recommend it to others.", "title": "Excellent location and great amenities", "user": "jburnsey", "date": "July 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166623231}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Very relaxing hotel.

It begins with the valet/bellman that greet you upon arrival and assist you to the front desk for check-in, might I add that the lobby is very fresh and inviting with the recent remodel. We dined at the resturant for lunch and dinner and all of the wait staff were very friendly and accommodating. The Amara resort is on its way to becoming one of the most popular places to stay in Sedona from my opinion. The last time we were in Sedona we stayed at the Enchantment resort which turned out to be nothing more than a well maketed dud in our eyes, we would reccomend to anyone the Amara resort over the Enchantment resort. For us its all about service quality, property condition and attention to detail and they nailed all three. The most important benefit for us is that they are BEYOND pet friendly and since we don't travel without our pet we are able to stay somewhere that doesn't make you feel unwanted. At this point we feel spoiled and will not give our business to any other property line, we hope they continue to grow as it's always refreshing to be able to visit somewhere new.

The staff at Amara is kind, helpful and authentic. Amara is an elegant establishment with a solid personality throughout the staff. Benjamin's staff with the dining are hard-working and pleasant folks. Ben was very attentive and helped me with anything I was looking for in and around Sedona. He is a great manager and wonderful host to guests and his staff. Joseph the valet gentlemen was always friendly especially during my last stay which was the hottest weekend in Sedona. He always was smiling and friendly. He was helpful on my departure out back to Chicago as I need directions and advice to take the back way through Prescott and Jerome for one last adventure and he was 'johnny on the spot'. The spa experience is wonderful and accomadating. I returned to have another massage from Jason, whom has just the right touch! He knows how to custom a massage for someone to relax after travel, work stress and still benefit the entire body.The Yoga instructors were so pleasant and made the day start off in a great way. Nice to meet other folks in the resort as well. Lastly, I had to return to hear an amazing man on the guitar, Anthony Mazzella. The Amara has just the man to play to many hearts to enjoy relaxing and fun original songs. Anthony always is pleasant to the guests and demonstrates his passion through his remarkable tunes.
