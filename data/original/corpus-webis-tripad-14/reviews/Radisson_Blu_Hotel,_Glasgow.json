I booked with the Radisson on-line opting for the internet rate that included all taxes, service and breakfast. Although these special rates can be good on the pocket, you never know about the room you might get, or what constitutes breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the hotel, and the room. I wanted a small bit of luxury following my walking tour and I got it. The room was well-fitted and very comfortable and generally quiet (and you've got to love the heated bathroom floors). The breakfast buffet was excellent and I remarked on this each morning. The location is superb. I had arrived from the Highlands into Glasgow via the Queen Street Station and there is a bus (one pound twenty vs. a much more expensive, though very short, taxi ride) to Central Station, which is across from the hotel. Walking and exploring the area is easy and safe (although I wouldn't know about late in the evening). Finally, the quality of room service, for dinner, is also excellent and it is refreshing to find that there are no added fees to the menu prices and you're simply required to tip the person who delivers it. With all the glory I'm bestowing on this hotel, I will also note two detractors: If there is a wedding or celebration being held in the ballroom, beware, since I could hear the music thumping in room 522 and evidently some of the party's guests were in rooms near mine. These were small interruptions and only one night - it was otherwise very quiet. The second is that huge bus tours book this hotel (e.g. Trafalgar, Globus) and probably because the hotel is big and similar to U.S. quality. I'm extremely proud of being American, but I don't go abroad to vacation in the midst of throngs of my countrymen. I was aware this might happen in a Radisson and was mildly amused while people watching from the lobby bar. So, with all this said, I cannot compare the hotel to other Glasgow hotels, but don't think I'd need to book elsewhere if I returned again for a visit.

The Glasgow SAS was our first hotel and we could not have made a better choice. This is definately the hotel-of-choice for Glasgow. The room was very quiet and extremely clean. The bed was incredibly comfortable (we woke up at 11 am- I haven't slept that many hours in years!!!) The hotel staff was exceptional. I wish I had written down the name of the bellman so I could specifically thank him. He was unbelievably helpful and kind. Everyone we came in contact with bent-over-backwards to make sure our stay perfect. We walked all over Glasgow that night to find a restaurant and ended up back at the hotel. \"Thank Goodness\" because our meal was fantastic! The dishes were extremely tasty. The menu was a perfect mix of tried-and- true favorites combined with some new tastes we had yet explore. The presentation of every course was fabulous. It was a quiet, relaxing and smoke-free environment that was just exactly what we needed. In the future we will definately stay our first 1-2 nights at the Glasgow SAS to rest and get over the jet-lag before we venture into the rest of the country. It was the perfect way for 2 very road-weary travelers to start their vacation. Prior to embarking on our trip we had rcd many warnings about the quality of the hotels in this part of the country. Our experience at this hotel could not have been more perfect. My husband and I are both Platinum status with Marriott and Diamond status with Hilton. In other words, we sleep in hotels more often than we do our own bed! This hotel surpassed all of our expectations. To all of the staff, Thank you very, very much. You are a gem!!!
