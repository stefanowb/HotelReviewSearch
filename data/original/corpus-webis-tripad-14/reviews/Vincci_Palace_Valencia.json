The first visit was on business, we loved the city so much we decided to take a week's vacation there and explore further. We absolutely loved the city and the people. And our stay at vinci was excellent. This hotel provides great value for money. Yes, the rooms are small but when you visit valencia you're really not in your room for long. The breakfast was excellent with a very wide choice of food, the fresh fruit was the best I've tasted in a hotel. The service was excellent. All members on the front desk were very helpful. All in all we enjoyed our vacation to the full. There is nothing that was too much trouble from any of the staff.

Breakfast was plentiful with fresh fruits, breads, hams, cheese, yogurts, cereals and hot food there too if required. I loved this hotel and would be very very happy to go back. It was recommended to us by our Spanish partners along with a number of others, I think we chose the best. The location was great, if you come out and turn right and walk to the bottom of the street you come to a park with the most amazing trees, I sat there for the 10 spare minutes I had and enjoyed the silence.

Ideally located approximately 5 - 8 mins walk from the Colon metro stop you can get from the airport to the hotel in around 40 minutes - ideal for a city break. Reception staff were extremely friendly and, importantly, spoke great english - which compensated for my very poor command of spanish. Room 305 was extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean and a good size. We also had breakfast as part of our room rate - which was ideal and provided a stress free start to the day. Buffet style, the food was tasty and provided a good choice. The Vincci Palace is in an ideal location for access to the centre (Plaza de la Reina) and the park in the dry river bed. We chose to take the city tour bus on the 2nd day (24 hour ticket 16 Euros each) which allowed us to hop off and hop on as well as change routes between the historic city and the beach tours. This was ideal. For dining - there are many restaurants close to the hotel and, overall, we found the prices to be extremely reasonable. You could get a perfectly acceptable 3 course meal in the Plaza de la Reina for 16 Euros. Valencia is a great place to just walk around with the occasional stop for a glass of wine or beer.

There is a car park under the hotel, which is accessed by a car lift. If you are going to park here, ensure you have nothing bigger than a Fiesta type car, as it is VERY tight! The rooms were finally available at c.4pm and were on the 4th floor. Rooms 410 & 411 had been converted from a suite and the air con for both rooms were controlled from room 410! The rooms were spacious, clean and had a great bathroom with excellent water pressure. If you are staying at this hotel with friends I would suggest you request these two rooms, as they have a small \"lounge area\" and a \"private\" terrace, which makes them excellent. The breakfast was good too and the whole hotel had a good feel to it. The reception staff, other than when we tried to check-in, were friendly, helpful and spoke excellent English. As mentioned in previous reviews it is in a great city centre location, close to the station, bullring, cathedral, shops etc etc. The only real negative was the smell of bad drains in the hallways.
