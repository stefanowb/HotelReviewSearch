They said if we wanted a room now, we could get one on the main hotel floor otherwise wait till check in. Since we had flown in on a red eye from San Francisco we opted for the room available now. Needless to say it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in, even for New York standards it seemed small, the door to the room almost touched the bed. We were about 50 feet from the check in desk and it was just plain noisy at all hours of the day. We were woken up by lobby nose both nights from arriving guests between midnight and 3 am several times (it seemed like people coming home from parties or a late night) who didn\u2019t realize people might actually be sleeping. It was downright ridiculous. I would have changed rooms after the first night, but because we were there for only 2 nights it was too much of a hassle. Also the room had a window that looked onto the balcony of two other rooms, and there were no privacy curtains, just drapes. So you had no choice but to close the curtains if you wanted privacy. I\u2019m use to most hotels having sheers and then curtains, but not this room, so basically we had to keep the drapes closed at all times. Also there were only 3 outlets available in the whole room. Two in the bathroom and one at the desk, all others were used and behind furniture.

The hotel is clean and the staff gives excellent service. My room was cleaned everyday and I had a spectacular view of Brooklyn, Brooklyn Bridge and the Seaport. Breakfast was served every morning which was very convenient for me considering I stayed there for business and did not have a lot of time in the morning to stop and get something to eat outside of the hotel. The doorman gave me precise directions to get anywhere I wanted to go. It was a pleasure staying at this hotel and I would certainly stay there again. The only thing that I did not like is that if you use the Fulton/Williams Subway station near the hotel during the day time, then don\u2019t always expect for it to be open late night after 12:00 midnight. The station was usually closed late night for maintenance during my stay or I would need to make a transfer to another train because the trains are rerouted after midnight from this station. I would have to find an alternate route or catch a taxi back to the hotel. This was not really a problem at all it\u2019s just that I had to walk a few extra blocks by using another station. The fitness room is small and only has one treadmill so I had to wait until the person using it was done. They also have a spin bike as well. The hotel is 3 blocks from the Seaport for shopping and fun.
