The good points- the staff was super friendly, and that makes a huge difference to me. Any experience at a hostel will also be determined by the people you are sharing it with, and I had some good rommates so we did have some fun.It's located directly over a pub with $6 backpacker meals!!! I foudn the food to be quite good The not so good- there are many long-term people who have lived there for years and treat the entire floor as their own personal garbage can. the cleaners did their job in the mornings and by afternoon, there was food everywhere and by evening the uncovered trash cans were stinking up the living area. It's a problem that could be fixed with a manager enforcing the clean-up-after-yourself rules but that doesnt seem to happen. The kitchen is tiny and awkwardly set up. I think they want to encourage you to go into the pub.
