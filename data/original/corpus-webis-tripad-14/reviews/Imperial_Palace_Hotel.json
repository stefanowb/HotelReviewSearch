We were booked into Imperial Palace by our conference hosts only a few days before arriving, and it was a busy period, with Fashion Week on, and the hotel apparently full - which meant that we couldn't change our room. Room 919 is not to be recommended. I suspect rooms number 19 on all floors will be the same - there is a kink in the building plan which means that three-quarters of the view from the window is blocked by a very close wall.

A 3-hour happy hour (6 - 9) is furnished with wine, beer and other alcohol, and a cooked dish that changed each evening - and in a pleasantly faked 'traditional Korean domestic' setting. The cost compares very favourably with the very pricey drinks and food in the hotel bars and restaurants. We did try the Italian restaurant and found it excellent (and we are very familiar with real Italian food) - but expensive. The breakfast is great (we used the lobby cafe rather than the Club lounge), and sets you up well enough for the day that the light evening meal can be sufficient.

It's an imposing building with fantastic public areas and a wonderful level of service in all it does. I was a little worried about spending a week here as a result of the mixed reviews on TripAdvisor, but chose it anyway as I was attending an exposition at Coex and some associated events were at this hotel. The \"trick\", I discovered, was to make sure that I was booked into one of the refurbished rooms, which are sumptuous. The older rooms, I understand, are a little worn - but still with much charm (a regular guest told me). The room I had on the 19th floor had all I wanted (and much more): great view out over the city, marble bathrooms, plenty of space and even a fully-automatic toilet with heated seat - a fine if somewhat unnecessary example of Korean technology. There's a huge TV and internet access (in some rates - otherwise it's an expensive addition). The pool in the hotel is lovely, there's a fully equipped gym and excellent spa (plunge pools at different temperatures, two saunas, etc.). The Club Lounge (access included in certain rates) has a generous happy hour - free drinks - meeting rooms and free food, so there's no need to eat elsewhere if you want some peace and quiet. I'm not partial to smoke - hate smoky atmospheres - but didn't find it a problem in the hotel in general, only in the main lobby bar in the evening (fairly expensive) if you happen to sit next to a wannabeseen local who is puffing away. There are three other bars, cafe and various restaurants in the hotel, so plenty of choice. The breakfast is an extensive buffet with huge choice of foods to satisfy all tastes. So all in all a quite lovely hotel and highly recommended.

However, the most important thing in a hotel is the room and the comfort that it provides to the guest. The hallway of the hotel towards the room are quite narrow. The rooms are ok but carpets have stains and looks old. Under the bed the carpets were never vaccumed. The room is heated and feels stuffy. I had to open my window just to let some fresh air in. The view from my room was a back alley so not much to praise also in that area of the hotel. The bathroom is quite outdated and needs to be upgraded. The shower handles are so loose that when I turned on the shower the handle drops to the bathtub floor. There are also no tissue rolls on the toilet. The room ceiling and wallpapers looks cheap and really needs to be changed. There is a plasma tv which is kinda good and a modern contrast to the room itself. The staff of the hotel were quite nice and can understand english well which is good. I would rate this hotel as 4 star only because the lobby and the decor of the room looks nice.

The spa is SO incredible! I couldn't get enough of it. When you first check in, there is a small but very nice/professional check-in area. When you enter the locker room, there are slippers, towels, and workout clothes with socks. The lockers themselves look like high end cigar lockers made of solid wood and high end fixtures. The floors are all wood as well. The spa area has several small soaking pools. One cold, medium, and very hot. They also have a \"themed\" pool which changes with daily with theraputic herbs like lavender. Outside, there is a private jacuzzi. In the back, there is a massage area (be careful if you've never tried a Korean massage. It is very intense and I had bruises afterwards), a wet sauna, and dry sauna with a clear glass window and a flat screen tv just outside. The remote is inside and the sound is piped in! There are also plenty of showers and salt scrubs available. It gets better! When you walk into the changing area, there is an amoire with robes and gold vents that have motion sensors and dry you off as you walk past them!!! The dressing area is even more amazing! It's absolutely gorgeous (all wood, gold, porcelain sinks with high end fixtures, etc.) and everything you would possibly need from brushes, hair dryers, European spa products, paper/cotton, etc. Past the dressing area are lounges where you can watch flat screens or a quiet room where you can nap. On top of all this, the upstairs houses the small gym/pool area. They have fresh towels, water infused with ginger or lemon served in glasses, a bronze fountain and knowlwdgeable staff. It was amazing and I loved very minute of it! Just a word of warning though. This is a Roman-style spa so if you are extremely shy about walking around sans clothing or barely covered, it might not be the right place for you. I was the only non-local there. All of the times I went, it was local \"ladies that lunch\" who knew each-other. The staff is extremely helpful and customer service oriented.

The bathroom had cracked fixtures (lights not working) and the vanity and tub were stained...gross.. Needless to say we checked out of the IP immediately.
