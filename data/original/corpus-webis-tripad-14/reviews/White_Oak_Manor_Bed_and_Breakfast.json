The rooms were spacious with nice big windows and sitting areas. The inn had a great porch for sitting and drinking morning coffee and evening wine. It had scrumptious creative breakfast and the owners accommodated vegetarian and Gluten free diets without complaint or comment perfectly. The owners had carefully thought through what their guest would like in unexpected amenities including Keurig coffee makers with numerous coffee choices in each room, mini fridges in each room, make-up removal wipes and on and on. In addition there was a microwave with popcorn and a fridge with soft drinks and water on the guest floor. The owners were very personable but not intrusive. The inn is a few blocks from the main area of town which was nice from a noise standpoint and parking in Jefferson is no problem. All in all just a great B&B experience.
