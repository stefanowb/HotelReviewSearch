It is conveniently located betwen the train station and bus terminal near Eyre Square in the middle of town. The room we stayed in was recently remodeled and completely up to date. We had probably twice the space in our room at Park House than we had at either of the hotels we stayed in elsewhere in Ireland, with all the amenities you could ask for. While the hotel is conveniently located, which means there are plenty of pubs nearby, it was quiet at night. The hotel has an excellent restaurant and a bar, if you choose to be more casual.

At breakfast there was a very pushie, fake friendly, head waitress or maby supervisor 'talk lady with dark hair and a suit' who insisted on interrupting about 3 times along with the waitress another 2 times just to check was everything ok!! We had lunch in the restaurant one of the days only to find athe food was slaped up and tasted like it was just flung onto the plate without any tlc given to cool it. Despite all this we said we would give dinner a chance as we heard it was supposed to be good, and to be fair the food was nice and our waitress was genuine but the man who greeted us when we arrived was just simply rude. I believe his name was John. He made me feel like i never left work and my boss was still beside me shouting the odds.
