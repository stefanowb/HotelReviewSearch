The grounds are kept neat. The owner is very accommodating. The regular rooms for 2 are spacious and have jacuzzi's/shower. There is one apartment available that has separate living room, 1 bath., full kitchen, and separate bedroom. Great views from the apartment of surrounding hills. Internet access is available in all rooms except the apartment - which is rented out in the off season. There is no phone in the apartment for this reason. Dogs are very welcome here. The owner's horse is behind the motel, and loves any proffered apples you may have. The location is just out of the main town - a nice walk for exercise. Not much need for cab service here, so if you over-imbibe and don't want to drive back to motel, the local sheriff offers free rides - back to the motel, of course. The only downside was that a 'no smoking' policy was not told to us on reserving our rooms - an oddity in the wild west of Nevada.
