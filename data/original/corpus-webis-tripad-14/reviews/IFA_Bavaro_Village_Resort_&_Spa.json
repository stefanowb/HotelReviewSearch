It was beautiful scenery, but that is all the further it goes. Took 6 hours out of our \"arrval date\" to check in, front desk employees does not speak English well enough, and has the worst customer service. Finally received 1 key (only) keying in to our room it was taken by another family. Went to complain and in 5 minutes they had us moved to another room, promising us we would be moved again to be closer to our friends we came with. Never happened the whole week. 2 weeks before arrival we had a confirmed email stating we would have the 3000 block and 3 rooms in a row so we could be all together. Never happened, and yes we requested it once again. Ocean view - Not at all. Quite a walk to the beach. The food was bad. The alcohol was bad. Customer service throughout our resort was bad. There may have been 2 employees that were friendly. We knew people that were moved 4 times due to their air conditioner not working. We had to call about our air also. We had to pay $20 for an extra key so we could keep the air on all day. Once you took your key out of the box for the lights and air it shut off. So your only choice was purchasing a key. After complaing to our Apple Vacation Rep. we got $20 back. We had ants galour. We had to wash everything when we got home. We experience cockroaches, and a mouse. There are no wash rags. Cannot drink the water. It took an hour standing in line to check out, once again it was bad. Our engoyable experience was the excersion we went on (for extra money) and a 10 minute walk to Hard Rock Cafe so we could get some \"real\" food and a \"real\" beer. It was to die for and the employees there were all about service and happy and cheerful. Our friends never did get their phone fixed after reporting it 5 times. There are no hair dryers in the rooms like they mention. Was great to get back to the states.

I will give you tips because this is most important for your stay! 1-bring 300 one dollar bills 2-bring 16 oz plastic cups. 3-bring lots of suntan lotion. 4-GO TO BREAKFAST BEFORE 8:30 or the flys will bother the heck out of you..all the resturaunts are open air! 5-Don't exspect to see alot of americans there. 6-If you need to use a computer its only 1 us dollar for a half an hour. 7-make sure if you sign up for a snorkle trip that you don't have to take a 1 hour bus trip...you can snorkle right from the beach out front...they will take you to a reef for 25.00 for 1.5 hours. 8-Fishing should be no more that 90 dollars a person for 4 hours trolling. 9-tip your maid evdery day and she will keep soda and beer in the frig. 10-go around the whole complex the first day and you will find your spot. we liked the pool across from where the shows are held. 11-While your checking in turn around and see that guy sitting down....make reservations for the resteraunts. you can only make one at a time so you may have to go back every day...otherwise you will eat at the buffet all the time..if you check in on saturday then you can make reservations for monday....and so on! 12-the guy from captain cooks that walks around is shady. 13-get a safe for your room...20.00..its worth it! 14-the beer is good..its called BRAMA and I liked it. 15-the drinks are good also however the liquer is cheep brand called Harmony. 16-When the maids clean your room they open the windows to air the place out...thats when the bugs get in....however, they are just jungle bugs you have to exspect. If you go to an Island...there will be bugs...no problem! 17-as far as getting a chair at the beach....if you wake up early and start your day by 8am..no flys at breakfast, no line to make reservations for dinner, no problem getting a place to relax. 18-anyone who writes a bad review is up to late...if you wake up at 930-10am you will not like this place! You must get out of bed and start the day early. the sun is hot at 8am. 19-Three pools to choose from and All are wonderful in their own special way! 20-there are no hot tubs...I don't know why people are complaining about the hot tubs...they have four whirlpool tubs around the bar that is located the furthest from the beach. you must go there and have a feww drinks with Lois the bar tender. The tubs are not hot tubs! hello, hot tubs in 90% weather! Have some sense! 21-Taxi to IFA Bavaro from air port is 18.00...don't let them charge you 30 like they try! 22-The beach is loaded with things to do including..kyaking...oh, yes it comes with all inclucive...you must give 30.00 for a deposit and then you get it back when you return. 23-There are many rude people from Germany, france and Spain. Yes, thats right rude people! They butt up in line and knock into you while your walking..but thats there problem not yours! 24-the best pizza I have ever had is at there pizza place for lunch. Don't forget to look at the whole menu there! They have inside outs that are out of this world. 25-If you walk the ground every morning you will find coconuts and the workers dressed in green will cut them for you...get a few straws from the bar! remember, bring your one dollar bills because its nice to hand out a dollar or two to all the nice people working there. 26-There are plenty of spring water bottles given to you in your room every day! if you want more its not a problem. 27-Topless woman are everywhere so if you are from the US and you want to go topless...this is the right place. you may want to go tanning first to avoid burning!. 28-Shopping is nice on the resort with pricesw ranging from 2 to 30 dollars. The huts on the beach are full of huslers and they are a pain in the butt to deal with. You can use your charge card on the resort. Oh, they charge by the paso so take exchange chart...get it on-line and print it! 29-Shots of Marajamama are real good. its the Island drink and is good.
