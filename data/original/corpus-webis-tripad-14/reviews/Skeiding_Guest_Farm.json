The ostrich fillet is cooked on an open fire in the farmhouse in front of all the guests, all the bread is home made fresh for breakfast every morning, and the jams, also are home made. If you ask Anna-lize for a recipe she will give you it and I can't recommend any specific dishes as they were all far too speacial and at a very reasonable price too, A truly gastronomical experience with the added bonus of the whole farm being a welcoming enjoyable place to stay, The farm tour with Neels is a \"must\" but not for the weak hearted as he doesn't really", "title": "Hidden gem - Perfect for everyone", "user": "JanJohnson", "date": "February 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25121973}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "know anything about keeping his pick-up on flat ground so you are thrown about everywhere.

The guest farm is close to the N2 and easily reachable, the scenery is great, very quiet with the mountains almost at your fingertips. The room was okay,but quite dark. But what made us think that we had to write a review about the guest farm that differs from the ones we had read were the owners: Actually we had the impression that the hosts weren't really interested in their guests. While we had dinner, they sat in the kitchen, not willing to spend a minute more to talk to us thea necessary. Same in the morning while having breakfast (which was actually really good!): the owner came to the breakfast table to pour a glass of orange juice and left?!?

Skeiding was a real highlight. We had wonderful time. The accomodation was homely and cosy and the warmest accomodation that we had during a really cold winter week. The dinner was outstanding. We fancy ourselves as steak fundis and found Neels' ostrich to be the best we have ever tasted. The meal was accompanied by real South African farm delicacies which were just as good. The kids loved the labyrinth and we all enjoyed a lovely long walk with great views in the evening and in the early morning an exciting farm trip. Neels was really kind and went the extra mile for us. Even assisting with fixing our motor car troubles! We really enjoyed the true and wholsome South African hospitality. A really great experience.
