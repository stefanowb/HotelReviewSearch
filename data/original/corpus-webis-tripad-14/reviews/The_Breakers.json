We felt very comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful without being too hovering. Mr. Ponce who is the unofficial historian of the hotel is very much part of its history.

Someone in an earlier review said the food was not so great. I have to disagree. Food was not bad at all. Every night, i took advantage of the $35 for 3 course summer special that they have at most of their restaurants. ( Echo, flagler steak house, sea food bar, italian, top of the point). If you stick to that, then you can have an affordable dining option. If you are picky and dont find anything in the summer special, then make sure you have a good limit on your credit cards cause the tag will go up very fast. At the Steak house, the soup/filet/dessert that you can have for $35 goes for like $80 if you pick the same a la carte.

We liked: lots of pools, pretty grounds, easy to get to from the airport and the rest of Palm Beach, the Circle room for breakfast, friendly lifeguards and pool staff; sunsets from the patio at the lounge on the concierge floor. Now to other comments: We stayed 4 nights in two adjoining rooms on the concierge floor facing west with 2 small children. The views facing west are excellent and the rooms are larger; the ocean-facing rooms on that floor are rather small and you don't really see the ocean that much from them. Our adjoining rooms were rather different. One was green with carpet and had a sofa (and we really liked the decorating in this one but alas the room had two doubles and the king bed was in the other room), the other was in tile and no sofa. Rooms are in the same category and shouldn't be. So I guess if you're in a room and don't like it, make them show you another one. Both rooms were a bit dark in the mornings as they faced west and the windows are shuttered and not that large. This is a very large hotel with about 550 rooms; it is best to stay on the concierge floor unless you want to be anonymous. When we were there, the pool heating was out and this was a disappointment with small kids. It was scheduled maintenance and nobody warned us before coming. Fortunately, on most days the sun heated up the pools to the extent that in the afternoon it wasn't bad, but it was about 85 degrees outside and in the winter this would have been a disaster. Food and beverage was decent but not outstanding at dinners. Top of the Point restaurant's desert menu was so boring that we didn't order anything from it. Much more exciting to us was Cafe Boloud at the Brazilian Court hotel. However, I should add that the hotel's gourmet room was closed the week we were there. Some of the portions of things we ordered, such as grilled mahi mahi sandwich at ocean grill, were really small and we didn't feel the value. I didn't like that it took nearly 10 minutes to walk from our hotel room to the pools. We felt the hotel favored conventions over independent travelers. We had one major complaint and it matters how it was dealt with: I came via Amex Platinum. We didn't get upgraded as hotel was full when we arrived. The Platinum benefit includes continental breakfast. We were on concierge floor so we get that anyway as we paid for that. So I said give us the upgrade to the full breakfast in the Circle Dining room which costs an extra $10 per adult / $5 per child so that we could at least get some value from the basket of amenities offered through Amex. Normally, Amex Platinum customers get full breakfast, by the way and this hotel gives one of the lowest allotments for this amenity of any hotels in their program. I asked for this at the front desk on the first morning of our trip. They said they would get back to us. They didn't. The night before checkout, I saw the charges still on the bill for all the days and it came out to close to $100 over 4 days. I again went to the front desk; they said nobody had followed up. Then he went to a manager and the manager refused. The next day at checkout I complained again. They still refused but said someone would call me. Somebody actually did and told me they agreed with my request, especially since the pools weren't working, and said we would be credited for the extra breakfast charges. The person said repeatedly they want us to return. So I guess that onsite, their managers could do a better job of resolving these kinds of minor items in favor of the client and leaving them with a much more positive feeling about the property, but in the end the manager who followed up over the phone made the right decision. I would prefer a bit of a smaller property -- this hotel has created a \"club\" and a lot of the weekenders at the pool offseason are locals who are members of the club. It is not an intimate hideaway the way I remember it from 25 years ago, last time I was there with my parents. But it is a new generation and the desires of people are different these days. The Breakers is well positioned to service these people. it's a decent property; I'm just not sure it is the right one for us. Next time we would go to Palm Beach, we'd look around at the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton and see if it offered the best choice for us with our small kids and then decide.", "title": "wonderful property with amazing leisure facilites", "user": "TravelAdorer", "date": "October 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 83592334}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Attended a meeting at the Breakers, which lasted four days.

On top of that we were served by James every morning, who was the friendliest and most courteous person ever. The meeting room was great - very nice decor and stylish. Free wifi in the entire hotel is another fabulous plus - altough 200 people went online together - the system always worked very well. For lunch and dinner we had buffets, which were nicely decorated and the decor of the food was outstanding. The leisure facilities are second to none and I wish my family could have been there with me. The last night we dined at the Italian restaurant on site - the pizza from the brick oven was great and there is a nice play area for kids. Really the Breakers offers something for everyone.
