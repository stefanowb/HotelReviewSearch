Rooms were small. And what makes it worse is the loation, because yes it is really close to the Museum but they don't mention that that's where most drug addicts injet themselves outside on the board walk by the plaza that connects the hotel to the museum. Oh, one more thing, this is also where the anarchist rebel to the government or whenever they want to start strikes with weapons and things of that nature. Overall, I would recomend to stay outside of the main city if you are on a budget and can not afford to stay in syntagmna square: for example in a town called Glyfada - yes it is a 40 minute drive by tram and train or 30 minutes by taxi with the traffic but atleast at night you will be able to feel more secure walking back to your hotel than in Exarhia or Omonia area ( which is close by) where all we saw was groups of cops with mahine guns in every corner around this hotel in speific and aroung the museum. And because the streets over there are one way streets - there is really no way to evade neither one of those unfortunate things. My advice minimize your stay in Athens and ENJOY THE ISLANDS!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "yessy", "date": "June 3, 2007", "id": 7752175}], "location": {"country": "Greece", "region": "Attica", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Athens"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 16, "average": 48, "very good": 139, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 102}, "aka": "Museum Hotel Athens", "slim_ranking": 0.117021276596}
