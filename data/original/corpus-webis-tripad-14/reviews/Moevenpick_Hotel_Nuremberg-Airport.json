{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 210, "name": "Moevenpick Hotel Nuremberg-Airport", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "title": "First-class location", "text": "You know how difficult it is to find your hotel if you reach the city by car on busy motorways. Not this one - as it is situated at the airport, you just follow the airport sign. There is an underground car park and while the hotel is only a minute's walk from the airport, you do not hear the planes. The hotel's greatest asset is the air-conditioning - quite a rare amenity and probably the only hotel in N\u00fcrnberg which has it. Easy access to the city by underground train, free tickets provided by hotel. Very comfortable rooms. Legendary breakfast, to judge from other reviews. Friendly staff giving you help with finding your favourite restaurant in the city (ours is the Maredo, a steak-place). Only thing we did not like was the bar: Too small and smoky. Price reasonable for this great quality place, even on the non-smoking executive floors.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "blacklab", "date": "May 28, 2007", "id": 7706936}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "An accidental stay", "text": "Like many previous reviewers, we stumbled into the Movenpick.

The service was great, and we were offered free metro tickets from the airport to downtown Nuremberg. The room was nice and efficient and had the only bathtub we had during that trip! The hotel even provides scented bath salts. After a long trip it felt wonderful to soak in a tub! Another unexpected bonus was the free breakfast for those of us with early flights.
