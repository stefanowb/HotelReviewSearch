It is situated in a great location and in our case we had a room on the top floor at the southern end of the building with a view of some wonderful sunsets. Stavros, the Cypriot with an English accent, was always attentive and anxious to please. The room was clean and bright and there was a good sized balcony. I have a couple of complaints though - there were no cushions on the wooden chairs on the balcony for our room and secondly there was a musty smell in the room emanating from the bathroom, probably from mildew. The location was close to Coral Bay village where there were a number of good value restaurants. Unfortunately I cannot recommend eating in the hotel restaurant. We did this one night and found it expensive and the food mediocre. We had a car but there was a good bus service from close to the hotel with good access to Paphos town and the habour at Kato Paphos.

If you like good food local food you will be disappointed. We walked to the local restaurants described as 'the strip' there was nothing local about them! Plenty of neon and karaoke if you\u2019re into that kind of thing and unfortunately there is nowhere else to eat except the hotel restaurant.
