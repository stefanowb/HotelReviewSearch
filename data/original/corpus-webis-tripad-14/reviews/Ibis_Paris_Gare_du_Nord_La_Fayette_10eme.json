Room OK and rate good, tho: Eur 94 for a single. The sink was blocked and I had to unscrew the sump, which revealed a truly disgusting pile of muck, but the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was pretty grim, in dire surounding, but what do you expect for nine euros? It's better to go to one of the many little restaurants in the area. The staff were cheery and competent, but obviously there's not much money spent on infrastructure.

The cleaning person was kind and the one day she cleaned she did a good job. There were no wash cloths or hand towels. I guess I am spoiled with previous hotels.

Positives: Hotel is very close to Gare du Nord which makes getting around Paris very easy as well as easy access to other parts of Europe and Charles de Gaulle. Staff are very friendly and room was kept clean and tidy. They have 24h room service and 24h bar service if you want. Lots of dining options around the hotel if you want which are not too expensive. Free breakfast is offered every morning. Negatives: The rooms are small and I did not like the bathrooms; there was a bad smell from the toilet and the room felt constantly damp (Im not sure why)- these are personal pet peeves of mine and may be perfectly fine for someone else. The TV also only had one English channel which can get a little boring after a while. The neighborhood is okay but is definitely not St Germain or the true center of Paris and may be a little unsafe late at night.
