I can't honestly think of one negative point I found. For the price and location in Downtown Boston Financial District you can't go wrong. Easy walking to Fanuel Hall/Quincy Market, Boston Common, even a cab from the airport is pretty cheap. They even had a cab waiting outside of the hotel door when I checked out at 6am on a Sunday. Loved the clean room. Bathroom spotless, linens spotless, walls clean and the carpet is so clean you don't have to fear walking on it barefoot. Descent sized, even with many bags you don't feel cramped. Nice flat screen tv and heater/ac in room so you can control the temperature, black out curtains, coffee maker. Check in and out is fantastically fast and the front desk girls who greeted me at the door were great. Free wifi, free internet on computers in the lounge and if that's not enough you can even print your boarding pass for free. Free connectors for computers in the rooms and in the lounge. Also free filtered water on each floor and a closet to grab extra blankets and ironing boards, irons, extra coffee ect. There is also an Elephant & Castle Pub adjacent to the hotel making it easy to grab a quick bite or a drink.
