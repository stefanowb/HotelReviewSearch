Bottles of water and apples a nice touch. Pleasant dining room. Loved that we could walk everywhere including the Born, Ramblas, and Poble Sec and Barcenoleta. Down side was the smell--Natural gas--that seeped in the hotel causing the housekeeper to clean our room with the windows open. Also, the hotel is in the process of adding rooms in what is still an apartment building. For three of the seven nights, construction started at 7 in the morning, waking us up. The first time it happened, the desk offered to switch our room, which I kindly pointed out was not what we wanted as we were asleep. The staff went and asked the worker to stop. The second and third time it happened, the desk said they could do nothing about it as it wasn't their workers causing the problem. Well, it IS the hotel\"s problem,because everyone on the floor could hear it. We should have been compensated in some way for this thrice disturbance, but I did not press further. Also, there are no carpets in the hotel, so you hear people walking up and down the halls at all hours as well and hearing guest's nighttime activities till the wee hours was not conducive to sleep. I slept with earplugs most nights. The hotel is very clean, beautifully appointed and the shower/tub was the best of any hotel I've stayed in.", "title": "high design and great location--Noise is a problem", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "todaystraveler22", "date": "December 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 51638237}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "A very unique hotel.

The probkem in fact is lack of sound insulation in rooms which, particularly for the lower floors where there is no double glazing, can make for a loud morning. We happened to be woken up by building works above our room (the building houses both the hotel and several private apartments) which went on apparently without the knowledge of management. Management , however, was apologetic and quick to find us another room. Having said all that this is an otherwise wonderful hotel, beautifully designed, relaxed, with a great restaurant and bar. Although the food is excellent and presented in a high class manner it is very inexpensive (most expensive wine on the menu was 14 euros!) . The bar and small terrace outside have been recently opened and are a very pleassant place to hang out and spend some time before or after dinner. Rooms are large, with high ceilings and solid wood floors. Bathrooms are superb with powerful, rain showers, good quality toiletries and thick cotton towels.

My only complaints are 1) they gave us one bed instead of two and 2) the walls are EXTREMELY thin! Think twice before you consider this a \"romantic\" stay.

It has resuling limitations. But if you're realistic in your expecations, it's a fine place. Courteous and helpful staff, well-maintained rooms, conveneint nearby subway stop (Urgell, not Sant Antoni, is much more convenient for most purposes), good individual air conditioning, The neighboord is kind of working class, but not scary as some have reported. The hotel restaurant offers great food at excellent prices - full of locals who obviously think the same thing. Limitations: It faces more an alley than a street, so no view at all and the alley can be an echo chamber for noise. Because it takes a change of elevators to get to most rooms, you will usually end up using lots of stairs, and you will probably get lost the first time. Biggest \"problem\" is that the hotel oversells itself on it web site. It is smaller, older, and more basic than it wants you to think.
