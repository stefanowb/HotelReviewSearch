The room itself was comfortable and the bathroom good in that it was clean and not too poky. It's typical of a Travel Inn in that it's consistent: you get the same sort of standards whichever one you go to and they're generally welcoming ones. The problem here was that they had fire doors on each room which made a VERY loud bang each time they were closed and people en masse did not seem to be very considerate. The place was fully booked (holidays), so there was a succession of banged doors for most of the night until midnight and then from round 5.30am onwards which meant that our sleep was quite broken. The children stomping around upstairs didn't help either. The restaurant adjoining it has a very kitch theme to it that's quite funny and the food's fine. Location-wise: a very dodgy area.", "title": "Not the Kind of Bang You Want.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LauraBoo1", "date": "August 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3761127}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "I usually use the Ibis for a budget stay at Heathrow but now I'll switch to here.

Not the place to stay in my opinion if you are looking to base a holiday in London there as it's greyness may get to you.
