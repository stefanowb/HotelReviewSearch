When we first pulled up to this place we thought oh no:(.... But to our surprise and relief the staff was wonderful and the apartment was just what we wanted and needed. The view from our balcony was great and the bed was comfortable. Kitchen adequate and shopping just down the street for groceries. Everything was walking distance for us and the hotel even arranged airport shuttle for us at a reduced rate with a private taxi. The taxi driver we had was a treat. My husband and him had a conversation all the way to the airport about cars and such. Alan enjoyed this so therefore I was happy. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to cook for he selves and save some money.

We didn't cook but had breakfast there and it was fine. The room has air conditioing in the living are but not eh bedrooms. There is also an in room safe and communal laundry facilites (not in room). Internet is charged at $8 per day for 1Gb and goes up from there - you can buy for a whole week, Notice I say internet and not WiFi - if you want WiFi you need to get a router from reception and the weekend I was there they were all given out. So I had to use the ethernet cable that they supply in the room and didn't have WiFi for the 2 days we were there. Funnily enough whoever stayed in the room before me had bought a one week internet package and I was allowed to use the rest of the remaining allowance and didn't have to pay for internet usage - so check before you buy!", "user": "Robert L", "date": "March 12, 2013", "id": 154321602}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent, spacious, centrally located hotel", "text": "The reception staff were friendly and immediately attended to any requests we had and even helped us load our car in the morning. So overall it was a pleasant and comfortable stay apart from one thing.....the car parking. There is limited car parking on site and you need to reserve in advance - I did but even so the spaces were all gone. The hotel is on the main street and you cannot stop outside the hotel. You need to pull into the alleyway by the hotel which leads to their limited car park spaces. This alleyway is tight and you need to pull in far left to allow users of the car park to get in and out. Also if more than 2 people are checking in then the alley is full. Once you have unloaded your luggage and checked in, you need to move your car immediately. Luckily I arrived late on Saturday night and was checking out Monday morning at 7am. So between those hours you can park on Emily Place (just behind the hotel) at the meters for free. But check which bays you park in as some are residents only and don't stray into the CBD where the meters are active until 10pm 7 days a week. If you're not lucky enough to arrive at that time of the week you then have to park at a car park 5 minutes away which is not exactly handy. The other snag I encountered was that I arrived on the evening of a concert at Vector Arena so finding a spot was a nightmare and I ended up having to park 1 kilometer away.", "user": "upandatom", "date": "March 9, 2013", "id": 154074018}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A decent family palce in Auckland", "text": "For me the car park challenge was not an issue as I had time to spare but be warned that this is a problem.
