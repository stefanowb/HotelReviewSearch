It wasn't nearly as clean as I expect from a Marriott chain hotel. Glasses pulled from the cubbard were streaked with some sort of residue. The bathroom wasn't as clean as I expected. The desk had a large ring of residue from a large drink on it. Clearly, the wipedown normally performed during a changeout never occured. On multiple occassions during my stay, there was a strong cigarette odor, probably from a neighbor ignoring the no smoking signs. The property is maintained decently, but is not modern. For those who must have a pitch black room to sleep, the curtains do not totally black out the room, so the parking lamps gave a permanent glow indoors.", "title": "Ok at best", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "brian796", "date": "September 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 141534871}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "On the plus side, the rooms have a small kitchen.

My room was set up oddly. The TV didn't face the bed. The kitchenette was nice, although I didn't use it. My toilet kept running every 20 minutes and since I didn't arrive until after 5pm there was no maintenance staff still at work to repair it. They offered to move me, but I stayed put and just closed the bathroom door, so I wouldn't have to hear it. Not a big deal, just a small annoyance. The reason I wouldn't stay here again is because the walls are paper thin. I could clearly hear the conversation in the room next to me and they were not talking loud. I was not even in a connecting room.

There are two separate buildings separated by the parking lot. The main building has the breakfast area, front desk, workout room, breakfast area and ice machine. So if you want to use any of these and are in the other building you have to go out and walk outside to get to them. We had a studio room which had a queen bed, a sitting area, a kitchenette and the bathroom. The room was clean but the TV was awkward on this table and you had to try and swivel it to watch TV in bed. My Mom and Uncle stayed in a two room suite which had separate bedrooms, living room, kitchenette but shared one bath. But each bedroom had it's own TV as well as one in the living room. Great set up for a family. Both kitchens had a small full oven with 4 burners as well as a nice refrigerator. Dishes and a few pots and pans were provided and there was a dishwasher too. My only complaint on my room was there only one mirror in the bathroom. The bathroom was all inclusive (toilet, shower and sink) so there was no place for me to do my hair (dryer mounted on bathroom wall) and makeup while my boyfriend took his shower. I was lucky and was able to run next door to my Mom's room. They had mirrors in each of their bedrooms besides the bathroom mirror. The breakfast area was another story. It was SO SMALL. There were only 3 tables with one connected bench seat on one side and one chair opposite the table. The selections were good (cereal, break, juices, coffee, hard boil egg and oatmeal) but the room was so small and congested we ate there only once and decided to go out and eat on the other mornings. Very disappointing. There are no restaurants within walking distance so a car is a must -- then it is a short drive to several restaurants, fast food and grocery stores.
