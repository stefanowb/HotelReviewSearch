Good sized, modern decorated room with above average linen and room amenities. I understand it's recently been acquired by Clarion so that may explain the only irritation of an empty mini-bar, new business caution no doubt - a bottle of water in the room would have fixed this. Service in general was good and a few negatives can be forgiven on balance when the excellent room rate was taken to account. To improve a little more customer awareness/staff training is needed. For example unable to charge items to room as credit card was not taken at check-in, a slight annoyance as check-in staff didn't ask!
