We spent five sleepless nights pre cruise due to the lack of soundproofing of the balcony doors. Directly below the hotel are benches and chairs where people would congregate all night, sometimes until 5am. I would consider this a budget hotel offering few amenities. There are no toiletries, bar soap or kleenex. They provide a plastic bottle with a pump containing liquid soap. The beds in our room were board hard and the walls very thin. Our room shared a wall with the hostel next door and we had to call our desk several times to have them turn off the loud music playing at midnight. My husband finally started using ear plugs at night. In due respect to the hotel the rooms were kept very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. However, the free beer and wine and mediocre 24 hour buffet were not enticements for us. We would rather sit outside at one of the many tapas bars and enjoy a reasonably priced meal and sangria and watch the sites of La Rambla. Barcelona is a beautiful and vibrant city and we do look forward to returning. However, we value our sleep and prefer a quiet environment and therefore would definitely not stay at the Hotel Continental.", "title": "Sleepless on La Rambla", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "hollywoodChicago", "date": "November 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 145231823}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Hotel right on the Rambla with a great location.

The balcony was nicer than expected and the views of La Rambla was as good as described! However, the same reviews did say that the noise of La Rambla was a bit loud, and I wasn't expecting for it to be THIS loud. We ended up going to bed at 2:30am and it was still a party atmosphere outside. Actually, it never stopped, people were still going at it when we awoke at 7. So for the first time in my life, I slept with earplugs. My advice is to either bring earplugs, or do not book a balcony room if you are concerned about being able to sleep with all of the street noise of people shouting. We could not figure out how to turn on the AC (may have been off for the season?) so we had to sleep with the balcony door open.
