Ahh where shall I begin, I will keep my lengthy opinion of this city overall at bay during this review & stick to the hotel. First & foremost I was graciously welcomed, provided a map to the city including all the hotel information and shown to my room, the front desk clerk explained to me all the features and then brought up my luggage, he was very polite & he spoke excellent english. The room was small but I expected that since its europe, what was weird was the small door for the toilet which was placed in a 3.5ft sq closet like space, acceptable for anyone who isnt too large, but it would be better if the door didnt close automatically when u went in, it makes it really claustrophobic. The Mac computer/TV in one was excellent idea, the free wireless internet was really fast, and the bed was super comfortable with 4 pillows the way it ought to be. What I enjoyed most was the rain showerhead, with 3 side shower heads and great water pressure that's great being I just came from Rome where water dribbled out. The french windows opening out onto the street were also a nice touch. Now the concerns: There is no desk space/place to work, I was hunched over on my labtop trying to get work emails done an hour a day. I looked at the breakfast menu since it is not complimentary 1 morning they want $25usd for a continental breakfast?? I walked back to my room. Plenty of restaurants in the area instead may i suggest St-Placide Metro around the corner alot of food variety in that intersection, I heard drilling either floor below or floor above one morning around 9:30am only heard it the 1 morning, there is a construction site next door which I think should be mentioned on TA I have enclosed a photo. I thought the hotel was awesome overall, just personally don't see $300 a night rate I paid for the smallest room option, especially", "title": "4 Star Review Excellent Stay, Great Hotel Just Overpriced", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "SunsetInStyle", "date": "August 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 137848152}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled solo", "text": "in August, I travel alot, Paris is a ghost town except for all tourist attractions in august be prepared for the lines, walking back to this place at night alone might have you looking over your shoulder, it did for me. Throw in a few freebees some how like breakfast (I don't mean the marshmallow on my pillow), or drop your rate but to be honest walking back from Eiffel Tower area I passed several hotels much closer and when I looked them up they were at least $75 cheaper a night. Tips: Take the metro everywhere buy the 10 ticket value pack it saves you $6usd, maps make places look close, they are not by any means in paris. Download the TA CityGuide map to your smartphone/itouch it works offline & has a subway map therefore you won't need a paper map out all the time. Don't expect anything but the bare minimum of assistance from anyone in Paris besides the staff in this lovely hotel, from my travels the french seem to only know english when they need help with something like when they're outside their country & lost which is kind of ironic based on their general perception of helping people lost in paris....", "title": "Chic & Modern but also comfortable", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "tucsondood", "date": "August 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137789331}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have stayed here twice.

The use of a hairdryer in another room tripped the alarm. Lots to do in the area being near St Germains and Montparnasse. Some nice restaurants in the area.

The staff also juggled our rooms to enable us to check in at about 10am. The rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds but are particularly small (it is Paris). The bathrooms are great, with awesome showers that have a huge shower head and side wall jets. There is a little bit of noise from surrounding rooms, and while the street was generally quiet through the night, without fail there would be the occasional scooter or garbage truck banging down the street in the early hours of the morning. There was construction going on next door, but for the most part this wasn't too noisy and restricted to daylight hours.

Jean-Baptiste graciously took our bags and offered their Spa for us to freshen up and called us when our room was ready. Dany brought us to our room where our bags were already delivered. It was gorgeous! We were welcomed to a trail of rose petals from the door to the top of the bed, a personalized note, box of cholocolates and bottle of champagne. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was heaven. The room did not seem too small...you're in Paris after all! The staff is what put this hotel over the top! We were greeted morning, noon and night by our names and they went out of their way everyday to help us...always a smile on their face! I can honestly say that I miss Jean-Baptiste, Dany & Guillaume who work the front desk. And Aurelie...she was just as amazing. Loved going to the bar in the evenings before heading to our room for dessert and a glass of wine. Aurelie always went out of her way to make us feel so special. You can not go wrong with Hotel La Belle Juliette and the location is wonderful.

The discreet luxury of a four-star hotel and the charm of an address that visitors and Parisians will give to their most demanding, cultured friends. In the pure Parisian tradition of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, the hotel is guided by a modern vision of romanticism and urban conviviality. Exceptional service with particular attention to hospitality, guests\u2019 well-being, calm and tranquility\u2026 all in the heart of bustling Saint Germain. Corinne and Pascal Moncelli, the owners of the hotel, have decided to breathe new life into an establishment that had been left to abandon on the rue du Cherche-Midi by telling the story \u2013 or rather stories \u2013 of a famous historical personality. This star of her time lived in the 19th century, frequented all the intellectuals and politicians of the era, was blessed with exceptional beauty, had an extraordinary love life and \u2013 above all \u2013 excelled in the art of receiving. The popular literary salon that she organised from the tender age of 15 attracted the greatest minds of the time and continued until her death, age 72! It is Juliette Recamier \u2013 famously known as La Belle Juliette \u2013 who gives her name to this new hotel."}
