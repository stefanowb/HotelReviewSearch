I used the free WiFi in the Lobby and it was suitable for my needs. We were on the 4th floor (Room 404) away from the elevators. It was a small room but adequate. The washroom door opened on to the toilet bowl - no big deal. Street noise was OK but it is located in an active area, there is always something going on. Door slams from other rooms were annoying but I think this was more a factor of inconsiderate patrons. There are ways to close your door to limit noise. On windy days the lanai door rattled as did the adjoining room door. Stuffed a folded piece of paper in the crack - problem solved. People were up and about very early to catch tour busses, thats just they way it is on holidays, good luck on trying to sleep in (bring ear plugs). Maid service was good and they were extremely friendly. Front counter service was adequate. As previously mentioned this hotel caters to Korean Airlines flight crews and Korean visitors. They tend to keep to themselves and seemed to go out of their way not to interact with other Patrons?", "user": "Ben C", "date": "February 12, 2012", "id": 124502545}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "An adequate hotel in an excellent location", "text": "Location: Excellent.

Snorkeled at Kuilima Cove (Turtle Bay) and had Shrimp Scampi at Giovanni's Shrimp truck, just past (East) of the Turtle Bay turn off. Used Speedy Shuttle to get to and from the airport. Very good service. Snorkelling at Hanauma Bay was good. Saw green sea turtles, eels and a large variety of fish. Take bus #22 on Kuhio street. The bus tends to fill up.

The 18th floor room had a good view of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach and the ocean. The room was very tired looking. The carpet and bedding has seen better days and we did make sure to keep our shoes on when walking on the carpet. We booked a junior suite and it was good size and had a small kitchenette which we used to keep cold drinks and snacks in and to make coffe and tea in the morning. Bathroom was in dire need of an update. The location was very close to everything in Waikiki. I did find the staff pleasant and helpful and buffett breakfast was good but would get boring if you ate there everyday for a week, as it didn't change at all.

They did charge us $15/day for parking which surprised me since the last time I stayed it was only $8/day. There is no free wireless here or anywhere on the island that I'm aware of. You have to pay at least $9/dy for it but I was able to sign up for 3 dys/$13 with one of the wirless providers, just hunt for the discounted rates.

The parking was $15/day extra and there was a problem with the parking ticket and gate everytime we entered or exited. We were finally moved to a different room.
