After reading the different hotel reviews at Tripadvisor I booked Hotel d l'Arcade with Venere.com. I chose this hotel for its near proximity to MTR, historic sites( Madelaine Church, Concord Place) and shopping areas(Champ Elysees, St. Honore and Gallerias Lafayette). My family and I were not disappointed. In fact, when we checked in, they gave us a bigger room, than what I booked for and without any additional cost. It also has a big bathroom. The room was cleaned everyday. The hotel staff were very helpful and attentive to all our needs. We also appreciated the chocolates that were given to us on New Year's Eve. We enjoyed celebrating New Year in Paris despite the very cold temperature and for Hotel d l'Arcade for making it memorable.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "carmenphilippines", "date": "June 8, 2009", "id": 31907652}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008", "text": "The Hotel de l'Arcade was everything we hoped it would be.

Appears to have been subject of a major remodel and upgrade within the last 10 years but still well maintained and in good repair with only a few, minor exceptions that did not diminish the enjoyment of my stays. Staff were friendly and helpful. Lobby area was understated but very attractive as was the breakfast room, with the breakfast offerings above average and more than adequate. Only 41 rooms, so it has an intimate feel. Sister hotel to Hotel Bedford, a larger, 4-star property about 1/2 block up the street.
