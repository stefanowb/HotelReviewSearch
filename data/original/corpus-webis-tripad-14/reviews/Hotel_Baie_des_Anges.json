Rarely have we had a disappointment with any of the hotels services. This time the strong points continue to be the excellent attentive staff, the quite location ( nearby Marineland can be a little intrusive during the summer ) and their comprehensive hot buffet breakfasts ( still rare, or expensive, in France ). The rooms were modernised in 2004/5 to a good international 3/4* standard. The location is frankly not walkable to any beach or to Antibes town, so best to come by car, hire a car or use the hotel's minibus ( Antibes taxis are a well known rip-off and should be avoided at all cost!).", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 16, 2005", "id": 3768830}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Mixed views about the Th", "text": "Unfortunately, this time the dinners disappointed us, they lacked fresh ingredients and concentrated too much on presentation and just 'being different for the sake of it'.

I would certainly recommend this hotel, but only if you come by car or do not mind taking taxis all the time: it is situated outside the center of Antibes, even the beach is at a 15 minutes walk. Personnally I'd say that's an advantage: Antibes and the other nearby towns and cities (such as Juan-les-Pins, Nice, etc) are very crowded, filled with buildings, shops, restaurants, cars and so on; you can reach all of this by taking your car but you can also escape the noise and crowds again by simply returning to your hotel! The hotel is indeed very quiet: there's a bar that closes at 23.00, there's no music around the swimming pools, and so on, but this really allows you to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet after a year of hard working... In the evening, you can have your meal in open air, under a parasol, looking over the sea, it's great. There are free relaxingchairs around the swimmingpools, the hotel is not \"chique\", but nice and clean, and the price-quality-relation is very good. There are quite some spa-possibilities as well.
