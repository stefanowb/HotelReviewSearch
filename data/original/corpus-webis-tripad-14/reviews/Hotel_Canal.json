The staff were not friendly, the breakfast was awful, the lukewarm coffee was served out of a flask! But the worst of all was the accommodation, two adults and two teenage children squashed into what should have been a small double room. It had a double bed and two singles, wardrobe and two lockers, we could hardly move. Apart from being extremely small, the room was dusty.

While it's not exactly elegant, it was fine for what it was- and that is old. If you are arriving by train, the hotel is right across the Grand Canal from the train station, making it very convenient. We paid upwards of $175/night, but it was also New Year's and the city was booked. Our room overlooked the corner of the Grand Canal and the side canal, right by the bridge. The views from the room were great- though it did get a bit loud from the boat traffic. Be sure to request a canal view. The outside of the hotel does need a facelift, or something, but doesn't every building in Venice? Our room had a double bed (please note in Europe, this means 2 twin beds stuck together, so get used to falling in the 'crack'). The ceilings were quite tall, but our square footage was not much- barely enough room to put all our luggage. There was a cabinet though, which held some items. The bathroom was typically small, though it did have a bathtub (which we used), and that was a treat. The staff at the front desk was helpful, though there was a semi-rude breakfast lady who didn't seem very nice. Speaking of breakfast, it can easily be skipped at this hotel. It is very basic- some bread, juice, yogurt, and coffee. We opted to skip breakfast the second morning. One nice thing about the hotel is that they bake their croissants early in the morning, so both mornings we were actually awakened by a pleasant smell of fresh bread seeping through the entire place- it made our mouths water in bed! Note, there are stairs that you will have to lug your luggage up and down, and 'luggage keep' means stashing your luggage in the breakfast room (they don't have a separate locked room), so make sure you take all your valuables. One drawback of the hotel is that it's a long walk to Rialto (20 min.) and St. Mark's Square (30 min.), and you have to walk through the crowded and narrow alleys- but at least it's scenic... I mean you are in Venice (at least there are signs- to get back to the hotel, just follow the signs that say 'Piazza Roma', since it's near the hotel. Luckily, there is also a water bus stop nearby, which will take you to the main sites too, but be ready for a pushy crowded and long boat ride for 5 Euro.
