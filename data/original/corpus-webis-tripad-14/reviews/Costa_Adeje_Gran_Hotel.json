Like the previous traveller, I too had read all the reviews on this hotel and was not disappointed. We had the best service we have ever had. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the food good. We had a lovely room overlooking the pool. The area in which the hotel is situated is great. A stroll down the hill (hike coming up!) takes you down to the lovely del duque beach which was very picturesque with some really pretty bars and shops. I heard people in the hotel restaurant complaining about the bacon and the sausages not being English.

The hotel was awesome!! We especially loved the rooftop pool with the 360 views. We had half-board and the food was really good with variety and change every day. The hotel is in a great location towards the end of the hotel area with other more upscale hotels in the area. The beach is a short walk down the hill and to the right. This beach was a lot nicer than to the left with whiter sand and beautiful blue water. Loved it!! the day we left, we were able to check our luggage and go to the beach. The hotel let us book a shower room for free to change later before we were picked up for the airport. WE didn't use any of the spa facilities, but they looked nice (of course there was extra charges for all this). Nightly entertainment was nice for families and kids, but the talent was lacking. We were able to book day trips from the hotel and did the trekking trip to Masca that was just spectacular with a great boat ride and lunch. They picked up and dropped off at the hotel. This was the highlight of our trip, but the beach and rooftop pool were a close second). Our airconditioning didn't work in our room the first night, but they fixed it promptly in the morning. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "nonethname", "date": "August 1, 2006", "id": 5536648}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Just returned from a week at the Adeje Gran and will definitely be going back. We read the reviews here and were not disappointed! The entrance is very impressive (like a Palace!!)with a lovely bar and live piano player singing every night. You can sit in the bar or up in one of the seating areas to listen. The hotel is on such a large site you never feel it is crowded even though it was fully booked. Our room overlooked the pool and ocean- This gave us great day and night views. We were a little worried our 15 year old son would be bored on holiday with mum and dad but he soon made plenty of friends and the pools are so large you don't need to worry about them getting in anyone's way. You must try the roof terrace for a late afternoon swim- it is something else- so quiet and peaceful. We stayed half board and there was loads of choice for breakfast (full cooked/ continental/cheese/ham/pastries selections) and evening with chefs cooking seasonal food, fish, meat, steak, chicken and plenty of side dishes/salads/sweets/icecream- you could really experiment (octopus/cuttlefish) or stay safe (steak chips) whatever took your fancy- we loved the variety! Don't worry about the sun loungers- just take your towels down with you when you have breakfast- unless you want to be right next to the pool- I recommend the terrace overlooking the sea- you get a lovely breeze and its much quieter. Take a walk to the new shopping centre (5 minutes)- open til 10pm so you can go when its cooler- there are some good perfume shops and clothing stores. Then carry on to the beautiful white sand beach of Del Duque- it is so pretty and the shops and bars are new and clean.

The hotel is wonderful, the rooms were huge and the views over the Atlantic were lovely. If you stay in a suite you get free use of the La Laja Buffet, which basically is a quieter restaurant where they cook your choice of meat whilst you wait. The Finca restaurant is the main eating area for all other guest rooms and can be quite busy at times, although our teenagers preferred to eat there as they could meet up with friends. We ate breakfast at the Laja as it was a peaceful and unrushed way to start the day and then some evening meals at Finca. The food is good if you are a meat eater, although two of our party (myself included) are vegetarians and it was basically salads with chips or cauliflower cheese, although they did have a good selection of veg they tend to put bacon or bits of chicken in with it! Anyway, don't want to go on about the food side as the hotel offers much more. The pools are lovely, the roof terrace views are amazing, the maid service is daily and is very good, I personally did not see any sunburned Brits with tatoos as the previous person has mentioned! The staff are all Spanish speaking, but they do make an effort to understand the guests. To comment on their lack of ability to speak English is just arrogant and ignorant! You are in their country! Our teens made friends with Spanish boys who said that the people in Tenerife speak with a different accent to mainland Spain and even they had trouble understanding each other. Reception staff all speak good English, so if there are any problems you can always get help from them. We went to the Aqualand water park for a day out, but to be honest it is so small you can get around it in a couple of hours. The water rides are good fun, try the new Boomerang ride! One thing to note is that you have to pay for the rental of loungers once inside and the food and drink counters are quite expensive, so take extra Euros with you. The Dolphin show is amazing. Try to queue up early so you can sit on the front row and they may pick one of your children to take part. We walked to the Duque beach one evening and the little bars and shops along the front are lovely, as is the view from the cliffs. The resort of Adeje is far quieter than Americas or Cristianos. We felt very safe and were not pestered by any ticket touts. We went to both Americas and Cristianos during our stay and we got the feeling that they are very \"tired\" resorts and could do with a bit of a facelift in parts. Adeje is a newer resort and, without meaning to sound snobby, a little more \"elite\".
