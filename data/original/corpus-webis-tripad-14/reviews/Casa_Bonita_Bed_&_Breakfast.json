Our only problems with the room was that it was stuffy at night - we didn't feel comfortable leaving the windows open due to bugs & being on the ground floor (even though there were bars on the windows), and that the hall light shone in through the transom over the door all night long.

It is a National Monument located in a protected historical neighbourhood in the center of Santiago. Casa Bonita has a high historical value for Chile since it used to belong to the well known Vicaria de la Solidaridad del Arzobispado de Santiago, a foundation created in 1976 aiming to protect and defend human rights during the Military Regime. The Vicaria supported 984 cases and operated during the entire Military Regime. It closed in 1992. Casa Bonita offers a cosy environment with well furnished rooms, new and modern bathrooms, a comfortable living and dining room, a lovely interior garden and an internet room with free access. Casa Bonita is personally run by its owners (a Dutch-Chilean marriage) aiming to provide its guests with a quality service for a fair price. Due to its location and infrastructure, Casa Bonita is oriented to both tourists and business people."}
