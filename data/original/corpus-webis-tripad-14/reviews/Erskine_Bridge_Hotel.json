There are 2 ways to do Scottish - tatseful and qulaity Scottish products and tacky tartan - this was neither. There were only 4 / 6 whiskies on the bar - no real selection of Scottish beers and the produce on the menu seemed like standard Bake Bros frozen food. The waitress we had was very helpful and worked hard to see we had everything we wanted. The bar staff weren't so helpful and had had no training about Whiskies etc.. so if you are a tourist from abroad looking for a more Scottish experience I would give this a wide berth. Given the proximity to the airport I would imagine having traditional scottish produce / drinks on the menu would enable them to sell more and make more money but obviously i was wrong.", "title": "Nice Anniversary Weekend", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "whimbrelboy", "date": "February 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6807173}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Wake up Glasgow Tourist Board", "text": "The swimming pool area was great - hot tub esp good!
