We absolutely loved our villa (17) very quiet and as stated by a previous reviewer a place you wouldn't want to leave and we didn't at least for the most part. . We were greeted on arrival by Bam Bang in a very new vehicle and nothing was too much trouble. Because of a very busy airport it took forever to get out but were met by a smile even though it was 2am in the morning. Check in was easy and we were shown to our villa which was beautifully lit. Instantly loved it. At 2am we took our first dip in the wonderful pool and that is where we stayed for the next 10 days. I had requested a quiet villa and on the sunny side of the street to avoid a shaded pool and this request was met. Mind you we were there for 10 days and hardly saw another guest. When we were leaving for airport met another couple who had also been there the same 10 days and we had never seen them. The villas are so quiet and have everything you need. The in villa breakfast was wonderful and varied and cooked and served by delightful staff ever eager to please. Once again nothing was too much trouble. We took afternoon tea most days in our villa and this too was great. Maybe a few western options could be made available as rice cakes may not be to everyone's taste. Still a treat though. Room service meals were very reasonably priced and like the breakfast was set up on your dining table, all the glamour of a restaurant without leaving the villa. Privacy was assured by the do not disturb plaque which you could place on the hook by the entrance to your villa. This was never abused. All you really have to do is make sure to remove it for room cleaning, turn down etc. As per a previous review the linen and towels really need to be upgraded as they probably prevent me from giving it 5 stars. I think there is something about crisp white linen and fluffy towels that give you that 5 star experience. Having said that you are not paying 5 star price so please do not expect it but what you will get is a wonderful holiday, extremely friendly and efficient staff, lovely villa, brilliant pool and somewhere you can call home whilst in Bali. Having travelled extensively I would have to say this was probably the best relaxing holiday we have ever had. The road leading to the villa is without a doubt awful and in urgent need of some sort of repair work but never prevented my husband or I walking it by day or night. Yes you have to dodge puddles, holes, motobikes, taxis, people but it is all part of the bali experience and this same road was home to many other \"5\" star villas so please do not let this put you off staying at the Bhavana .
