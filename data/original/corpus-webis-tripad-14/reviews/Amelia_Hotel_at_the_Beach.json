The hotel was comfortable and the staff was friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was ok for families with small children. The room rates were lower than the area's average and the quick walk to the beach made it easy to go back and forth as conditions changed during the day.

The location makes for a very short walk to the beach. Our room was not a beach view room. The only downside to our stay was the inconsistent wireless internet access in our room.

We had extended family in, groomsmen,brides family and the honeymoon couple. Our stay was so relaxed and enjoyable due to a very special person who works for the hotel and her name is Elizabeth Thompson. She went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable and the honeymoon couples stay very memorable. I hope the hotel realizes what a valuable asset they have in her. If we needed something either she took care of it for us or told us where we could go to get it taken care of. Our room was so relaxing and roomy which is exactly what we needed due to all the groomsmen ended up in our room to change. So thank god Elizabeth recommended the size we would need to accomodate all of them and us too. The beds very extremely comfortable and relaxing which is what we needed by time everything was over. You could walk out of the hotel cross the street and you were on the beach. The rates where very reasonable considering the time of year it was.

Nice rooms and we always sleep like babies. Lots of pillows and good A.C. Fabulous location. Ate at Sliders the first year. Average restaurant but great atmosphere. Kids loved the playground and we could enjoy ourselves while watching them play. The beach is RIGHT there. After we would eat breakfast each morning, which is more than enough for breakfast, we would go to beach and spend 3-4 hrs and then come rinse in pool shower and swim for about an hour. Pool is not in great position, as it is average and located right in middle of parking lot but all other amenities make up for this. We make this our yearly tradition.
