Our room was ready and we had the promised Ocean View, with a very good view of the ocean & the pool from our lanai. Unfortunately, as we didn't have a vehicle, it was too far out of town to walk in for food/entertainment, and therefore we had to us a taxi every time. Although it was only around $10 each time, it was still a pain. The kitchen in the unit was very old and outdated, except for the fridge which had an excellent ice maker! However, as we were only there for 4 nights, and we only cooked on one of those, it was sufficient for our needs. Unfortunately, we couldn't open the curtain in the bedroom for some daylight, as it was directly on the walkway verandah between units.", "user": "JenRei", "date": "October 7, 2011", "id": 119027572}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Time to relax", "text": "We spent a week here in mid August.

Kona By The Sea is a very good condo resort. The staff was very nice and helpful in everyway. Upon arrival, our first condo (Unit 409) had a couple of issues, but the office manager put us in a different unit (Unit 309) which was fantastic. We stayed in a 1 bedroom, 2 bath oceanfront unit and the view was beautiful. Very good appointments and all worked well. We also met some very nice people there who were long time returning guests as well. No hassles at all, you couldn't ask for a better vacation. However, my Wife and I were very disappointed with the housekeeping. No dusting, no vacuuming, did not clean lanai or entry way (very dirty feet) or do anything in the living room. Maybe our sheets were changed only once the whole time. Also, we found crumbs and pepper flakes (we had no pepper in the unit) on the dining table, so the maid had lunch in our place and didn't bother to clean the mess.

This place you can relax to the max or travel around depending on your inclination. Far enough out of Kailua to be away from the hustle and bustle (If you can call the pace that in any event), but near enough to walk if you like hitting the roads, about a 30 minute walk to town. We have stayed in the one bedroom apartment and found them really good. Everything you want and the pool is the right size and is never crowded to the extent it puts you off. They have barby's that you can use and these are cleaned daily. The maids are in daily and we found they will call back if you are still in your room. The staff at the hotel are so helpful.

Then we went to our apartment which was very seedy. The carpeting (lime green) was stained and dirty. The walls (lime green commercial color) were marked up and dirty. The bathroom was OK but not up to standard nor was the kitchen. I asked if they had a more updated room but they said not for 2 days so we stayed put. The DVD played did not work and they kept forgetting to give us coffee. I finally asked what the \"$10 amenity fee\" was for and they refunded it.
