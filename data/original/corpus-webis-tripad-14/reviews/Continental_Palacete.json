The location is very good, close to catalunya square and the Ramblas. We took a bus from the airport to Catalunya square and wheeled our bags a few blocks down to the hotel. Wasn't that bad, just don't carry very heavy bags, as the hotel does not have any bellhop to carry your bags for you and you do have to carry your bags up to the top landing where there is a quaint little pulley to take you upto the main floor. The hotel is very small, must have been an old palazzo residence or made to look like one, as the suite room we stayed in was decorated like a parlor. For 4 people they only have 2 suites which consists of basically a small parlor with 2 roll away beds, a sitting area, and a fireplace, beautifully decorated with gilt mirrors and high ceilings. Leading off this parlor is a small bedroom only big enough to hold a double/queen bed and a small dresser and fridge. Next to the bed is the bathroom which is extremely tight. The room was quaint and looked down onto the street which was quite busy even late in the night. Right next to the suite room was the common dining area, where one can have coffee, tea, sodas and snacks all day long. there were 3 tiny balconies with tables also looking out onto the street, for a blissful morning cuppa. A word of advise, don't expect much in terms of food. It is just a breakfast bar with some snacks throughout the day. The menu never changed, but included egg omelets, boiled,egg quiches, some kind of salads, different dried nuts, cereals, fruits, yogurts,milk, tea, coffee, soft drinks, water and juice. There are only 2 or people working here, one at the front desk, one in the little kitchen behind the snack bar and maybe a maintenance person. Couldn't really complain. Except that when we were back home we got an unexpected high charge on our credit card from them, which after investigating was for broken down air conditioning which was not even our doing. so a word of caution- never give out info about 2 cards.", "title": "Quaint and charming, Bed and breakfast in a palazzo.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "rah37", "date": "May 26, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 65341646}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "One can walk down all the way down the Ramblas to the waterfront and the Columbus monument.
