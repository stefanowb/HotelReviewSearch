This is definitely the nicest for the money. The room was very recently redecorated; it looked like new carpet, new drapes, new bedspread, etc. The room was well cleaned every day & all the staff I met were very courteous. The free continental breakfast was pretty good. They even had little cups of waffle batter & a waffle iron to make your own waffles.

Small hotel but it was all we needed. Pool was temporarily out of service but they offered us the use of the Residence Inn pool next door (same ownership); very nice. Linens are great, as their website states; but mattresses were boxy. Breakfast was perfect for our group; included some protein for our sports team, unlike most complimentary breakfasts. Very clean. Stayed 2 nights. Some freeway noise and construction trucks beeping; but all the hotels in this area are right by the freeway. A lot of restaurants & tons of shopping nearby. Busy town on a Saturday night: there was a 45-60 minute wait at most restaurants we tried, except at Spumoni (20 minutes). Food & service there was great!

When we hit a traffic jam in Santa Clarita, we decided to stop for the night. We chose the Fairfield Inn because we thought it would be the least expensive lodging in the immediate area. We were very pleased with the hotel. It seemed new and was very clean. Our room was quite large. The continental breakfast was ok but the waffle iron for the \"make-it yourself\" waffles was not heated up enough to function correctly even though the breakfast area had been open for more than 1/2 hour. If I ever stay in Santa Clarita again, I would stay here again.

I then set the alarm in the room for 3:50 a.m. (the clock was set for a.m. instead of p.m.) so it never went off. We got a call from our son, who was already at the airport in Los Angeles waiting for us at 5:30 which woke us up. Needless to say, we didn't get the wake-up call and missed our flight.
