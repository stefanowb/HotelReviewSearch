We find it amazing to find a pristine beach next to a high-end resort with service-orientated staff and none of the annoyances found elsewhere. The sand is soft, the sun is warm, the sea is gentle, no annoying vendors, the entire area is safe, our room was wonderful, staff is excellent... what more could one what?
