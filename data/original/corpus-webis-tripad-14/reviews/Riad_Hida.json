They ended up offering us an upgrade to the Kastberg suite instead of two separate rooms for three of our five night stay, which we gladly accepted. The Kastberg is situated in the building with the restaurant in it, up a spiral staircase to a lounge area with a very wide double bed and a vast selection of built in wardrobes. The lounge area has a writing table, coffee table and ample seating. This room leads via three sets of patio doors to a small ante-lounge with a small table and more seating. Turn left to a huge bathroom with a shower, toilet, bidet and double tub (bath) (with Jacuzzi jets which we didn\u2019t try because the wiring in Morocco scared us a bit, but we are boring British folk). It takes a good few minutes for the hot water to arrive out of the tap, so long in fact, we were convinced there was no hot water; only to be proved wrong by a very patient member of staff. Anyway, the ante-lounge has another door leading to a twin room. Both bedrooms have aircon/heating/climate control, which was very handy given the five days of non-stop rain (very rare apparently) and we can confirm the heating works fine. If it does rain, please do not expect the rooms to be watertight. Various puddles appeared and the walls in the bathroom turned a darker shade due to wetness. This is Southern Morocco and it rarely rains, so no-one really knows how to plan for it \u2013 a bit like London when it snows. The last two nights were spent in rooms 18 & 19. These were sold as a single and a double \u2013 although both had two beds each. Also the double room key opened the single room door \u2013 useful for parents needing access to a teenage room. These rooms had a sofa, table, triple wardrobe and a five piece ensuite.", "title": "Shabby chic, relaxed oasis", "user": "Holidayonastick", "date": "November 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 146025587}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The grounds are wonderful. There are plenty of places for a teenager to go and sulk, away from nosey parents. The pool was big but unheated, which normally would not be a problem (if no rain....bbrrr.). Plenty of sunbeds, with umbrellas and a vast selection of trees and folly buildings to hide from the sun/rain. The whole site is either a bit shabby or in the process of being built, slowly.

The couscous was divine, the tagine show stopping, the kebabs tasty \u2013 but they tried to be European and put easy cook rice and frozen chips on the side, which ruined things a bit for me. If someone could just convince them to stick to Moroccan stuff, we would have been much happier. Coffee at breakfast was a fair filter not instant. The orange juice freshly squeezed. The pancakes delicious. The omelette was a bit rubbery, but again, if they stuck to Moroccan food, the outcome would be far nicer.
