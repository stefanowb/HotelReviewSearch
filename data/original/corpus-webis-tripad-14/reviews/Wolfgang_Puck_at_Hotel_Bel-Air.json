Having said that, I have been a regular of the Hotel for years and heard about the \"renovations\" and decided to see for myself by having dinner at the new Wolfgang Puck restaurant. So sad. First of all, I understand the interest in going \"hip\" upscale, modern, and the old girl did need a fresh face lift. But really folks, you cannot take a Hotel W interior design concept and stuff it into a classic Mediterranean facade without it looking just like that....cut and paste ridiculous. It just looks silly when you are sitting in the old alcoves of the Terrace and you see someone has stuck black wood embellishments onto the pink ceiling to make it look more modern. I have nothing against great design or making changes to an existing concept to make it fresh and alive. But this is a mess. Also, judging from the other reviews here, it sounds like it's too much work to stay there as well. When I pay a lot of money to eat and stay in a great hotel, I want to relax...not be required to take a course in electronic devices or look at a plate of food that costs $60 ( the Dover sole) and wonder where the food went? My plate had three pieces of fish the size of 3 double postage stamps with some sauce. Really? for 60 bucks? I hate to say this but the feel of the property on the outside is one thing, then once inside it's something else. That's the major design flaw here. It's like you walk into a green, calm oasis at the gate, and the further in you get, you get slapped in the face with cold, black and brown, contemporary design elements. This isn't Vegas, it's the Bel Air Hotel. Anyway, the staff was very nice the entire evening, but I too detected they are tired of \"supporting\" these new changes. Most of them were getting the ear full the entire evening. Meanwhile the restaurant was very good. But even for someone like myself, who is more than willing to pay up for great food, I think I should feel properly fed after paying $400-500. I did not. So my love affair with two classics (The Bel Air and Wolfgang) is over for the time being. I suspect in the end they will end up admitting the mistake and start over. Bad interior design pushes people away...modern or otherwise, and it is my experience that no matter how good the food is or how technologically advanced the room lighting is, people don't want to work that hard to feel good in their rooms or leave the restaurant hungry after paying 400 bucks. People will walk with their feet and as far as I could tell, with the restaurant 1/2 full when I left around 9pm, they are.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "cmandell", "date": "February 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 124264401}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited November 2011", "text": "Had an enjoyable light business lunch on the terrace, excellent place for people watching too (saw 2 celebs dining beside us).
