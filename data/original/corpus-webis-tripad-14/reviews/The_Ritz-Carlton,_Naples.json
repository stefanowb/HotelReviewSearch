This hotel was very nice, wonderful decor and room design. Beautiful view from our balcony of the gulf. They brought us free choc. covered strawberries since it was our honeymoon. The food in the hotel dining establishments was very good, exept it is very expensive, plan to spend a lot if you eat at the hotel. Do not order the chocolate cake from the room service menu, it tasted like frozen Sara Lee cake. For all room service orders they add like $5 and 18% tip. Everyone there expects a tip, so be prepared for this. I forgot my pool supplies and a foam \"noodle\" was $8 at the pool shop compared to $1 at WalMart. The only really bad thing that happened was at the end of our stay we called the Concierege to call a taxi for just us (2) to go to the Naples Airport the next morning. We get down there and they called a 12 passenger van just for us that was $85, then proceeded to take us to Ft. Myers airport. $85 is crazy for a 5 min. taxi ride.

We had scheduled tennis lessons with the hotel's pros from ten o'clock to noon on two consecutive days, including our checkout day. Because the standard checkout time is noon and we had hoped to spend some of the afternoon by the pool and then shower, change and get ready for our evening flight, as soon as we arrived at the hotel, we asked for a late checkout of 4 p.m. (which I have never had a problem getting at other Ritz hotels). We were told that a 4 p.m. checkout would incur a charge for an extra night. We then asked if we could have a 2 p.m. checkout instead, and the response was that we would be charged for an additional half-day for the privilege of having the room for two hours beyond the noon checkout. All the hotel would agree to was a one-hour extension of our checkout time, until 1 p.m. Later one of our group returned and spoke to the manager, who conceded to a late checkout of 2 p.m. She was told that the hotel would be nearly filled with incoming guests on Sunday. As it turned out, when we left the hotel at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, the entire place was empty. Why, then, was the hotel to so rigid in refusing to allow us a 4 p.m. checkout?", "user": "luvsunOhio", "date": "February 4, 2010", "id": 55216561}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful hotel, great service.", "text": "Our second complaint was the shower fee. The hotel's gym is on the ground floor of the spa building. The only showers in the building are on the spa level, inside an area containing a locker room as well as a whirlpool, sauna, steam room and lounge. Because we would be leaving the hotel late Sunday afternoon and the late checkout had become difficult, we concluded that we could shower in the spa building (since we would no longer have our rooms) after spending some time by the pool. However, we learned that the hotel policy is that the spa showers and locker room may only be used by guests who purchase a spa service; those who do not purchase a spa service must pay $35 per person to use the showers. This struck us as ridiculous. (By the way, we had spent nearly $400 per day on hotel tennis fees.) Luckily, our group member who managed to get us an extra hour for late checkout was able to get \"day passes\" from management permitting us to use the spa showers -- one pass issued to each of the three hotel rooms, entitling two guests per room to use the showers. Did this go smoothly? NO. When we arrived at the spa, the spa receptionist said that each pass was only good for ONE person, not two. After some polite argument, we were able to convince her that the three passes had been intended to cover all six of us. We took our showers, but the experience was unpleasant and stressful, for no good reason.", "user": "cdmnc", "date": "January 31, 2010", "id": 54879877}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent, Top Notch Hotel", "text": "Finally, the restricted pool area. One-third of the poolside area around the \"quiet pool\" (adults only) is a cabana area available only to guests who pay the $495 daily cabana fee. The daily cabana fee includes lunch for four, massages for two, beverages, and some other services. The cabanas are set back on a raised terrace; down on the lower deck area along the pool's edge are about a dozen of the same sun lounges that surround the rest of the pool. When we got to the pool at about 2 p.m., all of the chairs were taken, except for those in the cabana area, which was completely deserted. We asked the pool manager whether we could just sit on the sun lounges as no other chairs were available. Of course, the answer was \"no\", though no one at all was using the cabana area -- it just remained empty. They did eventually bring some chairs from another area and jam them into a corner next to the building, so at least we had a place to sit.
