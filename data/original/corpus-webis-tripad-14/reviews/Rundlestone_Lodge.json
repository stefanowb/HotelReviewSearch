We paid a few dollars more for a \"premium\" room and to be honest I was tempted to ask to see a standard room to find out what the difference was (aside from the cost). I would definitely not stay here again. Nothing was wrong (aside from chipped furniture and gum on the bedpost) but I was disappointed based on the rating. I just think I could do a lot better for the price. Also note that you are not allowed to wear your ski boots in the lobby or bring your snowboards or skis into the hotel. When coming back from your day of skiing you have to press a button to open the garage door and walk down the driveway into the car park and leave your gear there. They do have lockers you can store it in for a $10 deposit.

We stayed in the \"Premier Honeymoon Suite\" for one night and it was perfect! The room was the largest in the hotel (we saw the floor plan of the building) and it was amazing. It was loft style, so the downstairs had a full bathroom, complete kitchen with full-sized fridge, stove, sink, counter, cupboards etc, a dining room with a big table, large jacuzzi, 4-sided gas and wood fireplace, family room with couch and chair, tv with dvd player and an amazing, huge, wrap-around balcony!! Then the upstairs had a king bed, tv and bathroom with toilet and sink. Simply amazing. Even the little things pleased me, like the toiletries they provided - the lotion smelled SO good and they even provided a little pot of lip balm. The jacuzzi had really luxurious robes for us to use too. It was close to a lot of decent restaurants and the downtown part of Banff. The underground parking lot was heated, which was nice!
