The bedroom also has a TV. Walk in robe and separate robe storage in another area. Plenty of storage for clothes (we don't travel light), shoes, accessories, and luggage. The bathroom is out of this world. It has two separate vanities complete with every single toiletry you could possibly wish for or even think of. The toiletries are Aqua de Palma, in full sizes. They are replenished daily. Absolute luxury. Apparently Aqua de Palma only supply a very select number of hotels in the world despite being asked constantly. The shower has a rain shower on the ceiling and a double power shower head on the wall. Also a seat. TV in bathroom too. The toilet is in a frosted glass cubicle adjoining the bathroom and not too private, our only small dislike. The concierge is fantastic. Nothing is too much trouble. We organised a private driver to drive us around HK Island and take us to places not on the tourist route. We also visited Repulse Bay and had lunch at a gorgeous restaurant. A super day out of the busyness of HK. We used the spa and beauty shop which are both top of the line. The spa uses Gaylia Kristensen products which are the world's best as far as I'm concerned. The bar, on the top floor, has one of the very best views of the harbour and great drinks too. It would be great if this hotel had a club lounge, we really missed that feature. We had room service twice and couldn't fault it. The food was fabulous, hot and fresh and served with silver service. Highly recommended. One suite benefit was the option to have breakfast in either of the on site restaurant/cafes or room service. We chose the room service and it was superb. You could order whatever you wanted. It really felt luxurious. Again, it was served on time, hot and fresh. Gorgeous linen cloth and napkins, and silver cutlery and food covers.
