The rooms put you at ease with their historical & personal warmth. Beautiful faux painted walls, with big nice iron beds, fluffy pillows, a beautiful bathroom & lots of room to unwind. Like a French flat from a forgotten time. The staff consists of all artists, which gives this whole scene a boho-chic appeal as well. It sits in the heart of Orchard Street, which is in the super-lux-hip Lower East Side. Seconds from some really groovy bars, fantastic restaurants, sinful shopping, & much more. We heard that this was unlike any of the other hotels in New York, but now we have seen it for ourselves and will return with pleasure. Hats off to Olga, who recommended \"Jin\" a wonderful sushi restaurant to us. She had several other yummy places, but we didn't have enough time to wine & dine ourselves at them all.
