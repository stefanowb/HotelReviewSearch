This was my second stay. The attention to detail was fantastic, including mints in the room! The Gardens combined with the fountains allowed created relaxing environment. The Plaza is within walking distance so I never needed to drive my car. The mission is 1/2 a block away; great restaurants within a block or two. The staff was so accomidating. They were very helpful with places to go, the history of the area, even providing a pick-nick.

The directions on the Internet were completely wrong and we got very lost, in the dark in Sonoma. When we finally got through the person we spoke to said she was \"tired\" ; we had been up since 5am and we were the customers! Three phone calls later we found it, no night staff to greet us, we had to go on a hunt for the key and then managed to find a restaurant which was nice. It was dark when we arrived, the place was not clean, had a funky smell, the cats kept trying to get into the rooms.. We asked to eat breakfast in the garden, they put us on the private balcony that was dirty and had no view. I tried to discuss this with the owner the next morning but could not find her to complain, she was available for us to pay the bill though.. I emailed her some suggestions and she complained about my suggestions. I did not say it was a horrible experience but the place has a reputation with the locals for being sub standard and I would have to agree. Our breakfast on Sunday was supposed to be at 9am I went looking for them and it arrived at 9:45am which did not leave a lot of time to check out. We got a pot of unperculated coffee the second day. The first day breakfast was tasty, the second day breakfast was heated and then left to sit, the bagels were crunchy! Cobwebs, dirt, and smoke coming in our windows.
