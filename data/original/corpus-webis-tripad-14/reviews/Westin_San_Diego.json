The days are so long that I really like to stay where the conference is. Very nice room- bigger than most. View was great. Clean, fantastic beds, double showers heads are the way to go (there is a way to only use one for those who are trying to save water- but it was delightful). Loved that they let us borrow a hot water dispenser- my mom was very happy with it. Fun elevators with nice views of the lobby and outside depending on which one you used. Nice conference space- well staffed. The bell men and valets were fantastic which is so impt since the parking is crazy at $32/night. The lobby restaurant staff were really sweet and attentive. Food was good there and throughout our conference. Just finished the survey from Westin after the trip and they didn't have a place to write about the good experiences, so I put them here.

When we reported it after getting back to the hotel that afternoon, the manager promised to send up a form that evening (she never did). So we requested to meet with the 'security' manager and the ACE Parking manager the next morning, who agreed that they would investigate. One week later, I get an email from ACE who say damage is denied because it was not reported when it occurred. This is a pretty poor response from Westin (outsourcing your parking does not mean you are absolved of responsibility to your guests); apart from costing us in both time and money, they obviously have dishonest valet staff who do not report incidents, or who cover them up.
