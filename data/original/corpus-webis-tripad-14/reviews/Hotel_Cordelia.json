The hotel location is good for exploring Paris during the day as it is only 10 mins from Place de la Concorde, but in the evening it seems dead as all the expensive shops (which are everywhere in that area) are closed and we did not find many restaurants as in Marais for example (maybe we just went all the wrong ways, of course, I do not know). There are no food shops either if you need them. So this is a good choice for day exploring, but not for going out in the evening.
