It is basically an older, although well maintained, motel or motor lodge. Rooms are older, but very clean and spacious. There was a mini fridge and microwave in the room. Coffeemaker in the bathroom with decent coffee (usually this coffee is awful). No breakfast included, but I knew that when booking - eat at Sugar Pine Cafe! (see other reviews). Good choices for eating within walking distance. Right in the center of a very small town. Very small outdoor swimming pool and hot tub. Not heated and very cold, so really couldn't use the pool in June. Did use hot tub once. Was disappointed with the described \"courtyard view\" - aka parking lot! Nice landscaping around parking lot, but that's about it. Also, if you are on the 1st floor, your \"patio\" consists of two plastic chairs outside of your door, in front of your air conditioning unit, looking at the parking lot - not exactly what I envisioned.
