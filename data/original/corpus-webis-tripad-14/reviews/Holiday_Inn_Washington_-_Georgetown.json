There are a couple of reasons we are rating the service as poor. Here's one. We arrived very late, after midnight, and while we paid online for the accommodation, we handed over a credit card on arrival for incidentals (although the room has no fridge or incidentals to purchase). We were woken in the morning by a call from reception to state our credit card was declined so we said we would provide another for them. An hour later, we were woken again by a knock at the door demanding we go downstairs with a cc. We refused and went back to sleep. A few hours later, we were working in the room, and we received another call. This time I was awake enough to exclaim that the room was paid for and I didn't see why they were so concerned that they had to hound us.
