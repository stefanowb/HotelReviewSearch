We had a large lanai with four chairs and two tables. . . and a lovely view of the pool area and the ocean beyond. We took advantage of the hot tub (and large towels picked up at the desk), the lounge chairs on the beach, and the Sand Bar.

After perusing the grounds, I came to like the layout of the mulitple hotel buildings and the wandering grounds that are meticulously maintained. The beach here is long and glorious to stroll from hotel bar to hotel bar or to watch sunrises and sunsets. The surf is too rough (at least this time of year) to do much more than that. The complex was quiet and we were some of the youngest people there (we are in our 30s). The staff were friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. Bring a laptop, though, if you want free internet (otherwise it's $0.15 per minute). The location of this hotel is great, in my opinion. It is well off the street, right on the beach, yet within walking distance of the Coconut Marketplace shopping center. Many restaurants, a Long's Drug, and a Safeway are a short drive away. If you are going to be out exploring the island a lot, as we did, you'll like the East shore, because you're halfway between the North and South shore \"action\". After visting the massively populated beaches (and their surrounding resorts) near Po'ipu and Princeville, I came to appreciate my temporary community even more. This hotel provides you with a free copy of Newsweek and the Newspaper (daily). The bathrooms are huge with a full linen closet. We made many breakfasts in our mini-kitchen and were able to fully unpack our clothes thanks to the large wardrobe and dresser. The reasons why I don't give this hotel an excellent rating: the room cleaning (especially floor) could've been better (additionally, they seemed to remember to give us a bathmat only every other day), the coffee pot went out, there were two sets of hollow-cored doors (each interior-locking) between us and a somewhat loud next-door neighbor, the bar doesn't open until 2 p.m., there are no restaurant or spa facilities (but there are at the very next hotel over).", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "rhnepal", "date": "March 11, 2007", "id": 7013429}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 69, "average": 161, "very good": 435, "terrible": 37, "excellent": 382}, "aka": "Aston Islander On The Beach Hotel Kapaa", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "This newly-renovated oceanfront resort offers guests contemporary island-inspired decor, six acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, a sparkling pool and a stunning beachfront location.
