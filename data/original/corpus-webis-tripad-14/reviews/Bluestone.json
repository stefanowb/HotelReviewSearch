It was a great size for the 3 of us. However, we were very disappointed with the standard of maintenance. The walls going up the stairs were covered in dirty marks and dents. At the top of the stairs someone had had several poor attempts at drilling holes for a stair gate. Many of them had not been filled in and those that had were done poorly and not even painted over. The kitchen had good facilities but the melamine was peeling off the doors. All lodges are supposed to be non smoking but ours definitely smelled of stale smoke (not nice in your bedroom). They cannot enforce this rule so why not have separate smoking lodges so us non smokers don't have to endure the smell for our stay? The mattresses are also like sleeping on MDF board and very uncomfortable. We like firm beds but this was painful. Not what you would expect from what we had been led to believe was a top class reort. Whilst you can expect some wear and tear, the prices they are charging at peak times cannot be justified at this standard. Thankfully we had a reasonable deal being midweek and out of school holidays.

We were very lucky that the adventure centre was free during our stay because the Elf Kingdom took out some of the facilities. The lagoon pool is lovely but the slides are only suitable for children over 1.1m. There is a small slide in the baby pool. The changing rooms are spotlessly clean but again maintenance is an issue here with the showers only staying on for 5 seconds before going off and 2 I tried wouldn't stay on at all.
