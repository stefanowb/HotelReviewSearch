Firstly, they gave us a room in the basement floor in Talbot Square, which we couldn't open the windows and the bathroom was appalling.

Absolutely terrible. In addition, the \"triple\" bed configuration was actually a lousy sofa bed, not even a proper extra bed! They also did not clean the room during our entire 5 days there - dirty!

I did. Dont be fooled. We paid a deposit and booked for a week approximately 4 months in advance. Luckily I had the receipt when we arrived. Our first drama was believing the map they have on the site which showed the apartments being three blocks from Paddington Station- 45 minutes after dragging our bags we arrived 10 minutes before they closed up the reception area. We paid the balance of the stay, and after some difficulty locating the key which had gone missing to our room, we made it a further two blocks to the apartment with the cleaners key. I went up to the room while my partner waited for me to open up. As I opened the door there seemed to be some movement in the dark room- and as the door opened wider I saw a poor bloke sitting up in bed! I apoligised and locked him back in and bolted down the street to try and get someone at the office before they left. Still there- and still not knowing what was going on- so she found us a key to another room, telling me to pop in the next day to sort it out. Back at the apt. I went ahead to open up- no need- the door was wide open and the heat was on. Very comfortable in July! I tried to sort that out, but there was no knob on the old style water heater to turn off the heat. My partner went this time, and came back with a wrench. We turned it off, but found that we had to spend the night with the window open on Islington Terrace- noisy and hot. It seems the premium we paid for air conditioning didnt include air conditioning. The room was fine apart from all this- tiny bathroom, but good kitchen, tiny double bed (not much fun in the heat, fairly thin mattress on a slat base and too small for big Australians). The next morning we trotted up to the office to find that we would have to move out of the room we were in (fine) buit for some unforseen circumstance they were unable to honour our booking at the apartment building. They had lost our booking, and booked others into the room we were in. We were told to get the luggage out of the room and into storage they had at the building (turned out to be the garden shed!), but she was sending a young fellow to assist. He stood and watched while we moved the bags. We were asked to go back to the office at 2pm and they would have somthing sorted out. So- after we wasted a day on this, we arrived back to find that they had nothing for the level of quality we had paid (supposedly 4 star), but could accomodate us at another of their buildings. Turns out it was back at Paddington station, which they offered to pay for a cab to, unfortunately less stars than we had paid for, 2 stars, and we would have to sleep in a double bunk! We started to lose the plot at this stage, and told here we would discuss and return. A quick visit to an internet cafe told us that there was no accommodation in London that weekend due to tennis, the grand prix and Madonna, unless we wanted to pay 800 pounds a night. So I called a friend who came and collected us, to spend our London holiday an hour out of town. Surprisingly, the woman in the office could not process a refund for the balance of the week we had paid for that they could not accommodate us. There were all the stories under the sun about how the boss was the only one who could refund a CC and he was unavailable. This story went on for five days, irate and pleasant phone calls from us having no effect and as we left the country we still werent sure that we had been refunded. That website makes the rooms look really good, and the prices seem very reasonable for all they offer- but its a sham. DONT STAY WITH THEM! Its not worth it.
