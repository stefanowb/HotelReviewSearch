The young lady at the front desk (who doubled as bartender two floors down) seemed overwhelmed. She was unable to make a Ferry reservation for us and was flummoxed by a question about where to go to get an Etna tour. There was wired internet in the room but wifi only in the lobby. Worst of all, our air conditioning stopped working and we got a runaround about it. \"Oh, it's fixed now.\" \"No it isn't\" \"Wait an hour\" \"We waited four hours - still a sauna in the room\" \"I'll send maintenance\". The maintenance guy suggested we leave the outside door open. We did, still had two uncomfortable nights.", "title": "Beautiful modern hotel", "user": "Estelleinlondon", "date": "October 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 118876409}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 11, "very good": 48, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 71}, "aka": "Hotel Esperia Palace Zafferana Etnea, Sicily, Italy", "slim_ranking": 0.142857142857}
