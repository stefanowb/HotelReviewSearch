We decided to make the most of it and did a 2 night 3 day tour of Hong Kong. Hitting the highlights, from the Sheraton, which is in Kowloon, we walked to McDonalds for breakfast (we have a 7 year old) and then to the ferry terminal (15 minute walk) and took the ferry to Hong Kong Island. The ferry costs about .50 cents per adult and kids are even cheaper. Upon arrival on the other side, we walked our way to The Peak tram (they do not take credit cards for the tram); it's about $5 per adult and half for kids. Going to the top is a very worthwhile trip with unforgettable views of the city and the peninsula. You don't need to buy the special Sky Terrace pass, which is about $2 more; you won't be missing anything special. Although, having a small meal or drinks up at the restaurants look like they might be worthwhile since the views are spectacular from there. There's even a Burger King up there. At the top, there's a tourist help center that is helpful with directions for when you get back down. We asked for directions to \"the worlds longest moving walkway\" and once we got back down, took a one-way bus ride to find it. Can't remember what stop it was. Taking the walkway leads you to SoHo. It's kind of a tourist trap in terms of restaurants but we ended up eating at a local Italian place...pizza and pasta. After lunch, we walked back to the ferry stop and back to Kowloon. Once in Kowloon, we bought bus tickets to find our way to the \"Ladies shopping area\". It's depicted on the tour maps. Basically, it's outdoor shopping with over a 100 vendors. You must bargain there. If it's Made in China, you can find it there. Afterwards, we took a bus back to the Sheraton for a quick break and then in the evening, went back out to the \"men's shopping\" area. It's similar to the ladies market. We walked there via the Kowloon park (very nice park in the middle of the city---incredible pool). The men's shopping is about half way between the hotel and the ladies shopping. In the evening at 8 pm, the highrises do a light show that you can see from the top of the Sheraton or from the harbour across the street. We chose to go out and see it from the harbour. It's literally right across the street. The lightshow sounds better on paper than it actually is (they really could have made it so much more), but the skyline of Hong Kong Island is really something to see, at night.", "title": "great location. great hotel", "user": "pechung", "date": "May 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 15535312, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Fantastic location", "disliked": "\u2014 very pricey"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Going back to the airport, you can take bus A21 across the street and about a block from the hotel. it takes one hour and is about $2 per adult.
