The place is seriously rundown. When you first arrive, you will be shocked that this is even a 3 star in the first place. The parking lot is old and cracked. The building looks like it has never been updated. The landscaping is full of weeds and not kept up. Inside, the hallways have carpet that has bumps in it and could cause a tripping hazard. The rooms are need updating. The air conditioner is something one would expect in a Motel 6. Manual controls and placed directly next to the desk. Thus, if you are working at the desk, the air will blow directly on you. The couch looks like something my grandmother purchased in the '70s. The bathroom is significantly small and the exhaust vent made more noise than a semi truck. Worse, the fire door between the adjoining rooms provided a nice way to hear just about everything that happens in the room next door.
