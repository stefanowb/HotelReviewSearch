The room and bathroom were lovely. Both a good size (I was in a premium room). Very nice decor, attractive furnishings, very comfortable bed, great bathroom with separate shower and such good water pressure that it took about two minutes to run a bath. The bathroom had a window, which to me makes a big difference. Nice toiletries in the bathroom, and in decanters rather than the usual packaging-intensive offerings. Very pleasing decor in public spaces too. Excellent breakfast and dinner. And last but not least, delightful staff!
