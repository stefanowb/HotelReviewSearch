Every single staff member in that complex was so helpful and nice, and i ended up getting to know well most of the people at reception and the sports beach. The entertainment staff are great as well, and i especially got along well with DJ Manga and Victor. At night, the pacha nightclub is the place to go for those really over 14. there, i was able to meet many people of my age and have a great time also. During the day, i was kept happy by using the great facilities there, such as the pool, gym, sports beach, pool room or else simply relaxing by the pool or beach. The weather there was great and we only had rain roughly once a week, except from the island being brushed by hurrican frances on my last day there. I have definitely made up my mind that i will go back there again next year if I have the chance again.

On arrival we were asked if we would like a free upgrade to the Bachata next door. Apparently the Merengue was proving to be very popular this year and they were trying to transfer some guests to one of the sister hotels. We were taken on a tour of the Bachata and although it lookeed lovely we decided to opt to stay where we'd booked. With hindsight it wouldn't have mattered either way as we could use the facilities in both hotels along with the facilities at the Mambo. The food at the restaurant was extensive ( none of our party was ill - not even the usual holiday tummy, and I don't think anyone could have eaten or drunk more than us.) The room was airy and kept very clean. The air conditioning was a godsend after a day in the blazing sun. Very hard working and cheerful staff. There was nothing wrong with the pool but we tended to spend our pool days at the Bachata - (swim up bar). It was a much bigger pool. The beach wasn't a typical Caribbean beach (golden sand rather than white and although the sea was lovely and clear it wasn't turquoise blue.) The sports beach was prettier. WE went on the monster truck safari which we all highly reccommend but please take things for the poor kids. Make sure you enjoy the free flowing rum on the way! One of our favourite places to eat was on the terrace of the Bachata. The view across the beach was beautiful. The entertainment was really good in the evening, the only drawback was that the children took centre stage until around 10.00p.m. Some nights we were too tired after packing in a whole day of sun and fun, to wait around for the entertainment to begin. I don't believe in holidaying in the same place twice as the world is such a big place, but this is one hotel I would definitely consider re-visiting.
