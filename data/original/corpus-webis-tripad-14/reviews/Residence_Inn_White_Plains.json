Inn White Plains on weekend of June 28 - July 1, 2013 (3 nights). We were a family of 5. The location is great (walk to everything), the rooms were very spacious (we got an executive suite but the regular suite would have been fine) and the service was amazing. All the staff (especially the front desk) were very nice and accommodating. I would have given the review a 5 star rating but there was no pool and the beds weren't the best. The beds were a bit firm for my liking. My kids would have enjoyed a pool but the extra space in the room sort of made up for the lack of pool. The warm buffet breakfast was good. The Res. Inn is not the Ritz (which is 2 blocks away). But if you want to pay double, have a much smaller room and no breakfast, then stay at the Ritz. Thank you to the front desk at the Res. Inn for this past weekend - sorry guys, I can't remember your names - Jason? and ? The next time I visit White Plains, I will come back to the Res.
