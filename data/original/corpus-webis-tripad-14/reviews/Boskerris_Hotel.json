The rooms, the lounge, dining room, everywhere was beautiful. What I wanted to comment on was the food. I had not realised they did dinner until we got there. What a treat. The first night we had sea bass. We had eated sea bass the day before at Rick Stein's Seafood restaurant in Padstow. This was every bit as good! So good, we had dinner there the second night too. Again excellent food, very hot (so unusual these days!) and superb quality. You must also have the cream tea! The scones are so light and fluffy they won't spoil your dinner. But the most outstanding aspect of this hotel is the staff. They really are a credit to themselves and the hotel. Nothing is too much trouble. You want extra biscotti with your coffee - no problem. We were so spoilt! They were all genuinely friendly, interested in us and making sure we had a great time in Cornwall. I do have one regret - I wish we had booked for longer. Not a mistake I'll be making next year!
