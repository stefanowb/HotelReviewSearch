I was a lone traveller so I stayed in room 100 - it is a smaller room right next to the lobby in the main Inn. It was perfect. Small but perfect for me, very clean (and housekeeping came every day to leave it spotless again), and though I was told it didnt have an ocean view, there is!! A partial one but nonetheless! The morning breakfast on the porch was the best way to start my days - good selection of fresh fruit and breads, yogurt, coffee and juice, and the view right on the ocean, just perfect! In the late afternoon before heading out for dinner, it was great to be able to have a drink on one of the patio chairs on the beautiful manicured lawn looking at the ocean. The location of the place could not be better...A walk to so many restaurants, shops, even Perkins Cove, and the beach is literally three minutes away. I didnt use the pool much (just once when the beach got extremely windy) but it was clean. I have been going to Ogunquit for over 30 years but this was first time staying directly on the coean...well, needless to say, I can never do it any other way from now on!! The only tiny little thing, and this is restricted to my specific room (100) is that in the morning you do hear the \"clings\" from the plates and cutlery form the staff setting the breakfast, but honestly, it wasnt that loud, and I had brought some ear plugs so it was an easy fix ;) I would definitely recommend this place!", "title": "Heaven!", "user": "shmoukins", "date": "September 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140012203}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had 4 beautiful days in this comfortable and welcoming B&B.

We stayed at a chain motel in York the night before and just were not ready to go home so we looked around Ogunquit. We were treated with utmost respect although we had just walked in to inquire about rooms and pricing. We selected a room that was less expensive - no ocean view and not in the main building. We still loved it! It was the most spacious and best outfitted 'motel-style' room I've ever stayed in. They have a parking lot with your own assigned space so there's no bumping you out of your spot. You can walk to restaurants, bars, and the beach. The only drawback is minor in that although the ocean is right in front of the inn it's a bit of a walk to actually get to the beach. On the plus side both the calmer river as well as the ocean are right there. The main house looks and feels like a lovely b&b with antiques in the living room and coffee and tea available all day.

It was simple and perfect for my little get away. My room had a little kitchen- which I only used the fridge of but having it deeply induced my desire to stay longer. Being off season but on a weekend- it was not very private- but I didn't need private. The boardwalk to the beach was directly below my room and we nodded and smiled and shared a few hellos with those walking below the deck. I could see the sunrise from my bed- I turned around and put my head where my feet were suppose to be and watched the sunrise over the ocean. The walls were paper thin - and me being a light sleeper- well If it was summer time - you might wanna bring along some ear plugs as we could hear the man snoring in the room next to us (or was it two rooms over). I'm guessing he was pretty loud though.. we were laughing a lot (my friend and I sharing some stories from our childhood) so no complaints on his snoring from me-laugh. Anyway, the bathroom was on the small side but the bath soaps were wonderful. I wish we had booked 2 nights instead of 1. It's perfect for walking into town. My room was perfect for the view. Wish again I had more time and a book with me. It was super close to the beach. Everything was just as I had hoped it would be. Breakfast was bagels, juice, coffee some fruit. Your continental- simple but enough. I think during peak season if you are looking for something \"romantic\" and a bit removed- this might be to close to the action of a spot for you but if you are with your kids, a friend or family member this was a perfect location.

Second thing right is free wifi- too many places charge for an amenity that is essentially costless to the proprietor.

New York Times, complementary, means you can read the paper over breakfast on the outdoor porch which, like the lawn, overlooks both river and beach. We think the rooms are best in the inn building but there are several adjacent motel buildings which the owners have acquired over time and which are adequate.
