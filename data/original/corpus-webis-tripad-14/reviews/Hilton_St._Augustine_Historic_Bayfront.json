The staff was professional and more than willing to answer any questions we had. Check-in was quick and easy with everything all in order when we arrived. Everyone always had a smile and a friendly hello. When we return to St. Augustine we will certainly stay at the Hilton again. Our room was immaculate. It had a coffee pot with wonderful coffee. There was also a refrigerator. Our room had a Jacuzzi tub in it and although we never had a chance to use it, it certainly looked wonderful. We had a small balcony off our room that had a quaint view of one of the side streets and a side view of the harbor. The room was quiet and I slept like a baby. The beds and pillows were so comfortable. Our stay included breakfast each morning and what a treat. The staff was wonderful and the food marvelous - they had a great selection of fresh berries, yogurt, Danish, cereal etc. that you could help yourself too. They also offered an area where you could get eggs or omelets made to order, as well as pancakes or French toast (I did not eat at either one of these so I not sure if it was pancakes, French toast or both offered). The food was fresh and yummy. The only downside to our stay was that we did have to pay for parking.
