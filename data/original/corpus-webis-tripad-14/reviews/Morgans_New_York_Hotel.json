Tea and coffee was available all day and the view from the penthouse (where breakfast is served) is fantastic. We were disturbed one night due to people being loud in another room. We informed the staff and this was resolved immediately, we also received a bottle of wine from Morgan's to apologise which was a lovely gesture thank you. The location is fantastic, very central.

I was worried when I booked this hotel that it would be out of the way but having stayed on Times square on a previous visit it was worth the 15min walk to experience the lower half of the city. On arrival you are met with a small area housing the reception and staff. I had a problem with the room I had booked but the wonderful staff-Todd and I'm sorry I can't remember the lady's name were brilliant in moving us to another room which meant we didn't need to move hotels. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have stayed in I have never slept straight away but here we did helped by the Egyptian cotton bed linen. The Superior Queen room was a perfect size. I really don't understand what some people expect when they complain about the breakfast. NEWS PEOPLE!! NYC doesn't normally provide this so don't book this hotel then complain that it isn't a full English. It states quite clearly that it is bagles/toast/yoghurt/juice/pastries. If you don't want this go somewhere else we loved early mornings having breakfast looking at the Empire State building-plus free wi-fi for booking seats and printing boarding cards.The only reason this hasn't had 5 stars is down to renovations going on and the tired looking carpet in the halls. Congrats to all the staff who made our stay so special nothing was too much trouble and a BIG THANKS TO TODD for making my husbands birthday such a memorable one.
