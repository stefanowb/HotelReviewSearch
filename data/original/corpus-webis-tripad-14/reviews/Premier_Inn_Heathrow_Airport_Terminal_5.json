These machines are excellent confirming your room, taking payment offering add-ons such as breakfast and Wifi at very good rates. Once you make payment it prints your VAT receipt and provides your room key, this is far more efficient than waiting in line at the reception desk.

I had one of the best night sleep in any hotel at LHR and check out was very easy the next morning just handing your key and room number over to another friendly member of staff on the way out. In conclusion if you are looking for 5 star luxury this is not the place for you, but if you are looking for clean, functional, reasonably priced accommodation with friendly staff close to T5 you cant go wrong. By the way if you want to get to the hotel / terminal for free take the local bus from outside the hotel / terminal 423 which stops at the hotel and is free of charge in apposed to the Hotel hopper which is about \u00a34.50 each way.
