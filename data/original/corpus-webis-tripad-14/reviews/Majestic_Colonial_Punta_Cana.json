You can also try one of the restaurants although we had a terrible experience at La Hispaniola restaurant: the service was horrible! They didn't take our orders til about 25 minutes after we sat and the food didn't come til about 40 mins after we ordered (and only 5 of us were at my table, everyone else was eating somewhere else or had already eaten).

Service at the door of the buffet can also be a bit unrefined during lunch hour. Since during those hours (12 noon- 3pm) people are either on the beach on in the pool, when they want to go to lunch they are wet. The people at the door do not tolerate that and will make you go back to your rooms and change (try to get a room not ending in a number after 25 if you want to be close to the buffet). Service everywhere else was pretty ordinary. Nothing to brag about. HOWEVER! There are some men by the beach who claim to take you in a boat ride to see dolphins, to a natural pool, and scuba diving. DO NOT DO IT. The dolphins we saw were part of another resort and were putting on a show about 80 feet away for people who paid for it. Standing so far trying to see was embarrassing! The natural pool was nice, it was at the beach and about 4 feet deep away from the shore so it was nice. NOT worth the 2 HOUR trip on a very small boat though. And about the scuba diving, YEAH right. If you want to do real scuba diving speak to someone who comes to the pool everyday to give scuba lessons. They had a bucket full of goggles and used mouth pieces covered in sand and salt water. It was gross.THE WORST PART OF ALL was when we ran out of gas about 40 minutes away from the resort. The man had to swim to shore to buy gasoline. We were very upset!!! There were 25 of us in two boats and some of the people on one boat were paying for some people on the other boat and vice versa. The two men driving the boats pretended like no one paid so we ended up paying double for the boat ride from hell!! DON'T DO IT! Stick to ALL resort activities and make SURE they WORK for the resort!

The best Trip Advisor tip I got was to bring cheap beach towels from home - my husband went down most mornings between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m., would put our beach towels on either a pool chair or beach chair - after breakfast we would return to the chairs which were always undisturbed.

I was a little concerned because the recent reviews weren't very favorable but once again the Majestic didn't let us down. Upon check in we asked for a room upgrade since we were returning customers and got a great pool side room on the first floor by the beach with a jacuzzi and 2 lounge chairs and a cafe set. Yes there is construction of their new hotel and we requested to be far away as they start early in the morning. We were greeted by Benito a member of the guest services staff. He escorted us to our room to make sure it was to our liking. At that time we told him what dinner reservations we wanted for the Japanese Steak house and the Gourmet restaurant. Within 15 minutes he called us and gave us our reservations and that he would leave them under our door. We enjoyed our complimentary Majestic breakfast outside on our patio which included lots of fresh fruit and freshly made breakfast rolls and muffins along with coffee, champagne and orange juice! Several afternoons we received a plate of fruit and a bottle of wine or sushi with wine. On valentine's day I got a rose and my husband a red t-shirt and a bottle of sparkling rose. The hotel is still spotless both inside and out. Yes at one time the ladies room was out of soap but that can happen anywhere. They are always keeping up with maintainence and it shows. The ancilliary staff don't go out of their way to say hello but if you habla en espanol un pequito they are quite surprised and pleased. The staff that come in contact with the guests always greet you and are very pleasant. Now if you you never want your glass empty speak to Ishmael or Yaser at the pool bar. They were making me stoli mojitos with equal instead of sugar....now that's service! The pool was spotless and clear. Plenty of beach chairs poolside and by the beach. Yes if you want a certain chair and a table you need to \"reserve\" it but we never had any trouble. I hope that the beach doesn't become to crowded after the addition of the new hotel. The sand is beautiful and the ocean color magnificant. I think they may have even dredged the beach because we both remember some rocks last year where the waves break but never encountered them. The other restaurants that don't require reservations are fine. We ate a lot of lobster, shrimp and beef. I think the lunch is better in the main hotel as opposed to by the beach. There is a bigger selection and more healthy items plus the thin crust pizza is delicious. My husband played golf twice and I used the Spa. The massage was better last year but maybe it was the masseuse.

Once in the room, we found the air conditioning not working, and were eventually moved to another room, (pool view). It was difficult to communicate with some of the employee's when we tried to tell them about the problem, but eventually, we found a manager who spoke english very well and he helped us out and then some. I wish I knew his name because he was just excellent to deal with. The rooms themselves were gorgeous and spacious. The shower is amazing. The only issue I think some would have, is the privacy of the toilet. There is no privacy, LOL. Be comfortable with who you are with!!! Although not yet completed, the resort itself was stunning. Beautifull pool running straight through the resort, with plenty of bars to get a drink. I was reading another review and they said that they were charged for champaigne. We drank a ton of it, including the bottle in the room and were never charged. We ordered whatever we wanted and got no problems at all. The staff was excellent. Some didn't speak english at all, however, most made the attempt to understand and were very very impressed by their hospitality. Our room was cleaned everyday, and lots of towels and water were there when we returned from the beach. A $2 tip each day helped I think. Although all inclusive, we made sure we tipped our waiters/waitresses and bartenders. This not only helped us get better service, but these people work their butts off to make your stay is a memorable one and dont get paid very much. They will always say hello, and always have a smile on their faces, treat them well. Entertainment at night was fun. Go see Michael Jackson if you can.

From the moment we arrived at the resort and stepped off our bus we were greeted by staff passing out cool face clothes and majestic drinks and cookies... I soon realized this was only a small glimpse into the amazing treatment I would be receiving for the next 7 days of my stay! Whether it was at the bar by the pool or at one of the many restaurants, the staff at Majestic were continually warm and friendly and providing great service at all hours of the day. I was fully assured that my family picked the right resort when mid week I had a craving for a very American food (grilled cheese sandwiches), and to my disbelief they actually had them at the lunch buffet cooked right in front of me so it was nice and hot! With five different restaurants serving wide assortments of food, you never have to worry about going hungry. If my experience wasn't already great enough it was certainly heightened by the wonderful, fully energetic team of animators who provide all sorts of activities from 10 in the morning till after 10 at night; getting you involved and ensuring that you are entertained.. They even get you doing things you would never fathom doing back at home (like entering into a bikini contest) and make you feel great the whole time! Although they meet thousands of people and probably wouldn't remember me if I am privileged enough to return, I will never forget those animators.. I learned to dance a little bit better at the late night disco thanks to my great animator friend Jesus, I got my butt kicked during stretching and pool aerobics (just a few of the MANY activities they provided throughout the day) by Francisco, and was wildly entertained on the beach volleyball court by Walter (aka. Mosquito, the humerus little firecracker).. they are amazing people!! This review doesn't even begin to explain every terrific aspect of my experience at the Majestic Colonial, cause if it did it would be far to long for anyone to read.. But I would highly recommend this resort to anyone as it is fully looked after by gardeners, maids, security and grounds keepers working all hours of the day to make it look outstanding, it has beaches you can only dream of, has staff that provides you with unimaginable service, going above and beyond what they're paid to do, and provides both relaxation and entertainment so any type of person is satisfied with their stay.

But, this place was definitely not built with kids in mind. Yes, it accommodates children, but unlike the Iberostar chains (for example), it was built with honeymooners in mind. When they started building this resort they must have meant for it to be couples only, but then decided that they would lose out big time if they didn\u2019t make it a family resort (IMO). The children\u2019s\u2019 play area (the castle and kids club) is way way out of the way. It is far from the beach and pool (I guess so as not to disturb the adult guests). In the other 4 star resorts that I\u2019ve been to, the children\u2019s\u2019 playground (and kiddie pool) was in the same area as the adult pool and close to the beach.

We were on the opposite side of the pool but enjoyed it, as it was more quiet. The room services were very good. I have learned from this experience that bringing gifts for the dominican children does not always work out. The maids prefer tips. The food and service are great at the buffet, you have a big variety of foods which changes now and then. We have tried all of the Restaurants, our favorite was Japanese, second the Chinese as we love sushi which they had plenty. Following the sushi you can order a la carte. The worst restaurant was the Caribean. I should also mentioned that they need a lot more experience in cooking the lobster at the Steak and Lobter restaurant. We found that cooking the lobster on the grill was always overcooked and burned. We have been to many different places and Republic Dominican and found that their drinks are very much the same with the rum. Rum this, rum that. One drink we found which was great is their caesars they have discovered clamato juice. Yes! When it comes to tours, watch out they are getting more expensive and less for your money. We took the Aquamarina Tour, swimming with the sharks and stinray was o.k. but the lunch was dry slices of bread and you had to make your own with slices of ham and cheese. We took one tour we thought was worth the price and that is the helicopter tour. Expensive but cheap if you figure how much it would cost you if you would do it at home. We took the 30 minute tour taking us all along the coast and inland. We could see most of the different tours on the coast and all the many different resorts. It was the most beautiful experience I have ever had. They have nightly entertainment, they need better performance but one of the shows was Michael Jackson, that one was the greatest. They need more games and entertainement for the people to participate. They should give prizes or gifts if they want people to be part.

We went here to relax, get a tan, drink and eat well, all of which we did to our satisfaction. Staff was friendly, our room was upscale and comfortable, beach was beautiful, food was abundant and always available, mixed drinks were decent brands and readily available, and the grounds and pool were beautiful. They provided beach towels, there were plenty of beach chairs and the beach was clean. People would bring you drinks on the beach or you could just go up to the bar that was right there. Included in the price was use of snorkel gear, wake boards, windsurfing and sailboats. To be balanced, the food was fine with plenty of variety from steak to lobster to everything in between, but I wouldn't call it 5-star - and didn't expect it to be because IT'S AN ALL INCLUSIVE! We read that the South side of the property overlooking the construction site got noisy during the day (confirmed) and therefore we paid extra to stay in a ground floor unit with an ocean view. We left daily $2 tips for the cleaning staff and similar tips for the food and bar servers, which they seemed to appreciate.

The options are endless at the buffets and to be able to have gourmet style lobster or steak everynight at the a la carte made my trip that much better. The set up for Christmas eve was out of this World, I don't think I have seen so much beautiful food in one place at one time. The entertainment staff were super friendly and so energitic both at the pool and the beach that just listening to them get everyone involved you want to join on the fun to. They smile the whole time and it's for real not for show and they sing an dance and become your best friend right from day 1, the only reason I'm writing this review is really beacause of them. The live shows at night were better then most musicals I've seen and it's all included.

I was alone, with my parents on vacation, i am 17 years of age, and i thought that it would not be that interesting. However, because of the animation at this place, i had the time of my life. The animators are always willing to entertain you and make your stay extremely enjoyable. They interact with people of all ages; from children to the elderly! A special thanks to Francisco, who is honestly out of this world AWESOME, and always makes the shows and every day fun! Also, Sandy is extremely fun! He is so funny and always talks on the microphone to entertain, and it works for everyone, no matter how old you are! Jesus is another FANTASTIC animator! He makes the dancing lessons so much funn! He is absolutely hilarious! What a blast to be around! Last but not least, TYSON! WOW.... those aerobic sessions! He makes it so intense but so fun at the same time! Absolutely incredible! These previous names are only a few of the awesome animators! THANK YOU TO ALL THE ANIMATION TEAM! YOU GUYS ALL ROCK! Each and every one of them!

We had 2250, 1st floor at the very end of building 2. Our view was poolside, partial ocean. The patio included a tub (which was only used once). The location of this room is not so private. Because the room was on the end of the building, there was a walkway that many people used to go from the beach/pool to building 2. That would be my only complaint with the patio...not a big deal, but not very secluded and private if you are looking for that. Maybe ask for a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor? The room did have a musty smell, but I think it was due to the ocean being nearby and the humidity. The room was clean, however it could use a little polishing. The mirror was dirty and the ceiling/walls appeared as though they could use a good scrubbing. Still not really a big deal. The minifridge is tiny. There is enough room in it for a few bottled beers, bottled water and sodas and that's about it. The in-room safe came in very handy, as we kept all of our valuables and money in there and didn't worry about a thing while we were out during the day. Housekeeping seemed to come clean the room at a later time in the day (usually around 4pm). If it were up to me, I would have preferred to have the room cleaned earlier. As sometimes we would spend a little time in our room in the middle of the day and needed clean towels. The bathroom issue that many people have with the resort was not an issue for us. We didn't mind it at all. I guess if you are sharing a room with someone you don't know very well this might be a problem. The bathroom area is not completely private. The bed was not great.

The breakfast in the main buffet was the best meal, in my opinion. I always made it to breakfast everyday! We tried every restaurant except for the Japanese-Hibatchi table. The Japanese restaurant is open without reservations, where they have a select menu and a sushi buffet bar. But in order to eat at the Hibatchi table you have to make a reservation. There are only 3 of these tables with 10 seats each. They have 3 seatings a night (6:30, 8:00 and 9:30pm). They fill up quick. I would suggest making a reservation the day you get there, as they are usually booked solid during the first 3-4 days of your stay. The other restaurant that requires a reservation is the French restaurant, Le Gourmet. It turned out to be my favorite. The beef tenderloin there was very good. The main buffet serves a decent breakfast, but the rest of the meals served there leave you with much to desire. The mexican restaurant, El Taino was not very good. The seafood restaurant, Tres Carabelas, was OK...the dinner menus at all the restaurants are very select..so there's not a lot to choose from.
