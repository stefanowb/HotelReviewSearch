I've stayed at a number of agriturismi in Italy over the years, and this one is one of the two best (along with Il Frantoio in Puglia) from that group. The farm is huge; 300 hectares (>1 square mile), tended by Sebastiano, his son Matteo, and two sheep-herders. It was probably the quietest place we've been to in years -- the only sounds you hear are the bells on the sheep, the crickets, and the other guests.", "title": "Fantastic stay at a real working farm", "user": "MikeBOS", "date": "June 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 163415570}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The accommodations were very good; nice beds, up-to-date, clean, and comfortable.
