It was up three flights of stairs, which was great because the exercise allowed us to eat a bit more! The room was fantastic, king bed, lots of space open air to a view and the breeze. For the last half we stayed in 5c a cabana right on the beach. Walk out the front door to your beach spot. The beachfront cabana can be noisy at night because people pass by having fun.
