Memories include --- swim-up bar at the infinity pool (awesome frozen drinks and ice-cold coronas ... plus, the prices aren't too bad either!), water activities (you have to take the shark boat tour!), music coming from the steel drums in the lobby, short walk to the market (actually, right across the street!), conversations and a few too many drinks at Rum Runners (really cool bar in the market ... MUST GO!), breakfast at Cafe Breeze (you have to get the banana walnut pancakes), pizza at Neptunes (place was jamming ... get there early!), blackjack at the casino (i only wish that they had a swim-up table in the pool), and the nightly Bahama drum dance along the beach (I forgot the name of this, but it was a lot of fun to watch.)", "title": "So much to do ... so little time!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Getting0ut0fDC", "date": "May 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 110718232}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "My husband and I stayed at Our Lucaya for 2 nights with 2 other couples for a quick getaway.

We had a great time, enjoyed fantastic weather and loved the soft, white sand beaches. Unfortunately, the Bahamas, and especially Grand Bahama, is undergoing a major economic downturn which takes a toll on what is offered to vacationers. The economic situation is a result of less people coming to the island and so unemployment is high and a large number of restaurants, stores and even hotels are closed. While the island is not in its prime so to speak I would still recommend going if you are looking for a truly relaxing time. The fact that there are so few people works out well for those who hate crowds or shiver at the thought of having to wake up early to get a place to sit by the pool. We greatly enjoyed the quiet atmosphere and overall beauty offered by the Caribbean. The situation in general left us less annoyed at the small number of places to eat or closed hotel facilities for example, and more feeling sorry for the people who live there and have to deal with the unpleasant circumstances. As a bottom line, if your expectations are not too high and you can get used to the laid back, island attitude about it all, Grand Bahama is still a great destination.", "title": "Far from perfection but still had a great time", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "LoveTravels", "date": "June 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 112108413}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel: Radisson Our Lucaya was not all that we had hoped it would be. The service and attitude of hotel employees varied, from the unorganized at the front desk to more personal and sweet at restaurants, bars, towel shack and so on. Only one pool is open (and it is not the one with the Sugar Mill and cascading water), and most restaurants are closed, leaving the open ones to rotate opening days/times among. We stayed for 7 days and during that time only the weekends felt somewhat fuller, while during the week perhaps 5% of the rooms were filled. The food at the hotel (and at restaurants outside the Radisson) is also nothing to get too excited about. It is ok but certainly not a paradise for foodies. Diners with moderate expectations will also find that the food is unimaginative and simply blah, with a gem once in a while (try the Key Lime pie at Led Med). The hotel could also use a facelift as the rooms are clean but somewhat outdated. The grounds are nice but suffer from the lack of desperately needed money, cash that would allow for some extra sprucing up. The Lucaya Marketplace area where the Radisson sits is actually one of the best places to be. In the eastern part of the island you will find tiny vacation rentals that are truly secluded (as we found the one day we rented a car to explore). While the beaches there are nicer than the one outside the Radisson, there is nothing in terms of entertainment, decent dining options etc. If you really want something exceptionally low key, it would probably be a good place to check out for a few days. If you want some entertainment though and less seclusion, check into the Radisson.", "title": "Never Stay Here", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "loismorganNewcomb_Tn", "date": "June 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 111910688}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Excursions/Things to do: We really had a great time on the UNEXSO dolphin experience and on Pat and Diane\u2019s Desert Island/Snorkeling Adventure (both highly recommended). Also if you can rent a car definitely go to the eastern part of the island. The deserted, calm-water beaches are stunning. Freeport, a short cab ride away from Lucaya Beach, also does not offer much. We went to the International Bazaar only to be really disappointed by the emptiness and mostly closed shops. On a different night we had the opportunity to take in Freeport again though when the 1st Annual Rush for Peace junkanoo parade took place. Junkanoo is a parade with costumes and music that takes places in the Bahamas (and a few other Caribbean islands) around Christmas time.
