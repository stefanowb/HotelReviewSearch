While the food was not truly gourmet, it was all of decent quality, with some dishes being really quite memorable. Try the cheese plate or the butternut squash soup. Both really nicely presented and flavourful. The S' mores for dessert were also well done. My one complaint with the restaurant, especially at breakfast, was the length of time it took to get a cappucino. I had to wait ages, and it was explained to us that there was only one cappucino machine, and that there could be quite a delay. On top of that, generally, the cappucinos were often mediocre, and small. However, when you need a cappucino, what are you going to do??? I ordered two, and hoped for the best.

For us, a two-bedroom is a must. The two-bedroom has a full kitchen with a big family-sized refrigerator, full-size range, etc. The others had a standard hotel room size refrigerator and 2 burner stovetop, which made a difference between eating out almost every meal except breakfast for the smaller rooms and going to Vons and then cooking most meals in the two-bedroom. Not only is that helpful budget-wise, it also reduces our stress to keep everyone acting perfect on our vacation. Kids can watch a video while waiting for dinner, and mom can watch them and drink some wine...

While I appreciate the views that some of the upper floor units have had, we much prefer the first floor. There are only a handful of units on the first floor, so I don't know how hard it is to get, but we've been lucky so far. (Apparently they have a computer that automatically assigns you a unit, but you can still ask for a specific location and the staff can change it for you.) Because there are so few units there, it is quiet. You miss out on a lot of the standard hotel noise. Plus, because it is on the same level as the lobby, you get much higher ceilings than the other units. Let's be honest, the Westin units are not huge, and the high ceilings go a long way toward feeling spacious.
