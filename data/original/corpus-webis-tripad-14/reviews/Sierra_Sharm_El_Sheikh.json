Rooms were very clean and all staff were lovely, very frienly, especially Mohammed El Fayez Lotfy in the restaurant. The food could be quite repetetive and we really missed bacon and sausages! Unfortunately while we were staying there,the kids club was off and the only nightime entertainmet was the same 2 women singing the same songs every single night. The pool bar had a belly dancer twice and African dancers once. Our main gripe was with our Odyssey rep who did not inform us that there was a kids room with playstation (we found out about this the day before we were due to leave). Also there is a waterpark just outside of Old Sharm which we only found out about 2 days before departure. Due to the lack of entertainment, our 2 boys aged 15 and 11 were very bored. IF YOU GO TO THIS HOTEL DO NOT BOOK THROUGH ODYSSEY!!We only seen our rep a the welcome meeting and as we were leaving and seh did not even come over to speak then. Our eldest son turned 16 while away and a big fuss was made of him at dinner that night with all the waiters singing and banging pots and a (very unusual) birthday cake brought out to him! All in all it is a nice place to stay, just don't expect an awful lot of entertainment!", "title": "Great Hotel shame abot the Rep", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Foxcroft-Family", "date": "March 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4700406}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "Following a diverted flight to Hurghada and a nightmare in the arrivals lounge at Sharm airport we were glad to get to the Sierra in one piece before 9 pm.", "title": "One week is enough", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Daftlad1664", "date": "March 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4690153}], "location": {"country": "Egypt", "region": "Red Sea and Sinai", "continent": "Africa"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 87, "average": 206, "very good": 572, "terrible": 53, "excellent": 1058}, "aka": "Sierra Sharm El Sheikh Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.157894736842, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Just a short drive from Sharm El Sheikh international airport and Na'ama Bay, the Sierra Sharm El Sheikh hotel is the perfect destination for those who want to explore the Red Sea and beyond or alternatively kick back and relax.
