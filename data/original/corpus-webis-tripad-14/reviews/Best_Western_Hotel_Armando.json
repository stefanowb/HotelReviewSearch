When we arrived at the hotel we were disappointed to see a building site next door, moreover we could hear grinding of stone and building work loudly. After opening our window we also discovered our room was directly opposite this, so I subsequently went downstairs to the reception to see if they could move us to another room away from the noise. To my astonishment the man at the desk denied there was any building noise going on at that time - this whilst speaking to him all I could hear was loud drilling and grinding. As it transpired we were not in the hotel room much during the day time but the building work started promptly at 8am to around 5pm during our stay. It would have been nice to have been pre-warned about the building works prior to our stay or even an apology for the inconvenience caused.", "title": "Modern hotel,central location,but a couple of negatives...", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jzeee", "date": "May 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 106510813}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room was very modern and clean and appeared to have nice fittings. However, when we went to brush our teeth the water from the basin leaked everywhere all over the bathroom floor. On closer inspection the pipes were not even connected. The plug on the bath which was a modern style was broken and unable to be used. Unfortunately some of the nice modern fittings hadn\u2019t been fitted properly which was a shame! I mentioned these problems to the same man at the desk, he said they would be fixed, but nothing was done. With it not being fixed for that day, we mentioned it again to the young girl at the desk before breakfast and by the time we returned to the hotel the basin was repaired.

We were not disappointed. The hotel was spotlessly clean, in a quiet but still very central location in the Historic District, and a 5 minute walk from the Arena. We loved the fact that we were so close to the major attractions but also that we could leave them behind and after 5 minutes get back to our quiet neighbourhood and leave the noisy and busy central streets behind. Our room was so clean, and the bed was really comfortable. Breakfast each day was just what you need - cereals, various breads and croissants, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cold cuts, cakes and pastries, juices, teas and coffee. And eggs you could boil as well. You don't need to worry about whether you can start your day with enough fuel in your tank! We have to mention Antonello, who was always there to help and could not have provided better service. His recommendation of an historic restaurant for dinner on our last evening enabled us to have an experience that will remain wth us for many years to come.
