We looked at five hotels in Sapa before deciding on the Chau Long, even though it is 3X the price of the other hotels we looked at (and most other hotels in general). If you are a heavy sleeper, most other hotels will be fine. But there is a lot of construction going on in Sapa and most hotels have thin walls. We stayed at the Chau Long because after a rough night's sleep on the train, we really wanted a comfortable, quiet room. The breakfast was not very good, they seemed to try to offer too many things. I opened a bowl of dates (I think) and let out several dozen fruit flies and our omelette was undercooked a little.
