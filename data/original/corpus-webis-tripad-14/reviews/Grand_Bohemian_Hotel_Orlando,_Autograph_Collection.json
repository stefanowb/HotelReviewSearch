I guess I will begin by saying that we were really looking forward to staying at the Grand Bohemian. Being from Florida, and visiting Orlando many times, I have heard such great things about this hotel. Being a frequent vistor of trip advisor, I was aware of the parking, internet charges...but not the nickel and diming for everything. First off, couldnt find street parking, so we had to fork over $21.25 a day for parking. How ridiculous, it should be FREE when staying at the hotel. It costs $11 a day to have internet access, all the food in the room is ridiculously overpirced. We are a younger couple (late 20's), and are not picky at all. We appreciate the little things and like to have a good stay when forking over some heavy money for a hotel room. Upon arriving for check in, we given are keys and not told about the location of the pool, spa services, gym, etc. No mention of anything- heres your key, have a nice stay. We get to our room, two queen beds. Of course we booked a king. Call down to the front desk and they tell us there are no kings left. Great start, no mention of this when checking in, so you can imagine my frustration already. They come up with a plan and tell us there is one king available, but it is handicap. I give them the ok just as long as we are switched the next day. Enough with my story, let me tell you about the hotel. The hotel is very nice and the rooms are quite honestly, nothing spectacular. Nothing better than, say a Embassy Suites. However, the bar and pool are fantastic. I would describe the hotel as a gothic, artsy setting.
