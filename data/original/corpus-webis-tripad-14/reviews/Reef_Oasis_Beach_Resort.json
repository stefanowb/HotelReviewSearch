The buffet was excellent with grills outside cooking fresh meat etc you couldn\u2019t fault any meal and could always find something to eat even for fussy people.

Shops and restaurants in there such as Virgin, Adidas, Nike, Claires, Mothercare, Pizza Hut,McDonalds, KFC, Starbucks, Costa Coffee. It was fantastic walking along the main road and seeing the camels being ridden around just like cycles in our country. We went on a submarine trip which we booked through the company in the hotel and it was well worth the money.
