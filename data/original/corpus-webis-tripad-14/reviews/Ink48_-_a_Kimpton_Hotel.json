The bathroom was very large with 2 sinks, a separate shower and very large tub and a little nook with the toilet. The shower was very large with a rainforest shower-head but the star of the bathrrom was one of the largest tubs I've ever seen. Usually, I limit myself to showers but the tub was pretty inviting and I tried it out--it was great; had to force myself to get out to get to a show. The highlight of the suite, though was the incredible view. There are floor to ceiling windows along the entire length of the suite (except for a closet that is opposite the bathroom) and there were incredible views of the river. The hotel looked down on the Manhattan cruise terminal and the USS Intrepid (aircraft carrier museum).
