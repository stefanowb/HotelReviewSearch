We asked them to take this off as we felt it was way above average for the distance so we'd pay the driver directly.

Still, they dint have the two 3-bedroom thingy ready so they were kind enough to give us three 2-bedroom, though the rooms were not cleaned (because they had no info about the booking). But they sent people immediately to clean the rooms once we reported. The food options are outright costly (atleast 3-4 times than any average hotel) and the food was not tasty at all.
