Everything about the day was absolutely perfect. Eamonn who organised everything for the day was wonderful, the wedding breakfast was superb - the meal was fabulous and the waiting on staff were brilliant; the bedroom elegant, the wedding reception room beautiful (I was glad of the air conditioning as it turned out to be a very warm day!).On Sunday morning the breakfast was delicious, ok a little pricey, but well worth it! My son and daughter-in-law used the hotel's flower arranger, dj and MC and again, all were simply superb. I hope I haven't forgotten anyone!

I had booked the restaurant and it seemed they did a deal of \u00a324.50 for 3 courses, wine and coffee, this was all very nice and value for money considering the average price of a main course was \u00a320+!!! Crazy or what?! Starters averaged out about \u00a39.... Now for the bad bits.......We were put in room 101 - this is THE worst room in the hotel (I hope), situated on the ground floor right next to the toilets, you can hear the toilet doors banging and the flush. The hotel was practically empty so i dont know why we were put there. Anyway, one of the curtains was hanging off , and the bed had two great craters in it (mustve been one of those \"memory mattresses\"!!!)
