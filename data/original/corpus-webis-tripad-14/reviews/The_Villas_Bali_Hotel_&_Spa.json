Everything was just perfect from the moment we got off the plane, to the moment of leaving the country. I felt like a princess during our stay. It's hard to say which was the best part about the holiday. I loved having freshly cooked breakfast (cooked in our own kitchen) in the morning, just as much as having breakfast in the beautiful Prana Restaurant, overlooking the Prana courtyard, with its beautiful decor and colours. Having our own private pool was just fantastic, as it meant I could get up in the morning and jump right in, without having to worry about swimwear or googling eyes from other guests. We did a few trips to animal parks, which the hotel organised for us. It was truely a holiday in paradise, with not a single thing to worry about.

The place is nice and the rooms have a touch of an \"authentic\" bali theme, even though everything is reasonably modern. First 3 nights we stayed in Villa 1 which was lovely and had a huge pool and garden, and also one pleasant upstairs bedroom, but since it's right next to the street it was so noisy that we really needed to change to a different villa. Luckily one was available, so we went to Villa number 3, this was very quiet. It has two bedrooms adjacent to the main living area, and a third one which is separate and a little smaller, also the bathroom here is quite small. The positives were friendliness of staff (although communication can be a little slow), the two Spas (Prana and esp. Chill), the location is OK but the beach is best reached on a scooter or in a taxi. We did encounter some problems during our stay - the main one was that we had to convince the staff in several stages to do proper cleaning. Also, the pool water was not entirely clean (just OK for swimming) and this did not get fixed during our entire stay, even after several complaints. Internet is working but dropouts requiring re-log on are frequent. We saw rats in our kitchen on two occasions (night time only, and definitively not in the rooms or bathrooms), keeping in mind that these are outdoor kitchens, and the staff sent pest control the next day. Overall a nice stay but more reliable internet, better cleanliness and more straightforward communication could clearly improve the place, and these things should all be expected at this price in any hotel anywhere.", "title": "Great place for relaxation and privacy with luxury", "user": "suntai", "date": "July 12, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 70575253}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Good place for groups that want to be together, great for privacy.", "title": "Little Piece of Paradise", "user": "EllaMelbourne", "date": "July 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 70446344}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010", "text": "Has beautiful grounds and villas that are well maintained.", "title": "We stayed in a 3br villa and it was just...", "user": "Macwheels", "date": "July 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 70354276}], "location": {"country": "Indonesia", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Seminyak"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 24, "very good": 97, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 490}, "aka": "The Villas Bali Hotel Seminyak", "slim_ranking": 0.105263157895, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Our exclusive accommodations offer privacy and luxury with all the conveniences of a full service hotel.
