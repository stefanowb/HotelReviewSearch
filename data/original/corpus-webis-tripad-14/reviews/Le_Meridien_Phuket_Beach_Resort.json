The first room we were given was a garden superior room which I did not like, The room itself smelt really musty (yes I know I am in a tropical country ) but this was very strong as though the room had not been used for some time.

My only gripe with the facilities is I think the hotel may benefit from a lobby bar somewhere to go of a night instead of the club especially in low season when it is often raining of a night and you don't want to go to the pool bar (open sides). Apart from that this hotel is an excellent base near enough to patong but far enough away from the maddening crowd and its big plus own beach which is fabulous.
