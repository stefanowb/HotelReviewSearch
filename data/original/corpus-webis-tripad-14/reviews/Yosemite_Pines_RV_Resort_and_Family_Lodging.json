Helped me new to RVing to sort out places to stay while on the road. I stayed both of the same owner's park's in the Yosemite area. South of Yosemite at a park called High Sierra in Oakurst on my way up from LA and Yosemite Pines on my way out of the park going west to he Bay area. Both parks were clean and the staff friendly and helpful to someone new to this RVing thing - fun!!!

The cabin was brand new, clean and was fully equipped. Cupboards were full of plates, utensils, pots/pans etc, a nice surprise. The previous owners apparently had let the place run down. The new owners have put a lot of money in renovating and adding to the park. The Smiths (park managers) are very nice and accommodating people. They went out of their way to make our stay there enjoyable. We had previously stayed in a tent at pines campground (Stanislaus national forest campground) past 3 days and were soaked. This was dec 25th-27 of 2004 when the storms came. We were forced to change our plans of tenting it and had to retreat to a cabin. When they heard we had some wet equipment the smiths generously let us use an out of the way heated room to hang and dry our stuff. That saved us from having smelly mildewed equipment.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 24, 2004", "id": 2491062}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Bad experience", "text": "The park is going through some growing pains due to change of ownership but it is in the name of increasing facilities.
