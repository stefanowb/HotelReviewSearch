I had a free upgrade to the highest floor. The view you have is great to look over the city and the huge atrium of the hotel. I should have a King bed, but to my opinion it was a Queen. The lounge overlooking the atrium was great. Never in IC or Hilton such a big lounge. The breakfast and hors d\u00f3euvres are of a very good quality. The service is really five stars. Like to mention Paulina. Also Vanessa on the front and the doorman Nebosja are very friendly in their approach. The only thing what bothered me and other guests is the rent of one of their locations to a church, who sing loud on their Sunday morning. You can imagin the effect on the atrium. But I love to come back again to this star rated hotel.", "title": "Intercontinental Dusseldorf - it\u00b4s five stars", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sabai77Pijnacker", "date": "June 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 163339940}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Since IC Cologne closed I actually decided to stay in Duesseldorf despite my business being in Cologne.

Because of this and the reception area two levels down it can be a bit noisy but you still have the sensation of being in a private, exclusive area. The buffet style area has plenty of goodies for breakfast and you have the option of ordering a warm dish as well. Throughout the day you will find canap\u00e9s or cakes or other sweets around the buffet area and the usual beverages. In the evening a canap\u00e9 service goes way beyond the expected and there are warm samplings - buffet-style - of three different meals; vegetarian, meat and fish. The one drawback is that you cannot check in/out in said lounge.
