Wolf Dietrich is a beautiful hotel placed in a pedestrian area, just 10 min walking from the Altstadt.

The position of that room is perfect as you can reach the breakfast room as well as the SPA with few steps. The room was tidy and clean, and spacious enough. Furthermore the staff very kind and the service complete. The SPA includes swimming pool, sauna, steam bath, infrared lamp and relax room, perfect for some relax! the water in the pool sometimes was not extremely warm and often staff was not in the SPA area, anyway the overall opinion is good.

In terms of rooms we had room 55 which was at top of a windy staircase with one other room - it would be amazing if you were a couple of families who booked both rooms because at the bottom of the stairs is a big playroom and kitchen that it looks like you could lock off and give the kids a big rumpus room to themselves.
