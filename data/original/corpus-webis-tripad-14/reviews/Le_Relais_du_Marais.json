Comments about the staff in other reviews here helped me make my hotel decision, and they were all right on point. All of the staff was very positive and helpful, especially front deskpersons Hakim and Lena. Also, everyone speaks fluent English, making requests and questions very easy. All rooms have nice AC (controlled in-room), which is not a given in Paris. Another good reason to choose this hotel.
