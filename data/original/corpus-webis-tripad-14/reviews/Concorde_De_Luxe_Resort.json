It was still a standard room and was room 6005 and the improvement was huge.

The steak house you can not take children under 12 to which was a bit annoying, then when we did go they got the meals wrong and actually took the plate off of the table next to me and gave it to me as they'd gven hi my meal, ok so he hadnt eaten it yet but he was just about to and it hardly shows high class!!!

The minibar is stocked daily and has enough, if you wanted a bit extra in your minibar I'm sure the minibar man would oblige as he was a really lovely guy. The maid was fab and made our bedding into wonderful shapes on numerous ocassions as well as sprinkling the bed with lovely flowers. Bedding and towels changed daily if wanted. The bathroom was also lovely and clean - my only slight worry here was that the side of the bath was rather deep and I had to be quite careful climbing in and out to have a shower as it was a deep step for a short person like me. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom which is great. I was concerned about not taking my own hairdryer as I have thick hair which can take ages to dry but this little hairdryer was perfectly adequate and dried my hair in no time at all.

My partner always followed this request and then changed back into his shorts and sandals after dinner. Other gentlemen however, chose to ignore this request which was a shame.
