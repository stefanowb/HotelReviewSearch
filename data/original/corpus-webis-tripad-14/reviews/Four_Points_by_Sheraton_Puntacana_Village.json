However, upon arriving at the Four Points, I was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful decor, friendly and helpful staff and great location. The rooms are lovely - well appointed, clean and modern. The lobby is open and airy and though right by the airport, you don't hear the planes at all. Even our room had a decent view! Breakfast was delicious and the staff was more than helpful. We spent the day at the pool before our afternoon flight and it was a great day. With our flight being later in the afternoon, the hotel allowed us to do a late checkout so we just packed up in the afternoon and the shuttle picked us up and brought us back to the airport. If you have time, they provide regular shuttles to the beach and the Puntacana Village across the street is a lovely place for dinner and shopping. All in all, a lovely stay!
