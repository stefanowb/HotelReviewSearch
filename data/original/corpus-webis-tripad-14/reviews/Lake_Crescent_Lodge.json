There is a small patio with 2 chairs for lakeside and sunset views (not private though). The restaurant at the lodge had good food, but again, like other National Park lodges, it is quite pricey. The restaurant didn't open early enough for breakfast for our tastes (not until 730a). The front desk staff are friendly and helpful. We couldn't check in early so we took a hike to the Marymere Falls about a mile away - it was a nice hike with very pretty falls, and you can hit the trailhead from the lodge grounds.", "title": "What a view!", "user": "travelman1370", "date": "July 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 18185032, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The great view from our cabin.", "disliked": "\u2014 They don't hold luggage."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Lake Crescent Lodge for 3 nights in early September 2007.
