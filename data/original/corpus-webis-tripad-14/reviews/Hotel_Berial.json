The tram stop is just 2 minutes walk if that!! Breakfast was nice but get down early because it does go quickly if lots of people are staying well by 9.30am not much left!! Hotel reception are fantastic and very friendly and 99% of them speak English, room was cleaned every morning and fresh towels provided. Try and request one of the modern rooms as the older rooms have not yet been updated and look a bit dull but my room was fantastic for any solo travellers request the modern single room.", "title": "Fantastic 3 nights", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "steveuk22", "date": "June 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5333108}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a small, unpretentious Hotel offering virtually nothing in the way of facilities other than a Reception area and Breakfast Room, but is very centrally situated within easy walking distance of all the shops, the Aldstat and the Rhine.

Unfortunately, we would have loved to have stayed longer to enjoy the comfort and charm of this lovely hotel for a couple of more days, but we were on an overnight layover only. Their staff were all so friendly and helpful. Justine at the front desk was resourceful and spoke in English. Our room which cost us 65 euro for a double was a steal of a deal. The room was clean and organized. The bathroom was spacious and water pressure was powerful. We even had the use of the desktop computer in the business center for free to check emails and search the web. The lobby and breakfast room(s) were decorated nicely in modern decor. The breakfast buffet is above average which is included in the cost of the room. Large selection of fruits, cereal, and dairy. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone.
