More of a business hotel, strategic location with a night market at the hotel's footsteps, lots of eateries, a night bazaar a few feet away. The rooms are spacious with a really amazingly comfortable bed and pillows. The room I was in faces a mountain range so it was nice waking up to a good view.The bathroom comes with a bath tub and separate shower enclosure with a rain shower head. Tried the hotel's spa's signature treatment Chakra Ritual,which \"focuses on the benefits and healing gained through the art of \u201clife force energy\u201d via a modified crystal therapy\". Crystals are placed at key energy points while the masseuse continues to massage the head, neck and shoulders. The treatment is complete with a milk bath in a jacuzzi. I would recommend this treatment, however there are others to choose from too such as the normal Thai, swedish massage, pedicure, manicure among others. The staff are pleasant and helpful.

A minor criticism is that the two towels provided for the sumptuous bathroom are puny, in incongruous contrast to the plush large towels in the pool area. The hotel has New York prices for amenities such as the spa and restaurant facilities, which is ridiculous for Thailand. Having said this, the rooms are very comfortable and modern, with the aforesaid wonderful bathroom being a place to spend a lot of time if one were disposed to doing that.

The hotel is super clean, quiet and very safe feeling. An extra bonus is that you walk right out the door and you are at the best night market ever. Save your shopping for Chiang Mai; it beats Bangkok in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and explore the night market, get a massage and have a few Chang beers! Then when you are done with exploring you step back into the Le Meridien for some nice comforts that remind you of home, but with a Thai flair. Thanks Urusula for a fabulous stay.

Le Meridien is developing a funky new brand image worldwide (typified by the new one on Suriwong Road in Bangkok), but the designers of the Chiang Mai hotel have shown considerably more restraint. The large lobby is all cream and light brown marble with some stunning touches - what looked like a 'wall' of lengths of twirled copper separating the lobby from the coffee shop and vast black birdcage motifs on the wall not far from reception. Lifts have the usual Le Meridien jungle noises (very pleasant first thing in the morning) and open on to conventional chain hotel floor layouts. The bedrooms themselves have almost everything one would wish from a 5-star hotel, including an extremely comfortable large bed, crisp white linens, a rain shower and a bath that is more Japanese style than western - i.e. small and deep. But the glass wall enables you to watch television as you soak should you so desire. It was not all perfect, though. The day bed by the window is presumably meant to double as a couch, but is particularly uncomfortable as there is zero back support, even using the cushions. The lack of a DVD player to complement the medium-sized flat-screen TV seems a little penny-pinching, and I felt the temperature control of the air conditioning was a little wayward.
