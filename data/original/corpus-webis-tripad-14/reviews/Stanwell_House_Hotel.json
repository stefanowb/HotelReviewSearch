The hotel itself is very nice and the room was well presented, well decorated and very clean and looked the perfect choice, until night time. The room we had been put in was above the bar and restaurant so we had to endure noise from downstairs all evening. Obviously this upset our daughters sleep so we all ended up with a very bad night\u2019s sleep. I don\u2019t know whether the staff were expecting us to have had a bad night or not, but not one of them asked if we had slept well, not even on checking out.

The interior design had the feeling of an executive style estate house whose owner believed B&Q homewares to be the cutting edge of chic.The service was a bit hit and miss. Language barriers made ordering white wine in the bar a tricky proposition reminiscent of foreign holidays of yesteryear! Only the breakfast waitress seemed to have English as a first language.

Knowing the area and my friends tastes I was expecting grwat things and it didnt disappoint. The civil service was lovely, informal and friendly as it could be and not robotic at all. Luckily for us the weather held off for the photos and a lovely pimms reception. I feel we were squashed in a little into the ceremony room and the garden and that capacity isn't really at what the hotel claims. The food was lovely; though the fish cake lacked that real fish taste abd mayonnaise tho nice tasted like normal mayo not truffle. The two mains were duck and beef which were both lovely. Veggies were a little too al dente as if they were hurried to the table. Service was a little slow and muddled, not knowing where to put what meal and dishing out in a random order not by table meaning people were waiting. One lot of veggies came out half way thru the meal which I found bizarre. Puddings were lovely, good choice of tea, and the venue seenes very helpful with allowing a personaliseddtouch. Having two rooms plus the outside space was nice, though thwre needs to be air con in them, it waa roasting during dinner, let alone when people were dancing. Evening buffet was lovely, bar waa too expensive although i was impressed that the left over I wine from dinner was put out for people to help themselves.
