Otherwise, the room was nice, bathrooms very nice, nice products supplied, and other than the stained carpet, the room was clean.

Hawks Cay resort use to be a friendly relaxing resort that welcomed kids and made you feel that you were in paradise. Now, under the new ownership, all the new employess act as if your a bother and are not helpful but very snobby. The main hotel made you feel so at ease with it's tropical decor,caribbean music, friendly staff, and kids could be kids. Under the new management, it's all changed. The hotel is now decorated very cold- it reminds me of an airport with alot of chairs and a stand up bar with no chairs. That's the lobby! No more comfy chairs, sweet smells of the bakery that once was there, the kids shop is now gone and so is the library and play room. It's icy cold with very bad attitude everywhere you go. Don't plan on sleeping in in the morning, construction starts at 7 am sharp- really loud!!! It's very sad that such a great family place that had so much history with presidents has now been replaced by the worst resort I've ever been to.

Our idea of a relaxing vacation is when everyone can take the day at their own pace while finding fun things to do. Hawk's Cay definitely made that possible. The Indies Club was my kids' favorite destination and my kids usually hate those resort kid camps. All the counselors (Brett being their favorite) really went out of their way to make it fun for the 2 younger ones, while the 12 yr old enjoyed the basketball court and the phenomenal arcade/game room. We particularly appreciated when one night (after trying to go to Key West for dinner and had to turn back due to an accident which closed the highway) we arrived at the hotel bar at 10pm just after the kitchen at the restaurants had already closed looking for a bite and Scot, working at the bar went to the back and managed to pull together some tapas like plates which were quite tasty and satisfying. Though this was not the usual fare the bar served, he understood our needs at the moment and rather than give what would be the usual \"sorry the kichen is closed\" he turned our evening around. That is what I call great service. Between the well-appointed villas on lovely grounds (we had beautiful water views from our spacious verandas), the 3 beautiful pools (one which is for grown ups only if you'd prefer to escape from kids & relax peacefully by the pool) and every possible activity you can imagine offered right at the resort (spa, tennis, fishing, dolphins, sailing, jetskiing, snooba/scuba, etc) you'd never need to leave the resort during your whole stay.

The resort grounds and 5 pools were gorgeous! My favorite was the main hotel family pool. The Conch Villa we stayed in was nice and spacious but could have needed some updating. It did not have luxury accommodations as their website described, but the villas were functional and clean with a beautiful water view. I recommend the Island Fish Co. restaurant to eat at. It is located in Marathon, about 10 min. from the resort. The calamari appetizer was great there.

My family travels to the Keys twice a year and this was the first time at Hawks Cay and definately the last. Customer service has not been taught to their front desk staff. The food is horrific and there is not much to choose from. If you want to eat past 9:00pm forget it your making a drive to Marathon. The construction is still going strong. The hotel should not be open at all until they are completely finished, especially for the rate they charge per night. All I can say is make the extra drive and stay at the Westin or the Pier House in beautiful Key West. Oh by the way, the rooms do not have a tub for small children. This is clearly not a kid-friendly resort. Try bathing an 8 month old in the bathroom sink. I was so disappointed that I had to write this review.

We also had no linens upon entering our villa. The villa was nice and clean and had a great view. It did need a little upgrading though. While swimming at the pool located behind the Sunset Village Drive side, which was close to our unit, we were asked for hotel identification more than I care to mention. When we stay at a resort, it just doesn't occur to us to constantly remember the little card thing that you receive when you check in, especially when going to a pool right by our villa!
