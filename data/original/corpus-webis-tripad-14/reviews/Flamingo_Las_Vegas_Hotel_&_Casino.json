We have been staying at the Flamingo for about 15 years. They really cleaned it up in the last few years. We had a nice room overlooking the front of Ceasar's. I told them that I only wanted a room close to the elavator. Check-in was very nice because I am Platinum. The other line looked long. On Sunday 4/28 the place was packed. My only complaint was that the Valet parking was full when we arrived and had to park ourselves on the top floor of the garage and walk. I did notice the Airport Shuttle droping off people 2 blocks away. They had a very long walk. The room was very clean. I like the new fake wood floors. The main reason we aways stay here is the pool. The BEST pool in Vegas. It was full. You must get there at 8am if you want a good lounge chair and location. My wife has to be in the shade and that is the best pool in Vegas if you want shade. If you want to bake in the sun it is like all the other pools.They still have the very annoying time share people in the lobby. I quess the hotel makes a lot off it but they should know how everyone hates it. Also they have shops with very rude and annoying people trying to get you in. One guy don't know how close he got to be belted. All in all The Flamingo has come a long way in the last few years. It was getting shabby for a while. Still the best location on the Strip.

Was a little scared after reading the reviews of the non renovated rooms which we had booked, but the price for the renovated rooms(go rooms) was to pricey. Arrived at 11:30pm and once we got out of the cab the bell hoped informed us that their was a long line up to check in so we should maybe get something to eat or get a drink at the bar and come back in an hour or two. Took his advise and came back to check in later at which point they gave us an upgrade free of charge to a corner king room 21043 non renovated tower. The room was the last door down two hallways from the elevator but once we saw the room we had no complaints about the long walk. The room was more of a mini suite, large sitting area and a king size bed with floor to ceiling windows which looked out onto the pool and habitat area. the furnishings thru out were okay no stains or tears. The bathroom was normal size and came with the typical ammenties. The food at the hotel was okay, ate at the buffet for both dinner and breakfast and have to say the breakfast was the best out of both, just remember that the food stations continue on both sides of the wall. As for dinner at the buffet, skip it definately not worth the price trust me, im not a picky eater ( i eat at taco bell, burger king etc) but the selection and the quality was just bad. The other restaurant that we ate at which is located just by the buffet called tropical brezzes was good , the wait to get in was sometimes long, but the food was good and the portions were large, the food arrived fast but the service could have been better on each occasion we were their. Just be warned that the prices on all the food and beverages in the hotel are over priced $4.50 for a coffee. Also ate at the outdoor grill at the pool , good food just very pricey hotdog and bag of chips $8.00 , also the drinks at the pool area will run you $10.00 each for a frozen cocktails. The casino it self is small and comfortable with good drink service but the machines are very tight, and the tables areas are usually crowded but the seats are comfy. As for the location of the hotel can't beat it , right in the middle of the stripe, the sidewalk out front can get very crowded and the deuce bus stop is located just a step out side the entrance to the casino. Definately worth staying here, the pool and habitat area are amazing, just get to the pool early or you wont get a lounger or a spot close to the pool.

Everyone was very friendly and tried to make my stay a wonderful experience. The casino could use some updating, but it was clean and the staff friendly. Cocktail waitresses are plentiful and eager to get you a refreshment. Don't expect to go to the bar and get a bottle of water if you are not gambling - it costs $3. The buffet is a very good value. The Tropical Breeze restaurant is also a good value and you get a lot of food for the money. While in Vegas I would recommend one show that is at the Imperial Palace.

My husband doesn't like to walk but I was able to talk him into visiting 11 casinos within the strip area. The tram really made that easy. It was clean and I felt very safe. We also rented a car for the 4 days for less than a 100.00 from car rentals.com.. We ate the Margarettaville restaurant right outside of the hotel and it was very good both times.. The service was good and it was fun to people watch.. Overall I had a blast and will continue to stay at the Flamingo.... I am not sure about the good rates now that Harrah's has taken over.

We paid alittle extra nightly for this and were not disappointed. We arrived at our room to find a beautiful room, new furniture..floor to ceiling windows separate couch chair and coffee table at the window. My wife also had a dressing table and chair that she used. We had a Coffee Maker, blow dryer, amenities replenished everyday. On our first night we even were surprised to have turn down service when we returned late at night with chocolates on our pillow. Also and newspaper each morning. The last night we were there we decided to try the buffet and couldn't beleive the seafood selection, and almost any kind of meat, sushi, vegetables available. My wife and I have nothing bad to say about the food infact we are real critics of buffets and are cautious before recommending any of them if they aren't worthy. Another thing we also liked were the sub sandwiches and chips sold on your way out to the pool. We had these for lunch on 3 different days, fresh meats piled high and selling for $7 each.

We checked in at the airport which was pretty quick and easy, and I recommend, because we often saw long lines at check in at the hotel. The ONLY bad experience we had was when we first got there, we were told where the elevators were, took them up, and figured...\"Hey we're almost there!\". Wrong. We ended up walking down about 10 verrrry long corriders while hauling about 150 pounds in luggage (yes Continental weighed it and charged us for it) after a verrrry long flight and long rental car experience. SO, make sure you find the correct elevator bank, because we sure didn't. It will be a life saver. After that now laughable experience, everything was absolutely perfect. We had a mini-suite on the top floor that was huge, clean, and had a magnificent view of the pool/garden area. Floor to ceiling windows, couch, 4 chairs, good size bathroom, and LOTS of open space. Didn't have a fridge but we rented one for $10 a day, and they brough it up within 20 minutes of me calling for it. Had a welcome note from the wedding staff awaiting us and with further wedding day instructions. Wedding staff were extremely friendly and accomodating. Wedding cermony was absolutely perfect...we were married in the indoor chapel, very private and intimate as we hoped. Photos were waaay beyond our expectations (although we did shell out some good money to get all those great photos). We had our reception dinner at Ventuno...excellent!! Great food, better service. We were a little hesitant at first after dealing with them via phone/email, they seemed a little unorganized and unreliable, but boy did they come through in the clutch and provide great service (cake was one of the best i've ever had). Room service was great (try the Juevos Rancheros for breakfast). Champagne bruch at Paradise Garden Buffet was really good...food was decent, but the view and ambience were great. Pool was as good as expected. Try the jacuzzi's that are kind of isolated behind main pool, they were so relaxing. Gambling was good, plenty of cocktail waitresses to bring strong drinks, even when you're playing pennies and nickels. Margaritaville was as good as expected (try the flavored shots). We would recommend any young couples stay here (we're in our late 20's), even more if you're looking for a great wedding destination. We would do it all over again in a heartbeat.
