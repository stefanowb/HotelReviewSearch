Only used the kitchen for making breakfast and sorely missed a kettle and toaster that was quoted in the agents pamphlet, my enquiry at reception was very negative (Sandra) as I pointed out that other apartments had these items she suggested I go and take the items from these rooms for myself. No effort was made to supply the equipment and I was most put out by the response. Similarly, prior to my arrival (some days before) I enquired both thro the agent and with a direct phone call to the aparthotel if the TV had either a scart or video input (I wanted to edit my video films) and told they are not available by both agent and hotel. Guess what, the TV in the room had both! Not impressed with reception staff at all, although Sandra did bring out the first aid kit when I injured my foot.
