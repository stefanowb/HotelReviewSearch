As others have said, it is a bit of a walk to the center, but with all the pasta and vino that's perfect for us. The room was facing the garden so fairly quiet. The bathrooms were updated (small shower, but it worked well) which was a perk. Front desk staff and breakfast person were wonderful. We had some of the best espresso and cappuccino of our five week trip with the breakfast. Breakfast included homemade bread, cereals, yogurt, a warming tray of scrambled eggs and bacon (we did not have these), and fresh- squeezed orange juice (!). One downside for me was that the bedding seemed to have waterproof sheeting underneath the top sheet - made me uncomfortably warm.", "title": "Great place to stay for easy parking, wonderful staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "msanta", "date": "May 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 130288615}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Good choice if you are up to walking!", "title": "Great hotel with lots of charm", "user": "mpirog85", "date": "April 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 128643112}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel Villa Liberty has been a favorite of my wife and I, since we first visited in 2006.
