While this is indeed decent value for the money if you are on a tight budget, there is nothing else special about it. For the 1st time in years of relying on Tripadvisor users, we were a bit surprised with so much hype. Our room was large and particularly clean but there were: 1) no phone for the 4 days (the technician never came), 2) sliding closet doors that were already off the rails, 3) TV that did not work the 1st night (remote needed some programming?), 4) strobing light in the tired bathroom. Complimentary breakfast was minimalist and needed to be complemented with our own purchase of cereal, fruits and bread. You get it from a tiny office corner, where it gets replenished in small loads making us feel bad to take more, and bring it to your room. One morning, there was hardly anything left and it was not late. The managing couple are indeed welcoming, calm and patient but they looked tired and we did not see enthusiasm in dealing with customers. The rooms get partial day light, you get no view and no sense you are in S-F. The walls and floors seem thin so we could hear our neighbours and stomping from the people upstairs. Location is fine although not that central. We unfortunately can't say we would return. The city otherwise if fabulous. We recommend you should \"bike\" the Golden Gate bridge like we did (any novice can do it): we dealt with \"Blazing Saddles\" bike rental near Fisherman's wharf, took the trails to the bridge, crossed the bridge admiring the breathtaking views, ended up in upscale and charming Saussalito for lunch and shopping and came back by ferry through the bay (part of the package from the bike rental).

Stayed from 23 to 26 May 2006 and chose Nob Hill Motor Inn on advice from Trip Advisor reviews. The location is SUPERB. Easy access to buses, cables cars and Polk Street restaurants. Swensens Ice Cream on Hyde Street is an absolute MUST. Biked across the bridge and down to Sausalito. It was very windy and we needed to walk the bikes at times but it was by no means a tough ride. Sausalito is a beautiful little village, a must see. The Nob Hill Motor Inn itself is nothing out of the ordinary, in fact it is very ordinary. It is an old style motel and the rooms are a good size. They are a little outdated but very clean and very comfortable beds which to me is more important than a fashionable look. One tip, ask for a room on the second level as we felt we had a herd of elephants running around in the room above us. Breakfast consists of fruit, muffins and pre-packed danishs with juice and coffee. It is over by 9am so if you want a sleep in forget it. But it is free so make the most of it. Staff were friendly and helpful but no more so than anywhere else we stayed in the US. Overall I would recommend the Nob Hill Motor Inn but be prepared for what to expect.", "title": "Loved the Nob Hill Motor Inn", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "CSP0712", "date": "May 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5203682}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Fine, but you can do better", "text": "My wife and I had been on a Mexican Cruise and wanted to stay a few days in San Francisco.
