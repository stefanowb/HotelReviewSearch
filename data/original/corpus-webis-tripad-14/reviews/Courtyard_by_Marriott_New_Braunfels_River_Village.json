We had a room with a balcony that over looked the pool and the river. Our room was really small (king with a sofa bed) I got to look in some of the other rooms and there were bigger rooms. I think I would have rather stayed in a bigger room and give up the balcony. The hotel lobby is wide open with lots of seating and flat screen tvs. The eating area in the bistro has individual booths that seat 4 -6 and each booth has its own tv. Very nice. The decor is very earthy and modern. Very beautiful. The only problem I had was at check in--you could not check in until 3. The had no clue if any of the rooms were clean. The manager finally started walking up and physically checking to see what rooms were clean to let us check in. Then when we did get to our room I had to ask the cleaning lady to re-clean my bathroom floor. It looked dirty and I found hair. She was happy to oblige. The pool was very small. We swam the first night and around 8 it got really crowded with about 20 people. It would have been really nice if they would have made a larger pool. It's ashame because the setting is so beautiful with the large pecan trees and river and then they put this dinky small pool. They were having problem with the pool I would imagine due to the many people swimming. The next day they had clorine floating devices like you would buy at Walmart. The water was extremely cloudy. I didn't let my kids swim that day. By the next day the water was looking better. Management said the water was fine to swim in. I wasn't so sure about that. Over all this is a really nice hotel and I would definitely stay here again. I am sure they just need to work out the kinks with a new staff and training. If you are traveling with small children Landa Park is a must. My 3 year old loved it there and the springfed pool with the waterslide is awesome!!! In the back of the park they have a springfed wading pool. It's beautiful and they have a train that you can ride throughout the park. Don't forget Aquarena Springs with the glassbottom boat ride. There is so much to do in the area that is so close by. We also did the NaturalBridge Caverns. That was fun but beware of the climb up--It's a workout! Incase you are wondering--you can not get in the river from the hotel. The water looks pretty deep there and it has not been manacured yet. I would imagine over time they will fix all of this up. There were no walkways put in yet either. Also, there is an outdoor firelplace that I imagine will be really nice during the winter months.
