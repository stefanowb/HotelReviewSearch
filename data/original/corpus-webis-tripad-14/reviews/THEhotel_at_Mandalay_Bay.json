This hotel was lovely. Stayed in one of the suites for 4 nights 11th-15th march 2011 room 18803. It was huge, lots of space, two toilets, flat screen tv in bedroom, bathroom and lounge. Free wi Fi, lush soft mattresses on huge beds, free extra soft robes, etc etc. Very very nice. Also free parking which is always good and we hired a car to go to the canyon so that was handy. The actual hotel is a separate building to the Mandalay bay itself but it only takes a moment to walk across. Mandalay bay is where the casino and pool and most other amenities are such as restaurants, buffets etc. There are a couple of cafes in THE hotel but you are close enough to everywhere to be able to have the choice as to where to go. The hotel is on the south of the strip very very close to the airport. Infact you will be a stones throw from the hotel when you land, so very quick transfer times also. The hotel has a free monorail from Mandalay bay to the Luxor and the Excalibur which takes only a minute, or you can walk. We walked a lot of the time as the weather was lovely and why wouldn't you ? However most people over there didn't walk much and you will see clearly what I mean when you go! There is so much to see and do in las Vegas I wAs surprised and never for a second bored. We managed to cram so much in to 4 days. If you are going then the Hoover Sam and canyon are a must if you have never been before. Hoover dam by car is about 35 miles. Great pictures!! The shows are amazing!! Check out 'o' at the bellagio. Other free must sees whilst you are there include the wonderful fountains of bellagio show. Outside the bellagio hotel on the strip, it's a water fountain show to music and it's fabulous. Also, the volcano show at night at the mirage hotel is well worth 10 mins of your time. Last show at 11pm! They feed lions at the MGM grand hotel throughout the day, worth popping in for ten mins. There is a monorail that goes from the MGM grand hotel right up to the north of the strip it's 5 dollars single ride. We did it for the experience but if there are a few of you it's cheaper and faster to get a taxi. The fares are all set by the government so very fair. Back to the hotel, there are lots to choose from on the strip and some look very tacky indeed. This hotel wasn't at all. It's five star, comfortable and well cleaned with all the little luxuries thrown in for free. The only pain is the 18 dollar per room per day resort fee. They all charge it though so don't blame this hotel too much and some fees are more than this. Luckily if you book through virgin holidays for either the package or hotel only, as we did, you don't have to pay them!! I could go on about this lovely place but the phone battery is about to die. Happy to answer any hotel or location questions just send a message! Oh, don't use the mini bar it's a complete rip off, don't even accept the key from reception when they offer it!!

Unfortunately, I did not pay close enough attention and slipped it on after a shower. When my husband was going to put on his robe, he noticed that the robes were not clean. The robes were heavily stained inside and had hairs imbedded in the fabric. YUCK!!! I notified the hotel and they eventually brought clean robes for us to use. We never did receive an apology for wearing someone else's filthy clothes.
