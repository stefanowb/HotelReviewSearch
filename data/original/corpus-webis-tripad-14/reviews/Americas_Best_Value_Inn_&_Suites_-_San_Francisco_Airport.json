Surrounding neighborhood appears to be working class and up-kept homes. The beds are firm, but pillows are flat and hard. Heating and air conditioning are the large unit that fits under the window and makes quite a bit of noise when running. Our room was next to vending machines in courtyard, so we got to hear soda cans being dispensed late into the night by either street passersby's or hotel guests.
