However rather than driving into downtown Halifax for a hotel prior to our airport departure the following day, we booked at the Inn of the Lake. The check-in was okay but the room was very disappointing- certainly not what its advertising brochure illustrated. We were placed in a room with a king sized bed because the \"rooms were bigger\". However there was very little room for suitcases, the room was not well maintained (tile grouting on floor and shower was was discolored probably with mould, the toilet tank took about 15 minutes to refill, a shower cap was placed over the smoke detector, cleaning of the room was questionable). In addition there was a 1/2 inch gap between the door bottom and floor, emitting light into the room when we were trying to sleep). The bedding was ordinary. We paid $169 plus tax for this room. This price was outrageous. There is an overdue update of this hotel.", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "dkona", "date": "September 4, 2005", "id": 3842304}], "location": {"country": "Canada"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 6, "very good": 34, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 60}, "aka": "Inn On The Lake Hotel Fall River", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "Hotel Shuttle Bus to/from Halifax Airport.
