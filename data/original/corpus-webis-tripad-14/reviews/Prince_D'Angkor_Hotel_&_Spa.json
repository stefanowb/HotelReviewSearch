The hotel is lovely and the staff are very friendly and helpful but the hardness of the beds came as a big dissapointment to us. Firm beds ok; but these were just like planks and we found the sleep quality at this hotel less than satisfactory. We asked about other room options but were advised that all beds in the hotel were the same. Shame, because this should have been a wonderful first experience and introduction to Cambodia, and Siem Reap in particular.
