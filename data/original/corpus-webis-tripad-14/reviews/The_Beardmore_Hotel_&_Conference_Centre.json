Our stay at the hotel was an horrendous experience The first night we had dinner in the hotel in a separate room from the rest of hotel I asked the restaurant manager for Wine List and was told to go to the bar to ask for it and that took about 20 minutes to find the bottle I had chosen. The meal was appalling especially the main course which was chicken, the pudding was fruit salad this was like the fruit you would serve at breakfast, others guest were served frozen cheese cake After dinner we went to sit in the lounge and this was full and we went to sit in the dining room chairs but we were told we couldn't sit and were send to the reception area. I complained to the Duty Manager and she said she would sort out and come back to me. I am still waiting for this. The second night we didn't have dinner in the hotel as we were at the Tattoo, we did try to have a drink in bar but there was a wedding reception and no space sit in bar ,again we were very rudely told by the staff we could not sit on the restaurant chairs and were send to unfriendly reception area. The breakfasts were very poor with cold bacon and poor quality bread , we had taken a Swiss friend with us and there was no cheese or meats for her. The single room for my Swiss friend had a stained carpet . The double room that we had was ok except on both days the towels in bathroom were for one person instead of two. I have never stayed in a hotel with such bad mannered staff and this was not the impression I wanted my foreign guest to experience of Scottish hospitality.", "title": "Visit to the Edinburgh Tattoo 2nd Aug for 2 nights", "user": "Elliott375", "date": "August 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 172562724}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed at the Beardmore for one night on business and found a very good hotel on the edge of an industrial estate joined to a hospital.", "title": "Great hot in strange location", "user": "David B", "date": "August 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172330837}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Once you are past reception it turns into a proper four star hotel with all you would expect find in a quality hotel, with clean well appointed rooms.", "title": "Overnight stay whilst having a wee op!", "user": "Lynz76uk", "date": "August 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 172264742}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "An Apple computer in the room you can surf the net and watch TV on is a brilliant idea.", "title": "Restuarant was brilliant", "user": "Claireb88", "date": "August 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 171874180}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "The only let down here is the breakfast, lots of choice but when I went down at eight thirty the cooked breakfast looked very tired as if it had been out on display far too long.", "title": "Very friendly and courteous staff", "user": "MummyStone", "date": "August 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 171850762}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "had a 3 night stay and was pleased about it as it was a lovely hotel.. the family rooms were big, clean, king beds are comfy, good restaurant, and nice swimming pool, was initially confused as this has access to the hospital but it was well posted in their big lobby where the hospital/hotel is.. lovely view by the lake and the grounds Are very big and our children enjoyed playing around on a very sunny morning. i will definitely recommend and will come back again soon!", "title": "excellent", "user": "jhendg", "date": "August 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 174302049}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The Great Western Road is one that goes on & on but eventually we turned into the grounds of the Beardmore Hotel.

Our stay started off very well, when the hotel shuttle car picked us up from Glasgow Airport. The facilities are truly four star. The room overlooks the Clyde, so too does the largest restaurant. It was very quiet, spacious, clean and has a very comfortable king-size bed, a big sofa, iMac, luxurious carpets, decor and bathroom. The food was excellent; we had slices of lovely homemade bread with our excellent dinner at their smaller restaurant. The reception, restaurant and cleaning staff were all professional and helpful; however, two members of staff were exceptionally so and warrant a special mention: the head of the breakfast staff was a very professional, welcoming, pleasant, friendly and helpful gentleman. The other excellent staff member was Anne who went beyond the call of duty by offering us a lift to the nearby Dalmuir train station and also told us about nearby tourist attractions, such as Loch Lomond, which we visited and enjoyed very much. There are regular, inexpensive trains from Dalmuir to Glasgow Central/Queen Street Stations and regular buses to Balloch( for Loch Lomond). We really enjoyed our stay and we will definitely stay there again. I have already recommended this hotel to all my family and friends.
