Right off the interstate, across from the liquor store, across from Marley's Restaurant. This is a brand new hotel. We stayed in a family suite which was 1 bathroom, a bedroom with 2 queen beds, a bedroom with a king bed, table and chairs, wet bar and kitchen area.The only thing I did not care for was we were across from the elevators and I could here them most of the night. Our room was not ready when we got there at 2:45 because check in was 4 PM but they hurried and had it ready by 3:45 so we could make the 4:30 Tommy Bartlett show with our 3 year old. We used the indoor pool which was a good size and great temperature. We loved that we could walk to Marley's and have dinner and drinks without driving. We already are planning to stay here again with friends. The room was such a great deal for a large room.", "title": "Brand New Perfect Location", "user": "jenai23", "date": "September 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176364620}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The experience from reservation through check-out was...", "text": "The experience from reservation through check-out was freindly and efficient.

When we came back from dinner, he asked me to check the fridge and see if the smell was gone. It wasn't and I went back downstairs to let him know and he said that a new one would be brought up within 15 mins.
