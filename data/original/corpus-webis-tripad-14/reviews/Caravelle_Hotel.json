We've all been to HCMC a couple of times, but this was the first time at the Caravelle. It is now our preferred hotel here--second choice would be the Duxton, if budget doesn't allow for the Caravelle. I stayed in the Grand in Feb. 08, which is a huge disappointment--as a beautiful French Colonial-era building it has the potential to be really terrific, but is far, far from that (its cheaper price is no excuse for such tacky presentation), so never again there. The Caravelle's public areas are much smaller than the neighbouring Sheraton (no loss, in our view), but elegant and beautifully decorated. We loved the Christmas decorations and how all the staff entered into the spirit of the festive season--loved the choir of orphan/street kids that visited a few times. All staff, esp. reception, could not be more helpful and cheerful. Breakfasts are just as a previous reviewer described--everything you'd ever want. Only one small quibble is that I cannot abide tea from those large perspex teapots that sit around stewing on a hotplate--ugh! We each asked for, and got after quite a wait each morning, an individual pot each. No big deal, but this standard of hotel could easily do this as a regular service. The large bedrooms themselves had every comfort and convenience, with the notable exception of internet access--no wifi, and a steep charge for internet access, as someone else has mentioned. Again, not acceptable these days--for what is still a poor country, Vietnam has a high take-up of technology amongst locals, so hotels of this standard can and should be able to improve their service in this respect--at the moment, it's a nice little extra earner for them. As also noted by others, the beds are blissfully comfortable, everything is very clean and well presented--but yes, I agree that the decor does have a bit of a bland, \"universal-corporate\" look about it, but it is still good--quite fresh and not at all worn, as alas, one reviewer found. The only real complaint about the room is that it's almost impossible to adjust the air-con to other than freezing--my 2 other family members sharing a twin room on another floor found the same thing. Again, these days management should be able to deal with this sort of problem reasonably effectively. However, all in all, we'll certainly go back to the Caravelle. It's location is about as good as it gets in HCMC, and we also just liked the scale of everything at the Caravelle over and above say, the Sheraton, which is, I suspect, quite a bit more expensive and for no real advantage that we could see. We didn't have Christmas Day lunch at the Caravelle, but went across the street to the very ritzy and glam (whose rooms are vastly more expensive) Park Hyatt, who offered a sit-down, set menu at almost the same price as the Caravelle's buffet (which is good for breakfast, but hate for other meals). This was superb in every respect for food, ambience, wonderful service, indeed everything, and will certainly be on our dining/drinks/afternoon tea must-do list in HCMC in future. Those who love good interior decor should definitely go and check out the Park Hyatt. Ref. one reviewer's comment that the Caravelle is some distance from the airport: would you really want to be stuck in a hotel right out there in \"Siberia\"? Like many cities, HCMC's airport area is just a grim district to pass through as quickly as possible! District 1 is without doubt the best place for visitors--everywhere you want to go is accessible, restaurants, shops, Reunification Palace, Cathedral, etc. all walkable, esp. from Caravelle, and other attractions only a short, cheap taxi ride.", "title": "Excellent hotel in HCMC", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "planetraveller", "date": "January 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 23535831, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Fabulous location, friendly staff, overall high quality of hotel and presentation", "disliked": "\u2014 Air-con. in room virtually impossible to adjust from near-freezing."}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed there twice on a recent trip and cannot recommend the hotel for any reason other than location.

There's a good gym and spa, although we had an odd experience on our first visit there, where they insisted that only one of us was registered in the room, so only one could use the gym. They came back repeatedly and, in front of all the other people using the gym, insisted that this was the case, then when they finally ascertained that we were both staying, they very quietly and privately apologised. Also, while we were there, we had some laundry done by an external service. This was returned to our room, but the hotel's laundry bag and price list was left very prominently on the bed. Given that we needed laundry done quickly, and that they were charging $9 for one shirt (no, that's not dry cleaning, nor does it include ironing), I thought this was a bit cheeky. If they want people to use their services (and, after all, this is a city centre hotel, not an isolated resort) they should charg more realistic prices. Overall, while it's a nice place to stay, I came away with the impression that this is about getting maximum money from guests, rather than providing good service.", "title": "Nice enough", "user": "don't_fly!", "date": "March 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14519297, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Rooms, views", "disliked": "\u2014 Overpriced services"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Reasonably good 5* hotel in the heart of Ho Chi Minh city.
