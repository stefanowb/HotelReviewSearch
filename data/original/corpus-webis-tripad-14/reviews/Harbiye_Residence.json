It's a short walk to Nisantasi, a fashionable shopping and restaurant district mostly patronised by Istanbul residents, or to the transport and tourist hub of Taksim. Touristic visitors should be aware that the HR is some distance from the main tourist sites of the Topkapi peninsula (Ayasofya, blue mosque, bazaars) - although not much further than hotels in Taksim - and should expect either to spend some time walking or on public transport, or to take the occasional inexpensive taxi ride.
