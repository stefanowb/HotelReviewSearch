Overall after staying at St Regis Bal Harbour the standard was set high, but even older St Regis in San Juan was much more relaxing, I forgot to mention the annoying door bell at odd hours that I could hear in my room every few hours. The entire room reminded me an akward design of Palace resorts in Mexico where I believe the price per week is the price per day or two at St Regis, glass bathroom door and opened bathroom concept is not exactly classy. I am writing this review as I am sitting in not so new BH Four Seasons and even though the place does not have a \"wow\" factor as St Regis Bal Harbour, it is completely in a different class (much higher one) than St Regis San Francisco.

Service at check in and with the concierge was great and they were generally very friendly and greeted us with smiles and tried to assist and be helpful! One night they took us to our dinner reservation with their Bentley which made the kids super excited! The \"Butler\" was a waste of time as we only saw him once and they did not check in on us or do anything really so not sure what they are for. The location was amazing and very convenient to all.

It's become my go-to hotel in San Francisco, both on trips for business or pleasure. However, my most recent stay was disappointing and I think I'll be looking to try a couple of other hotels on future trips to San Francisco. My wife and I were there for two nights. When we checked in, I asked the person at the desk if she could put me in the same room type as last time. She looked back through my recent stays to figure it out. A couple of minutes later, she asked \"Is this your first time at the hotel?\" I get that this is the equivalent of the \"did you find everything you were looking for?\" question you get when you check out at the grocery store and you know the person isn't really interested in your response, but it's still not ideal. In any case, we did end up in the same room type, but this one was connected to another room and the person next door was on a phone call and we could literally hear every word of her conversation in our room. We asked to be moved. We were taken to a room a level up that clearly wasn't the same room type and had a layout we didn't love. They offered one more room on the 15th floor, but it was filthy -- there was a patch of carpet missing, the writing desk was stained, and the windows looked as if they hadn't been washed...ever. To top it off, we were told there was construction nearby (not sure why we weren't told that on the original room, which was a door away but even lower, but never mind that). Needless to say, we went back to the second room we'd been offered. However, the thermostat didn't work. A very nice woman from engineering fixed it. When I took a shower that night, I realized that the rain shower wasn't working right -- it was mostly dipping.

In room DVD/CD player, fax and printer are all nice touches. Great overhead shower. Bathroom only had a single sink, and no full length mirror, so it was difficult for 2 people to get ready at the same time. Conveniently located to shopping, movies and museums. Another tip, on the guest room floor there 3 elevators on each side, the first on each side have separate buttons from the other 4 and from what we could see the first never worked during our stay, yet no signs of them being out of service, they may have been some kind of special/VIP elevator, but you didn't know that as you stood waiting for the elevator that would never come. My tip ask for a high floor, and don't plan on watching TV, get out check out the city.", "title": "Wake and smell the onions", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "MovieGuyParadise_CA", "date": "March 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4568294}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Can we move in please?", "text": "My boyfriend recently took me to the St. Regis as a romantic Valentine's Day surprise - although we both frequently stay in excellent hotels for business, we immediately loved the St. Regis!
