The bathroom was recently remodeled and very nice with just a shower. The air conditioning was good, but could have been better. Annamaria, at the front desk was very helpful to the group. Breakfast was continental but also very good. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody traveling to Rome. there is a very good restaurant about a block from the hotel, the Il Barroccio. Very good and reasonable for Rome. The hotel is close to a metro station and a bus line.

We (my mom, sister and I) had a triple that overlooked the hotel entrance. It was quiet and spacious for us. Breakfast was plentiful - but then again we don't each much in the morning (bread, yogurt, coffee, milk, juice). Where I think the Aberdeen did excel for us was their concierge and staff - they were extremely helpful and courteous. From the initial contact via e-mail with all hotels (with the Rome hotel search), during our stay, and holding onto our luggage after check-out -- they were fabulous! We didn't have time to utilize all of the hotel's in-house services (e.g., Internet) as we were busy sight-seeing. Ask for special rates, as sometimes they offer discounted rates during certain seasons or to Rick Steves's readers.

This was our second trip this year to Italy and both times I used Tripadvisor to find our hotels. The Aberdeen in Rome was lovely. Before we arrived I had corresponded with Annamaria on and off for 4 months. She was wonderful in changing, adjusting and helping us plan our week in Rome. The hotel was perfect for us. Our room was small but it was clean and quiet. There are larger rooms but I stressed the need for quiet. It was and we always had the windows open. The beds were comfortable and although I am a poor sleeper I slept very well in Rome. The entire staff was helpful and suggested wonderful restaurants, helped us find the sights and advised us to take a tour to Naples and Pompei instead of going on our own. It was a good decision and I would highly recommend it. In summary I would say that the Hotel Aberdeen was well located, safe, clean, quiet and made our stay in Rome very enjoyable.", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "ezb", "date": "May 2, 2005", "id": 3433552}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Exceptional Hotel!!", "text": "My husband, daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights in March.

The room was cool, spacious, and very clean. The bathroom also was spacious and picture-perfect. Though we did not spend much time in the room because we tried to see a lot of Rome in a few hours, I would have liked to have spent more time there.
