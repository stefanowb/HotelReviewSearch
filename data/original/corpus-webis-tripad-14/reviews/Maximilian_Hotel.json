Couldnt find fault with the hotel, fantastic location a 5 minute stroll from the old town square - which is really beautiful at Xmas with the tree and the lights and the markets... We did venture to Wencalas Square which is awful - you could be in any country in the middle of stag / hen night parties - stay away if you want to see the real Prague. The street the hotel is on is a bit of a back street, and at first I felt a bit weird and didnt think id be happy to walk it alone - but its fine, tons of people around all the time and even when its dark & quiet - there's no question of your safety - i couldnt say the same for the always packed Wencalas Sq though.. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the beds are extremley comfy - we had room 604 (i think) which is in the \"red house\" its the block at the back of the hotel, the lift only goes to the 5th floor and you have to get out and walk up the remainder of the steps!! but its only about 10 steps.. We could see the old town square churches from our room etc. The staff were friendly and helpful. We booked the car to pick us up from the airport & bring us back - its expensive but handy. The hotel is actually very quiet, and you never really see any other guests. The honesty bar is ok but extremley quiet!! We ate in Chez Marcel next door - good food but a slightly limited menu. Prague is strange in that people bring their dogs into restaurants - kinda odd!! there is a good (cheap) bar just around the corner from the hotel - left out of the hotel & first left again - small looking pub on the right hand side, friendly owners. if you go off the beaten track you'll find much nicer & cheaper restaurants, be warned - wine is very expensive in Prague.

Dlouha Street, which winds behind the hotel, is a direct route to Old Town Square and is lined with great restaurants, cafes, and even a couple all-night convenience stores! My single room was clean and quiet with a sleek, contemporary and very efficient design. The same design is carried over into the \"library\" and other sitting areas. The hotel also offers free Internet access and PC usage in its business center which is a big plus. All staff, including the front desk people, bellhops and restaurant staff, went out of their way to make sure my stay was pleasant and comfortable. When the first room I was shown to was a bit too warm for me, I casually mentioned it to the bellhop and he immediately called down to the front desk and had it changed! There was also a complementary bottle of wine and plate of fresh fruit waiting in my room for me!
