Our room facing into a courtyard was on the 3rd floor and consisted of a smal siting room and adjacent bedroom, rather grandiosely described as a junior suite. It was small but perfectly adequate for one or two nights, clean but a little faded. The bathroom was narrow and one had to squeeze past the WC and bidet to get to the shower, not a problem but really only suitable for one person at a time.", "title": "A mixed bag at the Biancamano", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "wendissima", "date": "January 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 6606433, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 it was clean", "disliked": "\u2014 the tired decor and tiny bed"}}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Piedmont", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 3, "very good": 7, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 4}, "slim_ranking": 0.653846153846}
