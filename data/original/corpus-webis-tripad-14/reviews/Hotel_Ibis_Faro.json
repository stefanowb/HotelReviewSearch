Having checked out of our holiday hotel and returned the hire car we found our early morning flight cancelled on the 15th due to the volcano dust. Our son in England checked us into the Ibis as a temporary measure. We actually stayed 7 days. The rooms were small and the decor a little dated but the beds comfortable and very clean. A former occupant had obviously been smoking in the room and the maid made valiant attempts to air the room as much as possible. The public areas were pleasant and clean and the pool area and gardens were delightful. Regarding the staff - I cannot praise them too highly. At a time when many guests were like ourselves stranded they were always helpful, kind and polite. They took the trouble to advise people on where things were in the locality and also on alternative travel arrangements. We could have moved back to one of the resort hotels but enjoyed the walk into explore Faro or the Algarve Forum a large shopping complex nearby. Certainly a pleasant hotel with exceptional staff if you want to explore this area for a few days.", "title": "great staff", "user": "martin4fran", "date": "July 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 33746065}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Faro was the one spot on our Spain/Portugal Christmas trip we had not booked in advance.

The hotel itself was really inexpensive by European standards (45 euro/night). The room was clean if basic; the staff were very charming and helpful, and the breakfast buffet (5.50 euro for two) was outstanding.
