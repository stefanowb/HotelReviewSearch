We had reviewed this hotel on this site prior to our travel, and given the reviews we booked it and we were not disappointed. The outside looks a litte dated, however the rooms have been recently renovated and was fine for myself and hubby. The bathroom is very small, however, the sink is just outside the bathroom. The first 4 nights we were there, the water in the sink was just a trickle, however, it was due to a problem from roof renovations and on our return visit, this issue had been resolved. The room was clean, offered free wi-fi, new linens and a pretty good cheap buffet breakfast. The pool area was a nice little area with towels available poolside. The only thing missing for us was a fitness area. For approx. $50.00 per night, it was definitely reasonably priced.

After I arrived to my room on an elevator with a wood plank floor, I tried to wash my hands & the water pressure was so low that the water just dripped out. I looked at the towels & they were filthy. I went back down to the front desk to inform them of the issues with the room & left to get something to eat. The hotel clerk asked if the towels were grimy like it was a common complaint. When I came back, my room was open & no one was in there. All of my stuff was in there unsecured. Anyone could have walked in and taken my luggage. The water pressure was a little better but the nasty towels were still there. I had to go back down to the lobby to inform them of the new issues. Again, no apology. The clerk just said that she would give me some towels now while I was down there. By that time, it was to late to find another hotel. I ended up sleeping in my clothes because I did not want to touch anything and I did not feel safe. I informed the clerk why I was checking out early the next morning & she did not even apologize for my unhappy stay at the hotel. I paid for the one night and hoped that my vacation would get better.

I couldn't have been more happier! I booked my reservation over the phone via the 800# and the reservation agent was truly AWESOME! Very helpful, patient and courteous. When I arrived on 4/1/11 I continued to be pleased. The desk agent was \"ok\". She wasn't overly helpful or friendly, she was just doing her job. Nevertheless, I have no complaints. On our floor (9th) the hotel was still in the middle of some renovations and had a few \"pardon our mess\" signs but nothing to fret about. The room was great. Very spacious and awesome view. The toilet & tub/shower was small but it wasn't bad at all. I was expecting the worst based on past reviews. It was a plus that the sink was located on the outside, so I gave that a thumbs up. We bought the breakfast package so we received a ticket for the breakast buffet each morning. It was very sufficient. The location was great, walking distance to a lot of eating places and a mile down the road from Universal Studios. The concierge was very helpful as well as Sid, the agent who booked our shuttle for Universal. He was humorous and super accomodating.

During 2 of the evenings on 4 seperate occasions someone was sliding little flyers out for local pizza places under the doors. the next morning we got up and went into the resturaunt and had breakfast off of the buffet and all the food was well cooked and for a little over 5 dollars per adult its something not to pass up and our child ate for free. the waitress on the first day was working by her self and the service wasnt the best but she was trying to do all she could do.

I read the reviews but was still quite nervous. I cannot convey the relief I felt when we arrived at this hotel! It was first and foremost - clean! Newly renovated, the rooms are appealing. Yes, the bathroom is a bit small, but for 50 bucks a night, you won't hear me complaining. Our room was incredibly equipped. For the price, we got a refrigerator, microwave, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, safe, free wi fi, plenty of storage for clothes/suitcases. I personally thought the beds were very comfy, at least in room 910. There is a nice pool, and quite frankly, I am still surprised they provided us with pool towels. If you like big beach towels, though, bring your own. Maid service was excellent. I actually thought the buffet was very good and very reasonable, considering our kids ate free! The staff was extremely friendly. We received a coupon for the Japanese restaurant for 50% off one entree from the front desk upon check in, however, on our reservation confirmation, there was a coupon for a free entree, so look to use that one. We love Hibachi, and I can honestly say this was one of the best we've had as a family. There is a shuttle, and as the other reviews state, the shuttle does go to two other hotels., and you must reserve in advance at the concierge. The good news is that this hotel gets the first pick up, so you will always have a seat. It is also the first to be dropped off back at the hotel, so you are the first off the bus in the afternoon. We only stayed half days at universal, although the shuttle only comes for pick up at Universal in the late afternoon/evening, we walked back to the hotel as it was so close! It is about a 20 minute walk depending upon how fast you walk, and well worth it! If you need to take a taxi back to the hotel, you are looking at $8 total, including tax and tip - that is a bargain! The location is perfect, we walked everywhere. The restaurants and attractions are all so close. Next time we are on vacation in Orlando, budget or no budget, we will go back - afterall, why waste your money on an expensive hotel when you can waste your money on Harry Potter wands for the kids???", "title": "What a relief!
