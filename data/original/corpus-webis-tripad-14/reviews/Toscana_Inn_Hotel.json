I've stayed there several times while in Panama on business. The hotel is very clean, well-maintained and the location is great. There are excellent restaurants in walking distance, several of my favorites are only steps away. Because the guest room floors are all tile, as usual in Panama, I found the room a wee bit noisy during the day. The breakfast is adequate, but not elaborate. The icing on the cake for this hotel is the staff. They are simply wonderful. I don't speak Spanish, and the first night I was there, I called for room service. The person answering the phone didn't speak English, but cheerfully connected me to the hotel manager who took my order and had it delivered within minutes! The front desk and lobby staff will greet you by name throughout your stay and offer any help. You will begin to feel like you're among old friends by the second day of your stay.
