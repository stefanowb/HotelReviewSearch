It was clean, and the staff was pleasant and helpful. The location of the hotel is excellent, just a few blocks from the beachfront and within easy walking distance of all center city attractions. The hotel could use a bit of a facelift. Although the bathrooms have been somewhat modernized, the rooms are a bit shabby. There is a lovely outdoor garden and pool area, but it needs a good cleaning.
