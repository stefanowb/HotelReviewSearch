An old house that has been converted, it has about 10 rooms (all suites with a separate living room, actually), almost all very different from one another. The decor is classy: predominantly white, modern and sober, yet it feels very cozy, in part because of the warm lighting and the soft wooden plank flooring. Pristine, modern, Grohe-equipped bathrooms (showers in most rooms), with robes and slippers. Breakfast, which was complimentary in my case, is excellent and as much (including cheese, hams, and eggs) or as little as you like. There are a few other \"Goeres\" hotels in Luxembourg, but this one is named \"Beaux-Arts\" because of the big art pieces that adorn each suite and make it unique. The staff is extremely kind and welcoming, making you feel at home. Other than the fact that the front part of the building can be somewhat noisy at night, as noted by other reviewers (and I do confirm this), the only other little glitches for a hotel of that class is that there is no safe deposit box inside the room, and that the single flat-screen TV set sits in the living room of the suites, so you cannot watch TV from bed (at least in the rooms I saw). However, none of these little flaws was enough of a nuisance in my judgment to warrant a downgrade from five stars rating. All in all, a wonderful find, which I can only recommend highly and where I will certainly return.", "title": "Great location, big room", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "shackelton", "date": "March 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126187115}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "This was a great hotel in the heart of Luxembourg.
