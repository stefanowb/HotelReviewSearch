I was on business and I liked the free wi-fi, proximately to the Convention Center, and the front desk was helfpul. You can walk to SeaWorld from here and it's right off Interstate. I was worried I'd hear the cars on the interstate at night, but I didn't. However, I did hear people in the hallway, in the next room, and in the parking lot. For me, the hotel is great for families and tourists. If you're on business, you should know that a lot of tour buses / large groups use this hotel. We saw a bus full of people depart and another show up. Some of the rooms were damaged due to a large contingent of students from Argentina flooding a few rooms. Because of this, one of our associates were not able to stay at the hotel even though he had a reservation. Again, the staff was professional, apologized, and found him another hotel for that night. Overall, good hotel and I would recommend it to my friends with children.", "title": "Good Hotel for Families", "user": "ohiocouple", "date": "February 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153191606}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013", "text": "Location is ok, but there are many options that are closer to restaurants, etc. Rooms could use updating (faucets had a constant drip).

The next morning the Front Desk Manager (Hi Brian) admitted it was the hotel's mistake and he ensured we were moved into our correct room that day, provided Hilton Points as way of an apology and continued to apologise throughout our stay - excellent customer service.
