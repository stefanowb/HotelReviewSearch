The bed was firm and the bathroom was quite serviceable, though the shower with no enclosure took some getting used to. The internet point was a big plus with me, and reasonably priced too. We loved the central location near St. Catherine's head and an easy walk to Il Campo, restaurants, sites, etc. We took our breakfast at Nanini bar near the Dominican church, with a stop at Bar Sport on the way into town. The breakfast at the Bernini was just too high priced for us. Great Osteria downstairs below the hotel and went to 2 others near the Campo that satisfied as well. Mauro finally pulled out his famous accordian on our last afternoon while we were in the room resting up, and I'll always remember how wonderfully he played.
