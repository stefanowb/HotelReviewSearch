I haven't seen a box TV in about 10 years, almost ironic as all the channels are broadcast in widescreen format; really can't be that much to negotiate a special rate for 40 plasma 20\" TVA....

Breakfast staff were amazing, remembering the kids' names n all! Ate so well at breakfast we barely needed anything at lunch. Service was excellent whenever we needed it. Rooms were cleaned to perfection!. Water pressure was great. Some noise on the 2nd floor from the dance show/night club but we were at the back so it was minimal. The rooms were huge for Irish standards and we had 2 rooms on the 2nd floor which were inter-connecting (I think it was 208 and 209)...weird thing though...when we woke on the first morning and walked into the interconnecting room where the boys were, there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke! We don't smoke and the windows weren't even open! We mentioned it after breakfast on our way out for the day and when we came back it was gone (odd swiff of it now and again if you concentrated hard) so we thought problem sorted! Woke up on the second morning and same thing! Like as if one of our boys had been smoking LOTS in the room! (the oldest was 11yrs)...Both nights we heard someone putting money into the vending machine around 2-3am but then it continued...they didn't press any buttons to get a snack, they just kept putting money in! But when one of us (first night it was my son) got up to use the toilet, the money clinking stopped! Second night I heard the money again, so I waited and waited and someone kept putting money in and not retrieving anything!?!?! So I got up to use the toilet and immediately, it stopped...I didn't sleep after this! My husband would not be a \"believer\" of ghosts per say, but we both believe \"something/someone\" was in our room or very near. I would NEVER stay on this floor again and would NOT stay here without my husband/teddy bear to snuggle up to at night for fear of it happening again! I did not tell my kids about this as we may stay here again because of the central location, friendly staff, and cheap offers, but I personally would avoid rooms 208/209 at all costs! Other than that, amazing hotel...only lost one star in my mind because of the \"ghost\"", "title": "Wonderful Service!
