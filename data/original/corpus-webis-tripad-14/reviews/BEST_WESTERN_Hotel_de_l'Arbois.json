To our delight this hotel did not disappoint us. It is outside of town but not extremely difficult to find in a very quiet area. Staff was very friendly. Room was very clean, beds were comfortable. Hotel has a sauna, gym, and jacuzzi. Bathrooms were super clean. free wifi internet was included in price which came in handy with laptops.
