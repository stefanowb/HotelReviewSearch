We were welcomed by two staff members, foreign girls, which was to be a theme of our 2 night stay- not many Irish people around! They were pleasant though and we paid up front, pretty cheap for the excellent location. The bar downstairs was rammed all day it seemed, and although this was a good thing for the drinkers, it was a bad thing trying to sleep at night. We were in room 6, directly above the outdoor smoking area, and it was so noisy until closing time (around 3am). I suggest ear plugs or a radio if you want to drown out the singing/shouting/etc from downstairs. Maybe we were unlucky with the position of our room, but it was very very loud. The room itself was basic but clean, one bunkbed, a clean nice bathroom with a good shower. No towels, but we had brought our own, not expecting towels to be provided. Breakfast, served from 8-10am was OK, just the usual toast/cereal really, nothing special. The location of this hotel is superb though, right in the middle of the packed Temple Bar area and you're close to everything really. If you can put up with the horrendous noise (i.e if you're out until 4am anyway) then this would be fine, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're not out that late, and certainly not recommended for families with young children!", "title": "Good but very noisy!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "smicer07", "date": "September 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8686869}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "The appartments provide Excellent \"value for money\" in Temple Bar on the very top floor of Oliver St John Gogerty buildings.

The staff was quite odd and never seemed to get the price of the stay right with any of the guests (tried to double charge us). There was no locker storage, only tiny \"safe deposit boxes\" for those interested in keeping anything safe (for a fee). The mattress was so thin that feeling the metal frame through it was a given and there were burn holes throughout all of my bedding. It was maybe one of the worst hostels I've ever stayed in (and I've probably been to about 100 in my life). On the bright side, the pub downstairs was one of my favourites in all of Dublin with various different rooms and music and it was a happening place every nite of the week (hence noise being a given).
