We only had a bed and breakfast package but did sample the lounge menu and found the food and service very good at all times. The staff we encountered were polite, helpful and always asking if there was anything we needed. They welcomed our two and a half year old and recommended child friendly places to eat in the surrounding area too. All in all we found the hotel was very clean, modern decor, nicely located with helpful staff and a great pool. Wouldn't particularly suggest Cirencester a good place to eat in the evenings as there isn't much there. Would though recommend the Wild Duck Inn at Ewen for an atmospheric pub meal.
