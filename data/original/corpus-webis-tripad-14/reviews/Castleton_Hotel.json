Stayed in room G03 for 3 nights in October, my first reaction was \"what a super tiny room!\". Tried to take some photos of the room, but had very little space to do so. However, I have to say that the room is very very clean, and the single bed, extra comfy. Considering that the bed is just separated from the street by a wall; it was generally noisy, and the room being the just beside reception, can hear people talking outside, well, considering all that, I managed to sleep very well indeed. The bathroom was small too, but on the whole squeaky clean! Looking at the fire exit floor plan, it appears that G03 is the smallest room on that floor, but I guess a room on the groud floor is much better than that in lower ground.", "title": "Very very small room, but very clean rooms!", "user": "SweetLing", "date": "October 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 181065651}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My sister and I had requested a twin bed room. It was more like a twin bed cupboard with a little room between the beds. It was tiny but this is London so it wasn't too much of an issue. We were very concerned that the minuscule bathroom, similar to a ferry or a caravan emitted a dreadful odour. We were unable to shower in June room or leave the door open as the stench was too great. It smelt of drains and raw sewage and made both of us feel quite sick. We approached to desk and were told they would fix it, it improved a little then went back to the original state. We were then told we would be moved. It was just to placate us they didn't care. All three men at the desk told us the same thing but nothing was done. Then we were told that there were no more rooms available. One day we were told to pack and our things would be moved, of inure this didn't happen.

This was my 5th visit to the hotel in the past couple of years. The front of house staff / duty managers I have met have always been very pleasant to talk to and helpful. Received a warm welcome on arrival. Hotel is in a very convenient location. The room was a little dark possibly due to it's location within the building and there was a bit of noise from the heating system units outside, but not a huge problem and no outside street noise. More importantly I have found the rooms (so far stayed in 402, L109, L112, 201 and g09), bedding and towels to be very clean. Rooms very spacious and not too warm but not too cold either. The bed was comfortable. The ''pod'' / modular style compact shower rooms are brilliant - ideal for one person and superb shower water temperature quality and flow. Easy to keep tidy and non-slip flooring. Could do with one at home! A nice quiet hotel - very little noise from outside and other rooms above. I like the breakfast room and that classic fm radio was on in the background. The breakfast food was freshly cooked and the breakfast staff worked very hard to ensure guests received tea / coffee and toast as quickly as possible. Tip: go to breakfast early (a note in the lift gives the times). In fact this time the lady had brought coffee and toast as soon as I sat down! Choice of breakfast items is ok. The hotel communal downstairs rooms, corridors, reception area is well maintained and the lift is a nice modern one. The cleaning, reception, breakfast and other staff work hard and do their best to ensure guests are looked after.
