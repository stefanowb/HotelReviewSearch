This was our second stay at a Rock Resort; the first having been the Lodge at Vail. At Rock Resorts, they do a lot of little things that make for a very enjoyable stay. Valet parking by very friendly and helpful staff, a concierge who handled dinner reservations exactly as requested, a small ski shop that stored our skis at the end of each day, a small but perfectly charming pool and hot tub with beautiful views, an exellent on-site restaurant for breakfast every morning with an assortment of daily newspapers, very efficient turndown service every night before bed, boot warmers in the room to dry your skiboots at the end of the day and even a small humidifier in the room to use at night. We stayed in a beautiful King Deluxe room, which was perfectly suited for a ski lodge, with pine finishings, french doors to a step-out balcony and a beautiful view of the mountains. The room was quite large, with lots of built-in storage and a very comfortable kingsize bed. Our only complaint. The doors between the rooms are far too thin, making noise between the rooms a definite annoyance.", "title": "A lot of little things done right", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "prose01", "date": "April 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7300308}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The charm and appeal of The Pines Lodge is its ability to offer a full service and personable stay without the size and anonymity of most larger hotels.
