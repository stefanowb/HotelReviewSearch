The property is just south of the little village of Ardlui, and about five miles north of Tarbet on the busy A82 highway that runs along the west shore of Loch Lomond. A bit of caution is needed while driving this scenic route, because large buses and lorries make frequent use of this, frequently straddling the middle line as they go on their merry way.
