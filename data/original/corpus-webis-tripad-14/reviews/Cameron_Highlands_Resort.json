I would like to congratulate YTL corporation again for this outstanding resort. Among the other YTL resorts that i've been to, i have to say that this is my personal favourite. I have always believed that great people make great organizations. Kudos to YTL for hiring staff/workers that go the extra mile for their customers. Never was i once not impressed by the information and services that they provided. Food is extremely good as usual. I asked for a quieter room and front desk placed me upstairs. Personally, i think i would enjoy the room upstairs rather than the ones downstairs. Though less view (only of the mountain and half the golf course), it offered alot more privacy and alot less noise. Very peaceful. Afternoon tea is magnificent (especially the chocolate truffle cake) and deco/attention to detail is impeccable. However, i would like to give my biggest thanks to Cameron Highland Resort's resident naturalist mr Madi. We went on the Jim Thompson Trail and we got a lot more than we asked for. Very informative trail. At the same time, it is honest in the sense that you get to occasionally see Mr. Madi's disappointment towards the rapid deforestation of the surrounding grounds. The Jim Thompson trail itself does not exist anymore as a result of deforestation for some strawberry farm, as if cameron highlands did not have enough of those. I would recommend anyone who can afford to stay here to miss out the opportunity to do so. At this place, you will find a lot more than whatever that you are looking for. I have no complaints about this establishment at all (maybe the piano needs a bit of tuning or the lid has to be open when it is sounded). Otherwise, this place is perfect. Will definitely revisit again.

Meanwhile, lunch is served in the Jim Thompson Room with a good selection of Western and Japanese foods. The scones and pastries during high tea is simply delicious. For dinner, we have it both nights at Gonbei which is a Japanese restaurant. It basically serves a variety of steamboats, shabu-shabu and sukiyaki on a semi-buffet style. While it is a Japanese restaurant, I was also given a option to order western food which they will deliver from the Dining Room to Gonbei.
