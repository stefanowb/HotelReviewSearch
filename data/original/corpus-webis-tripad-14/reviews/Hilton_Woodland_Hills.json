However, if you are in a corner room, beware the oddly placed coffee table (between the bed and the bathroom) on which if you are like me, you may knock your knee during the night. Access to rooftop tennis courts. We were tired after long days at work, but walked to adjacent Cheesecake Factory to pick up a take-out order and shockingly were back in only 10 minutes! Starbucks also walkable....across the street. Parking charges of $14 weekday and $9 for weekend were a turnoff, but didn't have to worry about safety.
