The price was very affordable and you get so much for very little money. Me and my husband came to Hawaii for a second honeymoon I looked at hundreds of hotels before deciding on this one. The room was gorgeous the decor was awesome it was just like it was pictured on the Internet. The staff was very friendly they checked on us everyday to make sure everything was to our liking. The room has a flat screen T.V. very comfortable bed free Wi-Fi in your room and not to mention FREE breakfast!! The room has a fridge and a microwave which is a live saver. Hubby and I walked to the food pantry that was in walking distance and bought food for lunch and this saved us on average about $100.00 per day. Average breakfast and lunch outside the hotel for two people will cost you at least 100-150$ per day. The microwave and fridge saves us a lot of money we had food and water in the room to have when ever we wanted so we had breakfast and lunch in the hotel daily. The hotel is in the best location walking distance to everything so really you'll waste your money if you rent a car. You're close to a trolley stop that will take you wherever you need to go. I was so pleased with my stay I told other people on my shuttle to the airport and trust everybody was amazed... I will be telling everybody about this top notch hotel.
