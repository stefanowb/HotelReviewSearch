The check-in wasn't great, the staff didn't seem to know what they were doing. I had to sign to agree that I would be fined if I smoked in the bedroom and when I got to the bedroom, it smelt very strongly of cigarettes, so I asked to change room and this was done. The room was very comfortable with 2 large double beds and a nice bathroom. The dinner menu was a quite limited, we would have gone out if it hadn't been pouring with rain, but the food we had was good. The bar service was excellent, with a very helpful member of staff. I would return again as apart from the initial impressions, we had a good stay.", "user": "Roslyn N", "date": "November 29, 2012", "id": 146431743}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Centrally located hotel!", "text": "If you are looking for a hotel that is walking distance to shopping and nightlife in Vancouver, this hotel is a perfect place.

Sink area outside bathroom was small too. Nice lobby & bar area. We had breakfast included with our room, you can choose a small hot buffet or cold items from a case.

Our group of 6 stayed here for NYE as none of us wanted to be the designated driver. Our plan was just to leave our bags and come back for the night after the night out. The building is definitely a little older, but it seems the hotel had a recent makeover, making it on par with other Holiday inn locations. However, the washrooms and applicances seem to have been the originals from when the hotel was built, and, unfortunately that is where our problems lay. The room, when we arrived was freezing. I had a maintenance manager come and inspect the heater and he advised that it was not something he could fix that night so he suggested a space heater. I was completely ok with that, but of course, the space heater never came. By the time we got back to the hotel, we were too tired to pursue it further, except we all woke up freezing.The toilet also did not flush which was a complete inconvenience when we found out in the morning.
