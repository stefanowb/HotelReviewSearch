We were excited to go back for a quick weekend getaway but were extremely dissapointed with all the changes since we had been there. We both felt like we were checking into a totally different hotel then the one we had such great memories of. The room and general state of the hotel just felt run down. The walls were all scuffed up and the carpet in the hallways were dirty and looked really dingy. The bathroom was small and dark and the television in the room was tiny.
