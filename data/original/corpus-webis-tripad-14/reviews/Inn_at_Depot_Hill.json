The rooms are sumptous and quiet, each completely different from the next with wonderful, soft, comfy, cozy furnishings. We stayed in the Costa Del Sol room with a king size feather bed that was romantic and snuggly all at the same time. The fireplace, double shower, fresh flowers, and deck are just a few of the amenities the room afforded. The staff was excellent, curteous and warm, knowledgable about the area and made us feel as if we were special, very good attention to detail. The food! Yum! The best croissants, ever!

Hopefully, someone threw them out or at least added bleach to the wash, as you would do at home. The tv was very small with only a vcr option. The drinking glasses in our room looked very filmy; probably just wiped out once in awhile. Ironically, the paper in a frame that offers hotel service was stained.

To make ourselves feel better we \"splurged\" and booked the Kyoto Room at the Inn. Our strategy worked. Despite the fact that the rental house was akin to Hearst Castle, we never felt sorry for ourselves. We actually preferred our room in the back of the Inn with a private Zen garden. I won't repeat what everyone else has said about the Inn's marvelous attention to detail, the stunning breakfasts, wine and hors d\u2019oeuvres each afternoon, etc. We especially enjoyed returning from our relatives each evening and raiding the refrigerator for desert - cheesecake, fruit tarts, unbelievably scrumptious.
