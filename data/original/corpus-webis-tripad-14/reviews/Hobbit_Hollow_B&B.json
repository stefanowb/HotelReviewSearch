It was a wonderful place for a reconnect and enjoy each other during the short period we were together. We appreciated the quietness of the area. We went to the Sherwood Inn for dinner - a wonderful choice. Not much in walking distance to the Inn but a short drive brought you to downtown Skaneateles.

This is one of their other properties just 2 miles outside town. The inn boasts sweeping views of Lake Skaneateles saying that it is just across the road from the lake. What they failed to mention is that parallel lake road is about a half mile from the Lake and that there is a vineyard between the farm house, the road and the lake so while you can see the lake \u2013 it is a long way away.

We upgraded to stay in the Lake View Room which was $230/night for 3 nights. Had we known just how far away the lake was, we would have stayed in one of the much cheaper rooms because you still get all the amenities and views around the farm house. Plus if you want to see the lake in the distance, they have a screened in porch at the front of the house where you can sit and relax. The lake view rooms are just not a good value in my opinion. The room itself and the en-suite bathroom were quite large and had lots of amenities like thick terry bathrobes, spa products and an in-room TV. It was furnished with antique furniture and the bedding included high end $800 Frette sheets. They must have a problem with their washer though because we noticed that the sheets and some of the fluffy towels had holes that looked as though they got caught in the washer.", "title": "Superb Accomodations", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "perfectlyfrank", "date": "June 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7956452, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Luxurious Room", "disliked": "\u2014 NONE"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The common rooms feature gorgeous furniture as well as things to do such as TV\u2019s, games and high speed internet access.

The interior is immaculate and well-decorated with fine antiques. Our room was quite spacious and the bathroom was large and clean. The Hostess gave us several recommendations for dinner and prepared a delicious breakfast the next morning. Being only a few minutes from the heart of town, the property was still very secluded, quiet and romantic. It was the best B&B that we stayed at on our trip (5 inns total).
