The Arcadia Lodge is perched on a hill in the town of Russell, in the Bay of Islands. The views are truly amazing, with most (and perhaps all, but I'm not certain) of the rooms looking out to the water. The rooms - as well as the rest of the house - are exquisitely and tastefully decorated (I stayed in the Tautoru suite, which had a somewhat beachy feel, private deck, and excellent views). Great beds/bedlinens too....I slept like a log each night. My personal favorite was the Arcadia's main deck, which is perfect for sipping a glass of wine in the late afternoon sun. Finally, the owners, David and Brad, are very friendly, accomodating, and all-around great hosts.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "noscreennameswork", "date": "December 5, 2006", "id": 6334188}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Russell is a much more attractive and low-key town than its more touristy sister across the water, Paihia. It feels islandy, with some quality restaurants, a few shops, a little museum, several other historical sights, access to all of the Bay of Islands water-related tours and sailing, as well as a nice beach. If you're looking for nightlife, you won't find it. However, if you're looking to relax in a beautiful spot, go to Russell and stay at the Arcadia Lodge.
