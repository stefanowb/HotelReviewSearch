The Estancia La Portena has the most gracious staff, however it's ok for a day visit, NOT overnight. I appreciate the historical signifigance of this property, but it's really run down. The pool was dirty, the rooms musty, the tubs were dirty, the famous meat asada (BBQ) was just ok. All the furniture oudoors is broken or dirty. The horseback ride was barely scenic and lots of mosquitos. There is no place to get comfortable. The owners need to invest some money into the place.

We spent there only one night due to very intensive agenda in Argentina, but would like to return there for a relaxing atmosphere. The owners, a young couple, demonstrated extreme hospitality (including pretty Christmas gifts). This is a place to relax, eat plenty of meat, read some books on the history of Argentina in the authentic surroundings. Anti-mosquito repellent is a must, if you plan to spend a lot of time outside.

One the one hand, it is located on a beautiful property about an hour from Buenos Aires replete with picturesque old trees, skillful and talented gauchos, historical significance, friendly owners and terrific service staff. The experience for day trippers who come to witness life on an estancia, including horses, parilla, and gaucho games and music, is probably better than for overnight guests. Overnight guests experience the same offerings, but are subject to a property that has alot of deferred maintenance: lights that don't work, no heat in rooms, tired linens, bug invasions, and broken chairs, to name a few. On one day, the owners left for Buenos Aires while newcomers felt adrift when they arrived to find no one at the estancia who could speak English. The resident gaucho reprimanded a guest for building too big a fire in their room given the cold weather, when in fact an estancia worker had built the fire over the guest's objections. Unlike mosquitos and other aspects of life on a campo, these are not part of life in the country. The price is not low for all these negative aspects. I hope attention will be given to improving the current weaknesses so the newish owners can succeed at conducting both a tourist and agricultural business.", "title": "This could be very good with some work", "user": "vanholt", "date": "May 26, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 65434808}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Perfect get away from the city", "text": "My friend and I stayed there after 2 weeks of fairly intense trekking in Patagonia, and we couldn't have dreamed of a better place to land at.

The actual site where he found inspiration to write about the \u201cgauchos\u201d to whom he rendered tribute by making them popular. La Porte\u00f1a was declared National Historic Monument for its unique Argentine Creole style with thick walls made of adobe. In 1969 the place was chosen for the making of the film version of \u201cDon Segundo Sombra\u201d. Chosen as \u00a81,000 places to see before you die\u00a8 by Patricia Schultz. About the Ranch: Located in the district of San Antonio de Areco, the Estancia is only 50 minutes away from Buenos Aires City. This unique typical Argentinean Estancia is considered one of the most beautiful and traditional in the country for its history, architecture and surrounding natural beauty. The main house was built in the 19th century and the park around it was designed by the French landscape professional Charles Thays. Distinguished and prestigious personalities from the world of art and culture spent pleasant seasons in \u201cLa Porte\u00f1a\u201d: Jorge Luis Borges, Carlos Gardel, Victoria Ocampo, Count Keyserling, Rabindranath Tagore, Garry Kimovich Kasparov and Pedro Figari among others, enjoyed the hospitality extended to them by the G\u00fciraldes Family."}
