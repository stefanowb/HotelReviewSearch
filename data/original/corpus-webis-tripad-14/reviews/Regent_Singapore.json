As others have commented, the lobby and check in staff are very efficient and helpful. We had a particularly positive experience with the concierge who gave nice recommendations and helped us order movie tickets on line. The breakfast is ample and has a nice mix of asian and western food. What makes this hotel so nice though is the service. The staff are really trained well and go out of their way to anticipate requests. At the pool, the front desk, the gym, all were really courteous. As for the facility itself, I think it's starting to feel its years. Though there's no problem with cleanliness in any way, it's pretty clear it was designed with the needs of travelers past in mind. The room is small, the pool is small, the gym is small, the bathroom is super-small (as in the door practically brushes the front of the toilet when opened). All in all it's a nice place with service that I have rarely experienced elsewhere but if you want more opulence you should look elsewhere.", "title": "I'll give it five stars but the rooms are a little dated", "user": "badwaiter", "date": "August 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136946028}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I visited The Regent for business and stayed for a week.

Check-in & out were fast. Gym & sauna facilities were also very good. My flight was late at night so I got a late check out at 6 pm with no additional charges. Laundry service is expensive- 5$ for one pair of socks but I guess this is the price at any other hotel of these levels.

The air-conditioning is super quiet but a bit windy (I think you can ask them to adjust the air diffuser for you). Moreover, the toiletries provided is from L'occitane! However, the best thing of the hotel is not the hardware but its software -- staff. They all serve the guests wholeheartedly. On day, my little daughter slipped on the floor and bumped her head. Although the hit was in fact very minor and she was absolutely fine, the staff in the lobby approached us immediately and offered us help. The duty manager also gave us a call later (in fact it was a voice message as we were out) to express their concern. We could feel that they really cared about the guests. Overall, we have had a fantastic experience in the hotel and are definitely looking forward for staying there again. One suggestion, as there is another Four Seasons Hotel in the area, just tell the taxi driver \"Regent Hotel at Cuscaden Road\" and nothing more.
