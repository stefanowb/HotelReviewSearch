We had never stayed there before and decided to give it a try. We were very pleased and impressed. Our room was spotless, had a fireplace and a jacuzzi and a beautiful view. The dinner was excellent. Their steaks are as good as I've ever had and the resturant has a fabulous view great wine and equally great atmosphere. There is also a fun sports bar and pub on the ground level. The view is over the beautiful Flathead Lake. The lodge doesn't own lake frontage aparently, which in the winter doesn't matter of course, but in the summer you would probably want to identify whatever Woods Bay had to offer and how you could also enjoy the lake. I'm quite sure the lodge could help with that too. Once we figured in that we got about $70.00 worth of dinner included in the price it really makes for a bargain at a top notch place.", "user": "mtoutdoorsman", "date": "March 6, 2009", "id": 25691266}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Really, the maintenance truck!", "text": "We were satisfied with the room.
