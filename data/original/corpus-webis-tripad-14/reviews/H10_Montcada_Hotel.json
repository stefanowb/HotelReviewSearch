At least in this room, you could turn around and have space to put your suitcase.

Breakfast was sad and lacklustre, with no English papers available (I was told they would come in around noon.)

I was a little concerned from some of the reviews that I read prior to our visit but we were not dissapointed at all. On our arrival, we were greeted by very friendly reception staff who explained all the hotel facilities and talked us through the high lights of Barcelona whilsdt relating to a map which was provided. We then went to our room which was on floor6. The view from our room was nothing special, but we were not here to spend time in the room! The rooms are small and as a previous review suggested: there is no room to swing a cat! (who wants to do this anyway!) But this was not a problem, what do you need lots of room for? The room was clean and modern with a lovely bathroom. the only down side was no bath but there was a large shower. I believe that some rooms do have baths though, so if you request one then you should get one! We were not too fussed about this anyway as we spent both nights in the roof top jacuzzi in the early evening. I would say that this is what makes the hotel that little bit extra special! The roof terrace was lovely and I can imagine that in the summer months this would be a lovely place to enjoy the sun lougers and bar. We were also given our champagne which was included whilst sat in the jacuzzi which was a nice touch! overall I would definatly recommend this hotel, as it is centrally located and amongst many bars and restaurants. we did not use any transport whilst in Barcelona and saw most of it on foot. We also did not have any problems with noise whilst staying at this hotel. I was concerned about the bed on arrival as they are very hard, but I have to say I had two very good nights sleep.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "spam10", "date": "January 18, 2007", "id": 6615466}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "We arrived to a glass of cava too!

Much of the discussion appeared to be about the size of the bed but I didn't say anything until we were taken to the room - 211. It was tiny and stunk of smoke even though I had requested non-smoking. Window could not be opened. Small bed with only just enough room to walk by if you edged up the side of the wall. Simply awful. Straight down to reception to be told they were full! Told them I am asthmatic at which point they then offered another room which had not been made- up.
