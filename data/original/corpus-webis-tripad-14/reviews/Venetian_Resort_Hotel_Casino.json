I suppose for most people this would not be a problem - only a problem if you want to enjoy some afernoon quiet time in the room. Lesson learned - don't get a room in the Venetian facing the pools in summer (no matter how high up) if you are senstive to noise. I actually prefer the Palazzo, so next time we'll stay there or not stay at all. Other downside of this stay was the construction going on in the casino.

The Venetian Hotel is truly a delightful hotel. It is THE oasis in the Las Vegas desert! I wavered on my decision about staying at the Venetian since I read some unflattering reviews. I am so glad that I stuck with my gut decision and was a guest at this extraordiniary hotel! My husband and I spent 3 wonderful nights being spoiled in our luxury suite in the Venezia Tower. The suite was tremendously spacious and very well appointed. Our room overlooked the Venezia pool which was spectacular. Every staff member we encountered was helpful and down right friendly. The concierge assisted in dinner reservations and steered us in the right direction every time. Our check-in went QUICKLY and smoothly...no more than 7 minutes from arriving in line. We checked out via the Venetian's automatic system with nary a problem. The thing that make this hotel so superb, is the room itself. Honestly, there is not ONE thing I would change. It was huge and beautiful! The bathroom included a large soaking tub and a Swiss shower. It had a vanity area and a double sink. The toilet was in a separate room. The lighting throughout the suite was lovely too. We had 2 flat screen tvs as well. Although people would come and go all night as you would expect in Las Vegas, we never heard a sound from our neighbors! The housekeeping staff are impeccable. Our shower was cleaned daily so as not to have any water drops on it! AMAZING!!! Yes, there is alot of walking to get around the Venetian. I've stayed other places in Las Vegas and everything requires alot of walking! At the Venetian, you're lucky enough to have great restaurants, a nearly smoke-free casino and great shopping all in the same complex. The pool and hot tub setup is fabulous too.

We had stayed at the Palazzo for my sister-in laws bachelorette party and had a great time. So, my brother decided to book 2 suites at the Venetian from Feb 13-15th. My brother booked the suites more than a month in advance because he wanted to celebrate his 30th birthday with all his friends. He payed $290 for each suite because he didnt want us to worry about paying for the hotel. He specifically requested 2 joining suites so that we could all be together. My sister in law made reservations for everyone at Tao. Our friends arrived before we did and Venetian was kind enough to give them a room first. However when we arrived my brother learned that the two rooms were not adjoining, even though that is what he specifically requested and booked in advance for. So after 45 minutes of speaking with the front desk they finally resolved the situation and gave us 2 joining rooms in the lower quality towers, with smaller rooms. He requested a discount but they gave him about $20 off. All of our friends who had checked in earlier, gotten comfortable and unpacked, had to repack all their belongings and move to a smaller room in another tower. This took about an hour an half. It took 40 minutes for the bell hop to arrive at the room to help move the luggage. Once we actually got settled in the other room, the cake showed up and we had to rush to get to the restaurant. Three of our friends got there half an hour early to re-confirm the reservation and have a few drinks. Our reservation was at 10 and we arrived at 945, our friends arrive at 9:15. Throughout the day my friends had already spent hundreds of dollars gambling and drinks. When we arrived we spent at least $400 more. We waited for a table until 10:45, constantly checking with the hostesses, who gave us attitude each time. The hostesses never even apologized or offered anyone drinks though it was their fault that we had to wait almost an hour and it was my brothers birthday. So we got seated after 11:00 but there wasn't enough room for everyone, when we tried to get additional tables, the waiter was extremely rude and gave everyone an attitude. This was the last straw and we decided to leave even though we had already spent so much on drinks and waited so long for a table. We wound up eating at a cafe at another casino.

The Venetian also doesn't do a lunch or dinner buffet so we again went to the other casino's for our buffet's, Luxor and Ballys buffet's were excellent, Harrah's always had very long waiting times so I presume that was good also. As we were there for our 40th anniversary we had dinner at Luxor's Sacred Sea Room restaurant, it was fantastic. We took the helicopter trip into the Grand Canyon with Papillon Helicopters and had a champagne picnic on the canyon floor, this again was fantastic, cost $270 each and lasts about 4.5 hours from hotel to hotel. If you want a heli' trip on a budget drive to the Hoover Dam and about a mile before the dam there is a casino with a heli' company beside it advertising heli' trips for $29, now that looks a bargain.
