Situated close to St Marks, it is convenient and also it is not far to carry luggage to the water bus. Quiet at night.

The Green Room is in the attic but headroom is no problem, there is good space and it is comfortable. All the equipment in good working order. Breakfast typical continental: OK but not exciting. The lift is a big bonus. We also liked the Laguna Blu restaurant opposite: unpretentious but the food was good, price reasonable and the staff well above average for efficiency and friendliness.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Malgard", "date": "April 30, 2006", "id": 5020440}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic hotel and location", "text": "Have just got back from celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Venice at this hotel. Both the hotel and Venice were fantastic! Location of hotel was brilliant two minutes walk from St Mark's Square and five minutes from the Rialto bridge. Accommodation and hotel were spotlessly clean and staff were superb. Booked water taxi through reception for return journey to airport and they were cheaper than the agents - direct water bus cost 50 euros and water taxi cost 80 euros, worth the extra 30 euros! Visited on St Mark's Day and hotel even gave my wife a red rose in celebration! Best times to visit St Mark's Square is before 10.30am because of day trippers but don't miss St Mark's Square at night - very romantic as lit by hundreds of little lights!
