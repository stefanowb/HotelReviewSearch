The lobby was large and very nice, the elevator was fast and the rooms were quiet. The hotel had many amenities that most Italian hotels don't. It had a swimming pool and a washer and dryer available for guest use on the 7th floor for 3 Euro a wash and 3 Euro for a dry which was great for us traveling for 2 weeks with only carry on bags. The room was large and spacious and very new and clean. The bathroom was also a great size. Their breakfast buffet was simply amazing. It had eggs you could boil, waffles to make with toppings, a large selection of fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, bread, dried fruit and some hot dishes as well like sausage etc. It was the best breakfast at a hotel I have ever seen. The onsite restaurant seemed lovely but was pretty pricey, we preferred to eat at local restaurant in the city center. The only small drawback was it is not really centrally located. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the center of town and the train station is 30-40 minutes, basically on the opposite side of town, but all the positives definitely override that. The front desk staff said a taxi to the train station would be 15-17 Euro. The hotel was also about 20 minute walk from the bus station. Overall this hotel was superb and I would gladly stay here again and recommend it to anyone.", "title": "Amazing Hotel for an Amazing Price, Not Centrally Located", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "aburton2", "date": "October 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 119055067}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Five nights stayed at this hotel.", "title": "I had a great stay - Business Trip", "user": "toddydec", "date": "October 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118845268}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Good points - Location was good 20 minute walk to Town Centre, 10 minute walk to some nice resturants.

The location isn't to far from the center of Lecce, where all the sites are. It's in a good location to drive to the beach for the afternoon as well. The service at the Cube restaurant was nice, but they could have turned down the lights in the evening inside so it wasn't so bright while dining. The staff was amazing, a couple came in and wanted to sit outside and they moved a table from the inside to the outside because all the outside tables were taken. Excellent service!!! Also, we stayed on the 6th floor and it would have been nice to have chairs and a table to enjoy the outside. There is a huge patio off the room but nowhere to sit. Very quick to service our needs and a FABULOUS pool on the 7th floor where the spa is located. It has a panoramic view and is geared more or less to adults relaxing vs. getting crazy with the kids. Overall a nice place to stay when you are missing a bit of your American comforts. They even have coffee in the room!!!!
