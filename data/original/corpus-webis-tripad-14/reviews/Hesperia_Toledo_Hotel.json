It is an excellent hotel, small (only 35 bedrooms) quiet, beautifully decorated throughout, very modern yet very spanish. Our room was clean and comfortable, the bedsheets were turned down every day(with a chocolate left on the edge of the bed!). The breakfast menu had more than enough choices to suit everyone and was delicious. Every one of the staff were polite and helpful although, apart from reception, had very little english. (But, why go to Spain if you're not going to practice the language!) The hotel is situated opposite the bull ring, so don't be there on a Sunday if you don't approve! It's just a 5 minute walk to the park where they have a Tuesday Market and another couple of minutes to the old city walls.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 21, 2005", "id": 3689534}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice hotel", "text": "It's quite a steep walk up into the old city or you can catch a bus from outside the hotel.

We were fortunate to get a parking space right by the front door and the rental car did not move until we left. The entire hotel is floored in gorgeous marble. The public areas and WC's are beautiful. The large, modern rooms have been added to the rear of wonderful historic building with beautiful stained glass ceilings. The rooms are spacious, clean, quiet and well-equipped. The AC chilled the rooms more than adequately. The breakfast was very generous and varied. It is about a 15 minute walk slightly up hill to the old city, or a brief cab ride. My only complaint is that there was a fee for internet/computer usage. After several unsuccessful attempts at using that service, I asked for my euros back.", "user": "beekay458", "date": "July 11, 2007", "id": 8103598}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We just got back from a 2 week trip to Spain and had a rental car much of that time. We were looking for a place in Toledo where we could park the car and walk to everything. The Hesperia fit the bill. I don't think there was an extra charge for the parking either. There are not alot of spaces out front, but if we had not been able to find one, they told us at the front desk they have alternate spots elsewhere. About the walk-- it is about a 7 minute walk to the wall of the old city, then a climb up sometimes steep serpentine streets to the cathedral and other sites. so if you don't have a good fitness level, this would not be for you. We liked the Hesperia. The room was large by European standards and clean too. The staff was pleasant and responsive and they give you a decent map of the old city which you definately need. . A bar/cafe adjacent to the hotel serves lunch and dinner and the hotel offers breakfast. We hiked up the hill into Toledo for an outside cafe breakfast instead. One note if you are driving, it is across from the Plaza de Toros, so look for signs for the Plaza de Toros. There has been some construction on the roads right near the hotel and the directions on the hotel website from the south no longer make sense. Still, knowing it was near the bullring we were able to find it with no problem.", "title": "very nice hotel in Toledo-dump your rental car and walk!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "PattyPhiladelphia", "date": "March 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7202017, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 clean and comfortable, free parking , walk to tourist sites", "disliked": "\u2014 our room was on the parking lot, but even that was ok."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the Hesperia Toledo for two nights in July 2006 during a horrific heat wave. I am sure we would have enjoyed our stay a great deal more if it wasn't for the constant 100 degree days. On booking, I thought the short walk uphill into the old city would be a \"piece of cake\" for two work out fanatics like my wife and I, and I thought we would avoid the hordes of tourists this way. Hah! It turned out to be a hot and sweaty uphill climb into the old city and Toledo itself was quite quiet towards late afternoon and into the evening. On further thought, I should have booked a hotel in the old city. Yet, I felt solace in the 56 euros per night I was paying. The hotel itself is rather beautiful, in what seems to be a renovated, stylish edifice in the Iberian style. The floors are all tiled which caused some consternation as the maids in the morning wheeled their carts along the floor. The staff is young, but helpful in an unsophisticated manner. The room itself was quite lovely with a seperate sitting area. Unfortunately, the sitting area contained the T.V., and thus you could not watch television in bed. The floors in the room were also tiled and the bed was reasonably comfortable. There was a safe and good storage for erverything. The bathroom was large and well lit, but the towels could have been thicker and we could have used more of them. The soap posed another problem. It might have been great glycerin soap, but after one person used it, the soap was gone, and we found ourselves constantly asking for additional \"pieces\" of soap. In addition, the air-conditioning system had a difficult time combating the accelerating temperatures. There is a great grocery store directly behind the hotel where we bought our water, cheeses, and wine at a very reasonable price. The Hesperia Toledo Hotel is a very nice hotel particularly at 56 euros a night. Yet, with the heat wave in July, and the uphill climb into the old city which we did at least twice a day, my wife and I would have probably opted for a hotel in the old city.", "title": "Great - Except for the heat wave and walk!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "enofile1", "date": "July 22, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 5496851, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The building itself was lovely.", "disliked": "\u2014 It is far from the old city in the heat of summer."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "This hotel is a good blend of an historic building, which houses the reception and dining areas, and attractive and comfortable modern rooms.
