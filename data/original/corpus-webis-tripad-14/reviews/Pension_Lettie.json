She loved that I gave her a magnet of our home city and said she collects them. I would definitely recommend Lettie's place and will stay there again if we return to this charming town. The city is so nice, our favorite of the five German (small) towns we visited. Did Rick Steves' suggested town walk, which was had great views of the Rhine and town from the vineyards above. Ate at the wine restaurant. The wine was not so great. Went to what we think is the only bar in town. Had a nice chat with a local guy who's well traveled, and a couple from England. Enjoyed small Bacharach very well. Oh, best Italian meal we had was at the Italian place on the main street. Has a round sign that says \"Pizza\". Had a language barrier, but had a wonderful meal.
