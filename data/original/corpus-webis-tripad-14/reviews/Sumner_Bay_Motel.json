It is right near the beach at Sumner ( about 15 min drive from the city) It was worth the drive out. Beautiful new split level one bedroom apartment with a king size bed ( bliss after the double we had had everywhere else) and a double sofa upstairs for our 13 yr old.A fold up cot, high chair and toys were available free of charge for our baby. The self contained kitchen even stocked plunger coffee. There is a night and day right across the road and a fish & chip shop that fed 4 of us for $9. Wow. I wish we had been able to stay there for a week.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Kwaussie", "date": "September 30, 2004", "id": 2609121}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Good quality motel.

The unit was very tidy, but on inspection the level of 'cleanliness' was questionable. Long hairs in the bedding, dirty looking knives, bedside light not working, and only 2 thin bath towels per day. It is always a nice touch to have an extra clean towel available in a unit, and some flannels. Unfortunately we also had to contend with hours worst of noisy maintenance right outside our unit. Understand that maintenance is required, but it was so noisy and prolonged. Not good after previous late night! The people at check-out were friendly and professional. Nice touches were the milk in the fridge and 2 chocos.", "title": "average motel stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jane86", "date": "February 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 97381224}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We chose this motel for a one night stay as did not want to be in the city and thought the beach be a nice loaction with our 18mth daughter. Motel is nice and modern, and all you need, however we probably would not stay again with a young child in the 1 bedroom due to space. We in general put her to bed in our room when away and then move to the lounge when it is time for us to go to bed, but there was really no room for the port a cot in the bedroom, so meant we too had to go to bed at 7pm so she could sleep in the lounge...and no tv in the bedroom, so it was a matter of reading books and an early night.
