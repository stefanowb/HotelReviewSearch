We went from San Diego to San Francisco over 12 days and this was the most we paid for an overnight stay, and by far the hotel we were the most disappointed with. The ice machine was dirty, chicken bones on the floor next to it, big fresh stain on the couch in our room, carpets are very worn. Hotel is not located in a scenic area by any means...reminder in the room to make sure your vehicle was securely locked. Management took my complaint very nicely, and told me he would like to look into the 3 issues we had and he would call me back. After a week, I decided not to let it go and called him back. He apologized for me having to call back, but said he had a note somewhere to get back to me. He told me he had indeed validated each of my concerns and promptly addressed the ice machine, which needed to be shut down immediately and serviced. We worked out compensation for our stay, but that is not really the objective. Would have much rather had a pleasant experience to begin with. If we were staying in this area again, I would definitely stay in Santa Barbara instead.", "title": "Dirty ice machine, stains on couch, very expensive", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "QBT", "date": "July 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 133684950}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love Carpenteria", "text": "The hotel was nice, but I liked Carpenteria even more.

We had 2 different rooms b/c our first was a handicapped room which we did not need/ask for. Plus it was VERY worn with shabbily completed repairs here and there and a TV with malfunctioning volume. Our 2nd room was not much better. This property has not been updated/remodeled as HI Express advertises and needs some attention ASAP. I also did not like that the outside doors were unlocked until 11/12 at night. If I would have known, I would have spent more and stayed in Santa Barbara to have the nice vacation relaxing feel continue. Definitely not a place to get comfy in.
