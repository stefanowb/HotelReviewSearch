Simply put, it is an exquisite hotel in an exquisite place. Perched atop a hill and accessible only by boat, the hotel exudes Raj-era ambience and boasts the finest views of Periyar Lake and the wildlife sanctuary. We stayed in the north end room (by far the best room---request it if at all possible), and had spectacular views right from our window---we saw wild boar, sambhar deer, brilliant blue kingfishers---all while we sipped tea from our veranda at breakfast. The hotel has only six rooms, so it's always quiet, and at night we could hear the lilting nocturnal calls of hundreds of different birds. Come morning, the ever-helpful staff booked us on guided treks through the sanctuary---we spent a whole day bamboo rafting and hiking with born-and-bred Periyar guides, and we saw tiger tracks, nilgiri langurs, giant squirrels, and a stampede of wild bison from less than 50 feet away. We returned to the hotel tired, elated, and starving---so the cook, who quickly became a friend, prepared us an amazing meal of ginger chicken, chapati, and Keralan beetroot curry. I have never eaten so well in my life. The only downside was poor water pressure in the shower; I'd also advise travelers to bring lots of insect repellent, sunscreen, and binoculars.
