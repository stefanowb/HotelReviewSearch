We loved Modica and the Hotel Relais. We had a very large room and it was very private. We were close to the terrace which has magnificent views of Modica. We ran into some car trouble and the hotel owner was invaluable to us - so helpful. The staff was friendly and so welcoming. Be aware there are a number of stairs to climb but it is well worth it. Modica is a wonderful place to stay and explore Ragusa, Nota, Modica, and the marina areas. I would recommed Modica and the surrounding area as a must see for any travellers to Sicily.

He makes you feel like your apart of his family and goes to great lengths to make sure you're taken care of while at his hotel. He speaks 6 languages which was extremely impressive. There are a lot of stairs to reach the hotel but well worth the trek.

From our window we saw the town lit up at night and heard church bells in the early morning.
