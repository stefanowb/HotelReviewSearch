Would definately go back but would love a room with a sea view next time. Great location for relaxing walks along the beach no matter what the weather with the local town within easy access. Will go back in the summer hopefully to make the most of the beach. Full cooked breakfast is a must with fresh hot food with plenty choice, the porridge is lovely.
