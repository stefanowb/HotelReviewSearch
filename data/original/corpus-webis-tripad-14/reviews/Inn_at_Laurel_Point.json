The motel is equivalent to a Motel 6 with a fancy lobby and exorbitant prices. I stayed in the fancy new South wing of the motel in a \"deluxe\" room. The most significant problem is the noise. I have traveled a lot and have never stayed in a motel as noisy as the Laurel Point. The plumbing makes continuous, loud noises all night long, and I mean loud. The walls are very thin and you can easily hear anything going on in adjacent rooms or in the hallway. To top it off the Laurel point allows the bar to stay open until about 11:00 at night playing terrible but very loud music.
