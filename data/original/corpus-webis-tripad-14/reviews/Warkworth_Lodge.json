What a lovely surprise when we arrived and saw our studio. This was very nice with small kitchen,table chairs for eating. Chairs for relaxing,good shower and most importantly good bed.We were the inside end unit of Studios ( see Photo ) Even had chairs outside to have a glass of wine in the evening. So I was surprised to read other reviews.Re noise etc. ( we are not use to noise at home ) so quite sensitive to it.No problems at all. We were amazed how nice inside the main house was. Quite upmarket the lounge area.( free Internet PC.) Nice big kitchen with all equipment / utensils to cook plus plenty of crockery and glasses. I thought the next building down towards the road is a Police station. ( me thinking good for security ) Another reviewer said rooms for the lodge ?", "title": "Lovely Surprise", "user": "Barry-Jang", "date": "June 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 163058014}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled solo", "text": "Warkworth is a good place to see all the surrounding area.

It's a big old house, with creaky floor boards and high ceilings. It feels more like a home that a hotel, with a very large living room, where you can laze around on the big sofas or pop outside to the swimming pool area (more a pop in pool than length bashing). There is a big kitchen, so you can cook your own food if that grabs you or make yourself a cup of tea. It's homely in nature and has the air of a faded beauty.", "user": "sfh36", "date": "March 8, 2013", "id": 153992374}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013", "text": "The room was petite but big enough for a bed and couple of armchairs.
