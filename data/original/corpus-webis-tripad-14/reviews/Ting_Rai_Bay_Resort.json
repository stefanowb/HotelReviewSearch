We had two days here and worried we would be bored but we weren't ready to leave after our 48 hours. Yes, fairly basic - though reflected in the price and it was all clean and perfectly pleasant - but as long as you are happy to just sit on the beach and listen to the sea this place is great. Ting rai is on a smallish section of beach which keeps it quiet. The longer beach further south would be worth a visit I'm sure but we just relaxed locally. The food was lovely - best green curry of my trip. Very pleasant hosts.", "title": "Absolute island (basic) bliss", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "AlYorks", "date": "January 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6572821, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Peace and quiet", "disliked": "\u2014 all good given we were only there two days"}}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Koh Jum"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 4, "very good": 25, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 41}, "aka": "Ting Rai Bay Hotel Koh Jum", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Ting Rai offers a variety of Deluxe Bungalows which are spacious and comfortable enough for couples and families.
