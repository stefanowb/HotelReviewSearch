Also, not a hip part of town restaurant-wise, but definitely recommend Zinc Caius restaurant a few blocks away (excellent food and wine pairings!) as well as the chocolate patissierie down the street (delicious pain du chocolate for 2 Euros!).

If you don\u2019t \u2013 and you have to stay in a standard room, it\u2019s not worth as much as they charge you for. We were lucky in the end \u2013 seems like many are not\u2026.", "title": "Clean and Comfortable", "user": "amagangan", "date": "April 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 15063383}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled on business", "text": "At least once a year I stay at Le Meridien Etoile, an once I stayed at the Montparnasse, so I must come to the defence of a good old faithful, that has everything a city-centre hotel should have and more..", "title": "Le Meridien - what a joke!!", "user": "JulieJames", "date": "April 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 15053722, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Flat screen tv", "disliked": "\u2014 the hotel bedroom"}}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Paris"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 190, "average": 486, "very good": 769, "terrible": 91, "excellent": 333}, "aka": "Le Meridien Etoile Hotel Paris", "slim_ranking": 0.474623535973, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.0}, "description": "Situated on the Right-Bank, Le M\u00e9ridien Etoile is strategically located to appeal to business travelers and art-lovers alike as it faces the Paris Convention Centre, is steps away from the legendary Champs-Elys\u00e9es and close to La D\u00e9fense.The sophisticated 1,025 guestrooms include 21 suites and renovated Executive rooms.
