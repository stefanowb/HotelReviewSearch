However, given the prices in Melbourne for hotels, the price for a married couple and their two adult children was better than most, so we took a breath and booked an apartment. We are very glad we did. Check in was efficient and well handled, even though we arrived at about 10 AM after a 30 hour travel time from the US. The location is great, literally around the corner from the free City Circle Line Tram stop. The apartment was larger than expected very clean and well appointed. We had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, washer/dryer, fully equiped kitchen, dining area and living area with floor-to-ceiling windows that had a wonderful view of the city and the river bank, and a balcony (albeit small). Everything was very clean. Towels were replaced, the apartment was tidied, garbage emptied every day. The front desk was very polite and helpful, and even helped to arrange transportation back to the airport for 4 AM. There are a couple of bars across the lane but they presented no problem, either noise wise (perhaps being on the 15th floor helped?) or any other way. Restaurant prices were expensive by US Standards, so we were very happy to be directed to a Coles Supermarket that was within easy walking distance. The only \"quibbles\" were the charge for internet (paid per 24 hours) and the $25/day fee for parking the rental car. Otherwise, we had no complaints about this establishment, and if in Melboiurne again would definitely stay here if it were available.", "title": "Great self-service apartment in Melbourne", "user": "Mrs-K-albany", "date": "May 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 65792295}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This accommodation ranks with the worst I have ever experienced. The name of the accommodation is Riverview, there is no river view, there are no windows in the bedroom, it was like living in a bunker. Very claustrophobic. We were expecting a 5 night celebratory Easter Break for my birthday. The only window that opened did so for only 6 inches. It overlooked Highlander Lane which was the place of choice, it seems, for the patrons of the surrounding clubs to use as an accessory toilet. There was a lot of noisy vomiting and a lot of shouting and fighting throughout the early hours, we were constantly woken. The mornings would find young street people rummaging through the plant holders for remnants of alcohol in discarded cans and bottles. Although its location is handy to a lot of city highlights, iI did not feel safe to walk out at night unaccompanied. We were confronted more than once by groups of loud and excited men outside the nearby strip clubs. There is plenty of other accommodation in Melbourne in the same price bracket and with good location and access to highlights as this one. I regret not being able to check out accommodation before booking. This one simply does not deliver.

I have travelled the world both for business and pleasure and have NEVER felt compelled to check out of a hotel early because I research where I am going to stay extremely well. The reviews of this serviced apartment hotel looked fairly good when we booked it - affordable, mid range, centre of the city, etc. We weren't looking for luxury boutique, but rather something that was comfortable, well maintained, clean and with helpful staff. None of these aspirations could be applied to the Riverside Apartments. In addition, it is located on the doorstep of the city's sex industry. As we walked through this area (which we took a large detour to try and avoid on the way home) the boucers / doorman on all the strip joints were saying \"good evening\" to our 16 year old daughter. OK, this is not the hotels fault, but when we mentioned our unease at this on our return to the hotel when asked by the man on reception how our night had been, we were sneered at by him and told that all doormen at strip joints did this. Hey, we're broad minded people, live in Camden Town in London and see all sorts every day - what I don't expect is to be told by a hotel receptionist that something I wasn't expecting in what we thought was a good hotel in a good area is OK!! The final straw was being woken up at 8am by DRILLING in the building!
