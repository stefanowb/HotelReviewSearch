When going to use the bathroom, the toilet and been used and not flushed. The sink was clogged, the shower was dirty. The beds had one thin blanket and when we pulled off the blanket from the 2nd bed to keep warm there were stains all over it. It was completely disgusting and impossible to keep warm. We would have left that night but it was late and no way of finding out what else might have been available. We left first thing in the morning. In addition as someone else has said, it is well over an hour into Yosemite so it will be about a 2 1/2 hr roundtrip drive.

The web site brochure was extremely misleading!! The riverside view was a joke. You could not even see the \"river\" which actually was no more than a creek from our room. The building had paper thin walls and floors. We could hear the people below us as well as the people next to us. The stairs creaked everytime someone walked up or down them. The motel is located off the main road about a quarter of a mile so you can't see it from the highway. When you drive in the entrance the only buildings that were pictured on the web site brochure were the \"office\" and the two-story building we stayed in. The rest of the place looked like a junk yard. Some buildings were falling apart and there was a couple of trailers near the motel area that made it look like a junk yard. They offered a \"continental breakfast\" up to 10:00 a.m. and when we to get breakfast, they only had one yogurt left and coffee. Everything else was gone. When we asked about the other items we were told \"they ran out\". Our air conditioner (window unit) never got the room quite cool enough even after running for over 8 hours. The web site said only 9 miles from the entrance to Yosemeite but unless you are familiar with the park which being from Florida left us out, it was another hour and a quarter drive to get down into the valley where we were planning on meeting up with some friends that were staying there. It took us over two hours to make the trip from our motel to the valley and back. That was not mentioned anywhere on the web site. I was completely disgusted with the location and the condition of the motel. After one night (we had paid for two nights) we went to talk to the office before 11:00 a.m. to request a refund for the next night or even a partial refund but we were told that they do not give refunds. Even after pointing out all the issues we had with the room, the noise, the odor from the carpet and the distance they would not budge. They said that they rely on reservations to survive because of where they are located and they do not give refunds. I felt cheated by this motel and I would never recommend this place to anyone and would discourage you from staying there. I wish I had seen the other review before we made the reservations!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 24, 2003", "id": 1148005}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Don't Trust the Brochure", "text": "I made reservations for a May-June 2003 stay with my wife based on Yosemite Riverside Inn's (Groveland) website and a recommendation from another website devoted to lodging in and around Yosemite National Park. We thought we were going to an inn situated in a 'park-like setting.' What we found, instead, was a collection of buildings, some in OK shape, but others in evident disrepair, with a couple of old house trailers on the property. We thought we'd get a quiet, cozy cabin. What we got was a premium-priced 'riverview' cabin (probably built in the 1940s and consisting of two rental units) that, while thoughtfully refurbished with new kitchen, bath, and paneling, was not level--and had no river view). It was like being in a slightly listing ship (I kept thinking of the Titanic while there). The window screens were torn, so, with mosquitoes in force, the windows could not be safely opened. On top of that we had ant problems and the place had the odor of insecticide. There seemed no soundproofing between our unit and the adjoining one, so instead of sound of the river, we heard our neighbor's noisy air conditioning unit, bathroom noises, etc. etc. Unfortunately, the owner-managers were not particularly up-front about these 'features.' When making reservations, I had asked if there were any issues at all with the accommodations and was told there were none. The cancellation policy was not customer-friendly. We will not stay there again. A warning to other Yosemite visitors: In an area where demand often outstrips supply, much lodging possessing good website brochures are places that saw better times many years ago.
