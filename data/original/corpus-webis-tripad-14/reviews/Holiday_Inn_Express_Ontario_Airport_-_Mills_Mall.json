We had 2 queen beds, with lots of pillows and nice white bedding. There was a piece of furniture across from the closet that doubled as a seat and also as storage, with a huge drawer underneath. The closet had a mirrored door, which was a nice touch. The room had an armoir with tv and drawers underneath. A frig and microwave unit, which was great. We used the frig a lot! There was a desk, and a chair. The tv had many stations, we had no trouble finding something to watch. The beds were comfortable, but the pillows too stiff for our liking. We were too tired to call and ask for any others, but I am sure we could have. The walls are a little thin, and we could hear our neighbors, both above us and beside us. The people next to us were up kind of late, and that was slightly annoying, but not the hotels fault.", "title": "Large, beautiful room, great amenities - nice, new hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ceeshel", "date": "May 22, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5188805}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Rancho Cucamonga"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 6, "very good": 20, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 32}, "aka": "Holiday Inn Express Ontario Airport - Mills Mall Hotel Rancho Cucamonga", "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667, "description": "Welcome to The Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Rancho Cucamonga.
