The rooms are styled in contemporary fashion with good sied bathrooms. The service is quiet and friendly and the food lovely. The seven course taster is well worth trying but though portions are not huge as it is a taster menu, by the end you will feel you have over eaten!! It is possible tto walk into Lampeter from the hotel and it is a typical little country town. There is some lovely countryside to be seen in the area and a visit to Narbeth is a must, stopping to see the Colby Woodland Gardens en route.", "title": "Olde world charm with contemporary style", "user": "suewWiltshire", "date": "March 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126345613}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Check in was 3pm.
