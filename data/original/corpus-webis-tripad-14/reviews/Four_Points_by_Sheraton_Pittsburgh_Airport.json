The newer-looking Amana wall unit for heating and AC produces the same ambient noise level as a vacuum cleaner running in the room. You'd probably adapt if the fan would run all the time, but whether I selected \"on\" or \"auto\" it cycled every 15 minutes or so. And when it did it was loud enough to drown out normal TV volume or phone calls. I'd realize my ears were ringing when it shut itself off. Most people wouldn't be able to sleep through it. And the window didn't open. With an outside temp in the 60's and low 70's during my stay, I was OK by cooling the room and then shutting it off, but I couldn't imagine staying here in the summer when this approach wouldn't work.
