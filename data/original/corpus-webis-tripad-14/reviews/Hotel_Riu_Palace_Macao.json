Upon arrival the hotel is beautiful and the staff was very friendly. We had a beautiful room \u2013 Room 3340 on the top floor. The first three nights we had no air conditioning, this was eventually fixed. The next day in a half there was no hot water or water pressure. I asked what the problem was at the desk. The receptionist explained that they are building a new Riu hotel and are transferring the water to that hotel. I asked what about the people here and he said it will only be for a little while. This lasted a day and a half. We made the best of our trip. The food was good and the beach is beautiful. Every morning we were out of our room by 8:30 and got a spot on the beach. On our last full day there, we decided to relax and get up a little later. I got up while my friend slept and went down to get beach towels at about 8:45. By the time I got back in a 15 -20 minute time frame, someone with a key went into our room while my friend was sleeping and took the jewelry which was left on the dresser. When I left, the door was locked and the \u201cDO NOT DISTURB\u201d sign was on the door knob. We immediately told the hotel manager who then came to the room with security and searched the room. Our safe was locked, the person who came into the room used a key and only took the jewelry on the dresser. The management questioned the hotel staff on our floor and they said they know nothing, how surprising is that! The management told us we have to go to the police station and make a report. After waiting two hours, the police said they could not make a report, because \u201ca key\u201d was used to get into the room and it was the hotel\u2019s responsibility to take action. We got nowhere with the hotel, when we requested a report of what happened, the management kept wanted to give us a free 7-night stay at any of the Carribean Riu\u2019s in a years time frame. It was like wheeling and dealing with a salesman to get the report. Everytime we asked for it, they want to give the trip, this paper also states that you are satisfied with how the hotel handled your inconvenience and that they are not held responsible for what happened if you take the 7-night stay. Finally after much hesitation from the manager he supplied us with a report of what happened. We have traveled to Punta Cana twice before and stayed at Iberostar Bavaro had a wonderful relaxing vacation. This trip started off good and wound up to be a nightmare. I would have never thought that by leaving the room with the \u201cDO NOT DISTURB\u201d sign and the door locked for such a short amount of time how your life changes.

We were perfectly safe as this is a solidly built traditional hotel. Debris, trees and other damage was obvious, but the hotel suffered no severe structural damage. We had power outages, no phones,no TV, and computer down time. The hotel had emergency generator so food, drinks, lights etc. were available fairly soon and the staff did all they could to help. Room service was curtailed (no maid service for 2 days). The most common concern for guests was lack of \"who is in charge?\"(hotel management here was somewhat remiss in keeping everyone informed),....and lack of Tour Operator presence. As An Agt I can probably explain that most Tour Ops on duty are \"local\" people and very likely could not get in, plus they have to visit and coordinate with several resorts.

Overall comments at the resort were that the Staffs were doing all the could to help guests. But again, lack of Tour Op presence was a concern. Secrets Excellence resort suffered water damage and because of its location, guests were helicoptered out to the airport by Sat because of the flooded roads, for return to the USA. We had a Cleveland destination and were taken by tractor/trailer to the tour buses to dry land, and then bussed to the airport for flts out on Sat 18th Sept. As primitive as this sounds, I have to say that Staff/Tour Ops did what they could to make sure everyone was picked up safely and taken out. It is a point to remember that late Summer to end of November is Hurricane Season in the Caribbean and of course, risky for a vacation albeit a good price! We take our chances!

The hotel manager told my husband he wanted to make sure we were satisfied because it is important to them that we were. He assured the manager we were fine and the choice not to move was ours. How much time do you spend in your room? The next night, another bottle of champagne! We will definitely go back again!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 18, 2004", "id": 2076611}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "First Class Resort", "text": "My husband and I took a quick trip (4 nights) sans kids to the Palace. We read every review prior to going. I can't substantiate any of the complaints we read , maybe it was simply the spring break timing. We were there May 10-14th. The Palace was spotless, the grounds beautiful, our room was upgraded to a beautiful suite with a huge balcony complete with rockers, the service was excellent, and the staff was charming. If you could mutter a few words of spanish, it would be to your advantage!! This was our second trip to Punta Cana, so we knew the European factor was going to be there. The German and French tourists are cold, arrogant, and would prefer to look the other way rather than say Hello. Watch the buffet lines, they don't understand the word \"line\". To them it means jump in anywhere (in front of you) to get what they want. They don't want to wait for you, but you can wait for them!! (the food was fine, no illnesses to report and the selection was plentiful)The clientele was most definitely older, but this was fine as we are in our mid 40's, and don't look for the party places. There were people in their 70's, and a few 80's. Bottom line: the Palace is beautiful, and if we ever went back to the DR, we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Some reviewers left a hint about taking the singles, and small bills. Best advice yet. Small tips really make a difference to these people. It really made my day to give them a tip. I don't think it happens often.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "cruzr4ever", "date": "May 15, 2004", "id": 2062108}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I'm going back!", "text": "The Riu Palace was great. My wife and I who are both in our early 30's went for a 3 night long weekend. What we found was friendly people both guests and staff, good food-not fantastic but very good, cold drinks, plenty of sun, plenty of activities, awsome beach, nice pool, beutiful grounds and rooms. I really believe that anyone can find a reason to complain, but we found nothing to complain about the entire trip. Now if your looking for a wild party then go to Cancun. If you just want to have a relaxing vacation where everything is at your fingertips Putna Cana is for you. We spent most of our days at the Riu Bambu. They had activities geared toward a slightly younger crowd and a great swim-up bar. We met several nice couples from all over the US, Canada, France, and Germany.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "blacktie", "date": "May 4, 2004", "id": 1869525}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 94, "average": 182, "very good": 491, "terrible": 67, "excellent": 799}, "aka": "Riu Palace Macao Hotel Punta Cana", "slim_ranking": 0.227722772277, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Located on Arena Gorda Beach in Punta Cana.
