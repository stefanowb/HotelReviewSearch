Unfortunately, I\u2019ve slept in a sleeping bag on a rocky ground that was more comfortable! I think this mattress was made early in the last century!! Our son even asked how much we paid for this room. The room was clean enough that I did not have to keep one eye open for crawlers, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered with the condition of the beds. Although, I don\u2019t think I would have allowed anyone to sleep on the floor.
