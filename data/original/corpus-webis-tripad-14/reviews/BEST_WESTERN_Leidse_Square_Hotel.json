The location and exterior of the hotel I can't fault at all. If you don't plan on spending 'quality' time in your hotel, this is the place for you. Our room was larger than I am used to in European city hotels, with a predictably small but clean and functional bathroom with a frankly lovely shower over a good sized bath.The sheets weren't changed during our stay but the bed was turned down and towels changed so this is fine. Breakfast was good enough with nice quality food but the Sunday morning was crazy! I recommend getting in there early to avoid the rabble of students and families all cramming around the toast machine, we went down at 10am when the breakfast ends at 10.30 so that was our mistake!! The hotel interior itself is tired and old which is a shame and the reception desk had a multitude of different staff, some very helpful with letting us borrow an umbrella to some with barely any English who seemed reluctant to give us our key. Which brings me to another flaw - you drop your key off on your way out and buzz to get back in and ask for your key. Very odd I thought, not sure if they have a lot of people running off without paying or something!! Another thing to be aware of it is on the face of it, we thought the hotel was quiet but quickly realised that the soundproofing between floors is not great (leading us to think a family of elephants had rented the room above us!) and the sheer multitude of students and groups means a bit too much running around and laughing in the corridors at 4 in the morning for my liking. Not sure who on earth uses the frankly pointless bar next to reception when you are on the doorstep of so many great brown bars, clubs and pubs - the only people seemed to be a group of the hotel staffs friends who were all middle-aged men.", "title": "Ok, probably wouldn't stay here for a personal vacation", "user": "AmericaninRome13", "date": "February 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 55038296}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "All in all, a great base to discover Amsterdam if don't expect the Ritz.
