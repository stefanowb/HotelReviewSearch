Initially we were trying to find another hostel, but it had closed, and a local pointed us in the direction of Las Palmas. We checked out the dorms which weren't too inspiring, but were then shown a room which was lovely! Bright, clean, nice bed, TV, air con and a private bathroom. All for 360 pesos (about \u00a318) which was much less than other hotels in Cancun downtown.", "title": "Nice little hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Beckiboo1983", "date": "February 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 124537481}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Solid, non-party hostel", "text": "I think the room we had was part of a new block they have downstairs, these rooms are definitely brighter than the ones upstairs, and more private too.", "user": "zlo", "date": "December 11, 2010", "id": 89614101}], "location": {"country": "Mexico", "region": "Yucatan Peninsula"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 2, "very good": 8, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 0.55}
