When we checked into the one bedroom villa that we initially book, we found renovations going on in units on each side. No problem, we saw the manager, Jonathan, and before you could say low country crab cakes...we were upgraded to a wonderful 3 bedroom villa at their Beach Club, which couldn't have made us happier! The villa had outstanding views of the ocean and the whole resort was peaceful and relaxing. I would not hesistate to spend time here with friends and family. It is for all age groups with plenty of activities on the Island.

One other complaint was the fact that you had to use your room key to operate the elevators, yet you did not need a key at all to open the doors if you walked up the steps to access the building. Using the key to operate the elevators was a bit over the top in my opinion and downright a pain in the butt. Other than that, there were no complaints.
