It is a couple of blocks from the train station - an easy walk, even lugging big suitcases, and is in an ideal central location for shopping, sight-seeing, restaurants, people-watching, etc. The busy street, Via Independenza, is on one side of the hotel and a big serene park is on the other side (the quiet side) of the hotel. Our room was on the street side, and was a bit noisy, but not too bad; I enjoyed watching the beautiful Italians on the street below. The hotel is clean, has beautiful decor, exceptionally helpful staff, large bathrooms and big comfortable beds. I would definitely stay here again. The room price was very reasonable, but I do caution against ordering room service or eating the breakfast buffet. Although the service and the food was excellent, the prices were extraordinarily high. My friend and I arrived at the hotel on a very hot day and thought a cold beer in our room was a great idea. We just ordered it without checking prices and it ended up costing 24 Euros for 2 beers...ridiculous! In the morning we went for the breakfast buffet, assuming it was included in our room price, but after breakfast we were given a surprise bill of 30 Euros.

Sadly the room we had did not meet expectations. The street noise was unacceptable day and night - some sound proofing on the windows is required. The Aircon was very annoying - if you left it on at night it kept switching itself on and then off quite loudly and was impossible to control. The shower in our room was a pokey plastic unit that was very cheap and annoying to use - not sure why they chose this option as the rest of the bathroom had expensive fixtures and fittings. Lastly, I couldn't figure out why the bed was so uncomfortable to sleep in and finally I pulled the bottom sheet off to find a PLASTIC matress protector sheet on the matress. I hope they don't use these in all the rooms, and hope it was mistakenly put on our bed as it is not acceptable in the August heat of Bologna to have to put up with this in a top hotel.

The immediate impression given by the hotel is positive - the reception is sharp and efficient and the appearance smart. Our room rather disappointed, however; I accept that the style - white, clean,simple lines - is a matter of taste and therefore cannot condemn it on that basis, but we were not impressed by the facilities it offered. There was inadequate storage - the open, drawerless wardrobe felt like student accommodation. The desk was similar to a student workbench and taken up with the noisy minibar. The en suite was small, the shower felt like a cheap plastic moulding and we had a metal pillar rising up about 35cm from the front of the toilet, a design I have seen nowhere else in the world. The wifi was free and very good. Breakfast at 15 euros was a tad expensive but the quality was good and we used it three times out of four.
