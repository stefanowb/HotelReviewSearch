It made shopping and walking to popular tourist sites (Grand Via, Sol, Palace, etc.) very convenient. The hotel was very clean and modern. The breakfast buffet was quite nice and was a step above continental, although I wish the food options would have changed just a bit from day to day. The room was small, but quite normal as most standard rooms in Europe are smaller than in the USA; however it was clean with modern furnishings and an updated bathroom. The elevators were quite small and very oddly shaped. One elevator was in the shape of a triangle which made traveling with a lot of luggage very difficult. I am not sure how they accommodate people with disabilities and I recommend the stairs for people that are claustrophobic. With that being said, the major drawback in my opinion was the heating/air conditioning system. At the time we visited Madrid, it was colder than usual (12-17C) and the heating system had been shut off to run the air. Therefore, we froze for the 3 nights we were there. It didn't warm up in Madrid until the 4th day and we were checking out. But oddly enough, the common areas (hall, lobby, etc) were all warmer than our room.
