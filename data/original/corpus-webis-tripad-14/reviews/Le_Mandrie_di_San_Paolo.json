We were greeted by Andrea whose family owns the farm. He speaks very good English and is very helpful. He seems to work from early morning to late evening, often acting as server in the dining room at dinner. The rooms are spacious, spotless, comfortable, and look out over the entire valley. The food was excellent, with breakfast treats and an evening menu which is varied and delicious. The only down side is the difficulty in finding the agritourismo and the steep hillside on which it is perched. They have just added a very modern pool facility and run a first class operation.", "title": "Great place to relax", "user": "india1939", "date": "May 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 106982832}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Traveled from Canada and arrived late afternoon we were received with a very warm", "title": "HIDDEN GEM", "user": "Rinaldi_F", "date": "October 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 85100159}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "welcome and had the pleasure to have a bigger room than what we had booked.", "title": "Awesome Experience", "user": "JoshuaAllen", "date": "October 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 84747611}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Umbria", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 2, "very good": 30, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 219}, "slim_ranking": 0.0266666666667, "description": "Le Mandrie Di San Paolo offers wonderful panoramic views over Assisi and the Umbrian hills and it is located at 700m in the Natural Parc of Subasio.There is a very nice restaurant serving typical regional dishes.The outdoor infinity pool offers a wonderful panoramic views over Assisi and the valley.
