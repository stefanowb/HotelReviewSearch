Every staff member was exceedingly friendly. Room offered tight quarters between desk and bed, so may not be the best for heavy business. Hotel restaurant very good and plenty of room. Quiet area. Only noise came from loud door latching in hallways. Better soundproofing around doors would help. Taxis have to be called as there are none that wait there.
