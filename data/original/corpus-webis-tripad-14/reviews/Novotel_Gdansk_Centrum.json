Booked it on Hotels.com and managed to get a great deal for \u00a380 for the 3 nights for a room with a fridge, sofa, TV and queen size bed. Both the room and bathroom were in pristine condition and were very modern. I have always found that you walk into a beautiful reception and your room just doesn't live upto expectations but here its the other way round. The reception is very out-dated but the staff are lovely and speak great English. The location was also perfect with only a 5 minute walk to the main part of town (it was snowing so it would prob. take even less time normally). This hotel would be great for a drinking holiday as its only a short toddle back to bed after a night out drinking strong Polish beer but would also suit families as the rooms are quite large!", "title": "Great Hotel, Great Location!!!", "user": "charlenedj", "date": "January 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 54084542}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled solo", "text": "Have fun! :)", "title": "OK hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "VacationOslo", "date": "December 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 51508294}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Landed Sunday morning at Gdansk airport and took a taxi to the hotel since is was 50 min wait untill the bus would be there.

Newly refurbished in a modern style with all amenities you need: Flat screen TV, coffee making facilities, litte fridge, safe, air condition etc. The room is simply faboulous and quite big. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom well sized with a good shower. Our room was towards the end of the corridor on 2nd floor, so the noise from the highway wasn't disturbing us as long as we kept the windows closed. A big asset of the hotel is the vicinity to the old town. Its merely just around the corner and this is very convenient. They also have a secured parking lot, but you have to pay for it extra.

Gdansk is very industrial and also very ugly in parts. The old town is beautiful and of course that is what all tourists decide to see when they choose to visit Gdansk, but this hotel does not really have a nice view regardless of which side of the city you overlook from your room. We must have had the short straw when it came to rooms with a view as all we could see from our window were several very high, very ugly blocks of flats painted in some garish shade of orange or brown lining a tributary of the Motlawa river, the dual carriageway through Gdansk to the right of us over a run down looking subway and the roof of the hotel restaurant.
