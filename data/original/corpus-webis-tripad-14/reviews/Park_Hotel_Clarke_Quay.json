Agree rooms on smallish size - could have done with a tad more cupbpoard space but we coped with no problem. Standards of cleanliness first class and daily change of bedding. Pool good and no problem with sunbeds - only thing is the hotel is favoured for weddings and so at weekends may well find the terrace bar is taken over, but you can still use the pool. All staff extremely courteous and helpful. Ate in restaurant one evening food ok but expensive and with so many restaurants and food markets around then you need to get out. Location excellent and easy to get around by taxi bus or MRT. If you come out of hotel lobby turn left and left again you will come to the river. Turn left and under bridge and you get safely (no road to cross!) to Clarke Quay and beyond to Boat Quay if you want, both very lively and noisy, but hotel far enough away to be quiet. If you turn right and follow the river path and under bridge then on right at end of apartment block you will find an excellent place for breakfast -Kith's. Real bacon and leaf tea not tea bags and favoured by the expat wives!

I was surprised that our room did not have free wi fi access although it was available in the lobby area you have to give your laptop to the reception staff to type in the code which seemed a bit strange. Didn't eat here as the food and drink is very expensive (as with a lot of Singapore) however Subway in the mall opposite does a basic breakfast deal for 4 Singapore dollars and there is free tea and coffee in the room. All in all given the prices in general for Singapore we felt we got a fair deal at \u00a360 per room per night. The complimentary shuttle bus is very useful for getting around and saves you a bit of money as will eating out in the many local food stalls and cafes just around the corner or in central Singapore.
