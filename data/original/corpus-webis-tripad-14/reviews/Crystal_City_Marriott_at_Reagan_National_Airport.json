The people at the front desk were nice and that's where the customer service stops. The maids take forever to clean your room but thats because they really clean everything and change the bedding. It takes about an hour to clean a room. Ugh!! The ladies that ran the bar lacked customer service skills as well as the ability to make a decent drink. They handed drinks over the bar to us when we weren't even sitting at the bar but at a table so we had to get up. How Rude!! The buffet in the restaurant was definitely not worth the $18.00.
