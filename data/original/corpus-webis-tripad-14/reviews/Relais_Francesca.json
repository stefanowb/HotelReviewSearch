It's only 5 minutes from the train station, so you can get to the noisier, more touristy regions in a short time. Don't forget to validate your train ticket in the orange boxes before boarding. We had no problems with our room, though a security light outside our door would have been handy to find our door key. The breakfast was similar to other european ones I have experienced, though most of these were at hostels. We did enjoy the homemade cakes/pastries that were provided along with the packaged goods each day, just choose wisely. The piano foreshore was being developed at the time of our stay, so we envisage that piano will be a stunning place to visit in the future. We strongly recommend you walk to town to have dinner at osteria arcadia in corso italia 177. The owner was the friendliest person we met on our trip and cooks the most delicious, honest, fresh and local produce we experienced.
