This was a perfectly clean, quiet, comfortable hotel with a delicious breakfast and staff that was willing to help you with your every need. The bus stops right out front and it is a straight shot into the city center with a short 10 minute ride. The staff recommended an authentic Italian restuarant which was fantastic...just study up on your Italian before going. We would not book anywhere else when travelling to Florence again!", "user": "ucla_kat", "date": "July 22, 2007", "id": 8218216}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great modern hotel....", "text": "I booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. The hotel is very modern, very clean, and not too far away from the city center. And the location is quite possibly the only drawback, if you think a ten minute ride by bus to city center is unthinkable. We didn't have a problem with it and the bus stop is only about half a block down from the hotel. You can even buy bus tickets from the front desk of the hotel. If you would like to take the taxi, from the train station (Sta. Maria Novella) it's about a 15 euro trip going to the hotel and for some reason a 20 euro trip going back to the train station (I think we were hustled out of that return trip) which is supposedly dependent on the number of people and number of luggage that is transported.", "user": "Midinho", "date": "July 17, 2007", "id": 8132227}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Modern Digs in Florence", "text": "We stayed for 4 nights at the Cosmopolitan and loved it. The girls at the front desk were extremely helpful. The room had all the modern amenities, and was impeccably clean. My husband and I compared it to a boutique hotel in New York. The ONLY drawback, is that it's not in the city center, so we took taxis everyday (my husband has a phobia of public transportation) to get back and forth, which were about 12-15 EU each trip. Also, we had a concept suite and the shower was very small, barely enough room to move around, but we managed! Overall, I highly recommend this hotel.", "user": "Georgia_chick", "date": "June 5, 2007", "id": 7772262}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best Hotel I have ever spent the night!", "text": "My partner and I wanted a hotel not too far from the airport, since we were arriving into Florence late, and did not want to mess with a downtown hotel. I booked two nights into the Cosmopolitan Concept Hotel, and I must say it was possibly the nicest hotel I have stayed in. It is very modern and clean. The door key only had to be waved near the door to your room to unlock the door (no more spending minutes trying to figure out how the key works!) How cool! The room, wow! Nice pillow -top beds with very high quality sheets and Duvets. Huge comfy pillows. Flat screen TV with all sorts of option like pay per view movies in English. High quality furniture. And don't get me started on the bathroom! What a luxury! I did not want to leave the bathroom! From marble floor and shower to the really cool sink, which I think is called a \"vessel\" these days. Huge comfy towls with very nice soaps and shampoos. And the hotel staff was wonderful! Very nice and bent over backwords to help. I wanted to wash some clothes since we had been travelling for about ten days already, so I called the front desk. Of course she suggested the hotel laundry service, but I admitted that I did not want to spend that kind of money, since we had a lot of clothes to clean. Sure enough, a few minutes later, she called back, and told me she had located a self service laundrymat within walking distance to the hotel!", "user": "TimHowlin", "date": "April 11, 2007", "id": 7332244}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Clean and Modern", "text": "OK, the hotel is not downtown, or within walking distance to everything. But we took a bus, there is a stop right in front of the hotel, and it drops you right off in front of the main train station ten minutes later. It could not have been easier!
