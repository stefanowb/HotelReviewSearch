The location was excellent, situated on the V&A waterfront. The apartments are 2 minutes walk from the two oceans aquarium, which is great for picking up the hop on hop off bus (which I would recommend as a way to get around Cape Town as it takes you to Table Mountain and Kirstenbosch gardens. It is cheaper to buy in advance). The apartments have a bedroom, bathroom, living area, kitchen and balcony. They are well decorated and very clean. The kitchen has a cooker, hob, washing machine, tumble dryer, ironing board and iron, dishwasher and basic crockery (e.g. pans, plates etc). There is a Pick and Pay (supermarket) in the V&A shopping mall and a nice food hall on the waterfront. We bought food from the supermarket and had a cooked breakfast on the balcony every morning and made sandwiches for our day trips. The washing machine was great for catching up on our washing before our next travels. Everyday a cleaner came in to tidy the apartment which was great. The apartments were very secure; they were accessible by a key fob that you receive at reception. At night we travelled by taxi and they take you straight to the Lawhill apartments. The V&A waterfront has great shops and bars/restaurants so there is plenty to do. Look out for the odd seal at the harbour. If you are planning to go to Robben Island it is best to book in advance as we missed out thinking we could go on the day. In most areas of Cape Town you have fantastic views of Table Mountain which is a definite must for a visit.
