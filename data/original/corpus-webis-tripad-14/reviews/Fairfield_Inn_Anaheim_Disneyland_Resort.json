The bathroom had a bath/shower + toilet and the vanity was outside the bathroom and had a coffee machine small bar fridge and huge mirror and hanging space available. Staff were excellent and housekeeping was immaculent. Stand on the verandah outside to watch Disneylands foreworks each night. There is also a coinoperated laundry on each floor as well as on the 3rd floor a pizza hut where you can buy groceries and coffee, sandwiches and salads and a kids play room. You have to eat at Millies restaurant located at the front of the hotel. The chicken pot pie is to die for. Our daughter loved the dinousaur shaped chicken nuggets. Prices are great and the meals are huge. We bought 1 meal and shared between 2 of us. Saved us heaps of money. We walked to Disneyland each day. Only a 10 minute walk and it is directly opposite the hotel. You just have to walk up to the lights located west of the hotel and cross the road into the park.
