Do not be afraid to see Venice this way. The staff is 5 star. Maestre is not to write home about but we did take a walk around the area during our 5 day stay. There are few good restaurants. Save your dining magic for Venice or the hotel restaurant which is pretty good. H Bologna is across the street from the train stn & it is a nice area. There is cheap internet down the street af few blocks at a market (take a right out of the hotel and another right around the hotel-do during the day). The bus stops right outside too. It is easy to get to Venice. The room was large like the pix, and the bathrooms were ultra luxury compared to island hotels. The happy hour is wonderful (cheeses, snacks) and Moreno pours a generous glass. The manager is very professional and fantastic and even bought us a drink because we praised his hotel. Breakfast is one of the best in a bright bustling room. A BIG PLUS is you can park your car here and they charged us 10E a day if I recall, but that was over a year ago. This is available even if you are not staying at the hotel. My son said that he parked at a hotel (2006) across the street (I think) and stayed in Venice and it cost him less. This is a real parking find and it is safe/guarded. The train runs often, as do the buses. #1 & #5 if I recall correctly. Leaving just out of the station and arriving right outside the door. It is quiet, clean, elevator, internet (not cheap), and plenty of room everywhere.
