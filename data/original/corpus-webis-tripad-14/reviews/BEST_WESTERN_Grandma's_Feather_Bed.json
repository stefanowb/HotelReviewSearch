We stayed two nights at this hotel and two at the Country Lane. They are litterally a few blocks from the airport and offer shuttle service. The hotel however is about 8 miles from downtown Juneau. The hotel is very attractive and looks more look a bed and breakfast than a hotel. The room we stayed in was average size with a large whirpool bath in the main part of the room. While I liked the whirlpool my wife found it absolutely impossible to use the shower while in the tub. The room is very nice with a fridge and microwave. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the room at the end of the hall was quiet. The service was generally great but varied tremendously depending on who was there at the front desk. The young woman who is the cook is exceptional! Not only was she a good cook but she went so far as to obtain some deodorant at a store from me when there was none available at either of their hotels. This was in sharp contrast to the other young woman who was serving as the front desk who forgot that we and another couple were sitting for breakfast. They have a shuttle service that runs every two hours to downtown. You are dropped off at and picked up at Centennial Hall which is close to the wharf and cruise terminal. Both of the shuttle drivers were courteous and on-time. Staying here you really feel like you are in a bed and breakfast but at the outskirts of town.", "title": "Attractive Hotel But Far From Downtown", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DCSacramento", "date": "July 31, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 36350655}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I recently stayed at Grandma's for 5 days on a business trip to Juneau.

We were relieved but a little confused about the fact that we had to check in at the Country Lane and that they shuttled to the feather bed. Because we arrived late there was no one there (at the Feather Bed) and we had to use our key to get in the front door then find our way to the room. It was a little eerie, because it felt like we were the only ones there. The room was nice though and the feather mattress was absolutly wonderful and we both slept like a log. The next morning when we stepped out into the hall, we were greeted by the smell of breakfast and coffee. A full breakfast is included in the price of the motel and the restuarent is cute and cheerful. I would definitly recommend it. There are 14 rooms and it is advertised as the smallest Best Western.
