Both were nice, but I preferred #1. It is open-air, and I was a little leery, but it was wonderful. A few lizards (small) dined in the rafters, but they were cute. There were no bugs to speak of, and I didn'y even open my repellant even though mosquitoes love me. I found the staff very friendly, helpful and attentive. They got our breakfast order exactly right every time and it arrived promptly. The view from #1 was spectacular and it was very quiet except for the early morning wakeup call from the howling monkeys- otherworldly! #6 was a little less quiet because it is near the gate and there is a lot of foot traffic going by. The MA Park tour arranged by the hotel was very good. If we'd gone without a guide we wouldn't have seen most of the wildlife. The beaches inside the park are very nice. The hotel also arranged for us to go on the Titi canopy tour, which was excellent. The guides were very friendly and helpful and VERY safety conscious. Booking early is important or you won't get what you want in the way of accomodations.", "title": "Beautiful view, pleasant service", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "leverhart", "date": "March 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4588058}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005", "text": "My girlfriend and I stayed at Makanda last March and had a wonderful time. We booked late so we had to change villas twice during our stay, but it was no big deal (the staff was real helpful with the move), but keep in mind that the distance between villas can be a bit of a long including the stairs. We stayed in villa 5, villa 8, and villa 1. Villa 5 was our favorite, although nearest to the gate it was still very quiet. It is set up high with a beautiful view of the Pacific. Monkeys and sloths joined us for breakfast nearly every morning and the wildlife was surely spectacular. Villa 8 was set lower than villa 5 but the view was as nice, a little less private as there is a studio connected below. Villa 1, may have had the nicest view, but is completely open air. It is connected to other studios and can get noisy if the other studios are filled and the occupants are talking. The bugs were not an issue, but when the lights are turned off, you can see all sorts of animals sitting in the rafters. It didn't bother me, but my girlfriend was concerned.", "title": "Heaven on Earth", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "cboer711", "date": "March 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4567135}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006", "text": "The hotel grounds are spectacular. The pool view is beautiful and the hotel staff was extremely helpful. We got some great dinner reccomendations (try Karolas, el gran escape, two of our favorites), but there are many other great restaurants. The food at the pool restaurant was also good. The beach is a hike and is not reccommended if you aren't in good shape. But you will be rewarded by the beautiful beach if you do make the hike. Make sure you go down at a low tide, there may not be much beach at high tide.
