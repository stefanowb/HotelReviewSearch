The owners have renovated the building but it would appear on a tight budget. Some areas are lovely, like the front lounge where you will find a crackling log fire and comfy stylish seating.The dining room is vast and airy. I found the room very basic, clean but not much money spent on it. The building was very old and quirky which i liked but something was lacking. There was no telephone in the room which i found odd, and the hotel was not staffed between 11pm and 7am.", "user": "mel123Uk", "date": "March 19, 2013", "id": 155085088}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Vegan Freddie", "text": "Unfortunately whe we arrived to our room at approximately 6pm there was very loud music coming from somewhere, we assumed it was the person next door with a music channel on their tv. Slighly annoyed we ignored it and went out for dinner (outside the hotel) and returned later to peace and quiet. However at 7.30am the music struck up again and woke us up, not ideal if like us you came away from home for a relaxing break! When we went down for breakfast we realised the music was actually coming from the kitchen, which was not good! The kitchen was underneath our room.", "user": "Elfreda B", "date": "March 10, 2013", "id": 154148205}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great value", "text": "My friend and I stayed here for two nights, we found the hotel quite easy, no problems there.
