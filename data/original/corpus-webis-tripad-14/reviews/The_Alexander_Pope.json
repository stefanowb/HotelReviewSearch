Great location if you want to walk to events at twickenham. Otherwise I would not stay here. The place was just dirty (room and restaurant). It needs a good solid cleaning with a bucket of soap and water. While having my breakfast, I could see the thick dust and dirt behind the curtain. The poor plant on the shelf was in desperate need of water. The room was OK but not worth the price. The bed linens (if you call them that) were well worn. Walls and bathroom were just dirty. I didn't want to touch the blankets on the bed for fear of when they were last washed.
