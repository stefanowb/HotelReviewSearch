It is also conveniently placed in an area which feels safe and up market at all times (which can not be said of some of the other hotels around the Termini area!).

Friendly helpful staff but even they could not get our air conditioning switched on! Rome's council (must charge other pricier hotels ) apparently restrict the start date. As our room was on the ground floor, just off the lobby area and next to the hotel entrance, it was impossible to leave the window open for air at night as people smoked outside front door + talked plus traffic noise! Staff noise in lobby from around 7am too. On checkout I asked for and received 10% discount (which was on top of the 7% online reduction for a stay of 3 nights) . Room was clean and nice bathroom but would advise to buy breakfast at local bar / cafe as hotel's breakfast offering was unimpressive. Wifi is provided free but for one device only(!) per room, so you may need to request a separate code, which we did and obtained as there were 2 of us! Good location away from main centre which is leisurely 5 minute walk from nearest Metro.

We had opted to have breakfast in the morning and the meal were very good. There was a problem with the amount of bread served, and the staff corrected this problem and actually gave us a discount.
