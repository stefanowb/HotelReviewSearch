The golf course staff was very friendly and helpful. Most of the days we played, we were alone on the course, which was well maintained. The beach at the Marriott was very disappointing. All beaches are public, and you can't go on them without being constantly hassled by the locals wanting to sell you things, braid your hair or rub your feet. As I was swimming in the ocean, which seemed great, I discovered garbage floating by me (at the hotel beach). As we walked down the beach, it looked like a landfill, with all sorts of garbage, bottles, oil cans, handiwipes and other undesirable material on the shore. This discourage us from doing any more swimming in the ocean, so we decided to stick to the pool. This also seemed nice, but be aware that you cannot leave anything alone at the hotel pools for any amount of time. We had two MP3 players and towels stolen from the North pool, and the hotel wouldn't re-imburse us. This incident and the condition of the beach has discouraged us from ever returning to this resort.

Our flight was awful but once we got to the Marriott we felt more at ease. Luckily, Calypso served dinner until 10 pm so we ate a late dinner but got food! Our travel agent booked us with GoGo Tours so we set up our activities and adventures through a GoGo Tour guide that came to the Marriott (it was a little cheaper than booking activities through the hotel)! We took a half day tour of the island, hiked up the volcano and took a catamaran to Nevis (the ride to the port was included in the booking)--we didn't get to see much of Nevis but definitely want to go back. Every activity we did was well worth it and worth the money (and inexpensive), if you like history and adventure! The restaurants at the Marriott were nice--Blu was yummy, great place for seafood and beautiful ocean view, La Cucina was good Italian food and Calypso, good for a quick bite to eat. They also had Bohemia Beach Bar (which has a swim up bar) and the Pizza Shack for lunch or an afternoon snack. I loved that the Calypso Caf\u00e9 was open 24 hours\u2014they had drinks for late nights and were there for a quick to-go breakfast. Tip\u2014an all-inclusive package is the way to go. It included all restaurants and bars except the Royal Grille Steakhouse and The Keys Rum/Cigar Bar. The Marriott had a large pool but was crowded most of the time. Usually they offered nightly entertainment ....one night they had karaoke, which we missed out on but heard it was tons of fun. One thing I do wish they would have recognized was that were we were honeymooners. A couple we met that was staying at the hotel got a complimentary bottle of champagne and dessert and then got a complimentary bottle of wine at Blu---we had to practically beg for our champagne and dessert! Also, if you\u2019re looking for a romantic couple\u2019s getaway--there were a lot of families vacationing--and few couples. The hotel did have a beach but the water was rough---so we took a short taxi ride to Turtle Beach. If you go to St. Kitts you have to go to Turtle Beach\u2026.at least one time! They have a gift shop and restaurant and it's a great place to snorkel. Turtle Beach is famous for its monkeys but also has a pet pig, goats and cats running around! I also got an aloe foot rub on the beach from an islander and it was wonderful! A beach just a 15 minutes walk from the hotel was Friar's Beach (located on the Caribbean side)--and it was safe to walk. Lots of shells...also had bars/restaurants and local people selling St. Kitts souvenirs. Although the trip started rough, we will definitely be back to the Marriott in St. Kitts and Nevis....maybe with kids next time to share the fun.

The service throughout the hotel was superb. The front desk, managers on duty, bar tenders and wait staff were all very friendly and helpful. I didn't experience one unhappy employee. Because the 10% sevice charge that St. Kitts adds to every thing you purchase, we had a few couples ask us if they should tip more. We always told them to tip more if the service was good to at least equal the 20% you would normally give for good service. We tipped everyone and felt it was very appreciated. We also ate some dinners off property and our favorite was Marshalls. YOU MUST EAT AT MARSHALLS. The food was fabulous and the prices were reasonable. It was just a short cab ride from the Marriott.
