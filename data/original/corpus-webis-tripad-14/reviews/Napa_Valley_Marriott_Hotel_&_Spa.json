The hotel is not in a location you would consider for a romantic getaway since it's across the street from a strip mall with Target, etc. and is not in the cute part of Napa. However, the room seemed fine at first. Then I realized I was stolen from too, as a previous reviewer noted. I am now down two ipods and a Palm Pilot. I understand that hotels do not have liability for this, but really, I've never had anything stolen from me in over 8 years of traveling for business. I had a strange feeling when I got in my car to leave that I was missing some things but drove away. I called when I was less than an hour away and alerted the hotel of my missing belongings and they tried to tell me maybe I had left it in the restaurant which I never visited. The only conclusion I can draw is they were stolen either during a cleaning or once I called to say they were missing. I will never stay here again and will tell all my friends and coworkers not to as well.", "title": "Beware the Napa Marriott", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Feverpitch", "date": "February 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6745136}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007", "text": "My brother's girlfriend works for Marriott and because of her we decided to check out the Marriott properties while spending a week in the Napa and Sonoma areas.", "title": "Napa Napa Napa", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "whiteagles", "date": "January 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6712174}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We thought our stay was rather pleasant and the staff rather accomodating.
