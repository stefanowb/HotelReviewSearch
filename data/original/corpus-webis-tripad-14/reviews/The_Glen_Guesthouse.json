So as well as the noise from the road traffic you have the noise from all the people in the street and coming back at all hours throughout the night.

That night we decided to just go out for a couple of drinks and save ourselves for the Saturday, it was only about a 10-15 min walk to Temple Bar which we thought was great. Anyway everything was fine that night and the next morning, but we didn't get up in time for breakfast, but we weren't too disappointed. Then that Saturday we were all geared up for a great night out for my birthday, it was that great that we didn't get back to the guesthouse til 4:30, anyway the person who was looking after the front desk let us in, we then asked for our room key and he gave us a very puzzled look. He then said he would take us up to the room and he would go first, he then ran up the stairs, so I ran after him. When I caught up with him finally, I found him talking to a man who was sleeping in OUR BED!!! He was telling him to get out and that he wouldn't charge him etc and the man was becoming quite violent, after about 5 min of shouting the man finally left and the night porter disappeared also, we didn't know what to do, the night porter then came up didn't bother saying sorry or what had happened, just gave us some clean sheet for US to change and just said the man cam ein saying he had a room and he spotted that only our key was left.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "lotsaluggageGAL", "date": "April 4, 2006", "id": 4932319}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The last time I stayed in Dublin, it was in a wonderful B&B that was about 15 minutes bus ride from the city centre.
