These really are little, individual studio and one bedroom units complete with porches and rockers all assembled around a nicely landscaped courtyard. Best of all, they're only a couple of blocks from the beach. Everything is provided for your trip to the beach, too--portable beach chairs, coolers, even beach toys. Actually that's typical of these places overall--they've outfitted them with everything, from laundry applicances and WIFI to pots, pans, nice china, and even magazines, books and games to play. And the decor is very clean with a nice homey feel. After a day or two you start to feel like it's really your own little cottage in South Florida.", "title": "Such a cute, homey little place", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "FloridaTravelmum", "date": "May 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 16148719, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The homey feel of having a cottage rather than a hotel", "disliked": "\u2014 Can't think of anything"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Cottages are close to nice restaurants so you wouldn't even need a car if beach and water activities are what you're after.

Lauderdale and Miami to the South. Besides the more well known sights all those places have, you can also check out less well-known places like Butterfly World and Morikami Japanese Gardens.
