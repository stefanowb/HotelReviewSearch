We have several options to stay in Pisa, but chose Michelle's house because of the positive reviews on the website. We stayed on \"Cinque Terre\" room and must say that it surpassed all our requirements. It was clean and spacy, with perfect insuite bathroom with beautiful wall-engraved pictures. Michele is a perfect host and photographer. I bet you have not met such a person before. He did his best to make our stay remarkable. First I needed internet access and Michelle give it to me FREE. Even proposed to me a notebook, absolutely free of charge. I can't miss that we had a Nespresso coffee machine in the room and moreover the coffee was absolutly FREE. From the first day in the house he gave us a detailed day-by-day plan where to go during our 8 day stay in Pisa. We haven't even bought a map of the region - Michele give it to us FREE filled with notes and recommendations. I am not sure if you will believe me, but on the birthay of my girlfriend he even bought her a present.", "title": "Best service and amazing host Michelle!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mortex", "date": "December 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 11650956}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We loved Pisa, thanks to Micheles' recommendations of places to see and eat.

I think the reviews which have been left which are postive do not travel very often. We stayed in the cinque terre room, with a private showeroom. The room next to us had no bathroom so passed our room to use the toilet etc, everynight without fail we kept getting guests trying to practically break into our room, it was very strange we couldnt work out what was going on but apparently the rooms were hard to find so we let it go. Michelle takes up a lot of your time unnecessarily, not one of his recommendations proved succesful, we did not appreciate after a long flight and suitcases at our feet getting historical facts and figures about Pisa which were not relevant. He was extremely rude when he discovered we did not follow his specific itinery he had in mind for us and kept repeating \"you should have listened to me, you should have listened to me\" I didnt realise we were on a holiday with and for Michelle!!! It is very central right next to the train station but its in a disgusting street, not good if your on a girls holiday as their are a lot of unpleasant people in that area. We definately would not go back as their was nothing which stood out to us as reasonable or acceptable it was all very basic.", "user": "bristolgas", "date": "April 28, 2008", "id": 15422916}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful", "text": "stayed 3 nights in april,rooms very clean and comfortable,good value,excellant location for price.michele is very helpful.If he advises somewhere to visit or eat take his advice.He sent us to 2 restauraunts and both were excellant and no more expensive than the ordinary places we seen.Location is very good,1minute from station.15 mins from tower.", "user": "bluedormouse", "date": "April 19, 2008", "id": 15144897}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "I'm not sure which room the previous reviewer stayed in, but have to say that we stayed in the Cinque Terre room which was absolutely lovely.
