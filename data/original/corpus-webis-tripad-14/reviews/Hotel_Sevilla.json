For events like this hotel prices (not to mention lack of availability) can be difficult to swallow. This place was close enough and at around 250 zloty per room (with breakfast), in addition to being a fairly new property we could not turn it down. It is out of the way, on a country road but that means it is quiet (not a bad thing when all you want to do is sleep).", "title": "Reasonable, pleasant stay", "user": "LoveTravels", "date": "June 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 132468704}], "location": {"country": "Poland", "region": "Central Poland", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 0}, "aka": "Hotel Sevilla Poland/Rawa Mazowiecka", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
