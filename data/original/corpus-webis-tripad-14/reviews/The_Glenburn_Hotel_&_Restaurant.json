The food and service were good. There is on site parking. The hotel is very clean and tidy. And the hotel is licensed so an evening drink with diner or in the lounge is handy, there is only 1 draft lager and 1 draft beer but the spirits are well stocked and there is also a reasonable wine list. The staff are very attentive, keen to be helpfull and very hard working. Perhaps sometimes a little too attentive, on several occasions over breakfast and diner my plate was whipped away while i was still chewing my last mouthfull. But overall, very good. Certainly a very high standard of service. The food was well prepared and presented, i asked for a medium rare steak and got a medium rare steak, and it was a very good piece of meat too. I can highly reccommend the Thia fishcakes, the Lasagne, Salmon and the breakfast were all superb. With a very varied choice for breakfast. Pricing is very good, we stayed 3 nights with breakfast and ate diner every night, with evening drinks for just over \u00a3400, thats not bad at all.", "title": "Very comfortable and friendly", "user": "alison14063", "date": "March 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 99140702}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011", "text": "The hotel is very popular, with the Friday and Saturday nights very busy, i dont think they were far off fully booked, given the time of year and the economy i think that bodes well.", "title": "Very nice stay!!", "user": "Sdole1983", "date": "February 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 98227861}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The spa bath is a nice touch as is the little note asking you to be aware that other guests are staying and the spa is a little noisy, so not to use after 2230hrs.

The breakfast was a great buffet of cereals, juices, yoghurts, and all included if you desired the full English breakfast ....From Scrambled egg, poached.or even the good old fried egg. We do how-ever wish we had stayed to eat our evening meal at the Glenburn as the menu\"s looked tempting.But being on a week-end away we went out to windemere for meals ,later to regret not eating at the hotel,.and the nice ambience of the hotel bar .....
