The food is good and the service excellent. However breakfast is expensive and ordinary and the proprietors seem to regard their drinks tarif and wine list as an excuse to print money.(Most aperitifs 7 euros, bottle of water 6 euros, cidre du ferme 15 euros). If I can have wine at twice the supermarket price I feel that I have a bargain, two and a half to three times and 'Oh well that's life' but when it gets up to four times and more I will usually drink water and that would have been the case here if it wasn't our last night after a nine week trip around Europe.", "title": "Nice place but poor value", "user": "Peregrinakis", "date": "November 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 48708470}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Lovely countryside setting with farm animals everywhere: chickens, rabbits, pigs, cows, etc - kids loved that part.

Set in the countryside with lovely gardens to sit out in this hotel is one for peace and quiet in the middle of a long journey. The restaurant was however closed on the Monday leaving us to find an alternative place to eat with little nearby, they obviously think more of their staff than the guests. The room we booked ended up being one of only two in the loft space of the annex building with a steep winding staircase, given I was on crutches no alternative was offered which was surprising as we were the only guests at the time and only two other parties arrived later. The room was very clean but being in the loft space had no views, only high Velox windows, and had very restricted head space in the bathroom and over the bed compounded by beams running through the room, the head was bumped on several occasions. Given our personal experience I would not book this hotel again, I do not feel it represented good value for the price nor a level of comfort and amenities I would expect.
