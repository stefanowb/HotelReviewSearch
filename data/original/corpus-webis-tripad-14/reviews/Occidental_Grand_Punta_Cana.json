Our room was the on third floor and was very spacious. The resort was beautiful and a perfect size. It was easy to walk throughout the entire property. Most of the staff, especially the bartenders and entertainers were very friendly and helpful. Tipping goes a long way, especially with housekeeping. People with disabilities beware - there are no elevators. Of course there were a few hiccups: The registration desk will be worst service you will encounter during your stay. It took us two hours to check in and we had an early check in. Luckily we got our bracelets about 30 minutes in and were able to enjoy a cocktail to cool off. If your party is departing separately beware as the front desk will only give you one check out slip that you need to show the bellhops before departing. Talk to guest services for assistance. The first morning we attempted to make dinner reservations and everything was completely booked. Our local travel agency representative talked to management and got us a reservation. By the way, most of the restaurants were half empty whenever we went so we didn't understand why there was such a problem getting reservations. The food was mediocre and pretty disappointing, but there is food available almost 24/7. Since it's an all-inclusive and they were cooking for the masses it's to be expected. Some people raved about the food, and with so many nationalities everyone's tastes will vary. I didn't go for the food, and the beach and pools were amazing which was very important to me! The other major issue for us was that the water would turn off at random times during the day - this meant no showers, no toilet flushing or ability to wash hands. This made us wonder how the workers handling the food washed their hands, especially since both of us had stomach issues during the trip. We never had a hot shower, but figured it was due to the demand level before dinner. The resort offered nightly entertainment, shows for the kids and adults. There was plenty of shade provided both at the pools and beach which was great.

Then line up for food, if you wanted a drink the only way was to get it yourself.

My hubby and I were in Building 22 and our friends were in Building 13. We had a wonderful time. Rooms are spotless and the concierge service always makes sure that the beer fridge is always stacked up. Bring some kind of a plastic card (something like a credit card but NOT a credit card) to stick in the air conditioning slot cause the keys are attached to their air conditioner card and its no fun walking into a boiling hot room. The staff at this hotel is friendly but somewhat slow-paced and altho I know it's a vacation and it's the time to relax and just have fun, they seemed a little too slow even for that. As far as dining is concerned, the buffet is horrible and after a couple of days, just the smell made us nauseous but the other restaurants are quite yummy but the waiters are (once again) slow, so be prepared to have a 1 1/2 to 2 hour supper. It also a good idea to stand in line early in the morning to make reservations at these restaurants because it is no fun standing in line at 11am on a hot, humid day. We have no kids but the kids that were there seemed to have a wonderful time. The beach is absolutely beautiful and the sand is perfect. Plenty of chairs and palapas (those umbrellas made of leaves) available all the time. It's okay to leave your beach bag and stuff at your chair to go swimming or to eat. No one touches anything. Personally, we always took our camcorder and camera with us when we actually left the beach to go and eat. The only annoyance was the noise from the helicopters flying overhead. Locals aren't allowed on the beach and neither are vendors. Important to bring enough of everything cause the hotel store is quite expensive ($6 US for a bag of chips, $19 US for suntan lotion). Souvernirs can be bought at the Plaza Bavaro which is just off the hotel grounds and always start the bargaining at 50% or more. Who ever heard of 3 t-shirts for $60?!? The pools are quite nice and very clean and the swim-up bar is a favorite hang out for lotsa people so be prepared to wait unless you flash some $$$ (the bartender will literally trip over his feet to serve you). Order a Bahama Mama or a Ziggy Ziggy...amazing! The nitely entertainment is quite boring and we only watched one show. Also, the music in the lobby is extremely repetitive. As for excursions, try the Isla Saona and the Bavaro Runners. I don't suggest swimming with the dolphins at Manati Park as they are mistreated and their living conditions are horrible. This was told to us by 2 different tour operators. It was an amazing and relaxing vacation and we will be returning to Punta Cana to try a different hotel in September 2004.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 10, 2004", "id": 1545382}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Can we say the best!!", "text": "December 26th- January 3rdwell, i live in florida, my mom and family in wisconsin and we went to th DR (Dominican Republic).what can i say, when we arrived we were tired, and hot, when we got to the room we thought their was a power failure, we didnt know how to work anything, but it turned our that you have to stick the card into a slot to put the power on, anyway, we went to bed, and the next morning my brother was sick, he stayed in the room took some medicine and we headed downstairslots of good looking girls (for the guys), food and drinks were the best ever.

Recommend to all!", "text": "We (two couples) visited The Occidental Grand Flamenco Resort in October, 2003. All had a wonderful time! The beach is beautiful; the resort is EXTREMELY clean; the pool is gorgeous; the employees couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant.We stayed in Building 13. Perfect location! Close to the beach. Not far from the Home Rum Restaurant and the pool. Actually, nothing is far away. Building 13 did have a couple of water heater problems that week (Oct 6 - 13), but once brought to the resort's attention, the problem was corrected in a timely fashion.I had read multiple reviews prior to going and, frankly, was a bit worried, but there was no need to worry. Our stay was uneventful. Security was present, but not overly-so. We experienced no armed guards with the exception of one gentleman posted outside the local bank up in the local shopping area, which we felt was reasonable. The native people were kind and cooperative. None were pushy or intrusive. When you said \"no, thank you,\" they said okay and there was no pressure. We felt safe at all times. Now, we weren't stupid. We didn't stray from the public areas. We didn't take alleyways. We kept most of our money in our room safe, but you could leave your beach bag at your lounge chair without worry that it would be tampered with or rummaged through. Being an all-inclusive, you just didn't need a whole lot and everybody had the same thing you had - so your stuff was not interesting to anyone.The beach was clean and beautiful. It was like walking on flour! The pool, too, was clean and sparkling at all times. If you are a person who is offended by topless bathing, you will not enjoy the beach, as it is permissible and practiced. It, however, is not permitted at the pool, at least according to the pool rules, however, apparently, some are either not capable of following the rules; are above following the rules, or, simply, did not read the rules. At any rate, you will experience some topless bathing at the pool also.The food. Well, there's an area that could be worked on a bit. While there was PLENTY of food to be had, most was not real palatable. Don't get me wrong, we did not go hungry by any means, but, we did broaden our food ranges! You have to find \"your menu\" or \"your places\" to best meet your needs. Most of your needs can be met, probably not at the same location, though. My recommendation is that you take your own condiments. That was one thing we did and we very grateful! We watched others walking around us just wishing they had that Heinz Ketchup or Hellman's Mayonaise for their hamburger and fries.No vendors approached you on the beach. There were beach vendors, but you walked to them!The personnel in the resort-owned shops, were a bit less friendly than others. The personnel booking reservations for the restaurants have the attitude that you should be aware of the practices and not waste their time with \"silly questions.\" They, actually were rude! In addition, if you change your mind - THAT REALLLLLLY upsets them. They are not helpful in letting you know when certain restaurants are already booked for certain evenings, so you can make a decision, without inconveniencing them. Everyone else, though, was very pleasant.We had a wonderful time and intend to visit again in 2004.Thank you Occidental Resorts.

This hotel is suitable for people of all ages as theres something for everyone. Occassionally the staff were a little slow in taking drinks orders and laying tables in the main restaurant, but it didn't happen everyday and it wasn't as if we were ever in a rush. The only disappointment was the amount of complaining people did over silly little matters when really all they needed was use their common sense. For example the hot water is only switched on three hours in the morning and three at night and people were complaining about only having lukewarm showers...... who actually wants a piping hot shower with temperatures in the 80's anyway.? There were also complaints about cold food from people who we noticed came down to the main restaurant (which was buffet style) after 10.00pm expecting to obtain a hot meal when it closed at 10.30pm. Obviously none of the dishes would be topped up with hot food by staff as they were soon to close.

It will be warm, so have someone in your party walk over to the lobby bar for refreshments. If you tell them you are checking in, you will be served. For about $20.00 you can take a cab from the airport and get there before the bus, which helps with your wait. Even if you have vouchers for a free bus ride, talk to a cab driver or two and see what kind of deal they will give you. IMPORTANT: Always settle on a price before getting into a cab and don't be afraid to check with more than one cabby!!The rooms are always clean, bright, and comfortable. Remember, you are in a differnt country so things will be different than home. The food is fresh, taste, and plenty of it. The deserts are always my favorite. There are a few resturants that require reservations and we have learned that regardless what the booklets may tell you about making them, go Sunday morning to the desk in the lobby by the Buffet and make all your resevations for the week. This way you are in the book and don't have to go every morning. We were given this info by the staff. Another tip: Bring a large, insulated mug with a lid for your beverages. Whether for juice, beer, cocktails or water, they will fill them for you.

If you are expecting glitz and glamour, why are you choosing to go here anyway?! This was my first trip here, and I am planning another trip at the latter part of this year. If you go in with the mindset of every little thing needing to be perfect, you are going to have a terrible time, no matter where you go ! for example: We arrived before check-in, so we just went and ate (didn't get annoyed :)) Also, some of the toilets were out of order in the lobby, oh well.! no biggee....THE ROOM: Maria is wonderful!!! We took care of her right away, and she continued to provide us with huge bottles of water everyday. The room was always clean, and if there was a problem, we would have it taken care of immediately. We had 3 girls in the room, and each us had our own huge bed! We were in building 26, right next to the beach.!! THE FOOD: MY GOD!!!! THE FOOD WAS AWESOME! The breakfast was the best meal of the day!!! anything you can imagine, and the omelets made to order were always perfect! The coffee is sooooo good..We even went back to the main buffett for dinners a few days, because you can always be satisfied. We loved the Mexican restaurant (went there 2x) and the Brazilian and Italian were good too. THE PIZZA PLACE IS DELICIOUS!!! ELVIN IS THE MAN!! The pizza is open until 6:30am, and it really comes in handy after a night of dancing!:) The tacos were great too. The bars are so much fun: Emilio at the main lobby bar is hilarious! Diebe at the upstairs bar can really make one hell of a drink!! They really take care of you, and treat you nice. There are plenty of places on the resort to get food and drink and the Beach Buffet really comes in handy when at the beach and you just want to run in for a quick bite. THE BEACH: ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! plenty of seating, just go out early and save your chairs so you don't have to look for them. JULIO IS A JOY! He will pay you a visit numerous times to see how you are doing. It really makes your stay enjoyable. THE SHOWS: the entertainment was quite good. They put on great shows every nite we were there. THE STAFF: SUPERFRIENDLY!!! I really liked the staff, had a problem with NO ONE! I felt completely comfortable with all of them, and they actually like if you talk with them. GUSTAVO IS GREAT(MAIN LOBBY) if you go, tell him Christine from NJ said hello :) Seriously, they are all great, and just are friendly. CLUB MANGU: I LOVED IT.. It is a little different, but it is definitely a good time! I danced there 2 nites in a row until it closed at 5:30am. I can't wait to go back just to dance !!! TOURS: we did the Saona Island tour: YOU HAVE GOT TO DO THIS!! it is absolutely beautiful, and a great day, and I will go back here again, as well.. it is a full day, but well worth the $. if you book thru an agent, book the tour thru Victor(Liberty Travel) he is honest and tells you which tours are better than others, and the prices they should be. OVERVIEW: All in all, you should totally be pleased if you go here. When I go back, I will stay here again. You have to keep in mind you are going to a beautiful place, that is in a poor country. it is very under-developed outside of the resort, however the people still always have smiles on their faces, and are very warm. The people are working long days (usually 16 hours) for days and days straight, with a day or 2 off, and then working again. I think the Dominican Republic is a beautiful place, with great people, and a great vacation experience.
