After reading the reviews I was a little worried. We got a great room in the beach building and we got it at a fair price. The beach building is right on the beach and has a view of the ocean (some partial some whole-we had partial which was fine with me). The place is a little confusing at first like others have said. There is the main building which is where the one pool is and the gym and the food places, then there is the building across the street near the parking lot which is connected by a walkway over the A1A roadway. The other building is called the south tower and is sort of between the main building and the beach building and it has no views of the ocean (at least this is what I was told). We liked exploring the hotel. Our room had quiet air conditioning. The first few days I was there the hallway had no noise, then on the third day a large group must have checked in that left early because in the morning I heard doors slamming and then they were gone(along with my do not disturb sign). It was quiet again and fortunately no one came to clean early (which we do not want-we like later cleaning and to sleep in) and housekeeping got me a new sign right away. So it is a matter of luck if your halls are quiet or not. You can hear everything in the hallway. I bring earplugs with me because a lot of hotels are like this. At night the hotel hall way was quiet for my whole stay. I loved the hotel pool and it was right on the beach (one pool in main building in courtyard very pretty and other pool on beach (infinity pool also very nice). The pools are not super large like some hotels but they were fine for us. I enjoyed the beach view from the pool. We picked a quiet week and the pool was rarely crowded. On the night we were checking out which was a Friday a large group came in and the pool was more crowded and noisy. It was a football crowd down to see the Eagles game and they were fine except that no one stopped people from smoking while they ate around the pool. A wind blew the smoke in the other direction but it made me wonder if it was a non-smoking hotel except for poolside. We had no problem with any one smoking on the other days. People did smoke by the door going into the main building from the beach building and the south tower and this was a bit annoying but I let it pass and walked quickly and never sat out there. The food in the hotel was good. We ate a couple of days by the pool and service was good, we ate at the Linc when we arrived and service was also good and the food was fine. We tried Los Caminos for breakfast one day and I was happy to find breakfast food that was not spicy like some reviews said. It was very good- could get an omelet or bagel lox and cream cheese or whatever. Prices were high but they allowed refills of the orange juice which I liked. Our room had a safe and the bed was comfortable. Not all rooms have safes yet but they are working on it. The first night they put a sheet that was too small on the bed and it kept coming off. Others had said this in the reviews and it is true, however in the morning housekeeping was outside in the hall and I asked them about this and they apologized and immediately replaced the sheet with the proper size. They said I should have called right away and it would have been taken care of. So I guess you just have to speak up and it will be taken care of. I do not know why they have this problem in the first place but I was happy the rest of the trip and the sheet was fine. I know it sounds like I am complaining about things but I just want to express that we enjoyed our trip but things were not perfect. The place turned out to be a lot better then the reviews said. It was clean, I got beach chairs free, the weather was good (we are beach and pool people), The pool was clean and warm with the saline cleaning instead of chlorine which I now like,we had a view of the beach from our room. Housekeeping was wonderful, everything we requested they remembered to get and they cleaned the room well and always left us soap and lotions. I liked the shower gel and nylon scrubber they gave with it. Housekeeping was very nice and made us feel welcome. It was one of our better trips. We are glad we picked this hotel. One day we ate breakfast at the Marriott next door (expensive but great view on the beach and great service) and a few days we ate breakfast at the Best Western for 10 dollars each. It is a very good breakfast and Frank and Rose are very nice. Frank always gave us tips on things to do in the area. For dinner and lunch you can walk to Coconuts (prices are higher then three years ago), but food is still good and service excellent, Bahia grill is across the street from the Sheraton and All About Food is down the street or you can just eat in the hotel. Prices for food are high all over so we just got used to it. CVS is about a mile down the beach or A1A and we were told Walgreens is nearby too but we never got there. We also enjoyed the lemonade and iced tea in the lobby which is given out on weekends only or if it is very hot outside. (that is what I was told). When we arrived it was quite a treat while checking in. We did not have a long check in line but I can see how maybe there could be one at times. They usually have a few people on the front desk but if a big group comes in I guess there might be a wait because the front desk is very helpful and people have a lot of questions(like me). Cab fare ran 20-22 from the airport plus tip. Hope this helps everyone and enjoy your vacation!

Of course there was never a response or fix. The restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. Exceptionally slow service and I never received a refill on my drink during my entire meal. Their chicken tacos were supposed to have a citrus and lime flavor according to their menu but were over cooked dices of drano marinated mystery food. Complained to staff but they never showed up again until time to pay the bill. No manager ever showed up to apologize. My change for the meal was $1.34 and she brought me back a dime and 24 pennies which I let her keep the pennies as a tip. Everyting at this hotel is expensive including drinks, snacks and especially parking. The bar is called the Wreck Bar.

There were lots of families with younger children that were having a great time at the beach and in the pool. You do have to pay for parking at most of the resorts so expect to pay at least $25.00 to park for one night.

Called guest service who did send out a cleaner to clean out the pot. Also had several bugs crawling around our bedside tables, not great! Didn't kick up too much fuss as only there for one night.

I checked in this afternoon and was absolutely shocked that this hotel falls into the four star or better category. The room smelled of smoke, part of the bathroom door frame is busted, there are scratches and dents in the walls. People at the pool blast their own music over the hotel speakers. There are a lot of band aids on the ground around the pool and on the beach (which I actually find kind of amusing...I mean, what is up with that?). So I called Priceline and was put in touch with someone here at the hotel and since I already prepaid with Priceline they are not about to refund me for early checkout. Worst part is that their solution to the smell issue was to send two people up with this spray that made the room smell even worse than the smoke smell. My eyes are watering and my lungs are burning right now as I write this. I was also offered a voucher for a free continental breakfast for my trouble. Whoopie. We will see if that actually happens, but I am not too concerned with it as I plan to spend absolutely no time in my room here other than when I must sleep. If you can get a deal (I'd say no more than $60 or $70 a night or so) and have no problem with a motel type environment I don't think you'd have a problem here, but I'd you pay over $100 and/or expect the hotel to be as pictured/described, you will be disappointed.
