We enjoyed both restaurants and they went out of their way for the kids to ensure they enjoyed their meals as well. The concierge service was extraordinary from the moment we were booked months ago. They worked with us to not only plan our daily schedule but arranged all tour tickets and yes their was a small fee for the courier that waited for the tickets daily, but worth it!

No amenity or luxury was lacking and the contents of the mini-bar were absolutely amazing -lots of delicious sweets, cookies, chocolates and jellybeans as well as a wide variety of beverages.

The cost was prohibitive even for a small room (and no view of the White House for me) but it was still nice. Lots of free things: complimentary shoe shine, free newspapers (national and foreign), free wifi, free local telephone calls, free business centre- open 24 hours a day- it\u2019s like having your office with you. Very practical: the overnight pressing service to take care of your crumpled suits (alternative: the ironing board in the wardrobe for the cost conscious). Turndown service includes filling of the ice bucket and tuning the Bose radio/CD player to your favorite station. Bathroom is well-stocked, with plush towels and toiletries by Asprey- bathrobe is a bit cheap-looking (microfiber on the outside/cotton on the inside). TV could be better: a bit cumbersome to use and the choice of non-US channels is limited (no BBC, no German, no French). Good breakfast in the downstairs restaurant- and it is a la carte only- no need to get up for anything. If there is a problem that needs taken care of: mumble a few incoherent words to the concierge (that\u2019s what I did) and consider it done. Staff is wonderful and makes you feel at home.

The lobby is very well-maintained with lots of wood. The style is more traditional or classic, rather than contemporary/trendy. Our group paid $335/night on a discounted basis, and I understand the week we stayed was a rather high-volume, high-demand one for DC hotels; the rack rates for the Hay-Adams for this week began at $525.

The bathroom amenities were very nice. Nightly turn-down service and a Bose radio on the desk, and also a large TV and well-stocked minibar.

The 145-room boutique hotel in Washington, DC features 21 luxury suites with stunning views of Lafayette Park and the White House. All of our guest rooms exhibit the perfect combination of heritage, luxury, contemporary comfort and technology.
