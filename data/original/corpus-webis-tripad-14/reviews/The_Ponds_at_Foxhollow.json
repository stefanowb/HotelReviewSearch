While the unit is technically a sleep-6, we actually had a dozen people (6 adults and 6 children). The unit has 1 bedroom on the first floor, along with a sleeper sofa in the living room; upstairs is another sleeper sofa and a second bedroom. There was plenty of room for everyone since most of the children slept in sleeping bags. Other reviews are correct that the units are dated. However, we found it to be clean, which is most important. The place is a 15 minute drive to Butternut, which is very convenient. The clubhouse has an indoor pool, which the children enjoyed. Wi-fi in the units (unsecured). A few recommendations if you are going to stay here...First, the units have a fireplace in which you are allowed to burn only artificial logs - they sell small 2-hour logs at the front desk for $3 apiece, but you could probably bring better ones to save a little money. Secondly, while the clubhouse provides pool towels, they are small so you may want to bring your own. Lastly, my wife found the sheets to be of low quality - if you want to improve your experience, you may want to bring your own sheets.
