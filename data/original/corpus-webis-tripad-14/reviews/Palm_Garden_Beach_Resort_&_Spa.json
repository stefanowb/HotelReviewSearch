The resort had a few shuttles a day to and from the town area which made it very convenient, however the times were not always ideal.

Lovely touches such as water at each door to wash off your feet from the beach, flowers on the bed and updates daily on weather, activities etc. Front desk were fantastic and provided lots of options for tours. The one tour we took up to My Son was perfect - a small group, left to own devices at the ruins, cold water and towels provided pre and post walking around the ruins.

Was told that 10 days would be too long but really there is so much to do and see in Hoi An that it was a perfect length of stay. We booked through Aurora Travel who got us a great deal on a Superior Ocean View room. If you can, do go for an Ocean View as some of the Garden View rooms in my opinion are very close together with limited privacy. Also ask for a upper story, we had a ground floor room and had to keep the curtains drawn as people looked in a lot! The bungalows looked great, but again ask for ones by the beach, some near the pool would have been very public. The room itself was perfect, factastic decor, very very clean. Great marble bathroom with walk in shower. Housekeeping are really on the ball and keep the place immaculate. The grounds are very well kept, the gardeners are working all day to keep it that way. Very relaxing to just walk around the paths in the resort. Beach is huge and the staff always on hand to help with loungers/towels. Pool fab, very kid friendly. Really cant fault how this resort looks at all - night time is especially magical as there are fairy lights and candles all over the resort. Food wise, the seafood bbq was great and food in the main restuarant very much up to standard, but expensive. If you are a wine lover, forget it! Wine was $30 a bottle for the exact same wine i can get at home for $10. Only negative things i would say is that the staff are perhaps too keen - sometimes you just want to be left alone to chill out and they were always hovering nearby which got me a bit narked! Service even in the beach bar is very very formal, which again doesnt really help with the relaxing! Also most of the staff have very poor english, to the extent of not understanding our orders! I had to take the pad and write down 'sandwich with chicken' for one guy! In contrast to people in Hoi An town who all had excellent english. However i would totally recommend this resort, great combination of beach resort with a wonderfully historic town 5 min away. As for Hoi An, do yourself a favour and go to the Mango Rooms for dinner. We went 3 nights! Meal for 2 including wine was $80, and was on par with meal we had in London just before leaving that set us back $300.
