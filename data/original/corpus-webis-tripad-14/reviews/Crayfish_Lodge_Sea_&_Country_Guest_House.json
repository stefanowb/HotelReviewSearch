Our lovely host Sandra spent a lot of time making us feel welcome and recommending one of our best meals in South Africa at the charming Rosemary's just a few minutes away (like Grandma's quaint antiques-filed house but with WAY better food!). Sandra and Reinhard thought of everything when they built this house for guests, from the chic furnishings and very well-appointed bathrooms (ahhh the shower!), to their vast DVD collection, down to the heated floors that perfectly took the chill off our wintertime visit. Wish we had had more time to spend here- next time maybe we'll catch sight of the whales!

The bedrooms are comfortable and well equipped and the public rooms are airy and well designed with views over the coast. There is a private path down to the coast for those who want to walk along and watch whales from the coastal path.
