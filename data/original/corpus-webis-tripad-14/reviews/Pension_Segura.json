Pay in advance, it's a couple of cents cheaper. Each day in the morning you'll receive a ticket which you have to show at the cafe. I don't think the waitress speaks English (at that point I gave up speaking English which no one around understood anyway and tried to improvise in Spanish). The breakfast consists of a glass of orange juice, two big toasts with tomato paste (or some other topping) and a coffee. Okay for the price (about 2 euros).
