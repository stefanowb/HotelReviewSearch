Offered to keep any luggage for us but we just left it in the car and went out to the shops. The location is ideal plenty eating places and shops on your doorstep. Came back at 4pm given key for room on 7th floor. The room was as shown in the photograph, large window and kingsize bed. It was clean and never heard any noise all the time we were there. Swimming pool is adequate with sauna and steam room. Although the hotel was full the pool was quiet. We could not fault the breakfast and the service as in other areas of the hotel was friendly and helpfull. Certain furniture looks a bit worn but as this is a busy city hotel, only natural.
