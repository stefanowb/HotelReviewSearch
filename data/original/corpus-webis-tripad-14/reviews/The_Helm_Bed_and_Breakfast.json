From out initial booking, the contact and communication with Vinny, Shane and Neville was excellent, all our queries were answered without hesitation. The warm welcome we received from the friendly staff in the Helm was unbelievable, they went over and beyond for us. We enjoyed a great night in the pub on the Friday night which had live music. The apartments were perfect, very clean and spacious. The breakfast on both mornings was fantastic. We also ate in the restaurant on the Saturday night, and the food was gorgeous and the service was excellent. The Helm really is a real gem, and all members of our group expressed that they will definitely all return.", "title": "Fantastic Stay in the Helm", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Anon1234186605", "date": "July 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 135148385}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "This is our second time staying.", "title": "very welcoming, great food", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "John M", "date": "July 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134285300}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012", "text": "We stayed for one night at The Helm over the bar in one of their apartments.", "title": "Fabulous Place", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Sully45", "date": "July 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 133785326}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Staff were really friendly and welcoming.", "title": "fine", "user": "justavisual", "date": "June 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 132702468}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011", "text": "Apartment was really clean and wll equipped.", "title": "Fantastic food and service", "user": "lorr1979", "date": "May 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 130681541}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just back from Westport and had a brillant time, we cannot praise the owners & staff enough at The Helm.
