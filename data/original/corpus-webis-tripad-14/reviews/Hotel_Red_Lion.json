Our room was one of the rooms displayed their web sites(----). We found our room to be very large, clean and neat -- plus, the bedroom had a view of the hills which was absolutely beautiful (especially at night when the tower was lit up). Even though there is no air conditioning (we were there during a very hot spell) it seemed as though the hotel's location (close to the top of a hill) provided many refreshing breezes. Not only were we right next to the castle, but we also had many wonderful eateries to choose from (and did I mention it's proximity to the Charles Bridge?). The only down-side of this hotel is that because it's up the hill a bit, it can be a tough climb; however, one suggestion is to take the trolley to the castle and then walk down to the hotel. The restaurant in the hotel is very nice and quite convenient.

Definitely the place to stay for a quiet, peaceful trip (no stag or hen parties in evidence). Only down point about our stay was that on arriving late on our first night we were sent across the road from what I knew was the hotel I had booked to a different hotel. We were told we had to stay here and could not move. Given the late hour we reluctantly stayed in the other hotel and went across to the correct hotel the next morning. We were told \"Other hotel is the same as this one, you have to stay there.\" After a bit of a barney with the manager we were given a room in the Red Lion which was the one I had booked originally. On return I found the other hotel to be cheaper than the Red Lion which I had already paid for in advance. This experience left a sour taste with us for the trip, but made us very wary of being ripped off during the rest of the trip (and many people did try!) On the positive side, I would highly recommend a lovely medieval theme restaurant just down the road from Red Lion. It was really great, the best place we ate at all trip.
