Saw very few signs of mgt around the resort asked to see the GM after several dissapointing meals in the Thai restaurant & beachside cafe as was told that the Mgr would contact our room, which ofcourse never happened.

Despite there being at least 10 other people checking in at the same time we did not feel neglected. The receptionist who was checking us in then congratulated us on our first wedding anniversary and my birthday (both the same day) and went on to talk about an upgrade to the lagoon room. Due to her broken English I understood we were being given a complimentary upgrade, but then came the sting. She was actually offering us the the chance to pay for the upgrade. The cost was the equivelent of over \u00a3500 sterling. I explained that we could have booked it cheaper at home in the hope they would be open to negotiation, but alas she was not. We decided to stick with the Garden Villa which was very nice, however, the bathroom could use a makeover and it was absolutely tiny.

It was at the meeting with him he offered us an excellent lunch and dinner package for three lunches and three dinners for a total of \u00a358. There was also a five day package available but we wanted to experience the food in the town. We did feel that this food package should be offered at check in rather than or at least along side the overpriced room upgarde. The quality of food was outstanding. The breakfasts were among the best of any resort or hotel we have ever stayed in, including the Palace in Dubai and Reethi Rah in the Maldives. Our favourite restaurant was the Italian. The service and quality of food is truly first class and could hold its own with any 5 star resort. The service on the whole was excellent with courteous staff throughout the resort with the possible exception of a couple of bar staff who were a bit sullen. On our anniversary we had booked a private dinner. When we arrived we were greeted by our waitress who was on hand soley for us for the duration of our meal. The area we chose to eat was decked in white drapes and flowers and looked amazing. When we arrived back at our room there was a beautiful chocolate Birthday cake waiting for me. All in all we had a lovely time at The Anantara and would definitely go back. The resort and its surroundings are really much better than the 4 star rating but the standard rooms let it down very slightly although they are clean and comfortable with a lovely terrace. We came here on a very good package having spent an absolute fortune on our honeymoon last year. I was a bit apprehensive but it really did exceed my expectations. The grounds are phenomenal and taken care of by a huge team of gardeners. The only dissapointing thing was that on checking out they tried to sting us for a 10 minute local call by overcharging us by 20 times. I said I would pay the going rate an not a penny more. They agreed. Be warned, everything you use or buy has a service charge which in some ways takes the hassel out of tipping but it does become a bit rediculous when a service charge is added to a phone call or to purchases made at the gift shop. I simply refused to pay these charges and they were removed from the bill.", "title": "first class hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "angieNewcastle", "date": "August 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 18715111, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 tranquill very relaxing in beautiful surroundings and staff were excellent", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "would recomend this hotel to all it is absolutely amazing everything from the rooms to food and staff were excellent. could not be faulted in anyway do not listen to poor reviews. would go back in an instant.", "title": "Enjoyed the hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "alliealliecat", "date": "July 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 17818781, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Lagoon Room was fantastic", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed in the hotel in September, and as a Travel Agent, will try to give you a good all round view.", "title": "Just short of paradise", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "pjay72", "date": "June 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 17204205, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pool and gardens", "disliked": "\u2014 Rooms and location"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Anantara Hua Hin is NOT comparable to a Four Seasons, or Ritz Carlton, or a Sheraton; not even close.

It\u2019s not \u201chot\u201d design place, no extravagant \u201cluxury\u201d with gold and crystal chandeliers, but a wonderful well appointed hotel in a more traditional exclusive Thai design. It has a cool and gentle atmosphere. Very soothing. The lagoons, tropical gardens, swimming pools and beachfront are beautiful. It\u2019s a large property with only 137 rooms nestled either in the tropical gardens or by the lagoons. Lagoon room is best choice. Large with high standard, terrace or balcony, \u201copen\u201d bathroom with tub for two. Lot of wardrobe space! Always replenish of water (4 bottles) in the morning and in the evening. View from our deluxe lagoon room stunning. Fantastic sunset. The excellent breakfast can be enjoyed in the room, by the seafront or in the breakfast restaurant. There are 3 restaurants. Dining next to the ocean having a freshly barbequed shell/seafood platter is unforgettable. The Italian restaurant is beautiful and serving good food. There is also a thaifood restaurant whih we didn\u2019t try but had very good thaifood for lunch at the beach or by the lagoon pool. The lobby bar is calm, beautiful and serving great afternoon tea and evening cocktails (accompanied by soothing live music). Main pool large but can be a bit crowded and noisy from kids playing. There are plenty of sun loungers by the ocean, but during winter there is no real beach. However there are stairways right down to the ocean which is shallow for a long way out on a nice sandy bottom. For the lagoon room guest there is an additional lagoon pool (with private bar) which is stunning. The hotel has plenty of staff and the service is impeccable. The staff is very friendly and surprisingly a general good English knowledge. Unfortunately only thing not impressed by was the spa (although gorgeous). Had the worse and most expensive Thai massage ever. Furthermore, I\u2019m continuously disappointed in Thailand of the many luxury hotels who cannot have a free water service during the hot days! However apart from that you can relax, wind down and enjoy! Should you like to leave the resort Hua Hin center is only 10-15 minutes away. Make sure take a regular taxi not a tuk tuk!
