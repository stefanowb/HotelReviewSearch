The hotel lobby has its own security checkpoint into the airport which can eliminate delays in the main terminal. The hotel offers a pass for security so that guests may enter the terminal to use the restaurants and bars in the terminal if one chooses not to use the hotel facilities.

We were in Detroit for the AAU Junior Olympics and stayed here. The hotel is located in the airport, but you would have never known it, because it was so quiet. The Front Desk agent were extremely helpful. They always made sure I had what I needed. I was traveling with my boyfriend, four kids and our dog Miki. Our room was very spacious. The room attendant went out of their way to bring Miki her own bed and feeding pans. I went to the bar every night and had the Molten Lava Cake!!!!!!!!!!! It was so delicious! Did I say I had it every night. I had the same servers Kimberly and I think her name was Cassandra. They were extremely nice. One night my boyfriend was sick and Kimberly had the Bartender to make him a hot toddie. It really made him feel better. We stayed there for a total of 5 nights! Everything was wonderful!

This hotel is attached right to the airport and is about a 2-3 minute walk from the gates. It also has its own security gate to enter into the airport which saves considerable time. Additionally, there is a side entry into the ticketing area which helps cut time. Rooms were vey spacious, modern and very well maintained. Staff was very friendly. I also commend the room service for how fast they could get the food delivered. The food was a little pricey and limited in choices, but good overall and consistent with other hotel prices. As a traveling tip, very few know that you can go to the front desk and they will get an agent to walk you into the airport to buy food from the many restaurants in the airport itself. Also, for $5 you can get workout clothes and tennis shoes to wear for the gym. If you valet park, Kevin is great - very, very nice guy. There is also a Starbucks downstairs in the lobby and a very well maintained and comfortable lounge/bar and dining restaurant. All the staff here were very friendly. If I could make a suggestion, it would be the difficulty in baggage delivery to the rooms. The hotel is about 15 minutes from Ford Field and Tiger Town which is nice if you want to fly into town to catch a game.

It literally is part of the McNamara Terminal at DTW, which serves all Delta (and only Delta) flights. It has its own TSA security checkpoint, allowing you to step off the hotel elevator and get right in line at security to enter the airport concourse. The hotel has Delta check-in kiosks as well as flight status boards right in the central atrium. Especially if you are taking Delta, the Westin could not be any more convenient. If you are taking another airline, the airport offers a free shuttle from the McNamara Terminal to the North Terminal, about three miles away. I have used that shuttle in the past and found it to be relatively convenient. The hotel itself is as nice as most non-airport Westins. It is either relatively new or else has been immaculately maintained. The rooms are standard Westin rooms, meaning they are comfortable, well furnished, and provided with a number of amenities that make life easier for business travelers (lots of work space, outlets, etc.). I didn\u2019t hear much air traffic from my room, but given how late I arrived and how early I departed, it isn\u2019t likely there were many flights during that brief time. As with any airport hotel, there is no reason at all to stay here if you don\u2019t have to be at the airport, which is too bad, because this Westin is as nice as the hotels I have tried in downtown Detroit. The downside is that it is relatively pricey compared to the other airport hotels located off the airport property, but to me, the convenience factor and the quality differences between this hotel and the others nearby makes the price difference worthwhile.", "title": "Perfect Choice if Stuck at DTW", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Wedgewood", "date": "July 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166797730}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Very courteous checkin and very fast.
