As you look out your window you will see animals of all kinds. We saw giraffes walking by, wildebeest grazing, and young lions on the hunt. The room was so nice, and the staff was incredible. Trevor was our game ranger, and he was so knowledgeable and personable. The kitchen staff created really good meals and also came out to sing to us. We were there only two nights, but wanted to stay for a week. If you can swing getting here do not hesitate.

Elephants, leopards, cheteas, impalas, wildebeest, giraffe, hypo's, rhino's, white beers, they just were to be seen at very vlosse distance. The jeeps are very confortable and the rangers very knowledgeable with a good eye to spot the animals. They care for the nature too. The lodge is a delight: a lot of space, good beds, a lovely bathroom and nice balcony. From that you have a beautiful view of the mountains. The food was awesome, what a good cooks. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. My next visit to a wildpark will be again to Entabeni.", "title": "Wonderfull place with very knowledgeable rangers", "user": "AMBBangkok", "date": "September 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176274287}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "These individual lodges were great as was the evening meals allowing to taste some African cuisine.
