He was the most amiable person we have met on our travels to date, he was such a pleasure to deal with and incredibly helpful. Mateo offered us a welcome drink which we thought was a really lovely touch.

The hotel dinner was well cooked and tasty, although the limited menu offering the same choice of beef, fish, chicken, pasta or vegetarian each night would become boring. Wine and alcoholic beverages are reasonably priced. The two nights we ate in town (I recommend La Tablita) we decided not to wait for the return shuttle and took a taxi back to the hotel instead. Ask the restaurant to call a cab before you leave, or wave one down in the street or go to the taxi office, if you prefer a walk through town after dinner).
