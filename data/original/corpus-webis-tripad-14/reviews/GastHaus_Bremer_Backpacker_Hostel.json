It's a clean, friendly, and above all cheap place to stay and for that I'd recommend it. But I don't know if I'd want to stay more than a day or two because of access to water! It sounds funny, but there are very few sinks in the place. I stayed on the 3rd floor and the nearest sink was on the 1st floor. That sink had only a trickle of cold water. There was only one sink with hot water, in the shower room on the ground floor. There were very few people there in April but in summer I could imagine queues for the sink. But hey, if you bring your own drinking water, forget about shaving, and don't mind walking up and down a couple of flights of stairs to brush your teeth or take a shower, it's a nice place otherwise, and I think more people should visit Bremen. It's a really nice little city.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "melvinPickles", "date": "April 15, 2004", "id": 1786511}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 7, "very good": 4, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 3}, "slim_ranking": 0.733333333333, "description": "The GastHaus is a backpacker hostel and our main customers are people who like to share dormitory rooms for reasonable prices and contact with other travellers.
