The room was comfortable, clean and well equipped and maintained, and quiet, I slept well, a balcony although no significant view, no coffeemaker, no iroing board (not customary in Switzerland in a four star hotel), some offerings of wellness treatment I had no time to pursue, an interesting book of wisdom in the room, food was very good, the breakfast as well (although I had not enough time to enjoy), all staff friendly and helpful, inhouse car parking convenient with direct access to hotel, free of charge for guests. Fresh fruit offered in the lobby around the clock. A small bar visited by locals as well just beside lobby, a bit of atmosphere. Smoking still permitted in designated inhouse areas which was appreciated.", "title": "Good Place for a Conference and Relaxing", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "February 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 55026202}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Service was top notch at the front desk, the dining superb, the pool was lovely.", "title": "Great Stay at the Krone", "user": "meximom49", "date": "November 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 49498045}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Lenzberg is a small town with perfect streets for strolling. The castle above the Krone offers several hours of sight seeing, and a nearby museum is there if your interested. The tourist office is directly across the street for more information on the town. If you are looking for a more active scene the train is a 7 minute walk away, waiting to whisk you off to Zurich! Stay here and save the $ over the Zurich hotels. We really enjoyed our stay at the Krone.", "title": "Business Hotel", "user": "j2bfisher", "date": "September 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 19882920, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Traditional Business Hotel", "disliked": "\u2014 Parking"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled on business", "text": "My company has an office near Lenzburg and I have stayed at this hotel many times over many years.", "title": "Nice hotel in Lenzburg", "user": "Cyberion", "date": "February 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6775877}], "location": {"country": "Switzerland", "region": "Canton of Aargau", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Lenzburg"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 2, "very good": 14, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 11}, "slim_ranking": 0.5}
