I was really impressed w/ the lobby atrium and pool area. This is a very large resort and we found the grounds to be beautiful (w/ plenty of birds and bunnies) and the staff to be friendly. We had dinner one night at the Italian restaurant on site and enjoyed sitting outside by the fires w/ a cocktail afterwards. Very romantic. Also, the lobby bar in the hotel atrium was quite busy and entertaining as well, plenty of TVs around too to check out the sports on. The front desk clerk even upgraded us to one of their executive suites, since it was our honeymoon. All in all, we thought this was a nice place to hang out in the middle of the desert, everything was very green and the resort is surrounded by their golf course.

The pool grounds were amazing with 4 pools to choose from although they needed more security for those lazy butts that leave their towels on their chairs and don't come down until hours later. The grounds were well kept and i loved all the different animals around the hotel such as flamingo's, ducks, swans, parrots and fishes. it is a well relaxed area and you feel like your treated like royalty. the resturants are also very good.for a relaxing/romantic getaway this is a place for you or even for the kids.", "title": "i've been coming here for years", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Krazygirl", "date": "October 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10033240, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the sunset and sunrises", "disliked": "\u2014 the expensive valet although the valet drivers were super nice"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent all around!!!", "text": "This is a great hotel for people of all ages.

Having never stayed at this property before, we had no idea it was going to be so loud at night. Beyond the exceedingly high noise level from the club until 2:00 a.m., it was an enjoyable stay, but it is definitely no Hyatt Grand Champions (my first recommendation to anyone visiting this area). My husband enjoyed the golf courses, and the convenience of the on-site restaurants is a plus. If you want to party and dance and see and be seen at the pool and in the club, this is the hotel for you (although service around the pool was slow, taking almost 45 minutes to receive one drink). If you want a quiet and relaxing get-away for romance or your family, I would probably look elsewhere. The resort fee and the parking fees are absurd, but it seems to be the norm nowawadays. I believe you get what you pay for, but I certainly would not choose this hotel again unless I got a serious price break. Oh, and the gondola has a motor on it, in case you had visions of a romantic serenading gondolier. It is instead a speedy, mess-up-your-hair kind of ride.

A family with young children should steer clear on the weekends - they are pretty wild - especially in the pool area. Everyone has a right to a good time but the Marriott needs to set some kind of rules for activities in the pool just for safety's sake.

The lobby area has recently been re-modeled, and the lobby bar and furnishings are very pleasant. Be prepared, this hotel is BIG! If your room is on the outskirts, you will walk quite a bit, which we didn't mind. The trade off for having a room far way from the lobby is that it is very quiet, and your view will more likely be primarily of the lake, with the pool off to the side. Do spring for the superior lake/pool view, it is worth the money. We arrived around 10pm the first evening (a tuesday) and were pleased to find the lobby bar still lively and there was a 24 hour room service menu. Being very hot, nearly 100 degrees, we didn't want anything to eat, but were glad to go down and have a cold drink after stowing our luggage in our room. Took a walk and explored the property, which has 5 pools, 2 eighteen hole golf courses, several restaurants, tennis and more. We booked the unlimited golf package, which is a great value, and includes your cart. The pro-shop and starter are just beyond the pool, and they will store your clubs, which makes it very easy. I wont comment on the courses because I'm such an amatuer golfer, but my husband, who is an experienced player thought they were very nice. As far as the dining goes, we had the room service once, sushi at the lobby bar as an appetizer one night, and dinner at the japanese restaurant, Mikado one night. We rarely eat at hotel restaurants because we like to get off the property, but everything we tried was VERY good. You can order sushi appetizers during the evening at the lobby bar at a very reasonable price; the other venues can be pricey, but not ridiculous. The on-site Japanese restaurant is very good. All of the seating is at the Teppan tables, so there is lots of conversation between patrons. We ventured to Sullivan's Steak House in the El Paseo shopping mall one evening and had a FABULOUS meal, would highly recommend it if you like a lively atmosphere. They had a jazz trio in the bar, exceptional service, and offer late night dining. The place was full of locals, which is always a good sign. Also had dinner one night at Morton's , which is just across the street from the resort, and was very good. I would recommend it to anyone, just for the experience, but if I had a choice of going back to one or the other, I would go to Sullivan's. The El Paseo is a GREAT shopping district if you get the chance. Other than golf and dining, our time was spent in the pools, which are very nice. There are 3 pools opposite the lobby, one at the spa, and one at the far end near the conference center. The three opposite the lobby are staffed so you can order a beverage or rent a floatie. They also play music which makes for a festive atmosphere. The pool near the conference center is a great getaway from the crowds, but does not generally have beverage service, so it depends on what is important to you. Some of the reviews commented on the weekends being very busy at the pools. We left around noon on Saturday and things were not yet crazy, which makes me wonder if that is only a problem during the summer months?? All of the staff were very friendly and answered any questions we had and quickly helped when we asked. Overall we thought the prices were reasonable, and the stay was very nice; although the key to that may be staying mid week in the off season. We definitely plan to return.", "title": "Great time at the Marriott", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "maciegirl", "date": "September 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8705450}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled on business", "text": "This is an older property, that is just slightly beginning to show its' age. Rooms are nice - but (as an example) not flat screen tv nice. My room was large, with an updated bath that included a shower stall and separate tub. Comfortable bed, desk area, sofa - more of a standard business room than an elegant resort room. I overlooked the lake - quite pretty and peaceful - with beautiful white & black swans! The room was very clean, and the bed comfortable. There are 2 pools - I never went to the largest one - it was always busy & crowded - but people were certainly enjoying themselves! There was a smaller one that was much less crowded (so in my mind, much nicer) but did not have the restaurant and wait staff that the larger one has. Just depends on what you want. Weekends are BUSY with locals and weekdays are BUSY with conventions - so if you are fine with that, you will be happy with this hotel. A nice selection of restaurants, and food was good. One of the best assets of this hotel is the staff - all very friendly and accommodating. (and I had several special requests that were met pleasantly with no hassles!) Valet parking costs 2X the amount of self parking - grounds are pretty - so park yourself and walk! I was unable to enjoy the spa (I was there for a convention) so cannot comment - but it had been newly renovated and I heard some other positive comments. All in all - a good stay, and I would go back. If you are looking for a fun weekend with friends, a family get away, or a \"date\" night with sig other; you will probably be pleased here. If you want a true RESORT hotel, not sure if this fits the bill - more of a very nice, upscale, normal hotel with nice grounds, pools and a spa - however, it does not cost what a true resort costs, either - so - know what you want and set your expectations accordingly! I would suggest spending the $ and insure that you have a room with a pool, lake, or golf course view - otherwise, you may be looking at (and hearing) the parking lot! One cool thing if you have kids - they have a boat that will pick you up in the lobby and take you to your room - the kids I saw loved it!", "title": "Know what you want and set your expectations properly!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "sophiegirl04", "date": "September 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8690553, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 friendliness of the staff and the beauty of the grounds", "disliked": "\u2014 Starbucks was too far from my room :>)"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the Desert Springs Resort and Spa in August 2007 and had a standard room.", "title": "Nice hotel, but not geared for kids", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ucr909", "date": "September 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8682228, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the fluffy, soft beds and pillows", "disliked": "\u2014 teh heat and is a bit boring"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A favorite get-away!", "text": "Overall, our stay was excellent!
