The centre of town was about 20mins by car with no traffic, Opryland was about 15mins away. I didn't experience any problems with the hotel itself but I was only there for two nights, the cleanliness wasn't great but it was sleep-able and the room was quite large. I wouldn't stay there again purely because of the area as it was really bad but if you want budget and it's only one night then it's one to consider. We drove all around Nashville and the best looking part of town was Belle Meade (up market) so if they have hotels there I'd go for that instead.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 18, 2005", "id": 3373143}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Hated the Days Inn", "text": "I would have to agree with the fact that Days Inn Nashville is AWFUL!!!

This hotel was absolutly awful! Never in all my life have I ever seen a hotel that was hounded by police, street walkers, and drug dealers. During my stay the police busted a drug dealer, arrested a prostitute, and housekeeping couldn't speak a lick of english, so needless to say, my room was not cleaned. When I asked for towels, no one could understand a word I was saying. Futhermore, there were roaches in the room. They were in the bed, all up the shower curtain, and under the sink. I am so discussed and upauled that the Days Inn franchise would let a hotel like this carry their name. I will never stay at this hotel, nor another Days Inn again!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 17, 2005", "id": 3012545}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled solo", "text": "I stayed here for one night, arriving late and departing early.

Honest as I am I ask if I shouldn't pay the taxes. The receptionist goes to the manager aka shuttle driver who comes back saying, oh he! No this is not right, he can not stay here for free. Not a word to me. He goes to the back office, calls HQ and after 10 minutes comes back to give me the key. I heard him saying on the telephone to the HQ that was I really allowed to use the shuttle, how could I get this for free, he demanded to speak to a supervisor, etc. Seems like he knew very little about this policy and wanted to kick me out. The next morning I'm checking out at about 04, the manager is waiting in the shuttle outside and the clerk inside helps me. Basically he tells me that is all when I drop off the key, goodbye. I ask for a receipt for the stay but he says there is none. I then point out the paper which I signed the day before that he has in front of him. That paper says the room has a rate of $0 and I tell him a copy of that will do. He says no, not possible. When I insist he goes out to the manager and later comes back in and refuses any questions and tells me to talk to the manager. I go outside and am told that since I didn't leave my cc details with them the night before I can't have a receipt (though they did get my cc details with the reservation), the night is free. Worrying that he will refuse to drive me to the airport I get in the car. On the way to the airport I explain that I wanted a receipt of what I have signed and what we agreed on. The manager then gives me a minor lecture on how I got this night for free and that I should be happy instead of complaining (which I wasn't at all). He wishes he could get stuff for free etc. I point out that I am following the company's rules and found a better rate, that this is a guarantee they have but leave it at that and we are both quiet the rest of the way. I do not leave a tip at the airport. Of course I was polite and calm the whole time but had I not been in need of that shuttle I wouldn't have left without a receipt.", "title": "Maybe You'd Like to Stay at a Dump!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "umslgrad", "date": "October 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5938442, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Avoid at all costs."}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Worst choice ever!", "text": "Bad:", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 20, 2006", "id": 4695301}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Ggrrrooooosss!!!
