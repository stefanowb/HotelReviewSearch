Grounds were immaculately groomed. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, holding open doors, etc. as we wrestled with luggage, carts, etc. Kitchenette was delightful, and we enjoyed flat screen tv with lots of channels, wifi with good signal strength, coffee & breakfast items available in the mornings in the lobby. Beds were firm but not hard, with nice sheets, and we slept well. Laundry facilities very clean. Lovely view of the garden out our window. Parking lot well lit & monitored; we felt our vehicles were secure. Melba Garcia and Lisa Smith were especially kind to us during our stay and we very much look forward to a return trip :-) Would definitely return & highly recommend!", "title": "12 Stars for Value!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LINDA H", "date": "October 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143311494}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Booked three rooms..", "text": "arrived 2hrs early.

When recently visiting family as an adult (on the tail end of a business trip), I hardly wanted to stay at The Gables, where as a kid was a place of ill-repute - and awesome pre-drinking age parties! So Extended Stay America was a nice, welcome find. I've stayed at all levels of hotels and for 1- star, it's alright! Decent kitchen, bed, bath. Aside from the guy in his boxer shorts frying up some eggs with his door open and the other various cooked (ethnic?) foods wafting down the hall, I felt safe and secure as a single traveling woman. I had to smile at the receptionist with the big yellow hoop earrings and bedazzled fingernails...well, I guess that's the local flavor of these parts. I appreciated the free breakfast snacks in the lobby - note that they are merely snacks and you'll want to seek more nutritious fare elsewhere - like in Berkeley ;-)", "title": "Not bad for Budget...", "user": "keryninbali", "date": "March 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 154879123}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled solo", "text": "It is with some trepidation that I approached this one-star win on Priceline.", "title": "Very good for the price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WWLL", "date": "February 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 152287387}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "The location is good.
