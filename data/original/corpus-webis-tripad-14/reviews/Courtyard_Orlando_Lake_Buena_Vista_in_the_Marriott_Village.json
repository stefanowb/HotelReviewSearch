I am well versed on the different Marriott hotels, and this one was okay. We stayed in a jacuzzi suite. The room was nice but seemed a bit worn around the edges. Plenty of mildew present in the shower, which I did not appreciate. The bed was typical super comfy Marriott style, and the whirlpool tub was quite enjoyable. This place is very congested, and it took us about 20 minutes on Saturday night to get out of the hotel and vicinity to go to a restaurant that was 1.1 miles away. Very annoying.
