I had always wanted to visit Morrocco so I jumped at the opportunity to plan a family vacation when we found out my husband's daughter would be there for several weeks.. Granted there are some limitations when you travel with a small child so we had to be very careful about selecting our place to stay. I have to say Villa Mandarine exceeded our expectations. The room was the perfect size for us and my son had his own twin bed in a large vestibule joining the bedroom and bath areas. The food at Villa Mandarine was excellent and their restaurant is well known amongst professional locals, the grounds are beautifully landscaped and the swimming pools suited our needs perfectly after mornings spent site- seeing. We had the opportunity to meet with the hotel chef and learn about cooking tangines and truly appreciated the diversity of the hotel's international clientele. The people at the Villa Mandarine (from the general manager and the concierge to the waiters and chamber maids) were always a pleasure to deal with and took an interest in making our stay comfortable, fun and memorable.

Welcome was very nice and after a short time we were shown to a suite...we had booked Clemantine but ended up in Pamplemousse (a highter priced room but they of course did not charge extra...people in Clemantine stayed longer than expected). What a beautiful room with two seperate areas and everything you could want. Rooms are scattered throughout the grounds and are all very unique with traditional decor...I think any room would be nice and private. Arranged transfer from airport and they were there to meet us and this went smoothly. We enjoyed dinner in the restaurant both nights and found it good and nice service. At night especially the place smells so good as the gardens give off a very distinctive fragrance with all the flowers blooming. I highly recommend the Villa Mandarine for a stay in Rabat. I will say it is not centrally located and if your goal is sightseeing in the city you might want something more central although it is a quick easy taxi ride away....it was perfect for us.
