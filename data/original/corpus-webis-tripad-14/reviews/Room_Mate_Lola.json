Pluss they have musli, yoghurt, croissants. And also that you don`t have to rush down as you can have breakfast untill 12! Lola is situated in the \"red light district\" I pressume but we felt safe and it was only 5 minutes walking to the main street.

The rooms and general decor of the hotel is very contemporary. We stayed in Room 102 which was great, it had a flat screen TV, massive and very comfortable bed, simple yet sleek bathroom with a powerful shower. Breakfast was continental style which offered everything you could want, fresh breads, pastries, cereals, fruit, juices, hot drinks etc. No complaints at all. The only tiny downside was a bit of noise from some building work going on over the road (obviously not the hotel's fault!), and maybe the location if you were staying there with kids, as it in a red light area, but having said this we did not feel intimidated and had no problems at all. It is only a 5 minute walk into the centre of the town. I would definitely stay here again, recommend it to others and found it very good value for money.
