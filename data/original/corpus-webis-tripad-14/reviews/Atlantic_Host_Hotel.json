During my stay, we utilized one of the number of conference rooms. The staff was prompt and the rooms were set-up and stocked to our satisfaction. The onsite restaurant and lounge offered a great spot to continue our meeting over supper. The meals were very enjoyable and at a fair price. The hotel has done its best to keep the rooms acceptable with updates such as flat screen televisions and some furniture items, however decor and bedding give the reminder that the hotel is older. Despite this, the hotel has done a great job maintaining the rooms' cleanliness and fuctionality; evident that the hotel keeps up on maintainence, which also demonstrates the hotel's commitment. Apart from the conference rooms and onsite restaurant/lounge, the hotel offers a nice indoor pool and fitness room. In the main lobby, guest can utilize the \"single\" internet accessible computer, however a good wireless internet connection is available through the hotel. The choices are limited for hotels in the Bathurst area. By simply having the understanding that this hotel is not a \"5 Star\" and your stay at the Atlantic Host should be an acceptable one. I would stay again at the Atlantic Host Hotel.", "title": "Great Conference Location with Good Onsite Amenties.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "StandingRoom", "date": "May 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 108239746}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Let me start this review by saying there is limited choice when it comes to Hotels in Bathurst. I was surprised by the location of the hotel. Needless to say if you're expecting a 5 star resort this is not it. For its location and age (Let's not kid ourselves) this hotel was very well maintained (Currently being remodeled) I stayed in a nice \"Business\" Suite. The room was SPOTLESS (and I'm picky about this!).
