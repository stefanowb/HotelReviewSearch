The pictures make it look like it is right on the Marina-infact, there is a fairly busy road which separates the hotel from the Marina. The double glazing in our room did not cut out the noise from outside. One morning I woke at around 5am to the sound of a street cleaning machine which went on for ages. In addition to this there was the sound of clattering cutlery and plates from the breakfast room which could be heard each morning in our first floor room. The music from reception which seemed to be fairly constant, could also be heard (albeit fairly faintly) floating through the air vents of our room. We were directly above the lobby and also near the lift and I was frequently woken by the conversations and comings and goings of other hotel stayers.", "title": "Disappointing", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "abskebabs", "date": "September 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 41667926}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "For those interested in using the swimming pool, I would warn you that it is not very big.
