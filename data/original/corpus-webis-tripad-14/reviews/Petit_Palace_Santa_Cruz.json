Only a few steps from the Cathedral and almost every other attraction. The hotel tries to be High-Tech, but I think they tried too hard, which creates \u2013 in our opinion \u2013 a rather cold atmosphere (but then maybe it was just the weather?). The small lobby reminded us of a museum of modern art. The rooms are small, but well equipped and everything worked fine. However, what use is a nice flat screen LCD-TV with only a handful of Spanish channels plus a German, French and English News-channel of which most of them had a bad reception (a problem I encounter in almost all hotels worldwide).

Staff in the hotel (if they could be found) where as polite as you might expect in Spanish Tourist Spots. They do their job, nothing more, nothing less.
