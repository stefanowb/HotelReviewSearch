We had never been to Provincetown before (from RI) and we found this hotel on Orbitz a month before our stay. It looked nice so we booked it. When we learned the weather forecast was going to be very bad (rainy every day) I called the hotel the day prior to see if we could move up our reservations for another week. The woman I spoke with on the phone was very upset, kind of rude. Told me that they require seven days written notice for any cancellation or postponement. After I read the fine print in our reservations, I was understanding about it, and told her that it was fine, we would be keeping our reservations despite the weather. This hotel is literally on the very tip of Cape Cod. It's very easy to find, you just drive through the center of town, down Commercial St, drive until you can't drive any further and you will drive right into the parking lot. We booked a standard room on the second floor. We had the option to upgrade to a beach front room, but hence the weather forecast, we decided to keep our standard booking. The lobby was impressive & clean. But no one helped us with luggage and we had to climb a flight of stairs & carry our heavy suitcases up the long staircase ourselves. The room was spacious, but standard. Nothing fancy, but clean. There are no smoking rooms, so for us that was a little inconvenient to go down & out the lobby to have a cigarette, but oh well. We really weren't in our room that much anyways, mostly downtown shopping & dining (in the rain!) :-(. The day we arrived it was partly sunny briefly, then it rained that evening and rained for the next three days, and it was cold. I will say that the beach at this hotel is absolutely beautiful, but unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy it. The pool was closed for renovations and emptied out. Supposedly it will re-open on June 6th, the day after we left. As for the walk into town, well it is fairly close. We walked into town once (with umbrellas),and it was a little bit of a hike. It took about 10-15 minutes to walk to the heart of Commercial Street. It wasn't much fun in the rain, so we chose to take a taxi most times, which was pricey because even though it was only a three minute ride, the taxi charged us $7 per PERSON (which for us was $14 plus a tip each way). The continental breakfast was impressive. We really enjoyed it. They had danishes, muffins, bagels, fruit salad, yogurt, a selection of cold cereal (the milk in the pitcher was ice cold), a waffle maker, a selection of juices, a variety of coffees, teas, ect. We ate there every morning and was satisfied, No need to buy breakfast elsewhere. There is a lounge in the lobby, a gift shop, a piano in the lobby. Plenty of large conference rooms with windows overlooking the beach. Honestly, for the price of our stay, you really can't go wrong, The location is decent. The hotel is surrounded by a gorgeous beach. I'm sure our stay would have been nicer had the weather cooperated and the pool was open. But oh well. All & all it was a very nice place. Quiet, family friendly. I would definitely stay here again!! And hopefully next time have nicer weather. :-)", "title": "Nice hotel :-)", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jewlsinri", "date": "June 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 131585279}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Did best they could w/what they have", "text": "Stayed here for a conference....

There did not appear to be any elevators, and the rooms are in serious need of remodeling. Examples: I could hear snoring, conversation, and talking from the rooms around me. The bathroom was tiny, and there was no grab bar in the shower/tub. My room had two straight chairs, but no desk and no easy chair. Pillows were lumpy and mattress felt old. The televisions are evidently difficult for everyone to operate; there was a laminated card with instructions for what to do to fix various problems. The restaurant and bar were closed.
