It had a fridge and a microwave, which I paid $10 extra for. I also had a crib, also $10 additional. My son wouldn't sleep in the crib. He is 2.5 years old, and the crib was a bit flimsy and small for him. The toilet was a bit clogged, to the point that it filled to the rim before the water level went down. I told housekeeping and they sent someone right up, but he couldn't get it unclogged, so I told him to come back after I had checked out. The room was very warm, I didn't have to turn the heat on. Oh, I had no hot or even warm water when I went to take a shower in the morning. When I mentioned this at check out the clerk said other guests had also mentioned this, so they had turned it up. Great for the next guests, but really didn't help me much.

I was most impressed with the cleanliness of the room/bathroom, and the continental breakfast selection. The bathroom vent was exceptionally loud and jarring, though, and I could smell cigarette smoke coming into the bathroom even though I was in a non-smoking room. The rooms do offer flat screen TVs but not an HD connection so the quality is quite poor. While I personally drove up from Boston, I know 3 other applicants utilized the free shuttle service from the airport and to UNE. The only negative is that the hotel did not answer their calls to be picked up from UNE, and I utlimately drove them back to the hotel. Also to keep in mind, there are 2 separated parking lots for this hotel, one that can be accessed from I-95 only, and the other only from North Street/Saco.", "title": "Solid Option for UNE Applicant Interviews", "user": "Wendy A", "date": "December 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 146951975}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Saco"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 24, "average": 51, "very good": 96, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 90}, "aka": "Ramada Saco Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.181818181818, "description": "Welcome to the Ramada Saco, Maine.
