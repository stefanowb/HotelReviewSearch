I normally don't like breakfast buffets but this one is not only really good but also is clearly a big draw among the Antalya elite, who come on Sundays with their families. Sitting in the couryard, among the beautiful gardens, is a great way to start any day. Antalya itself has far more to do than one would think. The cultural exhibits alone, from the museums to the archeological sites, are top-notch.

I am still unable to understand why they made the European wing in this classic hotel. Unfortunately I was out of time and the weather didn\u2019t allow me to have a swim either on the beach or at pool but it looked good. The best thing I experienced was the SPA. The SPA was very well decorated and staff was really helpful. The SPA manager was so helpful and welcoming. Check in was a little slow, and I had to wait around 30 mins to receive my luggage in the room. Room was very well decorated. The terrace had beautiful views. From air conditioner to all lights were controlled by remote control. Breakfast was really not good. Less choices and I was surprised to have some fruits which were not fresh. Whole LARA area was over crowded and this place was not having more than 10% occupancy.
