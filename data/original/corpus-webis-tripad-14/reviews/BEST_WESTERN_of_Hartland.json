So it was a prostitute!\" and we all laughed...except the clerk.

It was NO BIG DEAL, but if you want to report me I don't give a [--] because I'm looking for another job anyway!\" We called the corporate office and they took a report, but NO follow-up call from the local manager or the corporate office! Just an \"I'm sorry - I was having a bad day...\" from the clerk would have been nice! Had this not been the only motel in this town (we were there for my son's wedding), we would have left!!! They did, however, loose revenue for 6 other rooms we were going to rent for the wedding party after the ceremony...instead, we paid to have them taken to a nearby city for the night.
