It is a beautiful hotel with alot of history behind it. We were upgraded to a full gulfview suite, which was much nicer than the \"average rooms\". Lots of space, great bathrooms and comfortable beds. The view was good, but only a window, no balcony. There are very few rooms with balconies. Construction is going on with a new addition, but since it was the weekend, no workers were there, so we did not have the noise issue as some previous post. The drinks in both the inside and outside bars are really good, but the pricese are steep, so be prepared for that. I don't think there is anything cheap at the Don! Staff was friendly in all areas. My biggest complaints are the following: It would appear that many more people use the pool facilities than are staying at the resort. By 9:00 a.m. all seats around the pool/beach area are pretty much take either by live persons or towels, books, etc on the chairs. We noticed a great number of chairs that no one ever really used during the day. Lots of people were looking for places to sit, but no luck as the day progressed. Lots of pool side attendants, but they really didn't offer any help in locating chairs that were not being used. My suggestion would be they find a better way of monitoring that situation. There is nothing that prevents people from walking from the beach area, or off the street for that matter, and using their facilities. The outside bar does a brisk business, so maybe they don't discourage the outside use, as long as you buy their drinks!!!!! I've never been blown away for the food, but it seemed this time the breakfast buffet was way over priced and left alot to be desired. That was the only meal we ate there. Great places for breakfast are Skidders and Frog Pond. Lots of food and way cheaper. We prefer the Beach House if you like a more laid back time and prefer cooking your own meals, etc. Overall not a bad experience just pricey.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "cmoye", "date": "August 7, 2007", "id": 8369535}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "My wife and our two boys (5 and 2) stayed at the Don 7/30/07 - 8/3/07.

I planned for us to have a private dinner with a table set for two at a secluded location and a birthday cake I had made at cakesbycarolynn delivered to our room after dinner.

Ron is the GREATEST, very busy man and I was grateful that he took time out to personally greet me and my man.

After sitting in the Sauna we finally left the Spa at 3pm...and guess who was waiting for us to show us to our room RON! Ron escorted us to our suite and first impression HEAVENLY!!! I actually thought they upgraded us after reading all the reviews here I was expecting some tiny cramped room, but no...the music was playing, the ceilings were blue, the bathroom had TWO...yes TWO sinks and the bed looked, felt heavenly...he gave us a quick run down of the room and told us that he had two chairs reserved for us at the swimming pool if we wanted them...Ron sure does know how to think of the little things!! He gave us two coupons for the ice cream parlor and we decided to grab something light to eat at the Sea Porch Cafe. Which of course was great!!

We went down to the pool and Heather our waitress was very attentive, my goal was to sit at the pool, soaking up the sun and drink some \"fufu\" drinks and that is what she did for us.

My husband chose Luxury Link to book our hotel reservations at the Don Cesar Resort and Spa, Saint Pete Beach, Florida. With this option, (to book online through a third party vendor) you pay up front and everything is taken care of when you arrive, except for incidentals, of course. Our flight was great, our convertible car was ready when we arrived at the airport..everything was happening beautifully. We pulled into the Don Cesar early...around 12:00 noon on Friday, June 15th. Realizing we were very early, we checked our baggage with the front staff and checked to see if our room would be available anytime soon. Parker, the front desk clerk assured me that if we would go out to the beachside bar, our room would be available \"shortly\". It sounded like positive information and since we had let the Parker (the front desk clerk) know that we were several hours early and that we were on our honeymoon AND that we were very anxious to check in and get our suits on to go out and enjoy the ocean.......he may possibly find it within himself to periodically check on the availability of our room and give us a reasonable time frame of when our room may be ready. So, here we go: 12:00 noon- check in, check baggage and agreeably head out to the beach bar to have a few cocktails and lunch (per the front desk clerk's suggestion). 2:00 pm- We thought by now, our room is probably ready....the front desk clerk assured us at 12:00 noon that the room was being cleaned and it would be ready \"shortly\". We had spent 2 hours in our travel clothes (from our flight) outside in the heat spending well over $200 on overpriced appetizers and cocktails at the poolside bar/restaurant. We were dying from the heat and anxious to get our honeymoon started. My husband went in to check only to return and let me know that the front desk clerk said that the room was still being cleaned and would be ready \"shortly\". I am starting to get frustrated. I start thinking to myself \"If the room is not ready and will not be ready anytime soon....just tell me the truth so I don't get my hopes up\". My anxiousness is getting elevated, nonetheless, we opt to spend another hour outside in the heat.....waiting for the word on our hotel room that we booked months ago. 3:00 pm.- I can no longer stand the heat so we head inside. I thought to myself if we sit at the chairs directly in front of Parker and the other front desk clerks, they will remember that we have already been waiting for three hours and let us check into our room already....what a mistake! While we sat and waited...thirty more minutes pass...I make repeated requests to get into our hotel room...only to watch other guests receive their hotel room cards and be escorted off to the elevators to be let into THEIR hotel rooms. Keep in mind, our room wasn't anything special...we didn't have any special requests...a King Bed, a partial ocean view, blah, blah, blah......Why were the other guests being given their rooms and we were going on FOUR HOURS OF WAITING?? Finally, around 3:45 pm, 15 minutes short of when our room was contractually supposed to be ready, we ask to speak to the manager. We get a blank stare from Parker and are yet again reassured that the room is still being CLEANED? I think to myself...this must be the CLEANEST HOTEL ROOM EVER!!!! We are going to be eating off the floor...after all...the housekeeping crew has been cleaning OUR room for four hours according to Parker and the other front desk staff!!

Our room was very clean and housekeeping was always very prompt. The biggest thing I greatly enjoyed was all of the little extras that this resort provides. Yes, you do pay a $22/ night resort fee but it actually goes for something, like wireless internet, parking and padded lounge chairs with umbrellas on the beach. As well as padded pool chairs, towels and umbrellas, a great fitness center with classes in the fitness room, pool and on the beach. I also enjoyed the little trats that they bring out a couple times every day like italian ice, smoothies and chilled fruit. All of this for free or at least part of the resort fee.

It is an impressive place and huge, and from the distance looks like a Spanish castle. The lobby is beautiful and stately, and we were given a very large Oceanview room with a couch and small kitchen area. They are just beginning to renovate the guest rooms, and they can definitely use it. However, even though the d\u00e9cor is dated, and the bathrooms are tiny, I was very happy and comfortable in the room. In fact, I commented to our bellman that I loved the ceiling fan, and he told me that the renovation plans would probably remove them. (I think all hotel rooms should have ceiling fans and told everyone at the hotel who would listen not to remove them!!) The Don did not offer a breakfast package, so it can get a little pricey if you eat breakfast there. The bar, wait staff, and the bell staff was amazing \u2013 helpful, informative and very, very welcoming. There were some very nice perqs that you don\u2019t often see such as free Internet and free self-parking. There were a few negatives\u2026..we checked in on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend, so on that Monday as the hotel pretty much cleared out, the housekeeping staff was overwhelmed and they never serviced our room. I mentioned it to the young ladies cleaning the rooms on our floor, but it did never got done. (Granted, I did not call Housekeeping to specifically request service.) On Tuesday, we saw a Housekeeping Manager and mentioned it, and the room was eventually serviced. Another thing we could not understand is why they left the beach chairs and cushions out in a tropical storm-type rainy weekend. The canopied bed shelters with gauzy white material for sun protection looked ragged and wind-blown, and the cushions on all of the chairs were disheveled, ripped and soaked. There was no visible beach staff that I could see. The beach amenities did not match the luxury and classy feel of the rest of the grounds.
