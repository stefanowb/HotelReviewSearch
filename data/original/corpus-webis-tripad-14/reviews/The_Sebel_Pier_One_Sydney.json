This was our second stay at the Sebel Pier One but it was just as good as our first. The service and friendliness of the staff is the highlight of this hotel but they have a lot more to offer, The rooms are so very clean and have all the amenities we require. The bed is comfy and the breakfast ample with some menu changes each day. Who needs a huge room when the surrounding pier is where we want to spend our time? However, it is lovely to pull up an armchair and take in the view from our room. From the time we pull up at the front of the hotel until the concierge delivers our car back to us, it is 5 star service all the way. I love how the staff can detect when I might be having a problem - they appear out of nowhere and ask if they can help. So what are the drawbacks? The rooms on the bridge side of the hotel are not as good as the harbourview rooms and these will be the rooms that are quoted on many hotel search websites and have the lowest rates. Rooms on the 3rd floor have the harbour view partially obscured by the heritage features of the original pier building which would have had to have been preserved. The toilets are loud, but I applaud the hotel's efforts to save water by using these devices. I didn;t find the noise of other toilets invasive although I was aware of them when we stayed on the second floor but not on the 3rd floor. The hotel room rates are quite high.

What a beautiful place. Overlooking the water. Looking across to Luna Park. Views to the Harbour bridge. Cruise ships passing by our verandah. We could have fished from the balcony. TV coming out the base of the bed. This would have to be the most exquisite hotel that I have ever stayed in. Complimentary wine, excellent service and a beautiful suite that covered all requirements. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world. This would have to be the best of the lot.

I have to say we really like this hotel. The location is not too far from all of Sydney's attractions, situated just west of circular quay beyond Dawes Point. From the hotel it is a short walk to the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Overseas Passenger Terminal, the historic Rocks district and the Opera House. The restaurant and bar offer good, reasonably priced food, and being away from all the commotion of Sydney you can sit and enjoy your meal or drinks in peace. The rooms are well equipped, spacious and have a nice decor. Street parking is fairly easy, but there is a fee. I have not used the valet parking, but I believe it is available. The room charge is very reasonable compared to other Sydney hotels.

Rooms are nice, with a very comfortable bed and everything else you need. The only issues of any significance arose next morning--firstly, our sleep was interrupted by what we think was the banging of weights & other gear in the gym (we were in room 11--suggest you avoid that); and secondly, the wait staff could in no way cope with the breakfast crowd. Many basic items on the buffet ran out for periods (orange juice, water in the coffee maker, eggs & bacon), and tables remained uncleared for long periods--it seemed the restaurant was badly understaffed. We also noticed food trays delivered to rooms remained uncollected outside doors for 12 hours plus.
