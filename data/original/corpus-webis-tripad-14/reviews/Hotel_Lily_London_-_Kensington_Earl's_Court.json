As if all this wasnt enough to send me scurrying for the door, when I pulled back the bed cover it looked like the cover had been repeatedly slashed by a knife, there were what appeared to be body fluids (looked like dried blood) on the inside cover and what appeared to be cigarette burns.

There was also chocolate wrappers, a Biro and a hairband lurking there! The draws had ticket stubs, sweet wrappers and other rubbish there too. Most of the drawers didn't have handles or knobs and one was dangerous as a metal spike was sticking out of it. The mirror was coated by a greasy type film that was smudged and couldn't be wiped off with a wet wipe. Breakfast was continental, which was fine but you had to wait for a table and most are for two. It was frustrating when others(two at a time) who had just appeared were called to a table. In the end we left . No instructions incase of fire so was a health and safety hazard.
