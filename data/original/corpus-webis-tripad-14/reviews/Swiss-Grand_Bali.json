The service was good and attentive. Rooms were value for money considering the price I paid and also it has small shops nearby which makes it convenient. Service was prompt too. Disappointing in the sense that it is not really as good as it seems. The mall wasn't that near to the hotel. Don't be fooled. The beach area wasn't that fantastic as there is no facilities compared to Hyatt and the Adoya near by. The place seems run down, the walls have cracks, the room with webs at corners and ants were attracted by food in the room. The place need to be upgraded. The bath tub was really worn out and the shower and toilet area are really old. Need to refurbished as the room I stayed in seems tired. The toilet flush not functioning properly when I checked in and the flush always seems to be weak. Overall just a normal hotel. Also food in the hotel was just normal and breakfast just barely made it.", "title": "Bit disappointing", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lee78", "date": "October 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 10319312, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Big rooms and quiet location away from all things", "disliked": "\u2014 Too away at times and need upgrading"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here for 2 nights first before transferring to hotel nikko bali, its a nice decent hotel and the spa is great.
