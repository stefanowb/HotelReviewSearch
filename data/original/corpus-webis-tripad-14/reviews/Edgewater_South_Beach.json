I went to south beach to celebrate my birthday and I have nothing but great things to say. I am someone who reads all reviews. U name it i check it. It was a few minors things that people were saying about edgewater that kind of made me hesitant but I went with my gut and booked and I was not disappointed. From the time we walked in to the time we left it was wonderful. They opened doors they got you a cab if u needed it they gave u dining tips. What to do where to go. I dont remember many names but The guy who sat in front of the hotel and offered u drinks was just a great nice funny guy. He always had a smile. The young men in the lobby were all helpful. The happy hour didn't offer a lot but the guy Jonathan was really cool we enjoyed talking with him! The room was nice. Had a nice view. Spacious. Clean. And to top it all off when I went in to my room they had a birthday card and a bottle of champagne waiting. That just really put the icing on the cake for me! I will definitely be back!!! :)", "title": "AWESOME", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Tiab3", "date": "October 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 143521428}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "THis is the second time we've stayed at this hotel and just like the first we loved it completely - the location is the best, a few steps from the beach and all restaurants and bars of Ocean Drive and a short walk to Lincoln Road. Very good customer service, very spacious room with kitchenette and balcony, giant TV. One thing I noticed was that I have not heard the neighbors like we did in other hotels, which is great! the best part is probably the delicious breakfast, excellent croissants, on the roof top of the hotel. Be ready to gain a few pounds ... ;-). Happy hour in the evening nice as well. Downside? I don't see any if it is the price that can be very on the very high end. But we managed both times to find a great deal ... oh also if it had a pool that would be great, but we can't have it all - we'll be back.", "title": "Fantastic hotel, cannot get better in SOB!", "user": "nat373", "date": "October 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143473120}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "First time in Miami Beach, this hotel was a great start.

The happy hour was a nice touch with quality beer, acceptable wine and quality mixed nuts and pretzels. We had two room issues. The first was in room 203. It smelled swampy or musty, sort of choked me up. The bed was comfortable and the bath was nice. They gladly moved us to room 303 and the air was fine; however the bed was terrible. It was like a piece of old foam and you sunk down so deep it was like sleeping in a hammock. We asked the front desk to be sure to mention this to the management on our departure and he wrote it down. The reason to stay here is value for location. Be careful of room selection.

The room had all the amenities you would need. The beds were very comfortable, and the entire hotel was very clean. I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel, especially Victor!
