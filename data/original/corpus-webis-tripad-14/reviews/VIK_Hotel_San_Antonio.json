The food was great and always fresh and hot and the staff in the restaurant were lovely. The pool areas are also very clean and plenty of sun beds always available. The lounge and bar where the entertainment took place was very nice but the only thing we found was that the entertainment was mostly aimed at the over 50's, but we were close to other bars and would often take a taxi (about 2 or 3 euros) along the main strip to the many bars and clubs down there, so it wasn't a problem.", "title": "Great hotel", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "JintyMac", "date": "September 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 10022291, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 lovely rooms and showers", "disliked": "\u2014 leaving it."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "very good would go back", "text": "All in all I would recommend the San Antonio but not for groups of young folk looking for clubs.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "stevenDublin", "date": "September 4, 2007", "id": 8655387}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "stayed at the san antonio hotel for two weeks in july.hotel was very clean rooms very small.also bewere at the pool side bar they try rip you off.games during the day very good [thank you jenny].food not that good very cold if you go in late [try room only] food is better eating out all and all good holiday will defo go back [room only though]", "title": "Don't listen to the moaners!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Manc_Ste", "date": "August 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8508831, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I don't usually write hotel reviews but after coming on here and seeing a handful of negative comments, I felt compelled to share my experience.", "title": "4 star you are having a laugh", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "cockney077", "date": "August 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 8469927, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 coming home", "disliked": "\u2014 arriving"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed at this hotel for 1 week just before Christmas last year (2006) with my girlfriend and my mate and his girlfriend.

The hotel room was very large and very well appointed with Queen size bed and plenty of room, balcony was also spacious. Wardrobe (with hangers) and drawers more than ample. Food was buffet style and covered most European tastes with plenty of choice and good quality. They also had a seperate food theme each night. While we were there they offered Chinese, Japenese, Italian, Spanish and seafood nights. (No extra charge). The cabaret each night was very good and of a very high standard. You would not be disappointed. Pools were spacious and clean with plenty of free sunbeds. The hotel is very big, which I'm not used to, but it never felt crowded.

I would recommend this hotel to couples wanting a relaxing and romantic holiday.
