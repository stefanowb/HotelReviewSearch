The bell boy made a big deal of pointing out where is should be and faked shock at the wires sticking out of the wall and even \"called\" maintanance to report it. We called agian the next day to ask about it and they did not seemed surprised at all that there was no control in the room, but said they would be right up to fix it, never showed up. The room was cool, but at night, it got chilly, would of been nice to have the option of turning it on and off as we pleased. The hotel staff overall was friendly.

The WiFi worked a bit slow, but we weren't there to stay in our rooms anyway. There was a note of apology in the bathroom for a small tile repair that had a temporary patch, no big deal. The Expedia presentation was very helpful! The restaurant adequate. We had been informed by a friend to stop at Safeway to get food, so that worked out well, and went to Starmart otherwise.

I have to say that it turned out to be a great place to stay with young children. We had booked a 2 bedroom oceanview condo and when we arrived we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to an oceanfront condo with a wrap around deck (room 901) to be exact for $120 a night on top of the charge that we had already paid through our travel agent. The view was amazing. Each time an employee heard what room we were in they commented that it was the best room in the house. We fell asleep each night to the waves on the beach below and enjoyed sitting out on our balcony looking at the view. The condo was very spacious for 6 people. We were a little taken aback that the 2nd bedroom only had 2 twin beds. As a result, my husband and I slept on the sofa bed. I do agree with other reviews that the appliances in the kitchen need upgrading as does much of the carpet in the common areas. Overall I would say that the resort could use a freshening up, but like my husband said we did not have to worry that the kids were going to damage anything. Housekeeping was very accommodating and came at the time when we asked them to. I thought the beach out in front was great. Many chairs and lots of room. Having 2 pools was great-one was more of a kids pool which was great with little ones. The staff was very helpful with my mother who is disabled. They always got her a taller lounge chair at the pool and even had an extender for the toilet as it sits very low. I do have to say that their \"Kids Eat Free\" program is a little bit of a hoax. It only applies at lunch time, and is contingent on an adult meal being purchased for each kids meal. There also was a special \"Kids Eat Free\" menu that limited the choices.
