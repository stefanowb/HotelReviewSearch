Marco the owner speaks excellent English and Grazia not a word of English but is soooo nice and very helpful. The accommodation is very basic, rooms are average and the ones on the street are quite noisy, poky and I wouldn't want to stay more than a couple of nites. We were asked to move rooms so I can comment on both rooms. We prebooked the accommo but would suggest that there are other hotels same price or cheaper close by that offer more facilities and are good, so look around.
