The rooms are good sized, but with a glass shower cabinet to one side, and no other seperation between the sleeping area and bathroom area. The restaurant is a little expensive for what it is, and my steak was accompanied by frozen french fries. If you are on business in the area, and have a car, this is not a bad place to stay.", "title": "Good hotel, not so good location", "user": "BraddyBarcelona", "date": "October 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 141888563}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Community of Madrid", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Madrid"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 4, "very good": 6, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 9}, "slim_ranking": 0.741228070175}
