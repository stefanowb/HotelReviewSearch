We booked directly with the hotel's online reservations. I had mentioned to a staff member via email when inquiring about specific spa services that my husband & i would be celebration our 10th ann & his bday. In the evening after we had checked in they had brought up a lovely chocolate & fruit desert which we thoroughly enjoyed. The entire staff was very helpful & cheery. Beautiful hotel. This is a new hotel so it was neat being the first one to stay in our room. It is in good location. We either walked were we wanted to go or took the trolley. We did have to take cabs a few times for a few things. Increase the cab rate about $5-$15 from what the hotel tells you. They said cab would be $35 from airport--it was $48. They said cab would be $15 to Northpark Mall--it was $22. Food in Ritz restaurant--ok, this was a disappointment for us. To ecclectic & just not very good. But service was great & again when they found out we were celebrating our ann./bday they brought us out these complimentary little deserts which were very good. Spa----excellant! If I had to come up with a complaint on this hotel it would only be that in our room the TV was on the dresser to the side of the bed rather than in front so if you are watching a movie, after awhile it becomes uncomfortable.

While the hotel is very nice, it's nothing to go crazy over. Upon arrival, the doormen were very friendly, including Isaac & Michael!!--both were attentive & warm. As I walked into the lobby, both the concierge & front desk agent (Gregg), greeted me by name, which was very gracious & welcoming. Gregg was polite, asking me how my trip was & briefly told me about the amenities. He as slow with directions & aloof at times. Upon check-out, he never asked me how my stay was, etc., which was rude & not acceptable @ Ritz Carlton's. The Front Desk was not staffed properly, as he was the only agent for several hours & caused much waiting among other guests. Also, the concierge left at 7pm on a weeknight, & was never there in the AM--not sure what that was about?! Patricia, also a front desk agent was nice, but nothing special. Ana, at Indulge, the hotels boutique, was super kind & I give much kudos to her!! The AM doormen were sweet as well, but not as engaging---they were just kids. However, I hate going to a Ritz & having Average Service at the front desk--if i'm paying $$$ to stay there, then the service should be beyond incredible & it wasn't here, which makes me so mad--people shouldn't he hired if they're rude & can't make a conversation with a guest--RUDE!---The lobby was pretty, with a huge floral arrangement in the center.

The bathroom was nice, but the tub was not deep-soaking & had a cheap look/finish. The shower had a great fixture & the hot water was good. The amenities in the bath were BVULGARI, which are amazing, but it lacked other amenities usual in other Ritz properties--i.e. bath salts, sachets, loofah, etc etc... The bed was incredible!! There was a flat panel TV with great reception, as well a desk, mini-bar, iPOD dock, DVD player, armchair w/ ottoman, umbrella, coffee/tea maker, etc. When I arrived, my room had been turn-downed, with extra chocolates on the pillows, the bed pulled back & ice in the bucket--nice touch. The fitness center, pool, & spa all looked very nice. There was a set-up in the fitness area with chilled towels, bottled water, apples, magazines, etc. I work in the Hotel Industry, & this hotel was just rated #1 in the US by Zagat, but I'm not exactly sure how that is true. Yes, the hotel is Good, but it's just that & nothing more. I've stayed in much nicer Four Seasons & the room at this Ritz was OK, but just missing something, as was the rest of the hotel It's as if the whole place was un-exciting. Nothing blew me away. I only paid $209, & was in the area over the holidays, which is why I stayed, but the rack rate is $369-$429 & up & the rooms are ABSOLUTELY NOT worth that---. I'm glad I stayed, but wouldn't return. Hope this helps! Happy New Year & Safe Travels!
