Our suspicion was that they had actually forgotten the order and had had to reheat it quickly to get it to us. having said that, the waiters were friendly and helpful, but on both nights we noticed a change in waiters between thr order and food being brought out and wondered if this contributed to the delay in our meals.

Everything about the decor both in the rooms, hallways and bar/restaurant were outdated and grubby. We were staying in the 'new' part of the hotel so thought we would have a nice room. However when we walked into our non-smoking room the smell of smoke was overpowering. It was so strong I can not believe that housekeeping could even think to list the room as ready to be occupied. The room was fitted with a tiny TV (11-13 inches) which simply did not work. The bathroom toiletries were also particularly cheap.
