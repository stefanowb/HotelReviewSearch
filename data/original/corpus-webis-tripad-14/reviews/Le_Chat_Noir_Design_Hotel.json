There had been a booking mix-up and we they had no room available for the first night out of 5 nights booked for us and another couple. They provided an alternattive hotel of the same rating in the same neighbourhood, paid for the taxis there and back the following day and also provided a room upgrade (much bigger!) and a bottle of bubbles for each couple. Bargain! Located on the Boulevard de Clichy, a block or so down from the Moulin Rouge we were easily able to walk everywhere locally and catch the nearby Metro train. The room was nice, big, modern, clean and quite sound-proof from the bar downstairs. The reception staff all-hours were great! Safe and interesting neighbourhood, great location even for families.
