We kept checking for the update photos on Thomson\u2019s website and other American websites and could see that it should be finished (hopefully). We had a fantastic holiday and met some lovely people, both staff and guests.

Although we stayed in the star class premier seats on our flight to Maldives we chose not to upgrade for Mexico as we didn\u2019t feel it was worth the money and it more than double the price than we paid previously. We were not disappointed with our seats on the plane and they were still comfortable and you still had TV\u2019s which you could upgrade to premier for \u00a35. We had a choice of two meals on our outbound and inbound flight which was nice as airplane food isn\u2019t always that nice. The cabin crew were pleasant and the service was pretty good.

You will be given an immigration entry/exit form and a customs form during your flight which you need to fill in. On the immigration form make sure you fill in the top and bottom sections otherwise you will be waiting longer. When you arrive at immigration there will be a long queue and they are not the quickest although once you get through there to collect your bags you will probably have another wait as they do not rush to get your bags on the conveyor. After you get your bags its over to customs where you may get your bags scanned but this didn\u2019t seem to happen to everyone. You will hand your customs form to the airport staff who will check it and ask you to press a button, this will either go green or red. If it\u2019s green you\u2019re free to go, if it\u2019s red your suitcase and bag will be checked. After getting nearer the exit there will be a lot of workers who will offer to take your bags for you, if you don\u2019t mind being hassled for a tip let them take them otherwise take them yourself.

However, we have never been away for Christmas before and maybe that is normal. In future, we would likely only go to an adults only resort if we went during Christmas.

The Senor told me ``Oh yes, it is the presedential suite` which I knew was not true. I said no, I know all of the rooms are the same in the Adults bldg, we just want to be sure we are on an upper floor please. He said yes, we were booked on the fourth floor. After we moved away from the counter we realized he hadn`t told us where the building is or how we could find it. So off we went and asked a couple of other people and found our way to our room. Gorgeous room, great view of the pools, grounds and ocean. Good balconey with glass so view was not obstructed. We slept with our patio door open every night. Nice and quiet around our area. There were a couple of little things broken in the room which we told the concierge about when she called us to check on the room. They fixed most everything within a couple of days. We had no problem with the shower leaking, just put the bath mat against the inside of the shower door to block the leakage and tilted the shower head a bit to face away from the door.", "title": "Built Until the Next Hurricane ...", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "HoustonBusiness", "date": "January 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 23207226, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Area for children, weather", "disliked": "\u2014 Quality of construction, water, lack of proper beach"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled on business", "text": "The pools and grounds are very nice.

Then you should avoid this place. YOU CAN'T SWIM AT THE AZUL SENSATORI BEACH. No exaggeration. Between the intense coral and the seaweed, it's just impossible. A few people tried, everyone gave up. Best you can do is walk to the Azul Beach which is about 30 minute walk. But it will just make you sad, because Azul Beach is beautiful and the service blew our minds. We had more service, options offered to us (spritzing, tan lotion, ash tray, invitation to pilates in pool, listing of what's on the beach bbq today) all within 10 minutes - literally more service in 10 minutes than all the time we were at Azul Sensatori. Also tough to swallow: Azul Beach has soft thick sand, unique lounging options, super delicious drinks and a swimming area in the ocean. It also has ambience, which the Sensatori does not. Azul Sensatori is all white stone and everything is glassed in - there's no open-air anything. It's like being at a very nice Sheraton in a very nice location. You can't walk to Azul Beach to swim with your kids because you have to walk through the naked beach to get there and yes, there's a lot of things dangling and giggling in the sun. If you like taking nice long beach walks, you're stuck with short ones if you're kids are coming because you'll be fenced in by nakedness on one side and private ugly on the other.
