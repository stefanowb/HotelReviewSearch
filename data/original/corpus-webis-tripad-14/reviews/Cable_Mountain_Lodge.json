Very nice rooms. Very clean, tastefully decorated, nice kitchen with full size appliances, big bathroom, nice little patios and balconies, beds very comfortable and cozy, flat panel tv in living room and bedroom. The pool and jacuzzi very nice, especially after the long wonderful hikes. Pool water was warm even at night. The views are breathtaking.

Comfortable sofa and chair in the living room and small dining table for 4. There is a washer and dryer available next to the office for $1.50 each. Took our own detergent sheet but you can buy it from the office if needed. Check-in was very quick and simple. There are no elevators, if you are on the second floor you will carry your luggage up the stairs. We wanted to be on the top floor for more quiet. Guests were quiet and not disruptive at all. The view from the room is fantastic, there are chairs on the balcony where we sat to watch sunset and moonrise. Mattress was very comfortable, the entire suite was spotless. Very short walk to the park entrance and visitor center. You can ride the town shuttle to most restaurants. We walked to dinner a couple times as there are sidewalks on the main road. It was near-perfect and worth the cost all the way. Quibbles - lack of drapes in the bedroom allowed more light in than we are used to sleeping with and the maid missed us one day, but she brought me coffee for the next morning and we don't care to have fresh sheets and towels daily, so it was OK.", "title": "Great Stay, Great View", "user": "Lola2104", "date": "October 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141956421}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "There were 5 of us family members in a 1 bedroom suite with a fold out bed and a sofa bed.
