The entertainment was better two years ago and you could join in the dancing etc. But all in all, we still all agree the Grande is the place to stay in Ocho Rios and if you go hungry it is your own fault, the food was excellent and the grills were awesome !!! The bartenders were not as friendly as they use to be, either were the servers, we understand they are there to work, but a lil chat and friendly smile would have been nice. I did tell one of the supervisors if you are not friendly like all Jamaicans are, than noone will want to return right ? He agreed as he never even stopped to see why I made the remark. Guess they are not as friendly as they use to be !!! But still will stay there again, and enjoyed Ocho Rios as always. The shopping, The Ruins for lunch is a good outing and beautiful pictures, but the next time will visit there at night when all lit up.

We are in our early thirties. We had a great time. Pros of the resort are the service, cleanliness, food and pools. The cons are the elevator service, beach and ride from airport. The staff at the resort are friendly and professional. The guys at the water sports are accomadating. The wait staff is attentive. The food at the three specialty reasturants is very good. I would say the Italian reasturant was the best, the Carribean reasturant and Asian resturants were also enjoyable. Make your reservations upon arrival. They book quickly. The buffet reasturant for breakfast, lunch and dinner were also superisingly good. The food was the best we every had at an all inclusive resort. The alcoholic drinks can be on the weak side but are tasty. The elevators ran very slowly. 1 of 3 was not working for almost the entire week. Even when it was working it was slow. If your room is on the third floor or higher you need to plan your day so you don't have to use the elevator too often. Some advice, request a room in the south tower. The north tower is still under construction. The pools at the resort are very nice but the beach was not. The beaches are small and not what we expected. The water was murky. Water sports were still fun, but not a typical caribbean beach. Be prepared for a 2 hour bus ride from the airport to the resort. Our plan landed at 12:30pm and we did not get to the resort until 5:30pm. The bus companies wait for the bus to fill up until they will leave the airport. Once you arrive at the resort you will forget the exhuasting ride. The resort is in walking distance to the town of Ocho Rios which was convenient for shopping. Do not forget to bargin with the locals. We went on 3 excursions and recommend all 3. Horseback riding in the ocean, Cool Runnings with Dunn river falls, and the Canopy tour. All were worth the trip. The locals in Ochos Rios town were not so bad. We expected to be constantly solicited but were not. Also do not depend on a wake up call they never called, there was an alarm clock in the room. At high usage times the shower might be cool. We did loose power and water for a couple minutes but both instances were corrected quickly. But it was \"no problem mon.\" Your in Jamacia.
