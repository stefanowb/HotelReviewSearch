The location of the hotel is perfect for both business and enjoying all the night life that Austin has to offer. The hotel is split down the middle between a Courtyard and the Residence Inn. The rooms on the Residence Inn are nice and spacious. You get a fridge and a microwave. I really like having a fridge. The staff are polite and accomodating. The only negative to the hotel is the cost of parking, but you really have to expect that with a downtown location.

I am always impressed by front desk staff that can recall names and Susanna was top notch. The valets were quick although a couple of times it took two phone calls to get hold of them.

It's basically like having your own flat in Austin, and the location is fantastic. The suites have full sized kitchens, and mine was immaculately clean and very large. I really enjoyed my room. I also swam in the pool (a bit chilly at 74-75 degrees, but fine for swimming laps on my own--it would have been crowded with others trying to do the same thing), and the breakfast spread was diverse and very fresh/tasty for an included buffet. I also appreciated the \"free\" wifi. The only main complaint I have is that they tried to double charge me for parking, but I caught it before checkout and got it resolved without a problem.
