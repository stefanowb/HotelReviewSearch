Loved this hotel. Rooms are clean and hotel staff so friendly and courteous. The only thing was the AC unit that made noise every time it went on and off. For the price payed per night, they should have a built in system. Pool was great and view was spectacular. Also, I expected my room to be cleaned the next morning but it wasn't. We had left early (8 am and came back at 1:30 pm). However, I must say they are very good with answering requests. Upon arrival, our TV wouldn't turn on. They immediately came to fix it. And when asked for extra towels, housekeeping was quick to bring extras. Would stay again at this hotel. BTW, parking is $22/day but so worth it. Price stays the same and you can go in and out as many times as you like.

There is a nice beach we went to at Fort Zachary Taylor but it doesn't compare to the above. The Hyatt does offer two seating areas that have sand bottoms and a large sun deck. We had to wait a little while the first day to get a spot in the sand but it wasn't bad. We didn't seem to be there during a busy time; however, I did see others saving chairs at the pool in the mornings...not suppose to but no one said anything. So, yes, beach areas are small but very clean and nice. Also, I think it depends on the time of year you visit, as mentioned we visited in April and we had sun at both the beach areas and pool most of the day.
