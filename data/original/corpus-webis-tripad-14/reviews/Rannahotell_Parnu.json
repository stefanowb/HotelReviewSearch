The beach is huge and stretches for miles and is shallow enough for the first 100 metres or so that we could let our 6 and 4 year old wander off into the sea for a splash around without any concerns. We stayed in a one bedroom suite in the hotel - excellent value for money - view of the sea, balcony and two TVs - especially handy during the World Cup. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly at all times. Short walk into town where there were many restaurants and bars. Located next to playground also and a very short walk to the Tervise Paradis hotel and indoor waterpark.", "title": "Fabulous location", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "wrightser", "date": "September 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5803138}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Location, Location, Location", "text": "Altogether an excellent hotel in a lovely town.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "Jackie34", "date": "August 7, 2005", "id": 3743568}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "The Scandic Ranna Hotel is one of the nicest hotel\u2019s I have ever stayed in.

The staff was excellent as well as the choices in the breakfast buffet. Unsecured internet wireless worked well. The roof top bar was a great place to relax at night and drinks very reasonable.
