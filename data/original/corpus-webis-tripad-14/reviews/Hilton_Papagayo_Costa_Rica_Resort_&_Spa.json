The country as a whole was wonderful! I found a review from a traveler who recommended Herson Segura as a travel guide and he was simply amazing! He picked us up at the airport, he had a sign with our name on it grabbed our bags and off we went! He only charges $40.00 versus $55 and trying to find a taxi who may not speak such great English as Herson. His tours are private and fabulous! He took us to places only the locals know of and you are alone not with tons of other people, so you can choose how long you want to stay at each site! The horseback riding and jungle tour at hornillas was simply a once in a lifetime opportunity! Mud bath sauna hot springs in a crater with tons of wildlife! We even saw a white faced monkey above us on the way back from the jungle, which was a private tour with a great kid who spoke great English! Herson took us to Coco Beach to shop for less than a taxi ride and we choose how long we canted to stay and shop, try Coconutz bar and the British bar down the street, great times. If you go, make your excursions prior to getting there or the first day, but take the first few days to relax at the resort. Rooms 101-109 are the first row on the hill overlooking the beach. Then they go 116-134 next row up hill. The 400 rooms are way up the hill but I was told not to take the ones in the hotel part due to lack of air conditioning and not updated. Our room was 118 great for wildlife and view and close to everything, only complaint is double beds and they would not move us to a king bungalow (hilton honor points vs. 375.00 nt income I suppose). So specify king bungalow in 100's close to everything! Very hilly property so bring walking shoes or take shuttles they have. Beaches are volcanic sand and be aware of small crabs and blow fish at night so you don't step on them. I recommend this to everyone! Wish I would have been there for 2 weeks so I could have gone on more tours with Herson! herson03@yahoo.com.....

It was a very pretty resort and had a rustic feel because of all the hills and little bungalows. The shuttles were all over the place to take you to and from places if you didn't want to walk. We were staying near the spa and spa pool which was a great location. We had a great view of the pool and the beach (we were in room 393).

We at most breakfasts and dinners at the main dining area by the big pool and there was a good selection. The spa area had great smoothies as well. We had dinner (it was Italian) at the restaurant at the spa and it was great. The day of the wedding my sister, mom and the Fiancee's mom had manicures and pedicures outside by the spa. It was really cool and I think it helped my sister relax before the wedding. The wedding was wonderful. It was on the beach right now from the spa at sunset. The staff was great and there was an impromptu audience. The pictures are great because of the setting and decorations. The reception dinner was also wonderful. he was held in the gazebo by the main pool. It was very intimate and the service was great. It was a very nice trip overall and seeing the iguanas and hanging out on the hammocks was relaxing. I would also recommend the Palo Verde river tour where you can see tons of crocodile, birds and possibly some monkeys. Also try and go shopping down at CoCo Beach. You can arrange a driver with the front desk. There are some better deals (price wise) down there and monkeys in the trees above your head!

About 2 days later it was fixed. Once this was done it was great, but prior to it getting fixed it was loud and ran continuously, our room was a bit warm. It was not worth ruining the vacation, the temp was still tolerable and the problem was taken care of. We were nervous at first with maid service because we did not see her for 2 days. When she did come we tipped her $2 and saw her everyday after that and she did a wonderful job.", "title": "Nice all-inclusvie", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "longhorn77079", "date": "April 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7368095, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 All-inclusiveness, staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Beds"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Premiere Fiesta was Great for the Money!", "text": "POOL: The pool was ok, a little dirty but not worth getting upset about.

The resort is on a fantastic piece of land over looking the Bay with a beautiful beach. The resort itself was very very clean. We saw the bartender at the spa bar cleaning the beer tap with a toothbrush! Now that's clean! Our rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. We were in adjoining bungalows and had no problems with the air conditioning or bathroom facilities. The bathrooms in our bungalows were very clean but could use some upgrading. I'm a picky eater and I had no problem finding something to eat. We found the food very nice with an excellent selection. I also took advantage of the spa facilities while there and had a four hand message on the beach in the cabanna as well as a volcano body wrap and the service was excellent and the spa facilities were again very clean and comfortable. The staff at the Fiesta is the cream of the crop. We don't speak Spanish but had absolutely no problem communicating as most of the staff can speak English. All of them were very friendly and accommodating. The \"Fun Patrol\" as I called them are a talented group of young people who you will see are consistenly on the move making sure everyone is having fun, from early in the morning handing out beach towels to the afternoon dance lesson by the pool (lots of laughs) and then finally putting on an eveing show (1 hr) with great costumes and great dancing. The bartenders are quick with a smile and provided great service and even took the time to teach us a little bit of Spanish. We are planning to go back in 2008 .
