Looked recently renovated hallways. Quiet, surprisingly roomy, and clean room on 7th floor. New bed mattresses. Clean bathroom. Despite the room facing the I-95, it was quiet. One big negative -- noisy A/C-heater unit. Free breakfast was marginal. Breakfast staff busy chatting and didn't really care to replenish the foods. It is about 10 minutes drive to downtown/Yale. It is a reasonable priced hotel around the area. Noticed there is IKEA nearby.

This time the key worked, and nobody was there...but there were two suitcases, a bottle of medicine and a toothbrush in a glass...so they were 0 for 2 in assigning me an unoccupied room.

They have a free shuttle within 5 miles of the hotel, which includes Yale and all of downtown. Parking at the hotel is free, while parking downtown during the day is expensive and hard to find- so the shuttle is a fine service. the free breakfast is pretty good and the dining area is pleasant. There is a Greek restaurant on site, but I didn't eat there, preferring a short walk to an Italian restaurant that was a two minute walk across a parking lot. The building is an 8 story, late 1960s style concrete rectangle; it looks kind of like a late 60s vintage college dormitory building. The area is pretty industrial, but it is easy to get to off of I-95 near its intersection with I-91. There is an IKEA store literally next door--some local maps show that but not the hotel--and it is also close to a bank, the Long Wharf Theater and a Mobil station; a post office is a short walk. Train station would be a bit under a mile walk away; not a scenic walk, but doable. Ditto downtown, but a bit farther--about a mile and a half. Small but decent outdoor pool on site; fitness room is small but clean and has an elliptical trainer, stationary bike and treadmill, but no free weights. Bed comfortable; hot water ample; room very clean except windows could have used cleaning.

I was in New Haven for work at Yale New Haven Hosp. The hotel is right off the highway, easily accessable. I was traveling alone, so I got a standard queen bed room. I stayed here based on the reviews of this hotal, and reviews of other hotels in the area. It basically seemed the safest. The room was average, clean. Bed comfortable. Iron and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was something less then to be desired. Every time I tried to connect it gave me the hardest time, and while I was here I had to call the hotels tech support 3 times, who were basically useless. It's a pretty big place, and was far from full, so it was annoying when they put people in the room next to me who were really loud, and may as well have been in the room with me. But that was only 2 nights. The continental breakfast was decent. Lots of bread, muffins, bagels, english muffins. Cereal, a belgium waffle maker and yogurt. Juices, coffee, tea. I think over all, it seems eqivalent to most other hotels, which made me rate the price poor. Between $83-$99, a night, but I guess it's better to pay a little bit more then be in a crappy area. This place is about 4 miles from Yale New Haven Hosp. There is a small diner next door......I ate there 3-4 times, and their food is good.

We checked in very late at night after a harrowing day of driving. I had carried our things from the car to the lobby, a mistake as I'm 6 months pregnant and was also carrying my little girl. The girl at the front desk saw how frazzled and out of breath I was and had a coworker carry our things up to our room, which was SO helpful. The room itself was more than adequate. I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say this hotel is dirty. I certainly didn't encounter this, and I'm very picky about filth since I have a baby. The continental breakfast had everything you could want and then some. The only gripe I have about this hotel is regarding the room key. Before we checked out, I decided it made the most sense to make several trips out to the car with our things rather than try to carry it all at once. This would've worked out fine were it not for the fact that each time we went back up to retrieve more bags, our room key wouldn't work. This then necessitated many trips back and forth from the room to the front desk to have them reset the key. Sometimes the reset worked, but more often it did not. What would have been three trips turned into about thirty-five, and by the end I was absolutely exhausted from carrying my daughter. But the front-desk clerk was so apologetic about the problem, and eventually came up and opened the door for us herself.
