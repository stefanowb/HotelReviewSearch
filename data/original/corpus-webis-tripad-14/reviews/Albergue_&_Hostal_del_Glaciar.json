We had our own private room with a bathoom (great shower!). The hostel was near the main avenue (with restaurants and shopping) just over a small bridge. We had earlier stayed at hotels during our 2 week trip through Argentina, and had to remind ourselves not to compare the hostel to a hotel. The cons included a window that looked out onto a concrete wall; the bed was just okay, the room was a bit small; the room door and window were rather flimsy - bit worried that the room was not secure; and we could hear everything from outside the room. If the hall was carpeted that may have help reduce noise.", "user": "bbjj0827", "date": "January 8, 2008", "id": 12450353}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fabulous Hostel", "text": "However, for a hostel - the pros are that the bed was okay ;-)", "user": "The_Tembas", "date": "August 21, 2007", "id": 8462414}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "LOVED the Albergue del Glaciar!", "text": "Also, centrally located; our own bathroom; great breakfast; friendly and helpful staff; we arranged a tour of the infamous glacier through the hostel; and other visitors were just as friendly. The tour of the glacier was perfect. Fantastic tour gude - she was the best.

We saved $$$$ - which meant more $$$ for other things (shopping, eating, etc). We stopped by the new trendy hip hotel that recently opened in El Calafate - and it just seemed out of place. The costs were triple (if not more) than the hostel - and we were glad to be at the hostel as it fit the town and our experience there better than the trendy, hip place.", "user": "falseneutral", "date": "May 28, 2006", "id": 5229283}], "location": {}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 6, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 3}, "aka": "Albergue & Hostal Del Glaciar El Calafate, Argentina - Patagonia", "slim_ranking": 0.738095238095, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}}
