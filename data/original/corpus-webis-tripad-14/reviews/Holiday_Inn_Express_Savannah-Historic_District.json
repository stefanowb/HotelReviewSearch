We didn't use the pool, so I can't comment on that (although it was on the roof, and the views from up there were spectacular). The bed was comfortable, the room was spacious, the wi-fi worked well, and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. I loved the location -- the riverfront was just across the street, and there were a number of good restaurants within easy walking distance. (Tip for art lovers: there's an extremely talented Haitian artist who sells paintings on River Street. His name is Jean Claude Martin, and his paintings are amazing.) The historic district of Savannah is worth seeing, and most of it is within an easy walk of this hotel -- even in the August heat.

Also the concierge was eager to help us in any way & gave us an excellent choice to go for breakfast one day.

There was not one day that someone at the front desk didn't say good morning to us as we left and returned to the hotel. Also, front desk was also so calming during a recent tornado warning ( thankfully it didn't hit) that occurred while we were there - kudos for keeping your cool among the harried crowd! Housekeeping was superb - hotel is new and very clean. Beds were very comfy and cushy. This is certainly not your average Holiday Inn. Perks were that our stay came with a complimentary continental breakfast which was nice - and our room had a small fridge and microwave. Apparently the company that owns this property also owns the other hotel we stayed at for the first part of our trip, the Holiday Inn in Charleston SC, Historic District.

Nice flat screen TV. Plenty of drawer/desk space. Location is excellent. You are a short walk away from everything. We did not try the bar, but saw a lot of folks sitting there each evening. Breakfast is a disappointment...but OK for a \"throw in.\" (some muffins, yogurt, coffee, tea, cereals and juices...cold sausage, biscuits and \"hockey puck\" pre-made omelets). Skip it and walk down the street to one of the local cafes. Much better. Also, a tip on the parking. Hotel parking is $10 a day, per day. Parking is located in a public building directly behind/beside the hotel. Weekend flat rate if paying yourself at the garage is $3 a day/entry versus $10 a day at the hotel. Weekday rates are $1.00 per hour...so if you're visiting on the weekend you can save money by paying for parking yourself instead of validating at the hotel. All in all, a quiet, clean hotel that I would recommend for a visit to Savannah.
