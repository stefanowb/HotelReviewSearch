We had 5 people there (1 couple in each bedroom and 1 person on a roll out double bed couch.) It was a great experience. The Jockey Club is nestled between the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio. It actually connects to the Cosmopolitan via an elevator. You have full access to all the amenities the Cosmopolitan has to offer including their great pool. There's an easy access to the Bellagio too so you don't have to go down to the street to walk back up to the Bellagio. We had an incredible view of the fountains at the Bellagio and the whole Strip headed down past the Mirage, etc. There are two crosswalks across the Strip right in front of the Jockey Club which is really convenient. The rooms were clean, the flat screen TV's were great, the kitchen had everything you need (non food and drink) and the housekeeping staff was attentive. The only caveat is DON'T DO THE TIME SHARE PRESENTATION IN ORDER TO GET THE FREE INCENTIVES. If you don't do that, The Jockey Club is truly unbeatable. The price is so much more affordable and the location is as good as any on the Strip. I totally recommend it. I will go back there for sure.", "title": "You can't beat the location and price", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "georgenmiller", "date": "March 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155891333}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Got there March 16 and stayed 5 days.

We drove to Vegas and had a really hard time finding this hotel and the parking entrance. There is a small sign right before the Cosmopolitan if you're traveling S on the Strip that's easy to miss. Anyway, once we got parked, it was another challenge to actually find the hotel and lobby as we made the mistake of getting off at the Casino level of the Cosmopolitan & wandering around before finding someone to re-direct us. So I would advise anyone staying here to really get clear directions on where to go if you're driving.

Staying here was not my preferred location but since we had 3 in our party & didn't want to share a room, we needed somewhere cheaper than the main hotels but wanted to be close to the strip because we were only in Vegas 1 nite. So it does provide better value as it's close to the Strip & parking was free. Also, there is NO RESORT fees. And if you want to gamble, you are very handy to the casinos in the Cosmopolitan. And the Bellagio is also pretty close so you can dine at their buffet restaurant as the Jockey Club has no restaurant or casinos. Our view from our room was onto the Strip (the Parisian) & a car park below. Early in the morning we were awakened by very loud noises outside - possibly laundry or garbage trucks picking up stuff.

Needless to say it was not and after waiting for over an hour in the dump that is the Jockey Club without the tour even starting, we began to ask what was going on. Fortunately I had insisted on getting a photocopy of my deposit receipt and with this in hand asked for either the tour to begin or to be released with my $40 and our show tickets. Eventually we were shown into a room where dozens of shaken and shattered souls who had endured a tour were waiting grimly for their comps. I was informed that we were at the back of a queue that would beat least a further 90 minutes. When I objected to this, an irate woman screamed at me that I should leave , and when another victim complained she taunted him with the words \"do you expect to get the money back out of the slot macchines as well, sucker?\". He left with his trembling partner when they threatened him with security. Eventually we got our $40 back and our comp tickets and considered ourselves lucky to have escaped the harrowing, brow-beating sales attacks that were described to us, but still thoroughly disgusted that such an ill-intentioned, mean-minded operation should be allowed to flourish in open view, even in Vegas. Such bhaviour should be intolreable in any society that claims to be civilised. The idea that anyone would pay money for a time share in this depressing dump of their own volition or free will is ludicrous, and is clearly why such an approach is deemed necessary.

A couple of items to be aware of: we asked when we made the reservation for a view of the Bellagio fountains, but were told they were not available upon check-in and the complimentary shuttle only runs on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, so if you are staying over a weekend it does you no good. However, Walgreen's right across the street has plenty of items available to stock your kitchen in your suite including adult beverages and it is open 24-7.
