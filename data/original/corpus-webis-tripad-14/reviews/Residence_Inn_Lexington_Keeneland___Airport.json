All four kids were treated with kindness by the staff, and we were made to feel pampered throughout. Housekeeping even called before going home for the day once to make sure we didn't need anything because we'd had our 'no service needed' sign out all day. Wow. The tennis/bball court outside was great for getting kids outside, breakfast hot and much nicer than the usual free morning meal, and the rooms are gorgeous. Be aware the kitchens don't have ovens, but the microwave got us through.

Sounds silly but it made a HUGE difference. You don't feel like you're in a hotel. It's like an actual apartment. The kitchen is outfitted fully and the staff have been beyond nice.
