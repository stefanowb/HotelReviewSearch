Rate was good, booked via a travel company in Ho Chi Minh City. The room was good, bathroom OK with a good shower. The staff were good, the aircon worked a treat, the location was great - near the main river strip and near a supermarket and lots of interesting streets/shops. One let down was the breakfast which was not very enjoyable and not well replenished if you got there in the last hour of service. A good tourist class hotel for a few nights if you don't want to splash out on the top end of town.", "title": "Good location in Can Tho but not very flash", "user": "CiaraB", "date": "January 12, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 53252354}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled solo", "text": "I stayed in this hotel for one evening and it was clean and well appointed.

The ferry's price recently went up to VND230,000 each way, still less than US$15. Our rooms on the 5th floor overlooked an intersection with a large bookstore and a huge Co-op market on the other corners. The location is OK, a short walk to the river. The breakfast buffet is extensive, mostly Vietnamese food, with cooked to order eggs, a nice selection of fruit and two dry cereals. This buffet is available to anyone for about VND50,000 so there are a lot of local people dining, especially on the weekend mornings, which stressed the food production, so some items were not available once depleted. Good WiFi in our room although the routers on our floor were not connected to the internet. Typical of too many Vietnamese hotels the cleanliness of our suite could have been better. The floors were carpeted but rarely vacuumed, the second half bath was not properly cleaned when we arrived and the trash wasn't all taken away each day. The main bathroom was fabulous with an incredible glass enclosed tub/shower, steam, jacuzzi and much more. First device like that I have seen in a hotel in Vietnam. We did receive fresh flowers and a basket with fruit every day. When the ferry was cancelled for the day we had planned to leave we checked out of the Ninh Kieu2 to try another hotel, the Kim Tho Hotel(very nice and immaculately clean) due to the cleanliness issue. Can Tho City, and our hotels, had very few tourists visiting when we were there in mid-May '08.", "title": "New(er) facility, nice suite@$113/night X4", "user": "clixtox", "date": "May 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16485107, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, breakfast buffet, amenities", "disliked": "\u2014 dirty carpet, housekeeping"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008", "text": "I was with a large group - 32 - on a humanitarian trip and we all stayed at this recently updated hotel.
