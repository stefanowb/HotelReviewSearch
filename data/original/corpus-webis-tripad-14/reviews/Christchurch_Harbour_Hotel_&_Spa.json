It was amazing so decided to return that evening and enjoy it after the screaming children had left. We checked the time with the spa reception and was told as long as we were out by 9 it didn't matter what time we went in. Unfortunatly this was incorrect information and we were told we were 5 minutes too late to entre. However we were allowed in but the cleaners had obviously started their work although we still had 40 minutes till closing. We enjoyed the spa and went back to the changing room. As I started to dry, I could smell a clean chemical smell. Then as I was dressing I found it hard to breathe and ran from the room as my eyes started to smart.

Rooms very clean and fixtures and fittings of a high standard (still didn't managed to suss out the touch button light switches in the 24hrs we were there, drove the wife mad just trying to switch bed side lamp off!!)
