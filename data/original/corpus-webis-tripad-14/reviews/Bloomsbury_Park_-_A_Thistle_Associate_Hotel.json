A twin at the front and a double at the back. The service was excellent and the rooms were fine. They are small and very cheaply fitted out, carved out of an old building so the partition walls are relatively thin. So if you have noisy neighbours it could be a pain. The biggest downside was the inability to adjust the room temperature other than by opening the window. This was OK at the back of the hotel but if you have a room overlooking the very busy Southampton Row it is not really an option. Breakfast was good in a pleasant restaurant, and the hotel is handy for Covent Garden, Soho and the British Museum.

Read Trip Advisor reviews which appeared to be mixed. It is what it is - a basic hotel with a very reasonable rate if booked as a special deal. We paid \u00a3130.00 for a family room sleeping 3, this included breakfast. Yes the rooms are smalll and the bathroom was bijoux to say the least, however the place was spotless and the staff helpful and friendly. We were located on the 2nd floor 2 rooms in from the front - yes you can hear traffic and the odd siren but no more than any major city. We live in a village so are used to peace and quiet however we all managed to get a good nights sleep. I would say for a 1-2 night weekend stay the rooms are fine, any longer than that and you would need a larger room. The area it's located in seems very safe and is surrounded by restaurants and shops. There is a Tesco Express a couple of doors away, several coffee shops and a 24 hour Sainsbury's near Holborn tube which is about a 10 min walk. The hotel has a small lift. The hotel is a good base for the west end theatres (the reason for our visit) and shopping. The breakfast is good value with a self-serve buffet including fruit, toast, jam, juices, tea and coffee and full english with sausages, bacon, fried bread, hashbrowns, beans, aggs etc. When we checked out the staff offered to look after our luggage to enable us to do some sightseeing - this was great as we were going to Madam Tussauds and had planned on paying to leave it at Paddington.
