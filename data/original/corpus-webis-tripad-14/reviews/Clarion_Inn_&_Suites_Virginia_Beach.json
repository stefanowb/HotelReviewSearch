Once we did this we had no problems getting a seat. We spent a couple of evenings out on the pool/patio area. This was a really nice feature. Our room was plenty big enough for all of us, even with two adults and two teenagers. This was a great vacation trip with only a 3 minute walk to the beach. When we checked in our room was upgraded to an ocean view. This was totally unexpected and completely awesome. No the view wasn't a complete view of the ocean but, since we are from Ohio the partial view was 100% more ocean view than we have at home!
