The afternoon we arrived in Rome, (after our flight was delayed from NYC 3 hours) would have been our only opportunity to see the Vatican museum including the Sistine Chapel; and had it not been for the hotel's prime location there is no way we would have made it in. As for distances to attractions....St. Peters Square is literally across the street; it's about a 5 minute walk to the Vatican Museum entrance (minus time waiting on the long line); and less than 15 min walk to Castel St. Angelo. We stayed on this side of the city 1 night before a cruise, and on the other side of the city closer to the Colusseun for 1 night after our cruise.

It had a marble floor, and a couple of lovely oriental rugs; damask drapes; and simple, but attractive, furniture. There were casement windows -- a delightful contrast to the sealed-in windows in typical modern hotels. I cannot speak for the other rooms in the hotel, but my experience was delightful. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and charming. I felt safe (the front door is locked in the evening), and the location -- just off one side of Piazza San Pietro -- was incredible. We strolled right from breakfast over to the papal audience in front of St. Peter's. The breakfast room is particularly beautiful, and the buffet breakfast was ample and delicious. Service in the breakfast room was pleasant, but on the relaxed side. Not a big problem, as the more impatient among us could just walk a few feet and pour ourselves a cup of coffee. The view from the terrace is matchless. There are a lot of good restaurants in the area, and a taxi stand right across the square.
