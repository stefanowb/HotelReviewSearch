The room was beautiful-complete with fireplace and balcony. Large bathroom included a deep tub, separate shower, his and her sink. Entryway to the room felt like a beautiful foyer with hardwood floors, walk in closet and bar area. Beautiful wood detail throughout the room and the resort. During our stay, the staff was very courteous and eager to please. We enjoyed the lobby settings, deck areas and the pool. The heated salt water pool was very relaxing and a great place to hang out with friends in our group.

I highly recommend massage therapist, Kristen. She is incredibly skilled! I did the 80 minute high-altitude adjustment massage and it was the highlight of my trip. The Spa itself is beautiful and has all the bells and whistles you would expect at a Four Seasons. All the spa staff were extremely friendly and professional. Also purchased the Four Seasons Ginseng facial and buy purchasing both treatments, received a 10% discount on both. Esthetician Michelle gave an excellent treatment!

The kitchen quickly replaced it with a vegetarian option, but it still wasn't what I had ordered and because of the ingredients they chose-I couldn't eat it.

Every detail was perfect. The rooms were spacious, however I was surprised that they had two double beds instead of two queens. This was a little uncomfortable, but the bed itself was delightful. The bathroom was huge and sparkled with granite everywhere, a huge tub for soaking, separate toilet area, and shower stall. The kids were treated like royalty with personalized chocolate chip cookies, a bathrobe with slippers, and hand made artwork waiting in the room upon arrival. The pool was amazing too. Just the perfect temperature for day or evening swimming. Heated bathrobes and towels poolside and a spectacular fireplace to take the evening chill away. The only detraction was that the kids club was NOT supervised as advertised during our stay since we discovered this was their off season and they were not fully staffed. Besides that, the kids club is awesome for kids of any age. They have a PS3, Xbox, foosball table, pool table, and three computer terminals for PC games. Overall our experience was very enjoyable and the property was beyond beautiful.

I don't care how nice this place is DON'T take advantage of your customers! We may be able to afford your hotel but we don't want to be ripped off! At check out we were charged $40.00 a day for COMPLIMENTARY internet, coffee and access to their vehicle (which we never used). I'm sorry Four Seasons but if you look up complimentary in the dictionary it means \"given free as a courtesy or a favor\". That would mean you are false advertising.

I read many of the reviews about the hotel before coming here, and find many of them to be accurate. Since I have stayed at many Four Seasons , I had to think about what is lacking at the Vail location and it\u2019s hard to pinpoint. I believe it is something to do with a lack of personality, the hotel is big and corporate as many have stated, much more so than I anticipated even after reading the reviews. You could as well be in business hotel in Denver or any big city, not at one of the best skiing locations in North America. The hotel needs some whimsy, some personality, some touches that make you feel something about the property. One of the other things is that most of the staff are very young, while this in itself is not a problem, some of them just don\u2019t have the gravitas to pull off their positions. ( One standout person that does have it in spades is Nicolas the sommelier \u2013 please learn from him! ) I also thought about my stays in NY, Toronto, or LA and each and every time I\u2019ve stayed there, the staff makes you feel special, and while everyone is trying very hard, something is lacking here.", "title": "Mixed Bag at 4 Seasons Vail", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sinclair36", "date": "April 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127078935}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Here\u2019s the low down:", "title": "almost perfect", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "colette_m", "date": "March 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126754491}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Largish clean rooms, with very nice bathrooms.
