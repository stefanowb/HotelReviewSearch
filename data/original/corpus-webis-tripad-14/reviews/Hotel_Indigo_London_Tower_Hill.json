The reception staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was also good. The location is good for the Tower of London area and catching a river bus but not so good for the West End and a taxi back from a show was \u00a323,albeit partially caused by night road closures and diversions.

Our stay was excellent, especially after so-so hotel experiences on previous trips to London. The hotel staff were polite, helpful, and did everything to make sure that our stay was great. Checking in and out was fast and easy. The rooms were clean, modern, and in excellent condition. The hotel did a really good job making up the room everyday. The only minor complaint was that the internet connection left a lot to be desired, but the hotel did make efforts to improve the connection. This was a very minor issue for us. The location is excellent. A tube station is only about a 2 or so minute walk from the hotel. There are a number of bus lines by the tube station as well. The hotel is only a short walk to Tower of London. Brick Lane and the surrounding areas are also only about a 10-15 minute walk from Hotel Indigo.
