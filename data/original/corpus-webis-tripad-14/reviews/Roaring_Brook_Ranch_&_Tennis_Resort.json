It had the smell of an old hotel. The sink in our unit sputtered everytime it was used (the hotel was not full while in the height of tourist season...a bad indication) probably because it wasn't used in quite some time. Tennis courts were bumpy (okay for duffers) which was disappointing in a place that uses \"tennis\" in its name. Breakfast and suppers were included. The menu was limited, and of poor quality (agian please reference the $240 price tag). There were two pool tables...had to pay to use them.

This time there was many problems on the trail rides. There is a young wrangler who is only 16 years old and is very inexperienced. The father who runs the barn is letting him take out rides on his own and he can barely ride himself. We have never run into this before this year. This place has always had great experienced wranglers until this year. Be aware if you are sent on a ride alone with this wrangler as he has a very hard time controlling his own horse and due to his inability to ride has sent the other horses into a tailspin and it is not safe for inexperienced riders to be out alone with him. On our ride he almost fell off and upset all the horses behind him.
