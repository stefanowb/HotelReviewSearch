Also, the property is well maintained and the rooms very clean and comfortable (as long as you don't mind the Victorian theme at the beach which takes some getting used to and the parrots screeching in the lobby.) But where they really lost me was the service. Examples: The front desk check out experience was terrible with me having to go over the bill twice and they still over-charged me. And even when they fixed the charge later (which they did promptly) they never bothered to apologize. Also, when I wanted a small dessert so we could celebrate a birthday in the room, all the kitchen would sell me were the elaborate desserts from the formal main dining room. I went to a restaurant next door which gladly sold me a slice of pie. And finally The maid didn't keep the room fully stocked with replacement towels or K-cups for the coffee machines.

We got an Ocean View Suite on the 3rd floor. It was nice to have a sitting room and balcony because we felt like we had more space. Although our balcony wasn't the biggest it was still decent. On 4th Of July they opened the roof to everyone at the hotel (because usually it's only open to people staying on the 4th floor) we got a pretty nice view of the fireworks and even saw some of Cape May's and Dewey's. Also the parrots their our kids entertained. The one rainbow one named Emro was very sweet and the kids even said goodbye to him. Now on the other hand the pool was very warm. I know it wasn't supposed to be a swimming pool that kids can play in, but it was nice enough to let kids in. Although we had some bad weather in the beginning (which made the pool feel good) we had some hot days too which was bad for our kids who wanted to swim, but were too hot to swim in the (hotub) pool. One morning we ordered breakfast at Victoria's Restaraunt. It was good but overpriced. On one of our last days we ordered lunch by the pool. When we got the food the waitress set down the food and expected us to serve ourselves. (Really!?) I got a \"Beach Burger\" which cost $20. When I bit into it was burned. Completely. I was not happy. Overall it's a pretty good hotel but does have a few adjustments that need to made.

There is on site free parking, a free beach umbrella, a pool and hot tub on the property (and one also on the roof available if you have a fourth floor room)- and if you want to stay on the beach after checkout, you have access to a shower and changing room before you head on home - a wonderful perk!
