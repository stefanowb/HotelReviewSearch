I've paid just over $200 there before, but never over $300. My chosen weekend is not on or near a holiday. I've been watching prices for several hotels and see that Hilton's fluctuate quite a bit. Over the past few weeks their standard room price rose to $329 and dropped to $246. I saw it go back up a few dollars to $249, but a nonrefundable price of $212 was then offered (not available before). I later did back-to-back searches and saw that the $212 offer did not come up every time. Now it doesn't come up at all. This leaves me wondering how many times I've overpaid in the past. I also think of the people who have booked at $329 without following up and seeing the price drop. My concerns have been brought to the attention of Hilton Times Square and Hilton Corporate.
