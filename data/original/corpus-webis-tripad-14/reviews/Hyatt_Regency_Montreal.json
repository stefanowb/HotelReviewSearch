According to some reviews and the staff, the lobby was fairly recently renovated. There is a huge bar that opens up to the lobby...odd placement but it was quite modern and it looked like a nice place to have a drink. The hotel, however, should have spent a lot of the money on the elevators and room upgrades. Once you get on the elevator to go up to your room, you can truly see how old this hotel is. The elevators are loud, shaky and very hot compared to the rest of the hotel. The corridors are desinged in a very 80s/90s hotel style and the rooms are pretty average. Our room's coffee maker and fridge didn't work properly and since we had a little baby with us, it was pretty frustrating keeping milk and baby food fresh.
