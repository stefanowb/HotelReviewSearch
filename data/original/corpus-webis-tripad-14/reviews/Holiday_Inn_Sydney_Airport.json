The rooms are clean and comfortable, beds super comfy and choice between firm and soft pillows. The bar and restaurant downstairs has a good atmosphere and good food. Staff are friendly and helpful in planning your trip to the airport. The shuttle is cheap but can take a bit of time depending on how many people need to get dropped off a domestic first as international airport is second, the traffic to the airport can be quite thick so allow a bit of extra time. I have parked my car here for 2 weeks whilst I was overseas, it was secure and the parking cost was very reasonable compared to other options near the airport.

We went to our room where we tried to book a wakeup call and an airport bus for the following morning, an answering machine said to leave all the details and the hotel staff would listen to the message later and book call and bus. I just didn't feel comfortable talking to a machine about my wakeup time and my 5am airport bus. Maybe it was the overwhelming sense of efficiency I didn't get when I checked in that worried me. I phoned the reception to ask if I could verify the message left on the machine. They assured me it was ok. It was. We were awoken the next morning on time and took the bus on time. The rooms were extremely spacious and acturally quite luxurious. The bed was a king single even though we were assured it was a double by reservation staff. We made do.
