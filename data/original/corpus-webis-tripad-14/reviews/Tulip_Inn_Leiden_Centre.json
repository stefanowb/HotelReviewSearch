We found the hotel to be satisfactory. They upgraded us to a \"family\" room with two queen size beds upon arrival. The room was clean and the bathroom was great. The beds were fine, we slept well. The hotel is located right across the street from the train station (which was perfect for us since we took day trips to the Hague and Delft) and it's a 10 min. walk back to the center of Leiden. We enjoyed our stay - it's not luxury but it didn't appear to me that Leiden has any luxury hotels (no need). Breakfast is something crazy like 15-20 Euros per person so avoid eating at the hotel if you can. We found a really great cafeteria style place (very affordable) inside the train station. You could probalby find a cheaper room in this city - but if you want to be comfortable, stay here.", "title": "A good stay at the Tulip Inn", "user": "laughli7", "date": "July 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 17657871, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Big room and big clean bathroom", "disliked": "\u2014 expensive breakfast"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I expected this hotel to be the largest and most comfortable of our trip between three hotels but I was unexpectedly disappointed. The bedspread was filthy when we arrived and had to have it replaced. The room was small and the shower was so small it was almost unusable. This was for a hotel that was the most costly of our three that we had stayed in. Definately not worth the price. The location was actually better than I had expected as it was only a short walk to the main square. I thought that I would get a room away from the main area so it would be quieter but it was next to the train station and a main road so it was actually even more noisy. I would try a smaller hotel around the main area next time.

Room was very quiet even though we were in close proximity to the railway station. Bathroom had very large deep bath and overhead shower and a silent extractor fan.
