Navy Pier was a short cab ride away. The hotel services were exceptional, the staff was quick to respond to requests, and the 17th floor lounge was well stocked with gourmet pastries and espresso for breakfast and complimentary beer and wine for evening cocktails. My friends and I made good use of the outdoor pool, the indoor pool (when it got breezy) and the hot tub. There were plenty of common areas to unwind after a tiring day of playing tourists in Chicago. And the rooms were exceptionally hip, very clean and everything is well thought of, including an Ipad, dock for Iphone. The bed sheets must have been 2000+ thread count and pillows were comfortably soft. Very clean.
