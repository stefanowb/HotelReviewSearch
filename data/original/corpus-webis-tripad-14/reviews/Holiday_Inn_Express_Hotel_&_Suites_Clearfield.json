The main drag is fast food, gas stations and hotels. We popped into three hotels before picking the Holiday Inn and chose this one based on appearance in and out (we checked out a room), cleanliness and value. Hotels all play games with price so here's what we got when we walked in. First you get the highest rate... the \"rack rate.\" Rattle off things like AAA, AARP, and the price goes down. Tell them that's still too high and you're offered \"The Manager's Rate.\" The best rate I was able to get was based on a \"Room Saver\" coupon from one of those booklets you get at the highway rest areas.
