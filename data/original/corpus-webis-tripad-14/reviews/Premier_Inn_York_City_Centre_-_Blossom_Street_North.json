The staff were very friendly, informative and attentive. I cannot fault the service I received throughout my stay. Dining alone can be a bit daunting and I initially felt self conscious it's difficult to know where to look when you have no one to share your meal with and are surrounded by couples or young families with children. However the young waitress, possibly sensing my discomfort ,came to my aid by offering me magazines and newspapers to read , I appreciated that very much. The young waiter was also very helpful and efficient.", "user": "cwillows", "date": "February 7, 2010", "id": 55381514}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Simply the best", "text": "The room was spacious, comfortable and quiet.

Room not huge but the king size bed was a bonus. Shower was brilliant. My only bugbear was the liquid soap but we bought our own proper soap.
