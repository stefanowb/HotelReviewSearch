The accomodation is basic and based on wood hut sauna type construction. This led to noise from neighbours carrying through the floor and walls and I wouldn't want to stay if they were full up. Parking at the back of your unit and friendly staff, parrot ,cats and dogs.

We found it fairly easily, but it sits right on a main road so the noise form the cars is bad as and when they go past (though it is also true to say most the hotels in Kaikura share the same problem as they nealry all sit on the main road). The hotel is 2 levels, so make sure you get a second floor room, as the view is better and you are further away from the road. Our room was of a good size, with a kitchenette with an electric hob, and a tiny plastic bathroom which was a bit odd but everything worked. The hotel is a good walk outside the main \"town centre\", such that it is, and about 10 mins walk from the Dolphin Centre (the dolphin swimming is fantastic by the way).", "title": "Fine", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Teutonic", "date": "December 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 6503505, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 View, balcony, decent sized room", "disliked": "\u2014 too far away from the centre"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled with family", "text": "As for the Panorama, it was absolutely fine, but nothing special.", "title": "Best view in Kaikoura", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "saintsontour", "date": "December 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6320131}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "Having been to Kaikoura before and stayed on Beach Road (a misnomer - it's actually State Highway 1) we had decided on the Panorama for our next visit.
