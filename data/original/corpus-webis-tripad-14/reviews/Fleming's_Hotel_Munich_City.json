Being a very particular eater, I was very pleased with the daily breakfast in the hotel restaurant as well as the fruit provided in the room. There is some street noise and if you are a light sleeper, you may want to travel with a sound machine.

The staff is very friendly and efficient. The rooms are pretty clean and comfortable. They have a weird design choice for shower room (transparent glass walls - you can see everything that is going on there right from your bed) but at least the toilet area has a proper privacy. If you're staying with someone else and don't want to see their ugly, flabby naked body, be aware of this peculiarity. The A/C, at least in my room, worked very, very good, which was surprising (first hotel in Europe where I didn't set the thermostat to lowest possible setting). The room had a decent WiFi internet, completely free, which was also surprising. The breakfast was pretty delicious.
