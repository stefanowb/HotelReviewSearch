Throughout our stay, we noticed that the staff is very well trained, cordial, efficient, knowledgeable. The Lodge is large, with several wings and a large meeting space/convention hall attached to it. The landscape is very well manicured and the interior spaces are well maintained with comfortable seating throughout the lobby. The Recreation building with the pools and game rooms are at the far end of the property and a long walk unless you are staying in the wing closest to that area. Our room was in the Kisse's wing and we found it very comfortable, though there was nothing \"deluxe\" about it.s. It came with a mini-fridge which is a nice amenity when traveling with kids. The bathroom was a little tight, but my only real complaint with the room is that the walls are a bit thin; we heard a lot of hallway conversations and screaming/running toddlers and the A/C unit is loud. Though it cooled the room, I so think that an HVAC upgrade may be overdue for the lodge.", "user": "Barb J", "date": "June 16, 2013", "id": 164112608}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good...Not Great...", "text": "We had a late lunch at the Hershey Grill ( decent food and service and reasonably priced) and took their shuttle service to the park.

Again, the shuttle drivers are well trained, friendly and knowledgeable.We had a little issue at the park with our entry passes, but after a brief phone call back to the lodge, my wife had it resolved and when we returned we had free passes for the park waiting under our door.

Everyone seemed welcoming and glad to offer assistance or service if called upon. I was most impressed that the hotel had three lifeguards on duty; two at the indoor pool and one at the outdoor.

I was there for 24 hours, my husband stayed 4 days. The 1st day he came back to the room after being at work to his room door open. In the 24 hours I was there here is my experience. Twice the concierge gave us wrong information. We were told there was no rental car office when our company told us a rental car would be waiting for us. There is a rental car office in the convention center area. They told us the outdoor pool was open, it was not! The vending drink machines on each floor would only take credit cards or a $1 coin. The machine charged my credit card twice and gave me no drinks. When I told the front desk what had happened they couldn't believe the machine would not take cash and had never heard of a $1 gold coin! I was told it was my problem since it was on my credit card! To top it off our room was surrounded by a group of middle school children who were shouting, jumping off beds and slamming doors until midnight and it started again at 6:00 a.m. All this for $250 a night.

Hotel was great - several restaurants on-site to choose from and a cafe that sells sandwiches, coffee, drinks and ice cream. We had room service twice which makes it very convenient for those of us with young kids who don't always behave at restaurants. The hotel is very large and has a tennis court, mini-golf, indoor and outdoor pools, a game room and an exercise room so lot's to do. The staff was great and there was a full schedule of activities for the kids. We did not participate in any activities as there was so much to do outside the hotel so we were gone for most of the day. The outdoor pool looks nice, but is not heated so if it's cold outside the water is probably ice cold. The indoor pool looks on the small side and when we visited it it was packed with hotel guests so we opted for the game room which was decent, although on the small side as well. The mini golf is 18 holes but is simple in design - no fancy windmills or other designs on the course.", "user": "CheerMom2012", "date": "May 28, 2013", "id": 162153122}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Hershey"}, "variance": {"poor": 73, "average": 222, "very good": 384, "terrible": 65, "excellent": 571}, "aka": "Hershey Hotel Hershey", "slim_ranking": 0.291666666667, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "A great place for families to stay while visiting Hersheypark."}
