Very nice hotel - clean and comfortable, great location - my partner and I walked over to the famous Brown Palace Ship's Tavern late last night after a concert for a couple of dirty martinis. ..this is the heart of Downtown Denver! Staff very helpful. Here's the downside (which would probably not prevent me from booking with this hotel again) The only parking available is on the street (free over the weekend) or valet parking ($16 a night). The worst hotel pillows in my experience...big bulbous foam things...a real neck wrencher. Clever little in-room coffee maker was not to my liking. Instead of the standard 4 cup mini pot, you get an obnoxious one cup at a time coffee maker...bad deal for two people - a real time waster and iffy coffee. I like the Mr. Coffee style because I can always ditch the prepackaged coffee for a real filter and good coffee that I bring with me - not possible with this little number. I'll probably bring my own pillow next time - not sure what to do about the coffee.", "title": "Comment on the details...", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "RoadTripper1211", "date": "December 10, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6358084, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 in-room coffee maker, bad pillows"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with family", "text": "My mom and I just came back from staying at the Hampton Inn & Suites this past weekend and we had a wonderful time. From the moment we arrived, the staff was absolutely incredible. We arrived early so our room wasn't ready but Amy gladly took our bags and pointed us to the 16th Street Mall so we could get something to eat. The lobby and dining area were very clean and modern. When we came back from lunch we were told our room was ready and wow, what a nice room it was. It was on the first floor which we didn't mind. The beds were super comfy and it was nice that they had a mini fridge which we utilized to store our own food. Breakfast the next day was very good and there was plenty to go around. It was nice to sit and watch TV while having breakfast. Everytime we came and went everyone was so friendly and helpful. We used the small gym and it served our needs perfectly. My only suggestion would be if they could add mats so one can stretch and do abs but otherwise it was very nice and clean.", "title": "What a Wonderful Hotel!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MJ24", "date": "April 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7476477, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The friendly staff.", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "All in all we had a very nice time in Denver and loved our stay at the Hampton Inn.
