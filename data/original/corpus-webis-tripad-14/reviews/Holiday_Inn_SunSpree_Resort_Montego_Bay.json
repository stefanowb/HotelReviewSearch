It was our first trip in Jamaica. We really enjoyed it. especialy the trip to the Dunn's river Falls. The hotel is too big for the small land they have. Rooms need to be refreshed and the furniture is too old!!! THEY ARE BEGING TO BE REPLACED! If you want to open the balcony door, you need to be strong. We were staying in the building 1 and the room 1405. Besides off this the quality food was good but the selection was poor. There was no seafood and there wasn't enough fruits. There is no wine during the diner. The beach is very small and the beach chairs need to be replaced. There is not enough place, on the beach, where you can hide from the sun. The evening entertainment is good, especialy the live music.

We found Winslow and the ladies at guest services to be very cordial and ready to help you. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I had read some of the previous reviews and was worried about the trip--I can only assume that these are the disgruntled few as my stay at the resort was wonderful. The food in the restaurants was very good. I particularly enjoyed the SeaBreeze Jamaican restaurant. My only piece of advice would be to try to upgrade and change up the buffet where possible. We also enjoyed the snorkeling. We had mentioned possibly coming back with our kids and David showed us some of the newly refurbished childrens rooms--these are going to be awesome. They have a private quarter with bunkbeds, a bean bag and a flat screen TV for the kids. There is also a kids desk and dryerase board for them to play with in the room. This will make a family vacation much nicer as you can have a little bit of seperation within the room--the adults could watch their own TV.
