The last one re. Grand City said that 'it looked like an old 70's Iron Curtain concrete apartment block'. I would suggest that the reason it looks like that is because that's what it is. For the price asked, there is nothing wrong with this hotel: the rooms (rooms, notice) are large; well-equipped (what are you expecting furniture wise?) and immaculately clean. The shower is powerful and the hot water instant (and I do mean instant!). The staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The area is a bit run down but that goes for a lot of Leipzig. There are restaurants and bars nearby if you look for them (the one under the Handwerkskammer, Dresdner Str. 11/13 is particularly interesting) and the tram goes from almost outside. I don't want to live in a hotel room; it's somewhere I can put my head down or maybe drink a glass of wine and watch some footie on the perfectly adequate TV. I've paid a lot more for a lot worse in Leipzig (and other places). I'll be going back and hopefully I can get in through the main entrance rather than through the car park this time!", "title": "Good Hotel once you get inside!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "bigfozbelper_England", "date": "May 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 129298818}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled on business", "text": "First impressions of this Hotel where that it looked like an old 70's Iron Curtain concrete apartment block, and things did not improve from there.", "title": "A taste of the Eastern Block", "user": "bax52", "date": "May 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 64350928}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "It is set a 20 min walk from the Ald Stadt, and is surrounded by other old concrete blocks that are still lived in as apartments.
