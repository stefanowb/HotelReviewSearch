The experience is not so bad. Everything is very bright and clean. In each dorm there are 8 beds, during my stay only 2 were occupied, bathrooms are ensuite. And for as little as 12 EUR a night you get all of the following - laundry, internet access, fully equiped kitchen, huge terrace for sunbathing or just spending a good time and even breakfast (some tosts, cereals, jam, milk, butter). Hostel is located in the downtown Malaga, close to attractions like Gibralfaro Castle, Plaza de la Merced (area famous with it\u00b4s nightlife), casa natal de Picasso. Good beaches are quite far, but are easy reachable with local bus services.", "title": "My first experience in real hostel", "user": "Lexx_Naxxx", "date": "December 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 50677558}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled solo", "text": "I stayed here for about 4 nights in July '09. The first dorm was an 8-bed and was very small, but very clean and well maintained. For the last night I moved to another 8-bed dorm, but the room was more than twice the size and had a balcony. The second room was 15\u20ac as opposed to 14\u20ac, but I would advise anyone to pay the extra Euro for the extra comfort and airiness of the larger room.", "title": "Excellent hostel and great prices!", "user": "MrSwampy", "date": "August 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 36532154}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Andalucia", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 3, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 0}, "aka": "Down Town Hostel Malaga, Spain - Costa Del Sol", "slim_ranking": 0.766233766234}
