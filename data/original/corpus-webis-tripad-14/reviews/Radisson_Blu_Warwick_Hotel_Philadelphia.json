I have been to the Radisson in Stockholm and Lisbon, and everything was great. So I was pretty confident in a nice room and a wonderful stay. Not at all. We were first offered a room at the 20th floor (uau!). The only problem is that this floor AC were off (if you've been to Philly during summer time you know what this means) and the room was right in front of the ice machine. So we moved to a room on the 7th floor, enormous, but without the fridge and safe. The internal AC system was broken and flooded the moquette one meter around it. The tapisserie was kept on the walls by means of adhesive naster. Last, but not least we received the confirmation bill outside our door at 2.30 AM (!) of the second night.", "title": "Hot deals terrible deals", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Alessandro M", "date": "July 18, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3679076}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "The reception staff was indeed nice, anyway.", "title": "Great Hotel....Great Location!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "enmsmommy", "date": "July 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3633710}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "We booked this hotel on recommendation from Tripadvisor.

The front desk was rude and very inconsiderate when advising us that our reservation for a king room made over a month ago was over-booked. But they did offer us a pull-out queen sleeper in a room they call the parlor!!! I felt like I was in a seinfeld episode where the manager Dwaine and his 2 flunky assistants at the front desk were convinced that a reservation met nothing and the customer would just go away. If you stay here an experience this situation it is probably because you booked for only one night. Don't let that stop you, call the 1-800 number for radison and complain. The brochures are at the front desk for the number. The corporate headquarters were very helpful and seemed to be as surprized as we were when told of an offer for a queen sleeper. I choose another attendant who was obviously not a manger but was kind enough to verify we indeed did have a king room reservation but it was obvious that the magement hawks would never allow her to check us in. It was pretty apparent that the check in line for one night stays were sent to the managers desk to plead there case. After talking to everyone in line it was apparent that everyone in the managers line was there for the same reason, reservation number in hand but no room and booked for one night. After 1 1/2 hours of complaining and basically making a scene, they finally gave us our room. We refused to be sent down the road to the overflow! I had to insist on a free drink and dinner. After only getting a drink card I warned the manager that my dinner reservation that I missed and the drink card may be a bad combination since I don't drink very well on an empty stomoch. They threw in a dinner at the circle restaraunt with a smirk and please leave us alone look. The dinner at the circle was great so don't believe the bad reviews.
