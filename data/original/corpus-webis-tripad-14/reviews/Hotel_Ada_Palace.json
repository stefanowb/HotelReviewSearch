Only reason it should be 4 star is for the location (which is fantastic) and the Staff (very helpful). Apart from that, cannot understand how this comes under a 4 star banner. When the taxi dropped us off at the reception we though we had arrived at the wrong hotel it was so dark and dismal. We paid for a superior double room......bedside lamp fixture broken (even after maintenance came to room), one of the ceiling lights flashing on and off for no particular reason at no particular time, hairdryer not working, no bottle opener for minibar. We pre-booked breakfast for 3 mornings but first two mornings not enough tables set out for clients so had to find our own table in bar area. Third morning decided it was easier and more enjoyable to eat out. Would recommend Madrid to everyone, just not this hotel.", "user": "LillianChris", "date": "October 5, 2013", "id": 179794984}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Superb location, great value!", "text": "I stayed in Ada Palace for 4 nights in Aug'13. The location is superb, right on Gran Via- one of the busiest avenues in Madrid. The room was quite airy, comfortable to stay for a long period. It was very well decorated, the bathroom is a lot bigger than expected. If you like walking, you don't need to use a cab or the subway. All major landmarks like Edificio de Correos, Parque del Retiro, Plaza Mayor, Callao, Puerta del Sol and the art triangle (Museo Thyssen Bornemizsa, Reina Sophia, Museo del Prado) are located max. within 1 km. Also Calle Fuencarral- where madrile\u00f1os mostly hang out in cool bars and restaurants-is 100 mts away from the hotel. The hotel's terrace has a lovely view of Circulo de Bellas Artes and Metropolis building right across Gran Via, definitely should pay a visit for a drink and chill after a busy day.", "user": "Mujmaria", "date": "September 28, 2013", "id": 178947997}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I will definitely stay here for my next visit to Madrid and i strongly recommend to couples and families to stay here.", "title": "Great location", "user": "Afif T", "date": "September 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 178530280}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled solo", "text": "This hotel is great hotel, the location is so close to plaza mayor and puerta del sol.", "title": "VERY NICE", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Marcelo1349", "date": "September 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 177714977}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "the bus station is so close, the staff are friendly and helpful.", "title": "Central location for museums", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Christopher R", "date": "September 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 177251169}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Ada Palace is very centrally located and has good size rooms however the bathroom needed maintenance and cleaning.

My only 1 real complaint is the cost of Wifi - 16,95 euro for 24 hours, for up to 2 devices. This is THE most expensive hotel Wifi that I have ever encountered. I think it is ridiculous to charge this much, especially when they then restrict it to only 2 devices. I was travelling by myself, so I only had 2 devices, but if I was travelling with my husband, this could be a reason not to choose this hotel. The Wifi was very good and didn't drop off, so I guess that is something. I do think that the hotel needs to rethink their pricing on this.

The breakfast buffet was also good, plenty of fresh fruit and fresh pastries, with only one minor complaint - all the sachets for the nexpresso machine were strong blends, too much for me at breakfast time.
