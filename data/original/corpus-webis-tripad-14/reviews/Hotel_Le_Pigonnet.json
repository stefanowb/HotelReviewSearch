It is about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the center, which makes the location extremely convenient if you are without a car. We had a car and parking was available free of charge. We arrived early on our first day and had to wait around the pool while our room was being cleaned. This was not a big deal because we did arrive before check in. The pool was very clean although very cold. There was plenty of seating. Also, they have a waiter walking around taking orders for lunch and drinks, which was nice but pricey. Our only complaint about the pool area is that they allow pets. After a 15 hour flight, all we wanted was some peace and quiet. However, the entire time out there a dog was barking while the owner sunbathed.", "title": "Good but not great", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "roallen", "date": "September 13, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3898780}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2004", "text": "The room (Room 40) was spacious and comfortable. It had a separate shower which was a good size for European standards. The balcony in the room was nice and overlooked the pool. The only downside of the room was some road noise since it was situated at the end of the hotel closest to the road. The hotel gets high marks for the beautiful gardens, which is nice for an afternoon stroll. The main reason for the rating is the hotel staff. The staff would answer your questions with a smile, but you could tell they were not sincere. Also, anytime we would leave for the day they would always ask if we wanted reservations to their restaurant for that night which was never busy and extremely pricey. This was slightly annoying. All in all it is nice accommodations but the customer service was mediocre.", "title": "Repeat visit a bit disappointing, but still has charm", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "minniemouse", "date": "October 15, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 2704729}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "not as advertised", "text": "They have wifi service and a business center, but you have to pay for it.

We were very pleased with the hotel, but were glad to be paying out-of-season prices (120 euros a night, including breakfast). At that price, it was a good value. Our room (14) was not huge but it was large enough. Unlike some reviewers (who didn't like the old furniture), we thought the furniture was attractive and suited the space (except for the print depicting a whale fishery, which I thought was disturbing and took off the wall for the duration of our visit). The proven\u00e7al printed fabric on the walls was a little busy for my taste, but suited the environment. The bathroom (a light grey stone) was gorgeous, and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was only adequate, but the service was good and the view over the terrace was pleasant.

Overall I was a bit disappointed with the general feel of the hotel. The room looked nothing like the photographs, and although large felt very spartan, bare and unluxurious. The furniture was more just old battered things your granny would have rather than antique. The landing was gloomy and the carpets stained. The bathroom had black mold in some of the grouting. Having said that the room and bathroom were large, the robes and slippers appreciated, and the bed very comfortable. The location is good, a 10 - 15 min walk into town, but we were happy to have that inconvenience in exchange for easy driving and free parking. I'm sure in the summer the garden / pool and break from the crowds would be a real bonus. If we'd paid \u00a350 I'd have been pretty content, but at \u00a3100+ without breakfast I felt it was a bit of a rip off. Don't bother paying extra for a garden view room if its going to be dark most of the time you're there - I did thinking it might be a higher grade of room, but the only difference is what you see from the window.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 4, 2005", "id": 3988068}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Provence", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 17, "average": 43, "very good": 104, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 132}, "aka": "Le Pigonnet Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.132352941176, "description": "Our Provencal Bastide from the 18th century combines tradition and modernity.
