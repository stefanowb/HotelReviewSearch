I was having laser eye surgery and we needed somewhere that was nearby. The Washington is close to Clifton village and a 15-20 minute walk from the centre of Bristol. Our room was spacious with a large en-suite. Towels were clean and fluffy and the bed confortable. We had facilities to make proper coffee as well as instant and fruit in the room. Breakfast was really good with everything available and plentiful. The staff were very polite and helpful. There is an affiliated restaurant where discount is offered. My only niggle was that although it was an older building there was quite a lot of noise from the room above especially early in the morning.

On entering the hotel my heart sank as in the reception area chatting to the receptionist were 2 young men - one shirtless with tattoos the other with a stag weekend shirt on. However the friendly receptionist assured me their rooms were nowhere near mine and to be fair to the whole party (there were quite a few!) they were very well behaved and polite and we only ever saw and heard them at breakfast. Our room was small - the double bed seemed on the small size - and as most other reviewers have said could have done with some refurbishing - the radiator would not switch off and the window was not easy to open and once opened you got the street noise - but the bathroom was fine and there was fruit as well as tea/coffee making facilities and biscuits in the room. The location was excellent - within walking distance of Clifton village and the cafes and bars on Whiteladies Road/Clifton Triangle, on the bus routes into the city centre yet fairly quiet. There are no lifts and breakfast is in the basement so not sure how less able bodied people would manage. The staff are very helpful and polite, the hotel is clean, breakfast is good (though the vegetarian sausage turned out to be a vegetable finger!) and for a city hotel the price is excellent.", "title": "budget hotel in good location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SarahNorthumberland", "date": "April 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 158920026}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Like stepping back into the 1970, but without any of the retro.

It's uphill - so don't even think of walking from the station. Take a taxi or a bus - but expect traffic-jams. Bristol could use a decent traffic-planner and a bus-schedule that is understandable. But that has nothing to do with the hotel - I know. I was there for 4 nights in april, and was received by very friendly people at the desk. By mistake I had booked a room with no bathroom. That was changed immeditely at the reception whan I asked for it. The place is a little old, so you have to climb the stairs to the room at 2nd floor. The room was nice and ok - like a normal guesthouse-room, with a decent bathroom. Nothing special - but you get what you pay for. Breakfast was in the basement - mind your head going down there. Breakfast was fine and service down there was fine as well. There seemed to be a lot of staff for breakfast-serving, and alsom two people at reception, eventhough it's a prette small place. The hotel is associated with a bar/cafe next to the hotel. I didn't go there - but if you go out, turn left, then turn right at the corner - there's a great pub about 100 meter up.
