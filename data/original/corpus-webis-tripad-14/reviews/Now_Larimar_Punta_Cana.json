Most of the restaurant, bar, lobby space is air conditioned. There\u2019s no loud music anywhere. All garden rocks conceal speakers playing soft piano music during the day (that what\u2019s commonly called elevator music; I don\u2019t say it\u2019s right or wrong, but this is what this resort offers). Given the fact that Punta Cana is developing at high rate, it\u2019s time to have some new resorts different from what we\u2019ve always seen around. They cannot make everybody happy. So, if you expect wild parties and loud club or Latino music day and night, this resort is not for you. Also if you like the open air resort style, EdenH is not for you. Also, if you travel in groups larger than a couple planning to share one room, or if you travel with kids or in-laws or friends/relatives sharing the same room this resort may not be for you. There\u2019s no point trying to change the resort to fit your desires. The resort is what its management wants it to be. Leave it that way.

The room was close to the pool and equally distanced from the beach and restaurants and we liked that. I\u2019m not going to insist on the room layout, everybody knows that already: ours was a deluxe room with that well-known opening in the bathroom wall. Did look weird, but we did not have any issue with that. Notable is the fact that one year ago we\u2019ve been in a very similar room at Majestic (jr.

To our surprise, after all we\u2019ve read, everything in the room was in its place and fully functional. We found the bottle of rum and the fruit basket waiting for us. The slippers and bathrobes were missing but we\u2019ve got those the next day. The room was cleaned daily and resupplied with toiletries and drinks. Yes, there were only two beer cans daily but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got at all other Dominican resorts we\u2019ve been to. The first night we spotted four mosquitoes and put a violent end to their sad life. Next days we haven\u2019t seen more than one on occasions. We came equipped with a Raid spray can and used it in the room every night before going to dinner/bar/show. Was efficient enough to kill any mosquito that may have sneaked in while the maid was cleaning the room. First two days the maid came to clean in the morning, while we were at the pool and we also had turn down service. After the wave of March break teenagers hit the resort on Sunday our turn down service disappeared (too bad, chocolates were nice) and the maid started to show up at 5 pm for cleaning.

One may complain of monotony. Yes, there are the same things every day, but there\u2019s variety and it\u2019up to you to pick different food all the time. Everybody constantly reading reviews and forum posts must have heard about Felix. Well, for those who don\u2019t know, Felix is the omlette guy. He will offer you an omlette made to order and nice, personalized conversation. But this can backfire sometimes: one day Felix was just talking with an Ottawa guy about how great the Sens were, totally ignoring the fact that the next in line (a Torontonian) strongly disagreed with that line of conversation :-) Don\u2019t get sucked in hokey talk Felix! Just kidding, Felix is just a great guy. The lineup for his omlette is 10-20 minutes long, on the right side as you look at his station. I have a tip here: if you don\u2019t like waiting, lineup on the left side. You\u2019ll be served by Eduardo, the quiet one, very fast, with an equally good omlette, but without conversation. I don\u2019t think Eduardo speaks any English, actually I\u2019ve never heard him saying anything at all, but he understands \u201ctwo over easy\u201d for sure (I tried that). Lineup for Eduardo is usually 1-2 minutes long. About a la carte restaurants. People lineup at 5:30 for dinner and wait until 6:30 when restaurants open. I hate waiting in line and, because of this, I\u2019ve never been in the Asian a la carte. With the other three it was easy: we showed up between 7 and 7:30 pm and were either admitted immediately or got a pager and came back in half hour with no lineup. I still think a reservation system of any sort will straighten things up. It\u2019s a little bit annoying to leave the room to have a nice dinner in an a la carte restaurant and end up eating in the buffet. A la carte restaurants we were in were nice, service was ok. Having to put with general issues like cost, efficiency and specific ones like shortage of staff and language skills the management has a process in place: the hostess runs the pagers and takes people in, then there\u2019s only one person (probably the most skilled in English) taking all the orders and then it\u2019s the regular waiting staff taking care of your dinner and your glasses. Cool, every restaurant can be run with only two English speaking staffers. We all read horror stories on this forum about these restaurants, but I, personally, did not witness anything wrong. Everything was clockwork while we were in there. Like everybody else we\u2019ve heard the rumors about this American couple that were waiting seated at a table in the Italian restaurant without being server for 1 or 2 hours. After I\u2019ve seen those waiters at work I don\u2019t think something like this can be possible (unless they were hidden under the table, told staff they don\u2019t want to be disturbed or something like this). The food was good, nothing extraordinary, just the food you\u2019d expect (and get) at any other good resort in the Punta Cana area. We only tried the house wine, both red and white. It\u2019s ok, nothing to write home about, but a nice, decent wine, going well with food.

A bellhop came promptly to move our bags. Moving higher solved the mosquito problem even though the maids continued to leave the door open when cleaning. Another negative is the food which was fine, not great. The specialty restaurants are too small to accommodate most guests and they need to become much more efficient since often we waited 1-2 hours even though many tables were empty but not cleared. Food at buffet was very good and plentiful. Last and perhaps biggest negative was insufficient number of beach chairs.

We did notice that the resort seemed empty, staff and guests. (We later found out the reason for the short staff was it was Election Day in the Dominican Republic so the resort tries to allow as many people to go home to vote as possible.) In our opinion it never affected our stay but did explain why there was less staff on hand then expected. We were given our room assignments and were told we were in the Paradise Club (we didn\u2019t pay for this service, so I guess we were upgraded because they had the space available) we received our door cards and were whisked away to our rooms. Once we got to our rooms we found the maid service still cleaning one of the rooms we were assigned. No biggy, since we had two rooms, we just put our bags in the room that was clean and decided to grab lunch. We did notice that there was a little mold on the lamp shade and there was a slight mildew smell. (No big deal, we were in the Caribbean, there is water and humidity, it happens.) We thought since I am very allergic to mildew we\u2019d go to the front and see if we could switch rooms. So after we enjoyed a good meal next to the pool we decided to go back up front. We asked if we could switch and right away they said there were no rooms available. I was guessing this really wasn\u2019t the case especially since we were moved to the Paradise Club. What I think they meant was there weren\u2019t anymore rooms in the Paradise Club that were clean and ready. We ended up asking for Mike to see if he could do anything about our placement or we would have made a quick call to our Travel Agent, as usually they can help in that situation. Lucky for us Mike was back and had already noticed we had checked in and he was coming to find us to see how things were going. (Again, I think Mike had a little more time because the resort wasn\u2019t full of guests.) He ended up taking us up to 2 new rooms, which were on the fourth floor and overlooked the pool and beach. Yes, the rooms had a big opening from the bathroom to the bedroom but we were used to this, every resort we have been to in the past has had this although others have some sort of shade or hinged door if you\u2019d like to keep the rooms separate. The one thing we all joked about was they have this beautiful heavy dark wood door leading to the bathroom with a lock on the door but a huge opening on the other side of the two person tub. What was the point of the lock? The toilet area is separated with a frosted glass and so is the shower, so unless you go on vacation with a total stranger this really shouldn\u2019t effect your stay. The bathrooms in the Paradise Club are completely closed in and set up a little different, that is because the two person tub is outside on the balcony.

Made friends with some couples while at the hibachi grill--a fun time..", "title": "Opened way too early", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "Hamilton_OntarioDeb", "date": "March 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 14103808, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The beach", "disliked": "\u2014 The smelly room"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Beach/pool: The beach was too gorgeous for us to ever want to use the pool (except when we swam up to get a drink from hysterical Alexis). We \"beached\" it every day. Played the chair game a couple of mornings, but if not, we'd throw a towel on the sand (which by the way, we never saw a piece of glass in). Chair game is also compounded by guests. If you're told 7am, people will go at 6:30. Got earlier as the week went on. Looking forward to when they'll have some more chairs, but this was really a non-issue for us. Who goes to a beach and refuses to throw a towel on the sand? Not us, in fact, I felt lucky to be so close to sand that had the texture of powdered sugar! Also enjoyed daily walks on the beach in either direction, where you really realize Edenh's is the cleanest and nicest!", "title": "Way far to be a 5 stars", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "Zagger97", "date": "March 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14089472, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Lobster dinner in the room", "disliked": "\u2014 The organisation and ARROGENCE OF THE MANAGEMENT"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Entertainment: Enjoyed White Night and Cirque du Soleil-type night. The singers were less our style, so we didn't linger for them. We were always given a chair by the staff to see the performances, & sometimes we'd venture up to the Tanhtra bar afterwards to relax on their comfy beds, enjoy the mellow music and a drink. There was also a musician in the lobby bar. All-in-all, we were not disappointed and didn't personally need a club atmosphere late at night. Also LOVED the animation team. (Watch Kelvin dance--he's hilarious) Did some beach step aerobics after several days of eating and was glad I did. Also took a morning catamaran lesson and were allowed afterwards to use them for 30 min at a time.
