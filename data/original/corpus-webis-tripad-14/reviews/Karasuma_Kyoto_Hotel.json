It is just a block from a great shopping district. The hotel is clean and the staff was very helpful. The hotel is older but very well maintained and safe. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which I found very convienent since I speak no Japanese and was travelling by myself. It was a great find at $77 a night (Oct 2005) , hotels in Japan are fairly expensive. They had 2 PCs with free internet access in the lobby also. My room was on the small side compared to American hotel rooms, but I expected that.
