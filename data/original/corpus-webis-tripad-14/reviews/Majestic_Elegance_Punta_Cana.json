In fact, a few days into our stay, my daughters witnessed a small fist fight between some of the meathead male partyers who were playing adult dodge ball. The available upgrade they offered was on the adults only club side and we could not take it because we were with the children. Regarding the rowdy pool bar location, the staff was very apologetic and understanding and even told the pool activity team to tone down the games that impacted our side of the pool grounds. My in-laws and our friend were upgraded to the Elegance Club, but again, the children factor made that upgrade impratical and counter to our purpose of the kids and grandparents spending time together. They were moved to rooms on our side, one facing the pool, one facing the garden, and we adults were all given access to the Elegance club which included private beach, pool, internet lounge and beach bars, so we took turns using those perks.

There was no butler - we did have a man who introduced himself as our butler, & I liked him, but he didn't come on duty until 3 pm, & we only saw him 2 or 3 times in the 4 days that we were there. He did make dinner reservations twice for us, & ordered us a taxi for when we left, but that was it. We tipped him well, but he was definitely not a butler in any sense of the word. We loved the 70's/80's show with the disco dancers. The casino was small but fun. We loved the Gourmet & the japanese restaurants, but were unimpressed with the steakhouse & the buffet.

They were surpurb, not only did they make great drinks but thgey remembered us and made what we wanted as we approached the bar. The food on the resort was very good also the varitey was sufficent for all tastes. I espically liked the steak house but the French and Sushi resteraunts were good also.

On the first night, there was power outage at the resort around 10pm. The a/c stayed on ( backup generators, I assume) but the lights stayed off. Because we had travelled from early that morning, we went to bed assuming the lights would be on in the a.m., but they were not. I called twice between before 8am before finally getting a maintenance person to come. He tinkered with the fuse box briefly and left and five minutes later the lights and tv's were off again. I had to run and find him in the walkways and bring him back at which point he called for a more senior helper to eventually replace the circuits and panels. Because of the nearly 12 hours of lost power, the refrigerator stopped working and it would be another two days before it was effectively chilling our beverages and snacks. While these things were happening, we found our jacuzzi tub to not be holding water or producing hot water and our shower heads to be loose and dangling out of the ceiling precariously. My wife, who speaks some Spanish, eventually got to the front desk manager, Starlin, who was extremely competent and efficient in having these room issues addressed. However, my wife and I both felt that we spent so much energy and time in calling and managing the repairs that we perceived there is a sever lack of basic customer service training at the resort. The most glaring example of this came when a maintenance man came by later in the week to replace the A/C filter in the ceiling. He did the work in less than five minutes and left...leaving a pile of plaster and ceiling dust in the middle of the floor. It did not occur to this person to clean up a mess he made in a guest's room without being told to do so. This to me was symptomatic that the Elegance is not putting a lot of time in training their non-front-desk people to use common sense or have customer empathy skills.

I have to say, this was the best vacation that we ever had. I cannot say enough good things about the resort. The Majestic Elegance was quite large, but everything is spread out in a way where you walk through a short, beautifully landscaped area. When we arrived our room was not ready, but the hotel staff kept our bags safe in the lobby, gave us a drink, and sent us on our way! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful in fulfilling any requests that we had. We stayed in the Elegance Club, and because of that we received many perks including our own butler (Bladamir, he was awesome), personalized concierge (Jennifer was super sweet and helpful), special dining and bar privileges, beach/pool towels, reserved pool space, and free WiFi in our own lounges (to name a few). This is an all-inclusive resort, which I think it the WAY TO GO in the DR. There are bars a step away no matter where you are in the resort. Even if you are on the beach, there are usually hotel workers making their way around fulfilling drink requests. Just a tip, bring an insulated cup to drink out of (it is larger than the cups they give you, and will keep your drink cool MUCH longer in the heat). The resort is equipped with many restaurants and buffets. The most enjoyable dining experience we had was in the French restaurant (requires a reservation). We also liked eating/drinking at Sea by Sea because of the beautiful view it had of the water. I have seen reviews saying that you had to be out early on the beach to get a seat, but we did not have this problem. There was a bounty of open beach seats, as well as spots by the pool, every day no matter what time (of course that could be linked to the time of year we went). As for activities, the resort has something going on all the time. During the day there were always cute contests and parties being MC'd, and at night there were shows and big beach parities. The hotel offers many free water actives like snorkeling, wind surfing, and sailing... and of course you have the option for paying for activities/excursions as well. We dealt with Prieto Tours for the excursion that we chose to buy (Papa Tony was our Prieto Tours representative, he was great). We chose to buy an all-day excursion (99$ per person) which took us to a few local towns, speed-boating, party catamaran (BEST EVER), and to Saona Island (our guide was Papa Tito... he's the man). As for late night at our hotel, there are a few bars open until late, and there is a club open until 5am (not really my scene). However, after being out in the sun all day, drinking, doing water sports and hotel activities, etc., we always found ourselves ready for sleep by 2am! In case you have never been to the DR beach before, you should know many locals walk on the beach and try to sell you items like jewelry, cigars, etc. The only reason that I mention this is because they can be quite persistent, and it was a tad annoying to constantly be heckled to buy something over and over and OVER... however, this is really not an issue that has to deal with the resort. Overall, we had an amazing trip! The weather, beach, and general atmosphere of Punta Cana was carefree and happy (everything one could hope for in a vacation)!

I loved the open air buffet within steps of the beach so we didn't have to leave it on a beautiful day. The sand was like powder and cool to the feet, the water clean and warm and not too much surf. There is a pharmacy there if you get stuck which we did and we were able to find what we needed.

This was my first all inclusive resort vacation and I am glad that I choose the Majestic Elegance! The resort was beautiful and clean. Even better than the photos. The beach was lovely. Very clean. The sea weed would come up on shore but was cleaned up each morning. The bar service on the beach wasn't great. I think each day we got back we were asked once or twice if we wanted a drink. However, if you did want to grab your own drink it was a two minute walk from the beach. It was very windy when we were there which made swimming in the ocean a lot of fun. The food was awesome! There were two buffets. Both of them had a wide variety of food. The resturaunts were all great. 9 Doors is the Japanese Resturaunt. You need to make reservations for this restuarunt as there is only nine tepanyaki tables The staff here are really great and full of engery. The food is to die for. The Asadito Steak house was very good. The night we went however was really busy so we got the soup, salad and appetizers at the same time. The See and Sea turns into a Seafood Resturaunt in the evening. I dont like seafood and they only had a vegetarian lasagna for a main course for non seafood eaters. The Il Botaccio (Italian Resturaunt) was very tasty. The service here was a bit slower here than the other restuaraunts but well worth it. The Limited Gourmand (French Resturaunt) was excellent. You also need to make reservation here. I had the beef tenderloin and I highly recommend it. The service here was great and the champagne is awesome! If you get hungry late at night the la B del M is open from 11 to 6 am. It is about a 5 minute walk from your room. They have pizza, burgers, wings, ect. There are tables and chairs outside to sit and eat. It is very nice at night to sit out there. There are lots of things to do at the resort and for being only there for a week I didnt get to do half of the stuff avialable at the resort. There was volleyball everyday, we learned how to dance by the pool (lots of fun! and the instructors were full of energy), parasailing, banana boating, tubing, snorkling, tennis, the casino just to name a few. The shows are night were a lot of fun and it was nice that they started at 10:00 so you could go for a late supper. The dancers in the Micheal Jackson show are phenomenal. The 60's, 70's and 80's show was okay but it was all lip syncing which was kind of disappointing. Ideal Couple was really funny. It is like a game show were 4 sets of couples need to do four games and then the audience determines the winner. It would have been nice if at the Coco Nightclub they played Spanish music instead of American Club music. We went to the Club two nights and it wasnt really very busy even night. I didnt find that there were very many people in there 20's at the this resort so that is probably why the club wasnt as busy. Most of our nights were spend at the Piano Bar in the lobby. Only open until 12. The bartender Roberto is the reason we went to that bar every night. He was super friendly and a lot of fun. He also makes the best drinks and if we didnt know what we wanted he would suprise us! We were never disappointed. Roberto was our favourite staff member but most of the staff were really great! They were always smiling and had high energy. Our rooms were very nice the only thing is the first day or two there were only two towels for three of us in the room. You also have to ask for a face cloth if you want one as they are not put in the rooms automatically. The pillows are very small too. I had to fold mine in half to make it fluffy enough and our fridge wasnt restalked with chocolate everyday. We did the dolphin, stingray and toothless shark tour. It cost $145 for four hours. It was worth it for because I have never done anything like this but the Sunwing representative said that it was only a 10 minute drive to the location and the a ten minute boat ride to the dolphins. It was closer to a 45 minute drive to the location and then another 10 minute boat ride. The represenative also said that you got 3 and half hours with the dolphins, sharks and stingrays. It was more like 30 minutes with dolphins and then 30 minutes with the sharks and stingrays. Once the tour was done we went back to the beach and waited for about 45 mintutes to get picked up again. You get complimentary drinks here but if you want ice cream you have to pay for it. You can also buy a DVD of your photos with the dolphins. It cost $70 USD for a DVD of 5 people. We were told by the representative that it would only be $40. It was nice though that the dolphin resort was away from the Magestic Elegance for me because I liked to see other parts of Punta Cana.
