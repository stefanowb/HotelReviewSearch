It is well situated in a lovely spot alongside the local river, very centrally in the village and we were unaffected by traffic noise or noise from other guest rooms. The hosts Ian and Christine are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the locality - thanks Ian we found Tarn Hows. The room was clean, well furnished, the bed comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and well equipped. Car parking in the grounds was not a problem. This is only a guest house and there is no guests lounge but it is ideal for a very comfortable stay if you only want B & B. The breakfast was more than adequate and freshly cooked and with plenty of tea/coffee refills. Here perhaps was the only downside that we could comment on in that breakfast is only served between 08.30 and 09.00; although that wasnt a problem to us.
