The Hotel Boston was by far the best hotel during our 2 week stay. We had a room with 2 small balconies that looked out over the lake and the view was amazing. At night you could see all the other small towns across the lake sparkling over the water. The hotel was really cute inside and the rooms were spacious and modern. The staff were really helpful and the one morning when she knew that the breakfast room was going to be full of a bus tour group the manager put a small reserved sign on a table just for us which was really nice of her. I would definitely recommend the Hotel Boston if you are looking to stay in Stresa on a budget and you won't regret going to Stresa as it is beautiful.

The walkout door was open when we walked in the room. The room was very clean and neat. We left our belongings and went out to see the town and have dinner. When we returned after dinner, about 10PM, there was a very foul odor of sewer gas backup. We returned to the front desk to see if we could change rooms, because of the odor, but the man at the front desk, who reeked of alcohol and cigarettes, said there were no other rooms available. He came up to the room, flushed the toilet a few times, but said he could not smell anything. Feeling there was nothing else we could do, we left the lights and fan on in the bathroom all night long and plugged up the crack below the door with towels. The next morning we informed the woman at the front desk of the sewer gas and she was apologetic (saying she didn\u2019t know, which could be true). Our throats and lungs burned with every breath for the next day and half. I believe the hotel knew about the problem and intentionally aired out the room before we looked at it (the patio door was open when they showed us the room).
