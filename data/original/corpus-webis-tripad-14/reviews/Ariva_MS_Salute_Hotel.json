We had three brief stays there, before and after trips to Sapa and Ha Long Bay. We had a different room for each stay. All our rooms were interior rooms, with a window onto an air shaft. This made for a quieter room, and we were only in the room briefly during the day. While our first room was fairly small (as another reviewer mentioned), our other two rooms were more spacious. The bath seemed just fine, and we did have hooks for our pjs. Nice bed linens, good toiletries provided, both a refrigerator and a safe provided in the room.", "title": "Great little hotel -- attentive staff", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Sron", "date": "October 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5902989, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 liked it all"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "The location was outstanding -- so very convenient, in the heart of old Hanoi.
