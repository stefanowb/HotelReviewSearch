Many a time we had walked past on day trips to Palma and thought how nice it looked and in such a great location. We had a room at the front on the 5th floor. It was very clean, great bathroom and quiet, despite the location. My only (minor) gripe was that the mattresses are a tad on the hard side. The minibar prices are extremely reasonable but you can also get almost anything you want in the large department store next door. Breakfast is a treat with a great selection and wonderful coffee (Nespresso). They even cater for no dairy, lactose free etc. Don't miss the roof terrace as it has fabulous views and is a great place to chill out with a glass of wine (theoretically they do now serve drinks but you're best to bring your own). Staff were excellent and spoke perfect english.

Unfortunately after day 2 we encountered an issue with the plumbing and a strong stewage odour was coming from the bathroom. We spoke to the staff at the hotel and they empathised and moved us immediately to another room - 804 - WOW! I was very impressed how quickly they reacted to the problem. The new room was excellent (very large double bed, coffee table/comfortable chairs/sofa, large bathroom-no bath, mini bar/fridge, TV with 3-4 English Channels, predominantly news channels), whilst no balcony the panoramic windows opened up completely to enhance the amazing views and we could always use the sun terrace if we wanted to sit outside. The only small negative comment I would say about Room 804 is the bathroom is not enclosed so doesn't provide a private environment when washing etc., and the door opens directly into the Bar which at High Season may prove to be noisy during evening (unless you are joining the party of course)!
