Given it was fashion week in Paris availability elsewhere was limited. Great. This occurs despite corresponding on line and speaking twice to reservations on the phone. Received the obligatory \"sorry\" but no assistance in finding an alternative hotel. The final irony is Wednesday morning when I go to checkout (after spending over an hour on the phone Tuesday looking for an alternative hotel) the gentleman processing my bill says \"but, I see in the computer that you are not scheduled to depart until Thursday...\".

I cannot explain how welcome the staff makes you feel from the first arrival to the sad day of departure! We stayed for 7 days (October 6-13) in room 415 (Deluxe room), and the room was large with a beautiful marble bathroom with double sinks and separate bath and shower (equipped with a rain shower head). The room overlooked the quiet side street (rue Boissy d'Anglas), and even though the room was next to the elevator, we never heard any sounds through the double doors. The Hotel de Crillon will close at the end of the year for a 2 year renovation. Fortunately, none of the historical areas will be preserved in their current grand style.
