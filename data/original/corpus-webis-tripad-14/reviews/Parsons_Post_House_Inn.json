My husband and I decided to stay here with my mom for a long weekend to show her how nice Ogunquit is. The owner Frank and his girfriend Holly were more than accomadating, especially since we choose the weekend of Hurricane Irene!! They made us feel more than comfortable providing us with hurricane kits just in case the power went out (which it never did). Holly even offered to wash our clothes after my mom and I fell in the mudd at the playhouse (it was the funniest thing you would ever see) She is also a great baker. Franks daughter was visiting and it was nice to meet her too! We only wish we could have stayed longer to meet Terry, Frank's sister. This place was clean, well decorated and very inviting!! We hope to come back again next year.

The new owners are kind, welcoming, and accommodating. One of the owners, Terry, treats her guests with delicious homemade muffins and coffee.

To my surprise when we arrived we found there are new owners who were wonderful from the minute we checked in to when we checked out. They have clearly updated the entire place to make it more of a beachy feel. They did a great job! When we arrived and went into our room you are welcomed with a hand written note on lovely stationary and chocolates form the Harbor candy shop. In the morning when you wake up there is always a fresh pot of coffee and homemade muffins. When you come back from a day at the beach or shopping you are greeted with a large pitcher of water with lemon wedges and sometimes some homemade cookies. All in all we of course will be back next yr and will not hesitate for a moment to recommend this Inn to our friends.
