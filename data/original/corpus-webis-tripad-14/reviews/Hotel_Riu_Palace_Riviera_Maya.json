It was awful, and that's a shame. Every night there would be 150-200 really well dressed guests milling around in the courtyard area and the best they had to offer was Mexican folk dancing. One night was kids night, they recruited children out of the audience to come up on stage and sing. Come on! Almost every other aspect of this resort was great, but whoever is in charge of entertainment should be fired. RIU Tequila (a 10 minute walk) has Pinata open from 2300-0200, but a resort like this deserves it's own club. Overall I'd say the best food of the all-inclusives I've been to. Krystal is not to be missed. They have the same type of dinner reservation system that a lot of the resorts use (go to the lobby between 1200-1500 and make up to 2 nights worth of reservations). Seating choices are 6:30 or 8:45. A little tipping goes a long way, hint, hint. Beach was great, lots of chairs under the shady palms. Pool was not huge, and they only have one which got pretty warm and oily by the afternoon but I go more for the beach so was not a problem. As you'll read, the hallways are tiled and get pretty noisy at night but the hotel is well constructed, you never hear your neighbors once their door slams. For whatever reason female guests seemed to outnumber the men 5-to-1. The hotel is located within Playacar so every car coming in has to show ID. The only folks walking the sidewalks at night are other tourists like yourself, I didn't see a single sketchy character. Arrange a trip or grab some snorkel gear and a cab to Akumal Bay. Saw more sea turtles than we could count and they are oblivious to the snorkelers.", "title": "A Really Good Resort, Could Be Great If..........", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Krellijo", "date": "August 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 73665140}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wow, great service, food, beach and pool", "text": "I use Trip Advisor religiously before going on trips and found that many of the people I met use it as well.

The location is great, with a lovely beach with tons of sun loungers. Everything is so new and clean...we used the spa whilst we stayed there which I would highly recommend. The food is fantastic....we tried 2 of the specialist restaurants...Krystal and The Japanese one...which were both excellent. I cannot fault this hotel...the only slight complaint would be that the room did seem a bit damp all week...which i think is due to the cleaner mopping it everyday with no ventilation...so it had a funny musty smell...BUT If you are staying in this area...Riu Palace Riviera Maya everytime!!!", "title": "Fantastic hotel...A true palace", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "kupocat", "date": "July 5, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 69775516}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya with my dad and 15 year old sister (I am 23) from June 24-July 1.

I can only say that the some parts of the bathroom, such as the mirror and inside of the shower, were a little dated and could use some sprucing up. Also, the beds were a little hard for our taste. None of us experienced a musty smell that some other reviews talked about.

As for making reservations, yes there was a line, depending on what time you got there. If you get there a little before 12 pm, you'll probably wait in line for 15 minutes the most. It just depends what time and how many people are waiting that day. You can make reservations for two days in advance.
