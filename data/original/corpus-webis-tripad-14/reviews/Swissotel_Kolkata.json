This was my second stay here and was well worth it. The Hotel is uber-luxurious and attached to a big Mall with a Multiplex! I loved the car-ramp and the entrance lobby and the atrium of this differently designed beautiful property. The staff is so polite and the check-in was smooth once again. The rooms are excellent with soft comfortable beds and pillows. The bathroom area is nicely designed with good shower temperature and pressure. all the accessories are modern and stylish. The best part about the Hotel is the Scandinavian Style Wooden Bar on the first level. The bartenders are well trained and the F & B is above average. Swissotel really looks after small details in making their guests comfortable and I was impressed.
