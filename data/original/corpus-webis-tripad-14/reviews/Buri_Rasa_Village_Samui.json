This resort is near perfect. It has a great location with its own piece of beautiful beach. The friendliest most helpful staff I have ever met, clean well appointed rooms and many included extras. There are only a couple of minor drawbacks which I will mention at the end. First for the positives. We arrived at 11.30pm and were greeted by the night manager. Check in was seamless with no problems, and we were shown to our room by the manager. A bellboy brought our luggage a few minutes later. We were given a cup of tea at reception, a cool towel and a small garland of flowers each. Once in our room we were shown were everything was and how to work air con etc. There was no sense that the bell boy was doing this for a tip, merely to be helpful. We were upgraded to a superior deluxe, which basically has a HUGE bath in addition to a shower (no reason for the upgrade, they just did it). The bed was very comfortable with nice bedding and lots of pillows. it was a 4 poster with a linen cloth near the ceiling. The room has a 32\" flat screen TV with a few English channles (Movie Channel, Discovery and BBC News) the rest is Thai. There is a bar fridge stocked with beer and soft drinks which for a hotel is quite reasonably priced. there are also bottles of whisky and brandy and packs of Pringles. There was a lovely balcony with a wall sofa and table and chair (we were in a 1st floor room which is accessed by about 15 steps (#17)), anyway the balcony is great for sitting out on at night having a cold beer (which is cheaper to buy at a local supermarket - about 42Baht for a large bottle of beer) The bathroom we had was quite large with a big shower which always had hot water, as I mentioned before a HUGE bath and a sink. There are shampoos soaps and the usual hotel knick knacks provided along with incense burners and mozzie repellants. (By the way we didnt suffer too badly with mozzies, the hotel sprays the grounds regularly which seems to keep them at a minimum). There is an electronic easy to use safe in a curtained alcove which is also stocked with umbrellas, a torch, slippers and gowns, also plenty of room to hang and store your clothes.", "title": "Near perfect", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "claguey1", "date": "February 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 95643786}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We only ever used the restaurant for breakfast which was included in the price. The staff there are brilliant and extremely helpful and courteous, in particular: Chart, Arm, Wat and the succinctly named \"O\", any of these guys will go out of their way to make sure your breakfast is awesome. There is the usual buffet fare along with made to order hot food such as eggs benedict, pancakes, and Thai food such as noodles or rice with chicken/pork/prawns (yes for breakfast) Beautiful fresh pastries and fruit, cheeses and cold meats, yoghurts, fresh honey still on the comb and even, believe it or not, vodka shots ! (must be for the Russians). The restaurant is open air and is next to the bar, pool and beach. The pool is about 15 metres long, 5 wide and only 1.2 deep (about 4 foot) for its entire length, so no diving! It is not heated, but is nice and cool after sitting in the sweltering sun. I found it to be actually cooler than the sea. There are about 20 loungers above the beach (including cushions, pillows and towels) and another 20 or 30 on the beach itself. The only problem with lying on the beach is the hawkers which continually walk up and down selling stuff or wanting you to have your photo taken with a monkey (no not your husband!). The beaches are not privately owned so there is nothing the hotel can do about this. However if you are on a lounger above the sand (about 6 feet away) you are on hotel property and they are not allowed to approach you. The sea is lovely and warm (once you are in) but can be quite rough with big waves and a strong pull, so be careful with small kids as they will easily be pulled in and knocked over by the waves. Make sure to wear lots of sun cream, even on cloudy days (I learned the hard way!) Topless sunbathing is frowned upon (although I saw one Russian lady topless and nothing was said). Bar prices arent too bad, a bottle of beer (small) was 85Baht (about 3US or AUD Dollars and 1.75GBP. They also stock lots of spirits and will make cocktails as well. There is a snack bar that prepares burgers, chips etc and now and then the staff come around with complimentary snacks. Away from the beach there is free internet access in the lobby and even WiFi if you have a laptop. there are lots of trip info guides and a pond with Koi Carp leading to the lobby.", "title": "Perfection", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Swooster", "date": "January 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 94211321}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We partook of the Massage service while we were there, they had a special offer of a full 1 hr Swedish or Thai massage for 2 people for 700Baht which is about 24 US or AUD dollars or 15GBP for both of us total ! What a bargain and what an experience. The ladies are professional masseurs, we were taken as husband and wife into a private room with two massage beds and had a great massage from top to toe. By the way you are expected to strip naked, so not for modest people. It can be a bit embarrasing as a bloke as sometimes you dont have full contol over your body (if you know what I mean) but as I said, the girls are professional, there is no hanky panky and they have seen it all before (you are covered by a towel for 99% of the time, so just 1% of embarresment !!!

I would definitely recommend the Buri Rasa for romantic getaways and couples, there were several gay couples of both sexes whilst we were there and no issues with that, everyone was there for a relaxing quiet break and that is exactly what you will get.
