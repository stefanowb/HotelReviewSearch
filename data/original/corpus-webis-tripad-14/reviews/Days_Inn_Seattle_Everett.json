We are budget travelers, so we don't usually pick--but for the money we spent, I will point out the problems we found here. Mattresses were really uncomfortable. The place is old and rundown and new paint cannot hide that. The temperature control on the heat/ac unit is not good--either you fry with the heat on--running forever!!--or you freeze when you turn it off. Hot or Cold. No in-between comfortable temperature. It's just not worth the money. We stayed for one night because we were tired and our first choice didn't work out and we were running out of options.

When on a short personal trip, my expectation when spontaeously choosing an off the Hwy motel for an overnight enroute is not high, and I am not nit picky. However, this motel room was dirty, deep filth, a hole in the shower curtain the size of a cannon ball - how could a maid not notice that? Sacks of garbage lined up outside doors and stairwells. Cig burns in the bedspread, spills over mattress and walls. Not worth grieving over...except when it came to 11:04am, a phone call to the room (I was awaiting my sister to pick me up, which would be within 15 minutes - she, my traveling mate on the road had to rush her dog to the vet at 9am) I was told by the Manager, \" Lady, I can have you removed from the room\"...Never, in my life have I been so rudely treated, especially from someone running a dumpy hotel, with drunks and low life bellowing from open doors. Although, the Quinta had kindly called over to find out the pet policy at this hotel, and to make my reservation I was accused of being ' a liar\", deceitfully harbouring a dog\"....It was absolutely outrageous, the treatment, and the deplorable conditions of this seedy motel. My purpose in bothering writing this, is simply to alert travelers to stay clear of this property.

It is connected to the dining room which is again huge with ample tables and chairs for eating breakfast. This motel is located next to a nice mall.
