We were so looking forward to our first trip to the U.K. and being there for Christmas was a bonus. We are frequent Hilton guests and while the room itself wasn't bad and the staff was friendly enough, compared to what we are used to at a Hilton hotel, it was just not up to standards. For whatever reason and no matter how hard we tried, we just couldn't seem to get them to bring us wash cloths. They just piled on more body towels with every request. It was almost as if they didn't have enough to spare. The showers had some really oddly placed swinging glass door panel that only covered the tub midway so water was always hitting the floor making it a precarious situation getting out of the tub which is much higher than a standard one in the states. The mini bar charged you if you thought about looking like you wanted something in there. Seriously, there is a sign on the frig door that says if you lift up an item (even if you don't open it), it will be charge to your room! A bit extreme. The bed was more like a platform bed and was just okay and the lounge area as well as the restaurant charged us a fortune and we always walked away hungry and/or dissatisfied. The final insult came on our last day as we were checking out when another hotel guest from the states informed us of the hospitality suite that she and her family frequented to avoid the high costs of eating out. It was open all day for meals, drinks, internet, etc. The front desk never mentioned it which would have at least made up for the ridiculous amount of $$$ we spent getting nothing.
