Janvara street, I mean entrance. Rooms are very good, but too noisy, because the trams are passing by every 10-20 minutes from as early as 5AM and street itself got quite a busy traffic. Rooms on the opposite side do not have any nice view - you will only enjoy viewing some construction works or rooftops, but they are nice and quiet. I started my review from contras, but that doesn't mean you will not enjoy your stay at Avalon. Rooms are very reasonably priced, so the value is just great.
