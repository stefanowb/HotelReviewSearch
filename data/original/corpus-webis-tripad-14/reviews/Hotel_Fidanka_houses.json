We had the BBQ twice, which was good, but one other dinner we had there was a disappointing. We felt that they had adapted Turkish cooking to the British taste (chips with everything, but no rice to be had). During our 9 days there the clientele was almost entirely British. There were also a kettle and cups in the room, but no tea or sugar. We thought the breakfast was a bit unimaginative - there was exactly the same choice every day with the bread being especially boring. Orange juice and lemonade were not freshly pressed from fruit, but tasted quite artificial. We did not see the owner once during our stay, instead everything was largely managed by two young guys - very nice - one of whom was almost inseparable from his mobile phone, which he had on during dinner and breakfast service. Room service was superficial. Our bed was made once during the entire stay, a dead moth on one of the rugs in our suite stayed there for the full 9 days.

The hotel had good points and bad points. We booked through Tapestry and picked the Nar Suite based on the assumption that it was a top floor suite (we did not want anyone above us). Upon arrival, I was very disappointed with this room. It was the last room you passed before reaching the roof terrace area and so the staff had a tendency to hang around just outside the bathroom window waiting for customers. The roof terrace itself was directly above the bedroom in the Nar Suite and so we could hear people moving around up there and then furniture being moved at the end of the evening. The layout of the \u201csuite\u201d was a bit strange with one completely empty room, apart from a table, but bare floorboards, which apparently used to house a kitchen. The main door to the suite was not completely secure and was locked with a padlock. The room did not have a kettle but it did have a large fridge.
