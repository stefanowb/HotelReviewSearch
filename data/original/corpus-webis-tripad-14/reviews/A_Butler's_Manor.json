The pool and outside dining areas are surrounded by blooming rose gardens and many other varieties of blooming flowers, trees, and singing birds. The home is equally as beautiful, clean enough to eat off the floors, and within walking distance to South Hampton. This couple has thought of every single thing a traveler could desire. One example of their level of service: Offering to drive us to the local beach (using their beach chairs and towels) and pick us up at our desired time, so we wouldn't have to pay the $20 parking fee.
