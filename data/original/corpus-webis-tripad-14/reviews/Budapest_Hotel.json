I was with my 15year old daughter and I felt quite safe, though some people who are a little sensitive may want to ask the restaurant or hotel to organise a car.

I stayed for 3 nights in Dec. '07. I prearranged an airport p/u for $50 each way, which was excellent. This hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Red Square. The whole area around this hotel & the Red Square was very nice, w/ Beverly Hills type stores. The room had a high ceiling, large bed, a high window, refrig. TV, ornate bedspread, & decorations, & everything you would expect. The bathroom had a shower stall only, no tub, but hair dryer & everything else. The off season rate was something like $175, for my first night, Sun. due to their weekend discount, & $225 for Mon. & Tues., both taxes & all included. I booked through their website which was cheaper than Orbitz, Expedia, etc. They do have a restaurant in the lobby that I did not eat at. I ate one meal in the bar, which was strange, but gave a good flavor of communist type food. It was a mixed plate, w/ little sausages, a few squirts of ketchup & mustart on the side, beets, & a little canned peas. The borst soup was OK. One prostitute was in the bar, & 2 \"goon\" looking bartenders. I had a few beers in the bar several times, too. The in-room frig. was stocked w/ beer, wine, bottled H20, etc. They say not to drink the H20 in Moscow, & there is a nice convenience store up the street & to the right, for 2 litters of bottled water for the equiv. of $1. The front desk people smiled, but did not seem too concerned about where to point you for restaurants, $ exchange booths, or what not. One of the bell hops yelled at me in Russian after I accidently went down the service elevator. Oops! I didn't know. But I tipped another bell hop on arrival well, & it seemed like he was telling the \"yeller\" to leave me alone in Russian. The TV channels were good. I enjoyed watching the Russian shows. They had European CNN & MTV, I think, too. I really liked this hotel. The Marriott down the street was something like $750, & other hotels in Dec., farther away, were around $350. I never did find this cafetaria that sells Russian food for cheap, & wish I did. The mini-bar frig. was cheap. Most of the restaurants were $50-100. I had a cheeseburger at the Marriott for $30. But there were little convenience stores that sell snacks, sandwiches, etc. that are cheap. After all the locals have to pay the prices. Compared to Alaska, where we are used to paying high prices for everything, I didn't find Moscow expensive. Overall, I really liked this hotel. And, I absolutely loved Moscow! I wish I had more than 3 nights, 4 days there. I always travel off season, & found this hotel to be a good bargain. I probably wouldn't want to pay their in-season rates. However, I would still find it worth it due to the high costs of the other hotels. Oh yeah, & the breakfast was strange, but not bad. They were always a little \"off\" w/ their delivery timing. 10, 20, or 30 minutes. It was prepackaged cereal, muffin, a mini caraffe of coffee or tea-you choose at check-in. I do not remember any hot items. However, it also gave the flavor of communist style Russia, where the food is not what we are used to in the West. This is one of the reasons why I went to Moscow, to see how things were/are different. Unfortunately, I did not see this, being near the Red Square, where everything is nice & sort of opulant. I did not really see the dreary high rise apartment buildings, etc. Yet, judging from other's poor experiences in sub-par hotels, it was probably a good thing that I did not experience this first hand.", "title": "Old World Charm", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "wanderlustak", "date": "May 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 16263885, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location.
