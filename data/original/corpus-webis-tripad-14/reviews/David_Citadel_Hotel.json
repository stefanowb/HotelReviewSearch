I was incredibly impressed. Many of the other reviewers of this hotel seem to be used to luxury hotels but for the average joe this place was awesome. The service was GREAT. The hotel is almost totally run by young Israelis which gives it a cool vibe. Front desk staff is multi-lingual and very helpful. The location is perfect, a ten minute walk to the Old City (ie: Jaffa Gate, Bazaar, Tomb of Jesus). Very safe location. Rooms are furnished nicely. Lots of restaurants and cafes in close proximity. Nightlife starts at 11pm .. get there any earlier and it will be empty. Try to get a local to take you somewhere as the clubs are a little difficult to find. I had access to the Executive Lounge on the 10th floor .. a great place to grab a snack and a soda (or cocktail) during the day. There is one computer and printer up there which was usually available, had no problems using it (except for a paper jam on the last day). Business center downstairs isn't bad but be prepared to pay for the time you use the computer. The huge breakfast buffet is reason alone to stay at the hotel - they have the biggest spread ever.
