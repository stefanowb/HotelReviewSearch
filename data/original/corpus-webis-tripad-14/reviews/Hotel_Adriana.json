On the \u201cservice\u201d (that\u2019s nonexistent) front, my friend and I were sent to a room that had one double bed. When I went back down to the desk and explained that I had requested a room with 2 twin beds, the obnoxious person told me at the desk told me that I\u2019d need to pay 40 kuna more. Although I had e-mail confirmation of the room I requested being the initial price, this worker and another refused to budge. It seems ridiculous that they were more concerned with making so little (less than 8 USD) extra money than with honoring their word, achieving customer satisfaction, and gaining future business.
