As for proximity, it was an easy walk and readily accessible by vehicle. If I had had more time I would have made use of the swimming pool and gym as well. Clean, courteous and convenient!

Hint: type East Hartford into your GPS, not just Hartford. The king bed was fabulous, business travelers will find the desk and free wireless internet convenient, the tv swiveled so you could see it from any place in the room, the closet had 2 pants hangers and about 8 shirt hangers (incl. an iron), the bathroom had a shower that was quite large with glass doors and complete with hairdryer and coffee maker. We were on the 5th floor and had a pretty good stay. The second night there was a young child staying directly across the hall that woke us several times (from wee morning screaming: midnight, 1am, 2am). It was unfortunate. Not sure if the hotel can do much, other than possibly making several rooms with extra soundproofing to put children in. I have seen it indicated that they have a heated pool, and it might be, but I put one foot in and decided just to sit in a lounge chair. My husband was a bit braver, but said it was uncomfortably cool. There was no hot tub. We used the fitness center that was good by hotel standards and was all working: 2 treadmills, a stair stepper, a recline bike, and dumbbells. They had a water cooler, but it was not working. The breakfast area had plenty of room and was well stocked. They can close off the food area from the eating area, so they start closing at about 5 minutes to 10am, even on weekends. They also replace their cheese omelets with powdered scrambled eggs once they run out around 9:30am. For some reason the waffle machines leaked which created a big mess, but they still turned out well. The breakfast area did not have a good flow to it, but it might have just an oblivious individual that took entirely too long at the coffee station.", "title": "Show, Game, or Twain - Good Deal", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JnDsTravelog", "date": "October 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 83879989}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went to see a show at the XL Center.
