Hot breakfast was not very inviting with over cooked burnt sausages and no bacon. Chef serving had no voice to assure customers hot fresh items were available and would be served. Paid \u00a369 saver rate which included 2 breakfasts, I would not consider paying the standard rate of \u00a3100+ for this hotel.
