It's a really cute place. We were met by lovely co-owner Simone (we didn't get a chance to meet her husband Collin). It was perfect and priced right for our one night stay. Our room had a queen size bed, a television, a microwave, a mini-fridge, an electric pot to make coffee or tea, a hair dryer and air conditioning. The Inn is not by the beach, nor does it have a pool or a restaurant. The airport runway is literally across the street. We didn't hear any planes at night. A taxi from the airport to the Inn costs $8.", "title": "Perfect for our needs", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MrsTraveler", "date": "September 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 39831941}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled solo", "text": "Having to stay over night in Antigua on July 18th, on my way to Montserrat, I was told about the Wind Chimes.", "title": "Clean,Comfortable great for overnighters waiting for contecting flights", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DuchessRainham", "date": "July 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 36162486}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "After being awake for twenty one hours, I was not looking forward to much, being very tired I was feeling ratty.
