The location of the Byron Hotel is convenient, near two tube stations that sit on different lines. The hotel was clean and tidy, generally well decorated and the staff always pleasant. The breakfast room, being smaller than the amount of guests the hotel can accommodate, works on a rota basis where guests book a 'sitting' the following morning. Works in principle but as you'd expect not everyone turns up at the allocated time, sometimes requiring those who did book in having a brief wait. We booked direct via their website. Our own room, on the top floor, appeared to be built into the attic and was much smaller than we expected, not having much room to swing the proverbial cat. The room had a small window overlooking the rear courtyard, and had the standard facilities you'd expect of a 3star. It appears, from other contributors and their pictures, that there are much better rooms available in the same building. There is a hotel lift which does the job a lift should, although it is 'cosy' with four occupants. To summarise, we would stay again as the hotel is nice enough backed up by pleasant staff but only if the room provided was larger.", "title": "Clean and tidy with pleasant staff, our own room was rather small though", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Telephant", "date": "June 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 33290728}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Ideally situated just a short walk from Queensway/Bayswater tubes.
