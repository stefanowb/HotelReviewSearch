Busselton is a delightful town on the coast with super beaches, shopping and opportunities to tour the SW area around Margaret River. Our hosts were so welcoming and knew just where we Poms should visit. John even took us to the golf course, as we hadn't seen any kangaroos...and there they were. Of course we saw them every day after that. As keen birdwatchers the area is very good with the Vasse catchment and varying coastal habitat nearby. There are not enough superlatives to describe our stay.", "title": "Home from home", "user": "Stormydog101", "date": "December 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 147481886}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were in Busselton for the Ironman WA competition, which involves weird hours, strange practices and odd eating requirements. But our lovely hosts, John and Doreen, talk absolutely everything in their stride. We had a big room with an ensuite, a double and a single bed, free broadband, TV and DVD - and best of all with a triathlete in the family, a kitchen for the use of guests. Doreen's breakfasts deserve to be legendary, and somehow just about every egg we had was a double yolk. The B&B is on the main road so there's a bit of traffic noise during the day but we weren't particularly disturbed - and it's very quiet at night. The other guest who was staying at the same time was from New Caledonia, and John switched from French to English and back again without blinking. It's a bit of a hike into town, so you'll need a car - but there's a lovely beach a couple of hundred metres down the road. We were made very welcome, and felt very much at home and very much looked after. We were tempted not to tell anyone else about it, in case they run out of room for us next time!", "title": "wonderful B&B , great stay", "user": "BertandCathie", "date": "November 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120982217}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific", "city": "Busselton"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 5}, "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Our Bed and Breakfast provides clean and comfortable accommodation at an affordable rate.
