Barisit House Hotel is a very nice contemporary-design hotel behind a classic facade. I would call it an outstanding 3-star hotel. I paid about 60 euros per night, including 21% VAT. In any major city, this hotel certainly would cost more. It has an fine location in the old part of Rosario, not far from the center and the waterfront (about 15 minutes to the water), but far enough from all the noise some reviews of other Rosario hotels mention. The rooms are understated, with aircon, flatscreen TV, and a shockingly reasonably priced mini-bar. I had plenty of hot water in the shower/tub. There is no view, because this is a remodeled urban house, but the window overlooks a space that is a small courtyard on the ground floor. Not to worry, you get plenty of light through the window. One touch I enjoyed was the little sofa on the landing between the 2nd and 3rd floors. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Not all spoke English, so be prepared to use Spanish if you can. There are plenty of good restaurants, bars, cafes, and convenience stores within walking distance. Taxis are quite easy to get on the street. My only complaints are that the wifi signal was not very strong and that I feel a hotel of this class and quality ought to have a safe in the room.", "title": "Contemporary, non-pretentious and a great value", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Massimo1", "date": "December 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121397391}], "location": {"country": "Argentina", "region": "Litoral", "continent": "South America"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 6, "very good": 41, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 21}, "slim_ranking": 0.142857142857}
