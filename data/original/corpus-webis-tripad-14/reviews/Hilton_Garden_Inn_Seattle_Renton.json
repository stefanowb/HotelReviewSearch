The staff was \"Excellent\" from the GM on down. These people should write the book on Customer Service. There were several amenities that made my 8-day stay the best. The room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was comfortable. Their courtesy van service eliminated the need for us to rent a car; they transported us to and from the airport and anywhere else within five miles of the hotel. I felt safe in the area. The campus was clean and nicely grooomed. I ate twice at the restuarant - the 1/2 pound burger was very tasty. The staff was always cleaning the lobby area; they kept a clean coffee bar; there were always fresh cookies in the evening; the fresh lemon water was not only beautiful but a refreshing treat; I appreciated the free Internet; the workout room was a plus.

Upon check-in got 6 breakfast coupons as a H&H Gold member. Breakfast was very average, I have been to other Garden Inn hotels and seen a lot of better ones with far greater variety... surely would not pay for this one. In six days there I was asked just twice if I need anything at the breakfast... I guess coupon people are not great tippers, right? Room with king bed was clean, internet connection free and quite fast, but after two days of stay there I discovered my fridge is not working. Try to find out why and discovered somebody has taken the wires from the electricity... why? Because electricity plug was broken... insted of fixing the damn plug they have just switched the fridge off. Brilliant. I did switch the fridge back, only to discover that this fridge is in fact working so hard that it freezes the food... :) Definetely the big MINUS for the hotel maintenance.", "title": "Frustrating and Lame", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ftgrnegrl", "date": "August 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 117318295}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I'm giving this a Poor rating because since I've been here (12 hours), I've experienced a lot of frustration. After a 6 hour flight from the east coast, I was really happy to arrive. As soon as I got to my non-smoking room, however, I was overwhelmed with the smell of smoke. I think whoever prepared the room must of known this too because the window was wide open and the airconditioner was blasting. I called the desk and politely asked if I could change my room. It was explained to me that there were no more available rooms (totally understandable) and they told me that it was just a smoke smell seeping in from the hallway or a neighboring room. Which was ridiculous since there are ash burn marks on the furniture in the room, proof positive of a smoker in the room , and there was no smoke odor in the hallway. The offered to send up someone to the room to spray air freshener, (cause nothing makes a smoke smell better than combining it with the smell of air freshener.) Finally, they offered me a breakfast voucher which was a good gesture. But I still hate lame excuses that refuse to validate my legitimate complaint.
