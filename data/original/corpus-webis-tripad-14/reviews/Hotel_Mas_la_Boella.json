Arriving at 20.00 I decided to have a swim and then dinner in the hotel restaurant. The swimming pool is small and \u201crustic\u201d which means that water is slightly milky with various leaves and flowers floating on it. Hence, I skipped that part, even though the outside temperature was 32C and went straight for dinner. We took a choice of starters, which in particular for Iberic ham is good and comes in generous portions. The main dish was less good; the sea bass with Porcini mushrooms seem not to fit together, the mushrooms were giving to the fish an acid taste. At 22.00 we asked for a bill, we had to remind the waitress every 10 min that the bill did not arrive, finally we go it after 30 min. The waitress was very busy and visibly hardworking as she was serving probably 10 tables, the bill came from the \u201crestaurant manager\u201d, why so late? After the dinner I got finally to my room with the intention to work, I could connect but my colleague in suite no 11 was getting the network only around the bathroom area, not ideal for working late at night. The thermometer in my room was showing 29.6C (I assume it is internal temperature), but the air-conditioning system was set at 25C. However the temperature was not going down, I reset it at 21C, but in the morning I saw 28.4C, still not sure if inside or outside (?): the night was bearable but could have been cooler.", "title": "A lovely and excellent place where to stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "angelbe", "date": "August 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 137283135}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012", "text": "In the morning after a good bath I tried to use the hair dryer.
