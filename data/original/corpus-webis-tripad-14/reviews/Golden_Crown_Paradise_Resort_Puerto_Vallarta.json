One downside to the hotel is that we thought they could have done something to warn us about this predatory encounter. Nevertheless, unwarned we proceeded to play victim to the timeshare scheme. You will learn that these people come to you at the airport, make you believe that they are with your hotel and that they are helping you, and then they will turn around and invite you to see some other property for a discount on excursions. The silver lining is that we were advised these timeshare sellers must be out of the airport, the breeding ground for their scheme, in less than six months. However, we did in fact see one of the properties and we saved a lot of money on excursions because of it. If you fall victim to one of these sales pitches make sure you have an entire morning (and we mean AN ENTIRE MORNING) of your vacation you are willing to give up for it.

Don't always go on what other's say obviously. If you've never been to Mexico before please understand that it is not AMERICA. Things are different, you will be treated different, no the beds aren't as soft, yeah the food may not be as good, but that's what's sometimes exciting! I had never been to PV before but had stayed at all inclusive resorts in Mexico. Once we got to know the employees, we were \"golden\" they're all so nice, they knew us by name (it's all about how you treat other's) The food at the resturant's was good, but to be honest we spent most our time at the pool or bar so ate at the snack bar. The taco bar is great, their breakfasts at the hut bar are great, but I would advise againsnt the room service breakfast. Room service otherwise was great, I ordered beer and shots to my room at all hours of the night. They got to know me by name and knew exactly what I wanted once I told them my room number. hehe..... Like most I think you go to Mexico to have a good time and drink! Well I was able to do plenty of that. My girlfriend and I wanted to rest on the beach till all hours one night, they made sure they came and checked on us to make sure we were okay, and safe. They're very worried and care a lot about your safety. Puerto Vallarta is VERY GAY FRIENDLY so if that's an issue for you, don't hang out downtown in the clubs. My best friend who joined me is gay but I am not, however I of course AM gay friendly, so I had a fantastic time downtown which we hung out all night. Sorry getting off track here. Our room was AMAZING!!! we had a fantastic view right over the ocean, I loved the pool, once you get to know the bartenders and waitstaff they'll take very good care of you. If you treat them like servants they're not going to be as attentive to you, which is in my opionion expected. So go, have an open mind, don't be easily discouraged, you're still in a foreign country, I've yet to stay at ANY hotel in the world that had a soft comfortable bed. And I've been all over the world.

I cannot be more pleased with this resort. This was the best vacation that we ever took. We have been on alot of cruises and always thought that was the way to travel, but we have found our new place to return too. Its the Golden Crown, with its warm welcoming \"hot towels and refreshing beverages\" upon arrival to its \"sexy coffee\" after dinner drink, we could not be happier. I HIGHLY reccomend this resort. Ultra Romantic, quiet, CLEAN, peaceful, staff is super friendly and we met some great people from around the states. The pool bar is the place to be after dinner, with its pool table and cute little bar. The food is amazing, Mahi Mahi is to die for. We loved every second and maybe we need just one more visit here before we have babies?? :) Otherwise we can take them to the kid friendly Crown right next door. All in all this vacation was PERFECT. I love Mexcio and while the gulf side is a bit more crazy with its party life, this was the perfect vacation for us \"older more mature\" partyers that like to enjoy the next day laying by the pool and realxing in the sun, not hungover and sick. The music the people the food was great. The staff could not be more helpful, these people work their butts off, often working all day at the pool bar and then all night at the club and then repeat it over and over. They always have a smile on thier face and will do anything to make your stay enjoyable. In conclusion, we highly reccomend this resort, for the price was super affordable (all inclusive, meals and premium drinks for us drinkers here in Wisconsin!!) Great wine with dinner, and GOOD drinks with GOOD liquor, not rail stuff that makes you sick. We truly were not ready to go back, We were actually very sad to say goodbye, I'm still sad!!
