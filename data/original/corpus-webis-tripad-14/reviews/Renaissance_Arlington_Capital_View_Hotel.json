Nonetheless, nothing felt as if it was skimping on energy - for example, even though many hotels have taken away in-room refrigerators, this hotel still has them.

The hotel is very new with a bright and airy feel and very contemporary decor. The folks I encountered at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. A staff member was assisting another guest with check in and almost immediately another staff person appeared to assist me. Check in was extremely fast and efficient. I arrived at the hotel around 5:00pm and was surprised to see housekeeping still cleaning rooms when I went to my room. In fact, right after I went into my room there was a tap at the door and then someone from housekeeping was opening the door. Upon seeing me, she apologized and said she didn't realize the room had already been cleaned. The hotel is a few blocks from the stores and restaurants of Crystal City. In nice weather it would probably be a nice little walk. The hotel does provide shuttle service to the Crystal City Metro stop and they also provide shuttle service to Reagan National Airport. I took the airport shuttle service both ways and while I appreciate the convenience, it did run rather slow. The airport shuttle service also stops at several other nearby Marriott Properties, including a Residence Inn which is apparently connected to the Renaissance. The hotel has one of the best fitness centers I've seen at any hotel. In addition to a number of treadmills and eliptical machines, there were other machines (including leg press, leg curl, leg extension, lat machine, smith machine), several benches, bosu balls and numerous free weights to let you get a gym quality work out. My only complaint about my stay was that there were no washclothes in the bathroom in my room, which I only discovered as I was about to step into the shower. What I thought was a stack of wash clothes turned out to be a stack of hand towels so I had to improvise. Despite the very minor annoyances with the shuttle and the bath linens, all in all I enjoyed my stay and would definately stay here again.", "title": "Very Nice Hotel", "user": "Saved1Boston_MA", "date": "March 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 126148093}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I came for a conference.

When I was in the bathroom at the same time as my neighbor, I could hear EVERYTHING.

Went back to the loud, uncomfortable lobby to use the free internet service, but there are no plugs if you want to use your own laptop. I couldn't get their airline ticket to print out my return boarding pass. My room did not get cleaned. There was a coffee maker in the room, but only one cup of caffeinated coffee for a room with 2 double beds. And the people in the room next to mine were so loud I had to call security - at 3 am. Breakfast - granola with yogurt - was a tiny bit of yogurt with way too much granola, sprinkled with a few berries. And for something that didn't require preparation, I waited far too long.

I am 30 years old, and well dressed and a rewards member. Once I left the bar to proceed to the front desk, the agent did not acknowledge my Rewards status or confirm any of my special request until I said something. Went up to the room and waited and waited and waited for the bags and finally almost tired of waiting I finally called DTS and I said to her, \"Im ****** **************, I don't know my room number, but i need my bags.\" I was calling from the hotel room phone. I asked here do you know who this is? She said, \"yes, now what can I do for you?\" Thins was said very rudely and never even attempted to call me by name or anything. So, 1 hour later bags finally arrive, not even an apology and the guy actually waited a few seconds as though I should tip him. We showered and came to the bar area again, me and my friend went to the host stand and no one there. Finally once seated We ordered a mojito, and 15 minutes later came back to say they are out. Come on, give us options! I told the server, me and my friend are going somewhere else. he responded, \"oh, ok.\" and walked away. RUDE!
