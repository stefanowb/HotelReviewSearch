This review is about the older Hyatt Regency on the corniche - NOT the Hyatt Grand which seems to be shown in the pictures. I'd stayed at the Regency on a few occsions in the past when weekending over from Muscat. When taking my wife and son back to Dubai in January I'd decided the hotel from past visits to be a little run down and out of date so booked into the Dusit instead (a mistake!). However on taking my son to the ice skating rink at the Regency I was amazed at the transformation a makeover had made. So much so in fact that we booked to stay there 3 nights in February. What a fantastic change this hotel has gone through. This goes from the lobby, through to the relocated (and vastly improved bar) into the rooms. Staff were courteous and helpful at all times. Location of course is away from the 'new' Dubai but easier to get to the airport. Pool as always is a bit square and goes into the shade in the afternoon. My wife says that on the plus side its only a walk away from the gold souk! Would be my hotel of choice - if I had't stayed at the Hyatt Grand leter in the week!", "title": "What a transformation!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "johnybegud", "date": "March 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6899732, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 new look; ice rink in building; walking distance to gold souk and creek area", "disliked": "\u2014 internet access - very expensive and should really be nominal fee if not free."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent", "text": "Stayed there for three days....I loved the views,hotel.....and especially the service l was provided by the waiters...it was at night and the were very proffessional..Well done Hyatt..l'll definely recommend everyone there.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Cecefoxy", "date": "December 15, 2006", "id": 6445168}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled on business", "text": "Third stay at the Hyatt Regency Dubai and a pleasant stay as always.

Good meal to be had in the Japanese restaurant. The one drawback was the 30 minute wait for a taxi in the morning.
