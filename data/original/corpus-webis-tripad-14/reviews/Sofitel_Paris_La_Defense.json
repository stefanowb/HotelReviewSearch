The reception area is warmly lit, welcoming and well-staffed with highly competent professionals who know how to service a very demanding clientele. As in any proper Paris hotel, there is a nice restaurant with good food \u00e0 la carte or otherwise at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Room service is always delicious and prompt and the rooms themselves very nice with full minibar and all of the amenities.

BUT, the bathroom in the room was quite large and luxurious... with a tub and shower, bath robes, slippers, and Hermes washes... (Another guest said he only had a shower when I praised the tub...?) The breakfast was incredible and where the value is. I did not think the La Defense Esplanade area was convenient or interesting, ( VERY windy with lots of beggars and some weirdo walking with a cell phone having a loud pretend conversation) so please figure that into your estimation of the worth of my appreciation of this hotel's location.

Even before we arrived the Concierge was fantastic helping us get museum tickets so that we would not have to wait on the huge lines. When we arrived the front desk was extremely courteous and fast, we had a complex reservation to sort through and they had already done the work. This was indicative our entire stay, extremely nice and helpful staff. The rooms were quite large by Paris standards, well maintained and very quiet because there are no cars on the street level - you are on an esplanade, so it is very quiet. There is a small mall and restaurants directly under the hotel and many on the esplanade. Getting to the #1 Line is a few hundred yards, extremely convenient to get into the center of Paris very quickly and efficiently. I don't quite understand the criticisms of the breakfast buffet - it was extremely generous and high quality. Yes it is expensive but not out of line for what you would spend for a similar buffet at a similar class hotel elsewhere in Paris. This Hotel is not 5 star because the building simply is not capable of offering those type of amenities, the fitness area for example is adequate but not 5 star, but the service and other aspects are really excellent - over 10 days with 3 rooms you can really tell if there are problems.
