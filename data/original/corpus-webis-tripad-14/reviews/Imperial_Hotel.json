To start with the staff was so friendly and welcoming, the hotel owners could not do enough to make the day go as smoothly as possibly, the food was quite frankly amaizing, really fresh produce and with over 100 guests to our wedding though out the day, they constantly commented how beautiful the food was, not one could find fault. Te rooms put aside for the venues were more than capable to cater for our requirments, without intruding on other guest staying at the hotel, the residents bar open for as long as we wanted so even after the party guest had long left we could still enjoy a quite drink well in to the early hours.
