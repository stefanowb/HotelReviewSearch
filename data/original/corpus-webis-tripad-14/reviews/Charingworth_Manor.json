It still is wonderful building with lots of character but as a hotel it is not in the same league as Lords of the Manor, to choose one local rival. It is a serviceable, comfortable hotel. The service is fine but there are moments when it feels like you are in a seaside lodging house. The pool is nice but a like the rest of the hotel it is feeling a little past its best. I have to say that we paid a fraction of what it would have cost to go to the Lords of the Manor so the comparison is not strictly fair. In the end you get what you pay for. We eat in the restaurant which had some real high spots (beautifully tasty local lamb) but again compromised by some other aspects of the meal.", "title": "A lovely building - but not the hotel it once was", "user": "Kingmaker", "date": "October 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180725651}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Went to Charingworth Manor for a few days of relaxing and certainly found it, room very nice with own terrace looking over a fantastic vista, perfect for enjoying a glass of wine with perfect weather for October.

Booked on a solstice package which included afternoon tea but due to the 7 million caravans that seemed to be on the road we arrived just over 5 minutes late. The greeting from reception was OK but I think she must have been having a bad day as eye contact or communication seemed a bit lacking. She did (without acknowledging me) phone the chef to let him know that the 'other solstice package had arrive' and he did agree to do tea even though we were late. Glad he did as I can confirm that the Pimms jelly was superb. The room was average and we booked a deluxe. Dinner was ok but my fish had an odd bitter sauce however, my husbands food was fine. Breakfast was Good. We were always referred to by the Room name and not our name which I thought was a bit off and the service was a little officious. Personally didn't feel that it was that welcoming unlike the next hotel we stayed Flitwick Manor. But I guess horses for courses and people like different things.
