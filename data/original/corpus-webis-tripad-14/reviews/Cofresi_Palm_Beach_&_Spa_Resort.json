Gross! The bathroom had all reused, half full and worn out labels, complimentary lotion, shampoo, etc. ! Totally unsanitary! The accomidations were below average to say the least. Our electric went out about every two hours in the room. And if that wasnt enough i got food poisoning the 2nd day in. Spent my birthday in the 24 hour emergency hospital room receiving an IV and medicine which was lucky enough on the resort. That is the only positive of the whole resort. At one buffet a \"chef\" would freshly cook you pasta and fresh vegetables, however if you got a \"lazy\" non english speaking worker they would only offer you the left over already cooked sitting food.
