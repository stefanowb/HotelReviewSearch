In summary, nice feature that has potential, but currently overpriced for the selection of food and times drinks are offered.

Check in is on floor 23 which is the actual Concierge Lounge, which was refreshing, but be prepared, the concierge checking you may offer several sales pitches for the current palazzo and venetian shows. I don't know about you but after a long drive into vegas, I just want to unwind in my room or at a bar, not at the check in desk with a sales pitch. Each time I went to the Concierge Lounge to book a show or dinner they always tried to push their own shows and restaurants, which gets a bit old after a while. On the positive side, the concierge lounge itself was beautiful, with a nice view looking over Treasure Island, and Trump Towers area. The lounge is a spacious area of 6 or 7 Large rooms to hangout in instead of the casino with all the noise. In terms of value, I personally found the extra $100+ a night for the Concierge Lounge a waste of money as the variety of what was offered was pretty slim and the bar was only open from 5-10pm or so. Breakfast is continental, with cereal, some fruit, bagels and toast. The afternoon presentation was the worst. It was exactly the same from day to day: They offered scones, tea, some fruit and biscuits (in the few days I was there, the afternoon trays of food were always full, as they were hardly even touched). Evening presentation and open bar were okay, nothing like the Ritz Carlton Club Levels. They offered mixed nuts, some fruit, and a couple types of cheese, chocolate truffles, crackers and two hot dishes per night (bacon wrapped scallops, teriyaki chicken sticks, mini quiche pizzas, mini beef burritos, mini vegetable egg rolls...)
