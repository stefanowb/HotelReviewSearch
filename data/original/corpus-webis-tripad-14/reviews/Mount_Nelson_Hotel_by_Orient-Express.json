It truly ranks among the finest hotels in the world. The service is excellent, the rooms unusually spacious, and the facilities in tip-top shape. Don't miss high tea, which is served every afternoon. The setting and the menu will remind you of every episode of \"Upstairs Downstairs\" you ever saw. One hint: the hotel provides free shuttle service to the downtown area. For other destinations, they can arrange for their own car service or a metered taxi. The hotel car costs a bit more than the taxi and, from what we observed, there is no appreciable difference in the service. Also be aware that if you arrange for a guided tour through the hotel travel desk, the cost will be about 30% more than if you make your own arrangements. We used both the hotels guide and another that we arranged privately. While the hotel guide was fine, the private guide was exceptional. We highly recommend her: Contact Julie Clarke, Cape Splendour Tours. You can make all the arrangements by email (julie@capesplendour.co.za) in advance of your arrival. She tailored our trip to the Cape of Good Hope to include points that interested us, such as Kirstenbosch Gardens and the penguins at Boulder Beach.

Unfortunately, it is not near the sea, but the mountain views offer some compensation.
