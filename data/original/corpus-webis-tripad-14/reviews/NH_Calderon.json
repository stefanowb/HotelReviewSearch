Booked online with alpha rooms who had cheapest rate - \u00a3112per night including breakfast. First impressions were good, check in quick and polite staff, we were given room on 2nd floor after previously requesting a room on upper floor, room was dark- tired and not over clean. When asked to be moved to a better room we were told that we had a very cheap rate and that they had nothing else available. On further investigation we realised that the hotel was under some refurbishment as the top half of the building was out of use, except for the rooftop swimming pool. Hotel is in a good position for shops and sightseeing etc and when rooms are refurbished it will be worthy of 4 stars - to sum up - breakfast buffet was very good and roof top pool also good but needs more sunbeds and chairs as i counted only 8 sunbeds which were all taken when we used the pool - did not think we got value for what we paid considering the vast amount of hotel deals in barcelona.
