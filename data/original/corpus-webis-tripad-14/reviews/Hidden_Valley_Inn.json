There are so many good things to mention. Butterfly Falls is beautiful. It is only one of the many waterfalls, pools and hiking trails located on the property worth exploring. The food is outstanding. The staff is friendly and helpful. They greet you with a cold lime juice when you arrive and will help you book a tour or suggest areas on the property to explore. Estella makes about the best pina colada I've every tasted. Our room was great. The fireplace was a nice touch, especially during the wet season. On the downside, the hot tub was broken while we were there but that was just a minor disappointment considering all the other positives this Inn has going for it.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "joomi", "date": "July 16, 2006", "id": 5473283}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "We spent our first four nights in Belize at the Hidden Valley Inn.

We didn't want to risk getting another flat since we no longer had a spare. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The tour guides at the Hidden Valley Inn (and the ones they contract out to) are incredibly knowledgeable. We could not say enough great things about Ric. He pointed out all sorts of flora and fauna along the roads, and told incredible stories about the Mayans. The road to Caracol was \"closed\" during our visit due to recent robberies and a rape, but we visited other ruin sites and Barton Creek Cave. We didn't visit the Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave, but the other guests who did said it was without a doubt the highlight of their stay in the Cayo district.", "title": "Favorite place in Belize; on-going mental vacation", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "peta4meter", "date": "June 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5298541}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "The Hidden Valley Inn grounds are gorgeous and the rooms are impeccably kept.

The rooms are very tastefully decorated, with a large, comfortable bed. The pool was a refreshing oasis after our day of mountain biking and there's a screened-in room where you can watch the sunset, read your book and enjoy a Belkin beer or two! The food was very good, although there is a set menu with a couple of choices at each meal. They will accomodate dietary requests. The staff were very friendly and hard-working. We borrowed the inn's mountain bikes and had a beautiful (although at some points gruelling!) ride on their trails, stopping to hike into a breathtaking waterfall. The roads do require a 4 wheel-drive vehicle, especially if you're going to drive beyond Hidden Valley to 1,000 Foot Falls.

We loved it. The cabins are beautiful and work well. The restaurant is fabulous and service is second to none. The waterfalls are great fun. We rented a Ford Ranger and drove ourselfs. The 18 miles off the western highway where the Inn is located is the worst road I have ever seen. We waited until the wheels fell off the truck and they eventually did. We drove to Tikal and there a pretty nasty stretch of 13 miles in Guatemala but not as bad as Belize.
