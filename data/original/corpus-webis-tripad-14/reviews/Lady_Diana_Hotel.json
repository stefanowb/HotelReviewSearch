We lived in small cosy room. Hotel transfer met us in airport despite night time and brought us comfortably to hotel. All personnel was very polite and helpful. Additional thanks to Murat Cone who kindly helped us with booking. The very best remarkable thing about Lady Diana Hotel is perfect view from the roof restaurant and bar. Every day that we started in this restaurant having breakfast was perfect. From there you can see Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque, and Marmara Sea. So, living in this hotel you are in old center of Istanbul.", "title": "Perfect hotel for romantic stay", "user": "sergt007", "date": "August 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 38224658}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I had the priveledge of staying at this hotel in July 2009 with my 16 yr old daughter. We had no idea what to expect but what we found was a hotel that was just perect for the two of us. The staff was extremely helpful and arranged our tour of Ephesus. It is located in the heart of the Old City and close to all major historical sites. The breakfast was an absolute treat and overlooked The Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofya. I noticed that other reviewers complained about the room size. I am not sure what else one would expect in Europe. We loved our room and bathroom. We didn't have a great view but that wasn't important to us. The AC worked really well. The beds were comfortable and the shower was the largest that we had seen on our 2 week trip. Free WiFi was available in all of the rooms which was an important feature for us as we had our own computer. There was also a computer available in the lobby. This hotel is a good value for the money. If I am ever in Istanbul again I will definitely stay at The Lady Diana again.", "title": "We loved this hotel.", "user": "Traveler1212_9", "date": "August 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 36434132}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "If location is your priority, then by all means stay at this hotel. However, don't expect a nice room. Ours was so small you could not even lay a suitcase open. No view, dark and dingy. Also, be prepared for them to tell you they have to move you to their \"sister\" hotel. I had heard they do this and it happened to us. When our friends arrived they were told the hotel was overbooked and were moved to a slightly lesser quality hotel. We were told there was a problem with the AC.

If you want the nice 5 star resorts they are all over on the other side of town and just not handy. That's the sort of places we usually stay so we are a bit bias with 3 or 4 star accom. You spend little time in your room as there is so much to see in the area. Rooms are smallish but not to bad, Ask for a quite room, we got a corner room and got no noise, Aircon was ok, not to noisey. You have to keep windows closed at night as the mosques make quite a lot of noise every 4 hours or so. Take ear plugs, really helps. Don't rely on the reasturant, meals as they are pretty basic and after one main it's time to look elsewhere. I dont think the chef has a clue quite frankly. All the staff stand around gauking at you while eatiing, quite off putting. Use the resturant and outside decks for your coffees, nice setting and views. I'd stay here again as there is no choice but if there was a Sheraton etc next door you would'nt see me for dust. Ps they will also pick you up at airport for no cost.
