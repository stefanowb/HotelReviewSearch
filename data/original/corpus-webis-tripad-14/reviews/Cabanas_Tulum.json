My husband and I chose Tulum and Cabana's Tulum because we didn't want to be around a lot of people. The hotel beach had lots of hammocks, beach mattresses, and chairs. By the afternoon most mattresses were taken, but we always had one. There was a beautiful pool, but we never used it since we prefere the ocean. Our room was simple, clean, comfortable, and functional. The bed was pretty comfortable with exception of the sheets not being the best quaility. The staff (including The Bistro staff) were all friendly and willing to help in any way. There was always hot water for showering, but a little tricky to adjust. There was no cell service or televsion, but there was poor internet. The food at The Bistro was great, but a little expensive.

I did a lot of research, and was very nervous about staying in Tulum (worried it was a little too eco-friendly for me), and about not going all-inclusive and having to find all our own food and activities. I was blown away by how much we LOVED this hotel, as well as the area. This is one of our favorite vacations we have taken. It floors me that people can find such minor things to complain about here. We booked a deluxe beachfront room. It was beautiful. The huge windows/doors looking into the ocean was the most gorgeous view to wake up to each morning. The patio space was great, and very functional with a couch, hammock, and dining table. The natural beauty of the outdoors brought in, as well as touches like gorgeous woods and stone throughout the room...no complaints there. The bed was very comfortable. I was expecting a rock! Towels were replinished every day. We never got hot and only used the AC one night. Most nights we slept with the doors open, and the screens shut. No bugs in room. Only didn't have hot water one night. The front desk is close-by to pick up new beach towels and breakfast tickets. You can get them the night before if you don't want to go by in the am. No big deal. The pool area is very nice. The addition of the new decking makes a huge difference. The beach beds were always available, including shady spots. Beach service was great. EVERY employee at the hotel was beyond friendly, and went out of their way to make us comfortable and happy. The free breakfast had lots of choices, and we were always full. The lunch and dinner was great there as well. A few times, we had them deliver food to our room (who can beat eating on your own private balcony on the ocean?). For our anniversary, they decorated the bed with petals, brought our breakfast to our room with roses, and left us a bottle of champagne. When I had problems with things I booked, they gave good advice and even let me use their personal cell phones to call the company. I have no reservations recommending this place. The waiter for our last breakfast even made us a beautiful flower arrangement. The bartender made my husband an awesome coconut drink, then cracked it open, carved out the coconut and showed him a special way to eat it with spices and lime (then did it AGAIN two nights later). Even though our week was windy, then chilly, we had one of the best trips we've ever had. When asked at check-out if I had any suggestions, the only thing I could even think of is a foot bath for the upstairs rooms to keep sand off the floors. (Even so, the maid service got it all up daily). My husband said it'd be nice to have a small fridge, which is true (we bought a styrofoam cooler, but the ice completely melted every day).

Although some of the glass has a smoke tint to it, it was relatively easy to see into the bathrooms. We hung a towel on a hook outside the shower to provide us with a little more privacy, but this may be something for the hotel to look into.
