Was very impressed with size, decor, facilities etc. Also the pool, jacuzzi facilities etc were excellent. Again though the staff lower my opinion of this hotel; on more than 2 or 3 occasssions I could get no answer from reception, even though they had posted a note asking me to contact them to arrange to refill the mini bar - this was never done. We ordered breakfast in bed which arrived on time and looked great but was stone cold. Again when I tried to phone somebody about this - no answer. I couldn't even get the huge trolley it came on removed from our room (I got through on the phone later in the afternoon and told them I had left it in the corridor). It remained there for 24hrs. At check out I informed the staff that I had tried lots but had not been able to get the mini bar refilled and had used approx $45. They told me it didn't matter and I wouldn't be charged. Because of this I didn't complain about the breakfast (which cost approx $75). I paid for my phone calls (I had a faulty phone or something went wrong disconnecting a call at reception so lost 40mins on an international phone card), and left. When I got back to the uk I had been charged the $45 dollars too! I must say that not all staff were poor; the guys who open the doors, collect and deliver luggage were pleasant, helpful and a credit to the hotel.

I believe it comes down to what you expect in a hotel,and previous experiences in 5 star. I rarely travel,so the thought of a 5star hotel in sydney sounded good.My daughter (7) and I stayed overnight in a deluxe king room.We traveled by train to wynyard station and is only a street away walking.On arrival,the door was opened with a \"welcome to the amora\" the girls at front desk were polite and showed us how to use the cards for the elevator and rooms.Our room was on floor 17.I found the rooms spacious enough,HUGE king size comfortable bed,well stocked bar fridge,tv,robes,slippers,guides to sydney,very nice bathroom with deep tub,seperate shower,shower gel\\shampoo\\cond\\hand lotion. Our room looked into the other buildings with glimpses of the water,but if you stay in the CBD you just expect that and being from the country it was fine with us to check out the city. We had a light dinner at the Gallery and was nice.Breakfast for a buffet is $33,but there is a food court practically underneath,with every kind of eatery you could wish for.Also a cafe next door advertising full breakfast and coffee for $12.50.Location - Perfect! A short walk to circular quay\\botanic gardens\\ferries\\trains etc was excellent.We explored the hotel pool which we thought was nice with a sauna\\steam room\\spa as well,and the beauty room.Did not use these but seemed very relaxing.Other reviews say about times with this hotel.Yes the pool\\restaurants etc are open certain times, so if this is important to you doesnt it make sense to find this stuff out before you go?Anyway we loved it,and the service,I think if you have a smile,they will too.", "title": "Everthing was perfect!", "user": "MJosie", "date": "August 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 18910620, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 68, "average": 215, "very good": 456, "terrible": 53, "excellent": 421}, "slim_ranking": 0.318918918919, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "From the moment you arrive at our 5 Star luxury hotel in Sydney, you\u2019ll experience the Amora difference.This award winning 5 Star hotel in Sydney combines space, style and warmth to provide the ultimate ambience for business travel or holiday pleasure.There are 415 stylish guest rooms, two restaurants and two bars offering exceptional wining and dining facilities, seven meetings and conference rooms and a dedicated relaxation zone incorporating Amora Day Spa, a heated indoor swimming pool, steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and gym.Amora Hotel Jamison Sydney is located next to Wynyard Train Station just a 10-minute walk from Circular Quay, Sydney Opera House, Harbour Bridge and The Rocks.
