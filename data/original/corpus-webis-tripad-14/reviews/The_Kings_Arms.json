On arrival, we were informed that we had been upgraded to a platinum room at no additional cost. On entering the room, we were amazed at the quality and luxury. Yes, it was at the front of the building and a little noisy, but with the windows closed this is not such a problem. The full length shuttered sash windows are a beautiful feature and should not be replaced with double glazing, although perhaps a well installed secondary glazing unit would resolve the noise issue. As others have commented, it was quite warm in the room (the sun had been out all day) but it cooled down at night. Perhaps the owners should consider air conditioning to resolve the heat complaints, but for us it was not an issue. The bar and restaurant were superb, prices very reasonable and the service just right. A lovely continental breakfast was delivered to our room at the requested time.
