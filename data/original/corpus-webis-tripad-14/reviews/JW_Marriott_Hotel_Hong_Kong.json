The \"free room\" on the first nights were on the 10th floor and was an average Marriott room. The hotel is built so that each room is a \"corner\", which improves the view, including into your neighbors' rooms. It was quite humid when we arrived, and the room smelled very moldy. We were only there for a couple of days, so we didn't complain. We stored our luggage for a few days as we traveled and returned to an \"upgraded\" room on the 34th floor, which was an identical room but with a view of the harbor (and no smell!). We had hoped to enjoy the executive lounge in the evenings, but it was noisy, crowded, and so brightly lit that you could not even see what would have been a spectacular view of the harbor if the lights had been dimmed. The food and the drinks in the lounge were good, the service good, and the location, over the Pacific Place, outstanding. It is very easy to take the Airport Express from the airport to the MTR station if you don't have a lot of luggage, although we opted to take the hotel limo service which was excellent (750 HKD.) All in all, it felt like a typical business hotel to me, but a good one, at twice the price that you would pay in the States. If you want a more unique Asian luxury hotel experience, I would consider the beautiful Shangri-La, which is located next door to the JW. (We stayed at the SL in Manila and were overwhelmed by their service.) In terms of Hong Kong in general... it's a very clean tourist friendly city.. and is especially a good place to stay over on your way to other destinations in Asia.", "title": "Stay at the Shangri-La", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JohnMD", "date": "January 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12309123, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of privacy due to the"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "From the moment the bell boys opened the front door and we stepped inside we were treated like royalty.
