Next door was an Ibis and their staff were more than helpful, they rang through to 3 Ibis hotels in Saint Malo, they eventually found a room available for us and booked it. Upon arrival in Saint Malo, we were impressed with the hotel, yes a little bit basic, but the staff were so friendly and showed us where to park. The rooms were clean and stylish and we were lucky enough to have a view over the harbour. We realised how lucky we were to get a room as there was a huge festival going on and the tall boats were all anchored in the harbour, WOW was an understatment!!! After finding a table in a restaurant (which are literally a step away from front of hotel) we enjoyed the party atmostphere of this great city. The hotel included breakfast of the usual bread, cereal and yoghurt, but so very clean.
