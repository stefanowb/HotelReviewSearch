The d\u00e9cor was really nice, the beds were comfortable but you are rarely in the room. Down side they have changed the heating from oil to electric. It was controlled from a central control room which was not good as we had a faulty patio door sensor which caused the heating to stay off, so the room was a little chilly and when it did work it was very drying. The oil heating was much more comfortable.

Well they could have not been more wrong. WE had a family room with piste view wihch was spacious with nice bathroom and seperate toilet. Let me start with the food, it was excellent , varied, fresh and diverse. The wine at the table was accpetable and easy flowing. The staff at the restaurant where accomodating. Like all club med resorts drinks at the bar are free and the staff behind the bar where excellent, fast service even when the bar was at its busiest. The GOs where very helpfull, expecially when my eldest son broke his wrist, I was 2 hours away and they took him to hospital, waited with him and brougth him back to the club and enteratained him till i arrrived. The lady named Leila was excellent and kind hearted. Also thumbs up to the Genral Manager Jean Marc and his assistant Jacklin, always took our minor complainst seriously and made sure we where happy througout. Granted the resort is now old, (It will be refurrbished this summer) but if you seek a family holiday , relaxed, ski in ski out, great food, fun entertainment, well club med val claret was a good experience.", "title": "Lovely club med experience", "user": "Nazlab", "date": "March 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 14486864, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly athmoshphere and food", "disliked": "\u2014 Teenagers felt left out"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "This hotel is in major need of a total refurbishment.
