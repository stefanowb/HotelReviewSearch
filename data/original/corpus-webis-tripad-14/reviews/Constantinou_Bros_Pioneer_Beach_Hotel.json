We always got beds near the pool/beach and they were very comfy and came with a sunshade. Food and drink in the hotel was quite expensive but of good quality (buy drinks in the happy hours!). Local bus service was easy to use, with a set fare, timetables and maps given free at reception. The Meze Corner restaurant was a great place to eat 10 mins up the road if you want authentic food. The Harbour restaurant near the harbour was also very good for lunch or dinner, it had air con in the evening. The child free aspect of the holiday added a serenity and peace that's hard to describe, it really was a wonderful relaxing break. Our only complaints were the shower kept going hot & cold of its own accord and the courtesy room was a vile small hot sweaty shower room, no bench or seat, no ventilation/ air con etc, you needed a shower when you got out of there!! awful! so if you can afford to pay for your room to be extended then do so.

First impressions of the hotel when we first walked in was a very good one, after a long flight we were checked in very quickly and given the key to our room. The room was spotless, and we had a bottle of water and a basket of fruit in our room when we arrived. At breakfast there was lots of variety to choose from, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful, although don't put your knife and fork down to quickly as they are quick to take things away as soon as the last bit of food goes into your mouth. During our stay at the pioneer we noticed you had to be up before the birds if you wanted to get a sunbed so that meant we were up before 6am most days. There was lots to do throughout the day. Marie as we soon learnt got everyone involved with different activities like, aqua fitness, pool, darts and french boules. She was lovely and would always make sure everyone had a good time. There was a variety of age ranges from 18 through to 80. Everyone we met was very friendly and the atmosphere was so relaxed you could really enjoy yourself with no screaming kids or the noise of a lad's holiday. In the evening again the food was varied, with lots of different things to choose from, the chef was very helpful as myself I have a nut allergy came out every evening and showed me what contained nuts. The only gripe was that the men had to wear long trousers, which my partner didn't realise until we got there this meant we had to go out and buy some more from town.The staff did their best to meet your every need and they couldn't do enough for you. There was lots of different entertainment on in the evening, and if it wasn't your thing then you could take a wonder down to the harbour where you would find lots of other things going on in paphos.

The hotel is not in the centre of Paphos but I enjoyed the peace and quiet. The Pioneer sun lounger area is right beside the sea and a paved walk-way leads all the way to the harbour.

It is very comfortable and efficiently run - pleasant and helpful staff, very good quality and choice of food, extremely clean. We were there for 2 weeks on B&B, but you can buy the evening buffet, usually 16.50 euros each, but if you buy at least 4 you get them for 14 euros - you can then add as many more as you want at the same price. We finished up having 6 meals and you can take them any day without prior notice. The omelettes and fried eggs at breakfast, done to order, were the best we\u2019ve had anywhere!! Although the bacon was deep fried the end result was excellent. Several reviews referred to the age group at the hotel - although many guests were of \u201cadvanced\u201d years we found a good mix from 30s upwards. If you wanted you could join in the dancing classes or outdoor bowls. There is also darts, pool and table tennis. The hotel is child free, but this was not a factor in our choosing the hotel. It had THE best \u201csundowner\u201d area we have sat in. We thought the drinks were not too expensive - the local cocktail (Brandy Sour) was 3.20 euros, cocktail of the day 4 euros, and other cocktails and spirits (including mixer) 5.90 euros - and the best bit - half price during happy hour (6-7). Near the pool there is a self-service caf\u00e9 where hot or cold sandwiches, etc. are made to order.
