Breakfast was free and was okay for cereal and rolls. The \"Eat'N Park\" next door offers a discount with your room key and has good food and great service.

Traveling the east coast corridor between NJ and Florida in the late 1960\u2019s/early 1970\u2019s, I remember the orange roofed restaurants next door to the HJ Lodge or Inn. The rooms were always huge and there was a patio or balcony with 2 lounge chairs.

HoJo is just a name today - a franchise with easy standards to follow. You can take the name and plaster it on any cookie-cutter motel you want to. Honestly, the corporate company that owns the franchise system should just retire the HJ name because its not the same anymore. I will go farther and retire Ramada Inn and Days Inn - names that meant quality in their glory years under private ownership.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Reading_travelor", "date": "March 21, 2007", "id": 7197547}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good value... excellent pool.", "text": "The New Stanton, Pa Howard Johnson motel - built in 1960 is pretty old already. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not falling apart, it was clean, and I didn\u2019t notice any long term residents. The owner was pleasant and we talked about the golden years of HJ. I requested a king room far from the pool. My room had a microwave and mini-fridge, cable with 78 channels and the old style table and 2 chairs. Yes I\u2019m spoiled since I rather have either a recliner or lounge chair with ottoman. The old Westinghouse air conditioner kept the room cold, though a bit noisy for some I rather have it that way to drown out noise - which there was none even though the place was packed. Original HJ motels like New Stanton\u2019s were very sound-proof, constructed of cement walls and floors. Everything worked except the free wireless internet. The signal was there but it just didn\u2019t connect. I called the front desk and he agreed that there was a problem but it was something beyond his control. If I was staying more than one night it would have been a problem for me. My room also had a patio with 2 plastic chairs.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "moostack", "date": "July 30, 2006", "id": 5528214}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 23, "average": 20, "very good": 16, "terrible": 25, "excellent": 7}, "aka": "Howard Johnson Inn New Stanton Hotel New Stanton", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
