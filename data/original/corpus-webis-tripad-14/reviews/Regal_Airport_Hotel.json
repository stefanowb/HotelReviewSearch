The female receptionist was efficient but lacked any warmth. The concierge's staff (Johnny and Leon) were helpful and gave good advice about how to get places. The bedroom had two double beds (I was travelling alone) so plenty of space to spread out. The bedroom and bathroom were clean though I felt the inside of the bath could have benefited from an extra scrub! Also I found a drawerful of coins from a previous guest so housekeeping could be improved. Tea and coffee making facilities, an iron and board, in-room safe, hairdryer, slippers and bathrobes contributed to a pleasant stay. Very minimal noise from the airport and the view from my window was across the end of the runway to the sea. I ate in the airport where food is apparently cheaper than the hotel. Check out was at 12 noon but as my flight was not until the evening I was able to store my luggage with the concierge at no cost, and take the free shuttle bus to a nearby mall. From there I took the cable car up to the giant buddha - quite an amazing trip and a good way to spend the afternoon. There are nice spa and pool facilities at the hotel (the former quite expensive, I thought) but I was not in a mindset for them. I would use this hotel again for a one night stopover for the sheer convenience.", "title": "Very convenient and comfortable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Ardene", "date": "September 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139704131}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Rooms are quiet, no aircraft noise. swimming poll nice.

The decor is Moscow discotheque circa 1980, the staff are uninterested at best, and there is no attempt to hide the fact that the majority of guests are stuck there because their flight got cancelled. Admittedly, the hotel's location just a few hundred metres from the main Hong Kong airport terminal (access via a covered walkway) is extremely convenient, but that's where the attraction ends. When you have to work so little to get customers, it shows. I only booked a day-room because I had a twelve-hour lay-over between flights.

The property location adjacent to the airport is fantastic especially with luggage and/or a late evening arrival. My check in was slow and poorly organized even at 0200 in the morning and few people around. The room was 3 star motel at best with a noisy air conditioner and sounds of running water throughout the night. The bed was like sleeping on a fold out sofa bed (with the metal frame digging in with each turn). No mini bar (without a deposit being paid - this would have been great to learn about prior to leaving reception) and room service required cash to be paid on delivery(?).
