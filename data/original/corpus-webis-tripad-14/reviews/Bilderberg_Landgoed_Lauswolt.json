It looks like a public pool and has no luxury at all, it is totally Eighties, and completely boring. There is weird towel service in the room, no idea why I would need 6 little towels per day in a little basket in front of my room. Staff is rude, or at least completely uninterested. Food seems to be michelin star level, but we found it obnoxious, little fingerfood that made no sense, and main courses that you could also find in the Van der Valks of this world.", "title": "Stay an enjoy a perfect wellness", "user": "Peter L", "date": "September 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 140764647}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled on business", "text": "We paid a fortune and we left with a feeling that we were ripped off.", "title": "Should have brought swimsuit and golf clubs", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dsm_99", "date": "August 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137435052}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "This hotel offers excellent service, outstanding restaurant an a perfect wellness.
