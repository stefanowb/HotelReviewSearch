Our room unfortunately faced the pub which was expectantly loud until late. We ate at the attached pub twice, but the service at breakfast was terrible. We had a simple order- coffee, tea and two cinnamon rolls. Twenty minutes later the waitress finally comes back out to tell us they were out of the rolls and would something else do?

The room was named \"Altar Boys\" and had quotes from former altar boys on the walls of the bathroom. It was a bit odd.
