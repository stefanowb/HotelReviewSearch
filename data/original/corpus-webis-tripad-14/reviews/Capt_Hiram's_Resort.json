The walls were paper thin so you could here everyone coming and going down the hall as well as people outside by the pool. We were on the third floor and there were people partying down by the pool and you could hear every word they said from our room. Across the street from the Inn is the Inn's Bar and Restaurant. They had a band playing and we heard it all night long until they shut down. We didn't have to stay over there to hear them we could have partied in our room to the music it was so loud. Upon checking out I told the clerk about the noise and he had to response, just handed me a copy of my bill and sent me on my way.

Fold out couch was completly destroyed and couldn't get another room or another couch or a fold out cot. Was pretty much told sorry about you luck. Also complained about our air which never work right the whole time we were there. They did send someone out to fix it but never fixed it. Problem with air never resolved. Front desk and/or managers where not willing to help us or even cared to help us. Pretty much some of the ruddest people I have ever dealt with. Problems continue over at the Sand Bar because everyone was rude and didn't really care to help you are care that you were even there. Point being this place is a tourist trap.

I recommend for breakfast Country Ham and Eggs restaurant on US 1 if you want a change from the continental breakfast at the Inn. Even if you have to wait it goes quickly and they even have a coffee pot for you while you wait. Also recommend Vic's Italian Restaurant, I think it's on Washington and US 1.
