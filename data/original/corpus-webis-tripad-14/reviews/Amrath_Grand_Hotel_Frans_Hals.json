If you have a car it can be hard to find but it is walking distance from the railway station. Haarlem is only 20 minutes away from Amsterdam by train and the hotels are cheaper so it makes it a good alternative. After visiting Amsterdam we were happy to go back to Haarlem which offers a similar feel without all the traffic. We got a good deal on the hotel's website and made a last minute reservation. My only problem with the hotel is that the pillows are too hard but you can request softer ones at the reception, something I wish I had known ahead of time. There is a computer and a printer in the lobby and the internet connection is free of charge which is certainly a plus. There are safes in the rooms and water dispensers on every floor. We didn't try the breakfast there because of the cost, $18 per person. Overall we were very happy with our stay.", "title": "Nice Hotel in Haarlem", "user": "Vbg", "date": "August 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8363635}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We loved our stay at this hotel, Nice new clean rooms. King was two twins pushed together. Water dispenser on each floor you can help yourself. Very nice new washrooms. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Free computer to use in lobby. Excellent location in Haarlem. It is about a ten minute walk to train station and 15 minute train ride to Amsterdam. Shuttle bus from airport takes you to Haarlem bus stop about a 5 minute walk from hotel.
