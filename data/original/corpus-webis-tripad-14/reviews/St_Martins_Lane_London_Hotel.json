Or at least, you won\u2019t be very forgiving of its particulars. There are plenty of equally expensive major label hotels in London for people who enjoy that kind of experience.

We arrived off of a 4-hour train ride from Edinburgh, tired, peckish, and slightly damp from navigating the alleyways from the Leicester Square station in the rain (which is ridiculously close, but for two disoriented Americans, it's not). Ed, at the front desk, was so sweet and accommodating that he had our gigantic soggy suitcases wiped down before he took us to our room. That right then and there was above our expectations, for I'm sure those bags suffered far more abuse from Virgin Atlantic than a little rain. Anyway, our room was fantastic - located right behind the English National Opera House, so it was very quiet. Even though it's smack in the middle of the very busy Leicester Square/Covent Garden (and we were there during Cocktail week) it was very peaceful. Everything was new and clean, the amenities plentiful, and most importantly, the bed was very comfortable. I also loved the plant hanging on the wall, and how a member of the staff would light a candle in the bathroom in the evening. It was those small details that made this hotel so lovely. But I have to say, it is the staff that really makes this place so special. Everyone is so kind and knowledgeable. I cannot count the times we went to the concierge (each and every one of you is a credit to your service) for help, whether it was cheap theatre tickets, how to get a refund for the Oyster Cards that never showed up, or how to make a simple local phone call (which is quite complicated if you've only dealt with no more than 10 digits for the majority of your life...11 if it's a 1-800 number...I swear we're really not that incompetent). To top it off, the hotel's location is perfectly centralized to EVERYTHING even though it's smack in the middle of the very busy Leicester Square/Covent Garden We mostly walked everywhere, but it's so stupidly easy to take the tube anywhere and everywhere as well.

This will probably be my last stay at this specific hotel. There was nothing horrible about the hotel but it was just not a good value for the money. To be fair, the currently weak US dollar is part of a problem here. The hotel's location is excellent. Very close to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and The Strand. The Philippe Starck design is playful and funny. I love the LCD displays in the elevators that play an ever-changing variety of video art. The limestone clad bathrooms are very efficient and well-designed for their footprint. The rooms are small but that is fairly common in London where hotels are generally not a good value for the money. The bed was very firm which I thought I'd appreciate but it ended up putting a knot in my back each morning. I had never had a problem with the beds at this hotel before. The color wash wall was cool but some of ours were burned out so we did not have a full spctrum of color. The lobby and some of the public areas of the hotel were a bit ropey: dirty carpets and broken tiles in the lobby. As I have experienced at other Morgans hotels the staff can be alternately helpful or surly. We used the concierge once he acted like we were putting him out to inquire about the weather forecast. The lack of a bathtub is a big issue, especially after a long flight from the west coast of the US. If you love design this hotel is creative and interesting but it needs to be freshened.", "title": "Showing its age", "user": "cjboffoli", "date": "December 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6321006, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, design", "disliked": "\u2014 cost, lack of bathtub"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Outstanding location is probably it's best asset.
