Arriving from deep winter back in switzerland it was like hitting the summer (even though everybody told us it's still to cold here and we should have come in summer). I did not expect a high-class hotel at this location at this price but was quite excited when I saw the location and the rooms. The lobby doesn't look too promising and the desk guy was not relly full of joy having us but still very helpful and friendly. It looked like the hotel was just renovated. Everything looked quite new and clean. Nice flat-screen tv on the wall. No working table though. Badroom nice and clean with everything you need. They don't server breakfast but due to it's location directly at the beach, there are enough possiblities nearby. The restaurant just next by was our favourite. Starting the morning with fresh fruits and juces with having a few on the free speach zone is really an expericence. The price is okay due to its location. I would stay again in this hotel.
