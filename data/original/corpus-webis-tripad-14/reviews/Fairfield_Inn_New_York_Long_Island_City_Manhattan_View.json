The breakfast is typical of any Fairfield Inn: hard boiled eggs, yoghurt, soy milk, cow's milk, cereal, even Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, and fruit, toast, juices, egg and ham croissant, etc. Again, this was different than a lot of Fairfield Inns, there was staff visibly cleaning, replenishing food and coffee every minute or two.
