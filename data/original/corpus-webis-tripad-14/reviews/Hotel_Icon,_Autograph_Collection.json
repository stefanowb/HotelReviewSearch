What a disappointment. If they offer you an upgraded room, be sure to ask if it is an handicapped room. I was checked into one and all the charm was lost. An outdated TV with the faceplate broken off, no claw footed tub, it was a handicapped tub and show with a fold down bench seat that I bumped into while showering. I was hoping for the charm of a boutique hotel. Far from it. The decor in my room (handicapped) was terrible. I will say that it isn't the same as in the photos online. It may just be this type of room. I wouldn't stay here again and will go back to the Galleria area where I typically stay in Houston.
