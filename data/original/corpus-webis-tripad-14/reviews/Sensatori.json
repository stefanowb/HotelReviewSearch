This was easily the best hotel I've stayed at, a choice of a number of different restaurants including a massive buffet style one which was our favourite. We rented the four poster sunbeds everyday which was perfect for a bit of privacy as there are curtains round the side and staff would bring us free fruit and water everyday. The pool is stunning as the hotel is as a whole. As well as the different restaurants there are also a couple of shops in the hotel that sell jewellery etc. I shared a room with my sister which we both loved and there was even a phone in the toilet!

The d\u00e9cor was exactly as described and photographed in the Thomson brochure. I suppose on reflection we could have done with a separate sleeping space for our toddler and I think you can book a suite which has this. The big let down for us was the very small balcony which overlooked a banana plantation and a building site. There were also a few cob webs hanging from the balcony as well. Our room was also at the opposite side of the hotel from the kids splash pool and it was quite a walk to get to especially if you had left something in the room. It is a big resort though so we didn't mind this too much. We had thought about paying the extra for a Garden room before we arrived and I am so glad we didn't - the Garden rooms below us were all totally overlooked with no privacy at all. We noticed that some of the rooms have Sensatori symbols on the door and the rest don't - maybe a coincidence but every room which had the same awful outlook as us was a Sensatori room.
