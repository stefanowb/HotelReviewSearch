The Hotel is outside of the nice victorian centre and the surrounding area looks a bit run down but its just a short walk to the nicer part of the town. I explained at check in that I was concerned that the trip advisor reviews were very mixed and so was allocated room 317 which was an executive room. The room was just OK with a comfortable bed but the bathroom was'nt that clean (long black hairs in the bath) and had an overall grubby feel to it. The room was at the back of the hotel so was nice and quiet. Breakfast is buffet style which isnt to my taste as food always looks very sorry for itself sat under heat lamps but the staff greeted me with a very warm welcome and offered me poached eggs instead of the sad looking dried up fried ones on the buffet. We had dinner in the hotel on Valentines night and the meal was very good, I had the Lamb Rump which was perfectly cooked. My colleagues had some special dietary requirements which were met gladly. However, it took a very long time to arrive and so the pace of service spoilt it for me and the food wasnt that hot. It wasnt busy at all. Eventually we had finished the set menu which was good overall. They gave us some complimentary cupcakes which was a nice touch but it was so late by then that we didnt want them. A previous guest had filled up the sparkling water in the mini bar with tap water, I called reception and got a very speedy replacement with profuse apologies and some complimentary orange juice. This could be a really good hotel if it was brought up to date with some investment by Holiday Inn, the staff offer a very warm and genuine Lancashire welcome which is worth a lot nowadays.
