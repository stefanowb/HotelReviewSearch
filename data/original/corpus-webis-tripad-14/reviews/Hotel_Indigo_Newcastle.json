I have travelled there for work several times, and I have stayed in hotels and B&B's which have ranged from very bad to average to 'OK good'. Indigo is a very good boutique hotel, that wins hands down when compared to some of the other big chain holels I have used in this city. The hotel is located centrally, near the train station, restaurants, and other amenities. The price is reasonable for the quality of accommodation (I paid \u00a399 per night). The hotel also features a Marco Pierre White restaurant which I didn't try - but the atmosphere was warm, lively and sophisticated when I arrived to check in at 11:30pm on a rainy night. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful (and alarmed, as I slipped on my way to the reception! luckily more a comedy moment than an accident) The room is of a good size, modern and stylish. The bed was extremely comfortable (I could do with a bed like that at home, in fact). It was well made with crisp clean sheets, and very welcoming. There was a stylish black and green armchair and a stool, which were a little cramped (the bed is massive and quite high). The room was also fully kitted with good lighting, a flat screen TV, an ipod/iphone deck, and connections so you can plug in your camera etc. The bathroom is also great, with good quality towels and Aveda toiletries. Unfortunately one of the glasses I had was dirty, so that put me off a bit. That was the only slip though...
