We weren't disappointed with the first one and we certainly weren't with this one: a warm, efficient greeting at the front desk followed by the joy of opening our door onto a lovely, large, well-furnished suite. Exceptionally clean, well equipped and comfortable, it's the kind of place a traveler is happy to \"come home to\". We were really impressed when, after we'd been in our room about 15 minutes, our in-room phone rang and it was the front desk calling to make sure everything was as we wished. How often does that happen? It simply made our day. The Welcome Bag of goodies in our room was a nice touch . And of course, the fresh-baked cookies at the front desk are always tempting.
