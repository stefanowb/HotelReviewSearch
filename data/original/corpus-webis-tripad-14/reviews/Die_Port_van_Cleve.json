Usually I will only book a 4 or 5 star, but was with a budget conscious friend so we did this 3 star. The rooms in the pictures didn't resemble the room we were given and I was very disappointed. It was super small, the bathroom was tiny and old with cracked tile floor. I will not stay here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless it was super cheap and they didn't have as high of standards.", "title": "small drywall room", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "travelotta", "date": "March 25, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3300961}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Location, Good Food", "text": "We got a special rate via Internet, otherwise I'd say the room was a little small for the price.

Desk staff were all extremely helpful, restaurant food excellent (the traditional pea soup deserves a special mention) and staff good. The staff serving breakfast were all very young and would probably benefit from a little more training, but we were certainly not ignored, unlike one other client's comment I've seen on this web site.

Perhaps not 4 star (as the debate rages) but how many 4 star hotels are available in the centre of an amazing city for $150 USD per night. The rooms were small but if you're going to hang out in your room then go to Gent! The breakfast buffett looked amazing but was too steep for me. There is coffee in the room and a fantastic bakery around the corner. Add in the 10 minute walk from the railway station and all in all a very good weekend.'", "title": "Fantastic Location, Above Average Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "markas101", "date": "June 13, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3547949}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "fine as long as you know what to expect", "text": "No, it's not a 4-star hotel.

Due its central location, you will find many touristic and cultural sites within walking distance. Hotel Die Port van Cleve has a rich history. Heineken opened its first brewery in this building in 1864. Brasserie \u2018De Poort\u2019 is famous for its numbered steaks and Bar-Bodega \u2018De Blauwe Parade\u2019 has an unique Delft blue tile fresco dating from 1887. At the beginning of 2012, rooms were soft refurbished and all rooms were redecorated with references to the authentic tile fresco in the bar."}
