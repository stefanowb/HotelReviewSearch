We only got to stay at the Blue Dolphin Inn for one night but we just loved it. We stayed in a second-story corner room facing the ocean. The room has a name, not a number and I can't remember how to spell it but it was awesome! When you first see the Inn, it looks like someone's well-maintained little home but it's very big inside and very elegant. The picnic breakfast was very good and we enjoyed eating it on the beach while watching the seals. Don't want to repeat everyone else's comments - all the good is true. We had the bagels 'n lox and egg breakfasts, which were both very good. There's a stand beneath a tree in the back with things to wash your car windows but you can also use the cloths to wash the sand off your feet. Beach towels are in a basket in the reception area. We bought a robe - it's so awesome!

Most of them are pretty nice, we've stayed in a few. But this one stood out! It's a much smaller hotel, but absolutely guest-focused. All the staff is really nice, most of them will address you by name, you get homemade cookies in your room every day! A boxed breakfast of your choice is included in your stay each day, your room has a Kuerig machine with all kinds of coffee/tea blends, the lobby has hot cocoa, coffee, tea and lemon water each morning and evening, free Wi-Fi, free unlimited movie rentals from their huge collection- I could go on and on. We stayed in room 100 which literally backs up to the lobby (it's right behind the front desk). I was a little apprehensive about potential noise or privacy with people coming/going, but never had any issues. The hotel is really quiet and nice. I believe it is adults only, so no screaming kids running down your hall in the morning. =) It's a cozy and beautiful hotel. Although the rooms were beautifully decorated, had fireplaces, and the bathrooms were beautiful- most of the hotels we have stayed at on Moonstone I could say the same for.
