This is a low-key, working town with a pleasant harbour and friendly bars and restaurants. It lacks the sophistication of other small towns and cities on the west coast but has great \"small town America\" charm. If you're travelling out of season you can get a decent room at the Ascot Inn for less than $50. Friendly staff and a good location close to the harbour and restaurants. Rooms are a good size, bathrooms are on the small side but clean and tidy. If you plan on staying longer, the Ascot Suites (more expensive, but higher quality) are probably a better choice.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "marshall", "date": "November 27, 2004", "id": 2849198}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Ripoff", "text": "Don't stay at this hotel unless you are prepared for aweful furniture, old beds, room cleaning by request, and noisy rooms.

It was disappointing that one of the lights didn't work on the lightstand next to the bed. However, our major disappointment was in discovering that it was an extremely noisy room - we could hear all of the activity of our neighbors above and on the sides -- too much activity. While I'll admit we probably 'lucked out' as far as our neighbors go, the experience was topped off by the loudest plumbing I can recall experiencing... In short, if you are hard of hearing or simply aren't sensitive to sound -- e.g., you don't mind hearing your neighbors intimate moments or their conversations... or being woken up at 6AM by the deafening sound of the plumbing...then you will probably find the experience reasonable...(unless you're looking for a quality continental breakfast...we were disappointed to discover that not only were the muffins and pastries of apparent store-bought quality but there was no fresh fruit, etc...).
