Be sure to rent a car as you're not within walking distance of anything. The only thing that disappointed us was that we paid extra for an oceanview room, but our room was tucked back in a corner with only a glimpse of the water. We were ok with that, because we didn't spend much time in the room anyway, but if the view is important to you, be sure to ask which way your balcony faces.

The restaurant is 5 star with a price to match. We thought it was worth it though, considering the room was priced very reasonably. The room itself is what makes this hotel a 3 star. There were small bugs on the counter every time I went into the bathroom, and as we were on the bottom floor, we kept waiting for a lizard or other creature to visit us through the gap under the door. The rest of the hotel was more like a 4 or 5 star though, and we weren't in the room much. Very friendly, helpful staff.

We chose a queen sofa bed room which actually ended up only having a queen sofa bed - in other words, no real bed.

Apparently the adjoining room is the bedroom which you can rent in addition (for example, it would be great for a family) we just didn't know this ahead of time.
