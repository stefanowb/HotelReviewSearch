Larger than an average suite. Very clean as you will expect from Hilton family hotels. Underground parking with direct access to the hotel. The hotel is right next to Stuttgart Mercedes-Benz Arena. It's very easy to come by car but I wouldn't necessarily walk late at night. Surrounded by large empty areas. Inside the hotel, the guest needs to navigate to the room thru connecting buildings. Breakfast perfectly fine, fresh waffles. Not superb and somehow limited choices but everything's good and quality. Mercedes-Benz museum is walking distance. Museum is really good, fun, interactive.
