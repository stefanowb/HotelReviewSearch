Many tourist fly or drive in from Aswan and only stay at the Abu Simbel temple site for about two hours. I was very pleased with my overnight stay at the Seti Abu Simbel Lake Resort. The hotel is beautifully landscaped and is along the edge of the lake with breathtaking views. It was a short 15 minute walk on a safe road to the hotel from the temple site. The hotel is near three banks and a little market. The rooms are pleasantly decorated, spacious, comfortable and very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious with great shower/bath. Great water pressure with plenty of hot water. There were many Japanese tourist at the time of my hotel stay. Therefore, the Sound and Light show was done in Japanese. The hotel dinner buffet was excellent and had a variety of meats, vegetables, soups, bread and desserts. The dinner buffet and breakfast was included in the price of my hotel room. The staff were all very professional and polite.

Our daughter is a vegetarian, which they found very hard to understand.
