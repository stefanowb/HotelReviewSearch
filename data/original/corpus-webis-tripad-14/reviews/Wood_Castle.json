They have a restaurant which offers a reasonable selection of Indian dishes but the dining room has only two tables so you can't always eat when you might want to. They have a single computer with internet access available for guests to use which is connected to a printer if you need it. If you decide to stay there I strongly suggest that you accept the hotel offer of a car to collect you, since it is not easy to find even for residents of New Delhi.
