The reviews were not favorable so we decided maybe we would stay just one night to check it out,play golf, and then head over to the Hyatt Tamaya for a few more days. We were pleasantly surprised at how friendly the staff was.We had an early t-time so no time to check in and they were very accomodating with our luggage. Although a challenge, the course was VERY well maintained and absolutely beautiful!Not to mention very inexpensive.
