Stayed for saturday night on the , and got a good rate incl. dinner and breakfast considering it is a 5star hotel. Checked in without hassle and got our bags brought to our room, not a given in the hotels i have stayed in recently. Rooms were oversized for two ppl with plenty of space, but they could do with a bit of maintenance as our carpet was torn against the wall . found out hotel is 5 yrs old so maybe its just wera and tear. went down to the bar for a bite to eat and to meet our friends who had already been shown to a table. settled in with a couple of pints and glasses of wine for the ladies beside an open fire in the conservatory part of the bar. great views of the course we were playing the next day, and even got a couple of hints from the waiter how to play the hole, didnt stop me finding water the next day though!!!! wife and her friend ordered the club sandwich, not realising the full ingredients, she cant stand egg mayo, but the manager had no hesitation in getting a fresh one which came on two seperate plates, full with chips as they were sharing, nice touch. I probably could have done with sharing my burger too which was very filling leaving little room for dinner which was booked for 3 hrs later!!! arrived back to the room for a shower, but could not find bathrobes in the room. called reception and they delivered two within 10 mins. dont see why they are not in every room?? arrived down to the hotel restaurant, which had quite a few kids in it, but was brought to another part of the restaurant which was quiet at first, but then filled up very quickly with other diners. familys seemed to be seperated which we were all happy with, as we had left our kids at home for a reason!! meal was delicious, i shared a large steak with my other half which was carved at our table. service was second to none, special mention to maeve our server who still had time for a chat. Retired to the bar again afterwards, and it was very lively with a good atmosphere. Guiness was great which is a change for hotel bars, and again we were looked after by the staff circulating the room. Just as we were heading to bed, the wedding party filtered in from their reception, i presume the atmosphere didnt die down for quite a while! beds are so comfortable, we nearly missed breakfats next morning. extremely busy with wedding party from night before, and were asked to sit in the bar for a few mins. worth the wait, full buffett and fruits was just the ticket. overall, we had a great stay and will definitley be back. not too sure if there is much to do in the area, but would check it out if you are staying for more than a couple of days!!!", "user": "barneyrubCarlow", "date": "October 13, 2008", "id": 20848894}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "absolute heaven", "text": "this hotel is well worth a visit.
