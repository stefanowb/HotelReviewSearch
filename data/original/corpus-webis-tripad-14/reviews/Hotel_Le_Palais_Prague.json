As the other reports claim, it is an unbelievable hotel in every way. We arrived at the hotel without luggage as the airlines failed to onload it at JFK. Reception asked for our luggage tracking information and told us they would follow up and deliver the bags as soon as they arrived. When we arrived at our suite, amenity kits had already been delivered and placed in the bathroom. Because we are members of the Leaders Club, we were upgraded to the Bellevue Suite with a spacious living area and well appointed bedroom/bath. A complimentary bottle of red wine, house made chocolates and a handwritten note from the general manager awaited our arrival. Plus the hotel sent a bottle of sparkling wine in honor of my birthday. And, yes, the mini bar including fruit juice, regular and diet coke, red and white wine, mineral water and chocolate is indeed free and restocked every day. Our suite was located on the first floor (2nd fl US) in the left wing with a panoramic view of the hotel's gazebo and landscape beyond. One thing I might mention is although the left wing has a better view, it also overlooks the railroad tracks and may be noisy if windows are open. Le Papillon, the hotel's restaurant served a delicious breakfast with selections for most every taste. The lunch and dinner menu are brief, but the food is well prepared and presented. And the servers are professional but not stiff and aloof. As the hotel is located a bit off the beaten track in a lovely residential setting, we reserved the complimentary hotel car service to and from Wenceslas Square, saving us from tiring/getting lost.

From the minute we arrived to the minute we left the hotel to go home the staff were simply amazing! The hotel is located about a 20 minute walk from Wenceslas square and taxis cost between 200 krona and 100 krona which is about \u00a33.30 - \u00a36.60 which we thought was reasonable. When we arrived our cases were immediately taken inside to be taken to our room. We had a tour of the hotel and then were taken to the room by the lady who checked us in. We were asked if the room was satisfactory! It was a lovely room. The pillows were the softest I had experienced - I have a bad neck and take pillows very seriously!!! The bathroom had underfloor heating, a deep bath and L'Occitane toiletries. Other little things made the room special such as the free mini bar stocked daily, clean towels in the evening if needed, turn down service, beautiful white towels (not the usual grey when they've been washed hundreds of times), shoe cleaning service. Overall the hotel was stylish, spotlessly clean and well maintained - i even saw one lady cleaning the brass with a toothbrush!! Whilst there my husband was ill with a fever and they could not have been more caring and helpful. Thank you Milan for bringing extra water to our room (at no charge) and taking the time to ask him how he was later and the next day. Breakfast was buffet style with cooked items to order. The service was excellent and the staff made the effort to remember where you sat the day before, offer a paper and even remembered that I liked eggs benedict and english breakfast tea with cold milk! Thank you especially to Zuzana and Lukas. There were a number of staff identified as trainees and I would say they are learning the very best of customer service skills. Hotel prices for drinks and food were pretty much the norm for a 5 star hotel. Local drinks were cheaper than those imported. The hotel also has a free shuttle to Wenceslas square each day at 10 am - which needs to be booked by 9am - our \"shuttle\" turned out to be a mercedes C class. On the day we left our flight was late evening, our bags were stored securely and the receptionist organised our taxi at exactly the time we asked,from the firm we requested (we used an airport taxi which gave a 47% discount for the return journey). Overall we had a wonderful stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone we know!
