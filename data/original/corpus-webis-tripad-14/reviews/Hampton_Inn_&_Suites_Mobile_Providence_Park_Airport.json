I like the added touch of \"Cookies and Coffee\" at 6pm. The room was very comfy and roomy. I always judge how old a hotel is by the number of \"Outlets\" that are in the room. This hotel has plenty, and just in the right spots!! I enjoyed the free breakfast, but I missed my \"Gravy and Biscuits\" that the competitors have.The grounds are beautiful, but dont go for an evening walk around the building...YOU WILL GET WET! For some reason they have their sprinklers set to come on just after sundown. (Most hotels wait til 2 or 3 in the morning) So bring your umbrella and rubbbers, if ya want to take an evening stroll.

The issue is that the GM elected to call me 4 hours before arrival to cancel my reservations, I took exception not so much with the cancellation, but that no advance notice was given. To make matters worse he offered no assistance for alternative accommodations. In fact, he went out of way to stress he was allowed to cancel my reservation at any point, because I made an error in booking the room. To top it off he was arrogant and belligerent in delivering his message. After filing a complaint with the Hilton the issue was somewhat resolved; so I thought. The GM after receiving the complaint by protocol is supposed to remedy the situation. Instead he elected to call me back to harass me more about why he was right. I really couldn\u2019t believe my ears..

Every employess greeted us with a hello or good morning. You recieve complimentary water and the all important complimentary high speed wireless internet. The room itself was large and the bed was very comfortable. There was a flat screen LG television that was program with the channels already labeled. It is very refreshing that there are some properties that do not try to nickel and dime you to death for water and internet unlike the larger more prestigious chains. Great job Hampton.

I like that it's centrally located and that it's a short drive from the airport, but what I like most of all is the feeling that I'm coming home ... because that's how the staff makes me feel whenever I walk thru the door. It's nice to see familiar faces. From the Managers to the front desk crew to housekeeping and even the grounds people --- everyone has a smile and most everyone will try hard to make your stay a pleasant one. The rooms are always clean, they've never smelled musty and that bed is to die for! The breakfasts are pretty good too.
