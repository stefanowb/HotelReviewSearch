Well, the roomy units are still, as they were, very good, but nowadays travelers have generally increased their expectations in this level of lodging and most Holiday Inn Expresses, as well as most Hampton Inns and Fairfield Inns, as examples, seem to include an in-room refrigerator, microwave, and wired, as well as wireless, internet access, but the Holiday Inn Boca West offers only a refrigerator and only wireless internet. The refrigerator is one of the largest small refrigerators we've seen in a motel room, and while it does not include a freezer compartment, it was both quiet and effective. Only one ground floor ice machine serves the four story building, but that does make for less noise and foot traffic on floors 2-4.
