The bathroom looks nice, but did not seem to be designed for practical usage. The towel hooks were right next to the toilet bowl and the towels provided were so huge and the hook was so low that my towel might as well have been cleaning the toilet seat. There were no toilet hooks near the bathtub at all, which means you toss your towel on the sink, or have to drip across the (small) bathroom to get your towel. Also, the bathtub side wall is pretty high, and it is slippery. There isn't any handrails to assist you getting in and out of the bathtub either. The tub doesn't come with shower screen, but a small glass panel to block the spray of water onto the bath room floor. Hence, you can get quite a wet floor if you are a large person. The plumbing also is a little erratic. I recommend letting the water from the shower head flow a little while before you use it as there tends to be a stream of really hot water a couple of seconds after you turn it on.", "title": "My hotel of choice in Rotterdam for business", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Chris D", "date": "January 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 150406716}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013", "text": "The lobby was small but functional.

Good sleep is essential to me and whilst I know this is personal I find the beds exceptionally comfortable. The rooms are pretty quiet too.

The staff are polite and particularly helpful and the clean bright new restaurant is pretty decent if not exceptional. Why do all hotel chefs use too much salt?
