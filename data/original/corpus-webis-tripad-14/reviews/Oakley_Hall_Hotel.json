I have stayed in a number of hotels in Basingstoke and found them largely to be very expensive, quite shabby or with other shortcomings. Oakley Hall is definitely the best I've found, and in a lovely big old manor house with vast grounds. The rooms are lovely, particularly the suites of which some are huge. I love the chocs and biscuits, robe and slippers (may be to do with our corporate rate!) and the food is generally excellent. The route in to Viables is 10mins which is less by far than other hotels considerably closer due to traffic routes. The only downside is that the wireless appears patchy in some of the rooms, and the forces chinook helicopter path is right overhead. Also, no pool or health club type facilities, but I just use David Lloyd anyway. Otherwise very good, and I will be staying again... probably numerous times.", "title": "Not very practical", "user": "archer_in_uk", "date": "April 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 156913476}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We booked this overnighter with friends and were impressed from the minute we walked in the door.We booked the Gourmet champagne break and to be honest for the price we paid we werent expecting much.

Their Courtyard Bedrooms were perfect, very large rooms with a large walk-in shower, full size bath, twin sinks and underfloor heating. We chose their 7 course tasting menu the first night and the a la carte the second - both meals were very enjoyable - not too twee on the plate but very well presented with delicious flavours. Although I would add it was about time they changed their \"Winter Menu\" to Spring! (Perhaps they were reflecting the recent weather!) The Courtyard Bedrooms are a little walk from the main house, where you have dinner and breakfast but the staff were very attentive and we had a golf buggy ride each way! I cannot fault their service, even room service away from the main house was very prompt. Will go again with my other half next time.
