The resort grounds and two pools and beach area are all well looked after - in fact the gardens are really beautiful. The fact that there are two pools works well also. Breakfast was quite good and there were attentive staff on hand. We stayed in one Villa which had an amazingly comfy bed (soft in comparison to most asian beds!) but the bathroom had a suspicious smell coming from the shower recess. The second villa we stayed in was bigger, with a massive bathroom and outdoor shower however a few mozzies were hovering. There are lots of bars & restaurants in the locality. Oh, New Year Gala Dinner was compuslory (expensive at $58 per person). Good resort overall but not luxury.", "title": "A good resort in Mui Ne right on the beach", "user": "CiaraB", "date": "January 12, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 53251861}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled solo", "text": "- Not really friendly receptionists (just okay)...", "title": "Nice but a bit expensive for standard room...", "user": "natti223", "date": "December 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 51782407}], "location": {"country": "Vietnam", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 23, "very good": 39, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 27}, "aka": "Sunny Beach Hotel Phan Thiet", "slim_ranking": 0.410256410256}
