I have a home in Auburn Alabama, which is 1.5 hours and a time zone away from the airport, so this is crucial for me. A 6 minute ride to/from the Airport terminal on the new SkyTrain , the Springhill Suites by Marriott offers a quality night rest at a reasonable price. The train arrives every 2-3 minutes so waiting for hotel shuttle buses is no longer an issue. One note: if coming from the airport remember to get off the train at the intermediate stop at the convention center. The hotel is new (quiet), has spacious well-appointed (contemporary style) rooms, coffee makers, microwave and refrigerator. Best of all is the free Internet and a free hot breakfast. I had a King suite. The room had a semi-separate living / bedroom area. In addition, there were two closed bath areas; one with the toilet and small sink and the other with a large walk-in shower and sink area. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The fitness center was well equipped. The only down side was that the hotel does not have a restaurant or bar and there were none within the immediate area.", "title": "Place to stay before early morning flight", "user": "FirstClass59", "date": "January 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 53964378}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Wow!! If you're staying at Atlanta Airport, you have to check this place out.

Due to all this cold weather, my evening flight was cancelled and I went straight over there and grabbed a room for the night ($139). Free breakfast, free internet, and a great lobby where you can hang out and get a beer + meal. The rooms are huge and look like they could fit a family (pull-out sofa in a living room type area). 42\" Plasma screen, comfortable bed, and great shower - what more do you need? One very cool thing is the sound of SILENCE in the rooms!
