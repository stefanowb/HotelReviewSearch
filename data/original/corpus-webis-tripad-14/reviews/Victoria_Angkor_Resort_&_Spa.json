The character was distinctly French colonial with features such as open hallways, an outdoor pool enclosed by a lush, tropical garden and old fashioned steel caged elevators indoors. The rooms are spacious and effectively air conditioned. The buffet was excellent. The hotel is adjacent to the Royal gardens which insulates it from the bustle of the city and gives more green space to view from the lobby and entrance. We saw a \"flying fox\" there one morning. There are vintage Citroen automobiles out front contributing to the overall atmosphere. The staff is ever cheerful and helpful and were all quite fluent in English. The concierge arranged a very good driver for the 5 of us to see Angkor Wat and the other temples and a wonderful guide ( Mr. Art Ourn ) for the Prek Toal Bird Sanctuary. We felt that all of the restaurants they recommended for dinner in town were superb. One can easily walk to the Angkor National Museum which is right around the corner. However, if you plan to go to the old market in the heat of the day, I would recommend using a tuk tuk. We toured Cambodia, Laos and Thailand and all of us agreed that the experience we had here was a distinctly wonderful way to start the trip and quite uniquely reflective of the French cultural presence of a past time.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 8, 2012", "id": 125826234}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "It had been 12 years since I'd been to Siem Reap and boy, has it changed.
