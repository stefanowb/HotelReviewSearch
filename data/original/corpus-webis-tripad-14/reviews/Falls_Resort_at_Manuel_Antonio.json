The rooms are good size and very clean. The garden in the backyard was like a jungle for me. Due to the Costarican climate, the plants are bigger and the vegetation is just amazing. The pool is smal but it was very quite in May so we were almost alone. The hot tub is rather small but again, in the low season, it was perfect. Service was very good, the desk help us to organize a one day guided tour to the Manual Antonio park which was great. The restaurant of the hotel is ggod and there are few other restaurant at walking distance from the hotel. Walk in the area of the hotel is not very since the main road is narrow and there no sidewalk in certain location. Parking at the hotel is small but there was always a parking spot available. There seems to be another parking aside the hotel which was used by the employees. The road noises could be anoying for some people since our room was with street view.

The rooms (We had a deluxe room) are very nice, spacious and have a lot of storage for longer visits. The items the rooms are lacking are a coffee maker (but they serve coffee starting at 6:30 in the restaurant), a blow dryer (but you can check one out at the front desk and typically keep for the duration), and a phone (who needs one on vacation). The staff were wonderful and very helpful. We loved Luis is the dining room (dinner and late lunches). Also Jockson in the kitchen! Always smiling and saying hello.

I saw capucin monkeys practically jumping onto the breakfast table before the waiter shooed them away. I spotted JC baselisk, agouti, toucan, and birds just sitting around. Luis, the waiter is very friendly and pleasant. The room itself is comfortable with good shower and bed. My main complain about the rooms is that they do not have opening windows. I didn't want to just keep the doors open as there are no screens. The air gets stale inside after a while, with or without the AC. The other problem with the hotel is their jacuzzi. To be environmentally friendly they say they use a combination of sun and waste heat from the office AC. Well, the idea may be noble, but hot tub it is not. I can't even call it warm tub. It gets only about two degrees above ambient temperature. The flat panel TV and cable was the best we had in the three hotels we stayed in CR.

The hotel hooked us up the the best tours and adventures we have ever had. We toured the National Park, Zip lined through and over the jungle with Diego and his crew which were the best group of guys to hang out with. We toured a Mangrove with Alex and everytime he spotted an animal or whatever, he was so passionate as if he just seen them for the first time. We repelled down some extremely beautiful and huge water falls with our guide Byron and his partner, whom were extremely professional and a blast to hang with. Both my wife and I never felt unsafe during any of our adventures. We will be coming back hopefully next year to repeat all of our adventures and add a couple more.
