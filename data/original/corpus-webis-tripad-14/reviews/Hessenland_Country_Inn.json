St. Joseph is located approximately 10 minutes east of Grand Bend, Ontario and 10 minutes west of Bayfield, Ontario. It is German style country Inn located on an increcible beautiful piece of land with horses and barn located to the side and back of the property. The Inn played host to my cousin's large family wedding with a number of us staying at the inn, hosting the wedding at the little gazebo in the back of the property and the reception to the right of the gazebo in a lovely reception facility with outdoor bar and sitting area. It was absolutely perfect for a mid summer wedding ! If you are considering this location for a wedding, you have found the right place!!!", "title": "Lovely Country Inn", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "lovlos", "date": "July 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8262662, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The grounds, pool, layout of hotel", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of channels for late night tv viewing"}}], "location": {"country": "Canada"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 3, "very good": 4, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 9}, "aka": "Hessenland Country Hotel Bayfield", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
