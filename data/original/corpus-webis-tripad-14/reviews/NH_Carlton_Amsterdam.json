Almost everything is in walking distance - Including Red Light , museums , Brewery and Central Station. The Zoo was a bit of a walk but only because I think we got lost.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very polite, friendly and couldn't do enough for you. The room was more than adequate for our needs. It was clean and tidy and as there was a thermostat in the room, the temperature was just right. We were on the 7th floor so noise was not a problem. There was a big choice at breakfast and again the staff were very friendly and quick to take your order for hot drinks and the made to order omelettes, scrambled eggs etc.", "title": "Brilliant Hotel - would recommend to anyone", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Mandy W", "date": "January 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4319517}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "The hotel was in a perfect location to explore all the sights in Amsterdam.

Plenty of tea and coffee, and a sweet with a message by our beds. The bathroom was lovely really big with 2 was basins, shower and a bath. Ther was a hairdryer, but this was in the bathroom so you had to stand I think they could put a stool in there, as usual with foreign hotels there was no plug by a mirror in the lounge so couldnt use own hairdryer, I gave up and stood. After we unpacked we went down stairs and the manager asked us if we liked our room, we thought this was a real personel touch . All the staff were really friendly as were all the dutch. It was freezing cold in Amsterdam so the warm hotel was very welcoming, heating is on in the rooms 24hrs, you can turn it to whatever temperature you want. When we booked out we left our luggage in the hotel, I have never seen this done so proffesionaly your bags were tagged and we were given a duplicate.Anything really valuable was put behind the desk and locked up. We would not stay in a different hotel if we go back to amsterdam.We took the schipol shuttle from the airport they are every half hour from the airport, we had a return cost 35 euros (\u00a324total) for 2 of us right to the jolly.
