Highly recommend.", "text": "Visited San Diego (from NJ) for sister's wedding. Cannot express enough how pleased we were with our stay at Homewood Suites San Diego Airport - Liberty Station. Suite was clean and very large for a family. Complimentary breakfast and dinner buffets were terrific...tasty and very convenient, saving plenty in meal expenses. The hotel staff was friendly and very accommodating. Location was great...near airport, however, plane noise was no issue whatsoever. Had other family members staying next door at the Marriott, but after our glowing commentary about Homewood Suites, they plan to stay here next time. Will definitely be back next time we visit San Diego.

You can go to all parts of the city with very little travel time. We had the 2 bedroom suite. I wished they could have put 2 beds in one of the bedrooms, instead of 1 in both. This makes it a lot easier for 3 women traveling together than a rollway of sleeper sofa.(They aren't very comfortable).

Fortunately, things got better! Our two bedroom room was wonderful. I know I always wonder what the exact layout is of these rooms. The entrance was to a living room/kitchen. One bedroom was on each side of the living room, and each bedroom had a bathroom. The sinks were outside the bathroom with the toilet and bathtub inside. One bedroom had a king bed and the other had a queen. Both had flat screen tvs, and so did the living room. Each bedroom also had a door that closed, so the living room/kitchen in the center was completely private when used as a bedroom with the pullout couch. This essentially gave us three bedrooms. The kitchen had a dishwasher, stovetop, microwave, coffee maker, and fullsize fridge (no oven). It was very well stocked with utensils, etc", "user": "oldrxstudent", "date": "October 25, 2011", "id": 119694249}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "beautiful neighborhood, convenient location", "text": "The breakfast had a good selection, and we really enjoyed getting this start to the day of sight seeing.

Best wifi connection I've ever had at a hotel! Highly recommend this place if travelling with family.

This was our third trip to this property and this time we sprung for one of the \"bay view suites\". Previously we have stayed in the king one bedroom suites, which are actually nicer than the bay view suite we just tried. We had a tiny view of the bay from our bedroom window. View was not worth the many extra dollars paid. Otherwise this is a beautiful property, well maintained, with great walking paths in the immediate area, stores and restaurants within walking distance, and convenient to many sightseeing places in San Diego.

It is in a complex with many restaurants and bars within walking distance and the drive to downtown and the gaslamp district is quick and pleasant (along the harbour). Comfortable beds (including the fold out sofa in the lounge room), good heating/cooling system, a desk as well as a table which I liked. Free breakfast was great, the pool was heated, the internet was fast and free and there was ample free parking. This is sort of like staying in a serviced apartment, the staff pretty much just leave you be unless you need something which is really nice.
