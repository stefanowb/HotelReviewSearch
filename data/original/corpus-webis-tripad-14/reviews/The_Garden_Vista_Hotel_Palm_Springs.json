The grounds are beatiful, it is close to the downtown area, they provide continental breakfast, they have a fitness room with sauna and steam room, they have a quiet adult pool and a \"loud\" pool for kids, the rooms are clean and big....What else could you ask for??? Since it is spring break the rate was $150 which is still reasonable. The pool even provides large towels for lounging. I don't have any complaints. I love the tiled floors in the room and the decor is nice. We got the room with the \"pool patio\". Some of the patios have grass out front, unfortunately our patio has rocks in front of it and we really do not have a view of the pool. Personally, that does not matter to me, and I like being on the ground level with a few chairs to sit on outside. I would reccomend the ground floor, but ask for a room with grass outside the patio. Also, make sure your patio does not face the kid pool.
