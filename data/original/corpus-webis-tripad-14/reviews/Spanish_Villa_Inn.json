The B&B was full but it was remarkably quiet and well kept. It is tucked about a mile away from the highway. The house is just adorable with large and well kept grounds. The bed in our room was sooo comfortable. All rooms had private bathrooms and private patios which was a nice feature too. The breakfast Tracy made was very nice - Fresh baked muffins, fruit with yogurt, tea, coffee and quiche or oatmeal. Tracy also had hair dryers and irons available if necessary. She offered suggestions of local wineries and things to do in the area. I would definitely stay here again.", "title": "Spanish Villa, a Cute and Quiet B&B", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jbritton78", "date": "September 6, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3845992}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2005", "text": "Our experience was good at this cute cozy place. The rooms were beautiful and clean as well as the grounds. Each room has a patio which was nice. It's tucked away in the wooded hills near St. Helena, so the area was quiet and off the busy roads. A romantic restaurant with great food is the Culinary Institute which is near the Inn.", "title": "Nice place...great B&B value...friendly service", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "klp300", "date": "May 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3503819}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Cute little inn in Napa", "text": "At the Inn, Tracey's homemade Italian style quiche was to die for!
