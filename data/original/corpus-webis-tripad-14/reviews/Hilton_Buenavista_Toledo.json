The building and gardens are very impressive with great views of Toledo in the back ground. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were large with huge beds and marble bathrooms. We only ate once at the hotel on the Sunday evening when the other two restaurants were closed so the menu was restricted to the room service menu, which didn't matter to us but may bother other people. The spa was amazing with a lovely pool outdoors and a beautiful indoor pool with multiple additional features. The only draw back was the spa is 25 Euros a day extra which we didn't know about and we used it both days (when we raised this with the manager he kindly refunded our money). There is a handy shuttle every two hrs to Toledo but the last minibus comes back at 9.15pm (it would be good if there was a later bus but taxis aren't very expensive).

Breakfast and all the food was delicious and well presented. The pool was nice, as were the outdoor terrace ares. The only disadvantage to this hotel, is that there isn't much around so you need to take a taxi each time you leave to go to the old town or anywhere else.
