It was opened in the 90s and no doubt then, was state of the art, but now it is tired and the pink floral bathrooms and Greco / French renaissance decoration are definitely of a bygone age. The celebrity endorsements (think Julie Goodyear and Lisa Goddard) also belong to a previous age and this, alongside the constant self-promotion of the owner, are a little grating. The food too, is definitely not 5 star. I can't understand the positive comments about the dining as, I had a red onion and goat's cheese tartin that was clearly in a ready-made pastry, a chicken supreme that was tough as old boots and a tiramisu (that says it all!) that again, was pre-made - and poor quality! Bring on Gordon Ramsay - the chef needs sorting out, as, at the prices they charge, you really expect better.", "title": "Mixed bag!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "easyriders", "date": "May 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7721096, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Food"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Welcome to Parasite!", "text": "However, the staff were delightful: friendly, approachable and well-trained.
