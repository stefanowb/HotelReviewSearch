The breakfast was more than adequate to fire up your day but in keeping with the rest of the city chicory is added to the coffee, which is an acquired taste! The rooms were spacious and clean.

Many travelers don't want to deal with the New Orleans heat and humidity. Downside was the free Continental breakfast (good coffee, but you're better off going down the street for beignets at the Cafe DuMonde.) Also, the maid service could have been a little better if you are the type of person who is a stickler for service. One day they neglected to tidy up our room, provide fresh towels, soap, etc. even though our sign on the door was clearly requesting maid service. We called the front desk and they quickly sent up some fresh towels and washclothes, but even then, they shorted us on washclothes.
