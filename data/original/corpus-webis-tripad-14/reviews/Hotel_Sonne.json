Hotel Sonne is a very unique one of a kind hotel, almost kitschi with an ultra modern touch. Old style castle meets technoland (doors & bathroom) blend for a satisfying stay. Great staff and clean well appointed room, robes, slippers etc and luxurious feather bedding. The underground garage is indeed a trip, and worth the 2 extra euros to park...but beware, drivings skils are needed, very tight stalls. The stand out, as per previous posters, was the breakfast...very very fresh! Three types of eggs, two types of sausages, bacon, quiche, fresh cheeses six styles, fresh fruit, delicious yoghurt, pastries (wow) and one of my favourites, a machine that produces orange juice from , you guessed it, fresh oranges! Staff are very attentive as well...all in all a delightful stay.
