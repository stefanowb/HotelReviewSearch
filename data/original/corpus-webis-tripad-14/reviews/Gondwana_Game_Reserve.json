The quality of the accommodation and food, the professionalism and friendliness of the staff, the beauty of the location and last but not least the marvellous animals all enhanced the fantastic experience. We stayed in a three bedroomed, self catering villa but booked full board which included two game drives and breakfast, lunch, high tea and dinner. The food compared to the best we have eaten anywhere. Not many guests went on the early morning game drives but we had saw some fantastic sights in the morning often when we were the only guests there.

This year we came in February to Cape Town to enjoy sun, wine, sightseeing and a safari. After research we settled on Gondwana which is a long drive from Cape town but we wanted to ensure we saw the best animals in the best environment...something Gondwana promised in its adverts. Firstly make sure you have a sturdy car.. The dirt track road goes on for about 15 miles and is a nightmare...It was a miracle we didn't get puncture... First impressions were actually good once we reached the camp. We were greeted by well mannered young rangers who carried our luggage and made us welcome.. The round Native style thatched huts were lovely and unusual. So after a nice lunch we were introduced to our ranger who was fairly new there. The game drive was a total waste of time.. The ranger was an expert on birds and we stopped and examined and discussed everything that flew but we never saw the animals we were promised...Sure a few Zebra and Gazelles but no Giraffes, Lion, Cheetah. One solitary Elephant and the tiniest part of a submerged hippo was the result of several hours bumping around. I was shocked to hear that on this huge expanse of land they only had a couple of lions and then they \"maybe\" had a cheetah who had come into the reserve by itself. This cost us \u00a3500 for one night and the next morning safari was no better..

In that context it is an excellent destination. The accommodation is very comfortable (Kwena huts) and the staff are friendly and helpful. The food was outstanding when the head chef (JC) was in attendance and was otherwise acceptable but not brilliant. The location is very scenic. The park shows its young age in that it is not yet mature so the biodiversity is not the same as a mature reserve and most of the animals are by definition newly introduced. We saw excellent Lion with cubs and were privileged to see a cheetah run down a small Eland. I was a bit disappointed in the bird life and it will take a long time for the place to feel truly wild but it is certainly one of the best game farms within 4 hours of Cape Town. There is a story online of the female elephant who was relocated from Bloemfontein Zoo to Gondwana and its an interesting conservation story. Two of the elephants were originally circus elephants who were also reintroduced - they could have more easily taken surplus elephants from Kruger but this gives a different angle and is more interesting.", "title": "Very good experience", "user": "CapeTownMac", "date": "June 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 163445376}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We used the conference facilities for meetings and it worked very well.
