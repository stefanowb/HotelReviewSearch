My room was very nice and quiet. I had a coffee pot, a microwave and a mini-frig in my room, which I really liked. It also had free high-speed Wifi connection which worked very, very well. I used the fitness center and found it to have everything I wanted: a treadmill, an elliptical and a reclining bicycle. It was equipped with fresh towels and a water cooler and other small amentities, plus a good sized cable TV. I didn't get a chance to use the pool but I did check it out. I do water exercise so pools are very handy when I travel. The pool is small, you won't be doing laps, in it but if you want to refresh yourself on a hot day or get some water exercise in, it is just fine. The hot breakfast in the morning was GREAT! It was free and it included scrambled eggs, bacon, hot biscuits, sausage gravy, and pancakes. The most hilarious thing that I saw was the \"pancake machine.\" You pressed one button and then two pancakes came out. They were tasty pancakes. Also they had high quality coffee on tap in the lobby 24/7 which I appreciate because I drink coffee non-stop. Another great feature is that it is right by the local Trolley route. The City of San A ntonio funds a trolley route that takes people from hotels to convention centers and the entertainment/restaurant district. I used that instead of a cab and saved a good deal of money. The staff were very helpful and professional. I will definitely stay in this hotel next time I am in San Antonio.
