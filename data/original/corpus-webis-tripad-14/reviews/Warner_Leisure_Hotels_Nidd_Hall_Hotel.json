Ambassador room and bathroom was very clean and comfortable . There was tuition available in salsa dancing, line dancing, archery, and rifle shooting in addition to use of the lovely indoor pool, steam, sauna and jacuzzi. This was our third visit and Nidd Hall has beautiful grounds and is a great location for visiting nearby Harrogate, Ripon and York. We did find that the food choice (being vegetarians) was limited compared to previous visits but still more than adequate.

Breakfasts are excellent, as ther is plenty of choice although the scrambled egg looked more like porridge! Dinners were just \"OK\" , & there could be more thought on the veggie side i.e not so many root vegetables. Fruit juices as starters & omelettes seem to have also been dropped from the menu.
