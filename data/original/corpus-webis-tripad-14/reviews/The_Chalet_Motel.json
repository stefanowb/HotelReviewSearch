You have the very nice and luxurious B and B's mainly located in the village of Manchester on route 7a. Then you have a few smaller motels off route 11 closer to the ski areas. The Chalet would fall into the route 11 group. The motel doesnt pretend to be anything else but what it is. A comfortable cozy motel with caters mostly to skiers or foliage seekers/ hikers on a budget. Having stayed in the pricey B and B's I am well aware of how those places can drain a budget.", "title": "Better then you would expect.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "icem2829", "date": "January 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4389447}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Just ok", "text": "Last year a group of 3 of us went up to Vermont for a two day ski trip. Rather then spend 250/nt and stay in the village we chose to stay at the 80/night chalet with a double beded room. We were very pleased when we entered the room, it was huge! Plenty of space for three friends and even a small kitchen area. Way more then you would expect from motel like this. Obviously this was not a luxurious place, but it doesnt pretend to be either. It gives you alot of space, and clean comfortable conditions for a short stay. One downside of the motel is that it would be quite a hike to walk to Manchester Village, but driving is usually not a problem usless it is peak season. There are several hotels and bars nearby on route 11 that you could walk or easily drive too. I highly recd. this motel to anyone on a budget looking to spend a night or two in the Manchester ,vt area.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "caroly6", "date": "September 28, 2005", "id": 3945787}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Largest room I've ever stayed in for a basic 2 bed room rental", "text": "Went for a spur of the moment trip to Vermont on a Saturday.
