Getting around in Vienna was no problem by trams and U-Bahn. My room was on the top floor, with a quirky old fashioned cage lift rising through the centre of the spiral staircase (which only went to the 4th floor), then a long flight of steep stairs to the 5th floor (unfortunately). Room was nice and quiet, with an excellent bathroom and very good bed. Breakfast room was very nice, just off a beautiful piano lounge, and with a reasonable variety of foods, but no hot choices.

The rooms were reasonably large, comfortable and clean. However, as with previous reviews we found that there was little/no service at all. We were dissapointed with breakfast as not only was the food unimaginative but they did not provide enough seats for the number of guests in their hotel - one morning we had to stand outside the breakfast room and wait for 20 minutes to eat because there were no seats available - and we were not the only guests having to wait like this. In terms of location it is ok - a good 20 minute walk from the main attractions though. There is no hotel restaurant though there is a doorway connecting the hotel to the restaurant next door. We ate in there once but wouldn't do so again - the food was mediocre and the room smoke-filled.
