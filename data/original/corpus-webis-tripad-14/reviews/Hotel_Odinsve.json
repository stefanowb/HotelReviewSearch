We had a standard double, but had asked for a quiet room with a view - which we got. Our room wasn't large but had a conservatory like window extension to it which gave us a nice view. The beds were very comfortable, probably the best I have experienced in a hotel!! We stayed across a Friday and a Saturday night and didn't hear any noise. It is literally a 5 min walk to the main shopping street. Rooms aren't large (unless you get a deluxe) but we found it adequate and also had a decent size bathroom (our room also had a bath) - not all the rooms have a bath. Breakfast was a typical continental affair but the hotel was happy to do an early breakfast for day of departure/early trips etc. Reception also extremely helpful with booking trips etc (and if you book with reception for reykjavik excursions you get a discount).

Breakfast was included, which was actually awesome compared to the free hostel breakfasts I've had on the rest of my trip. The room was nice and had a window, which is great, and a door which if I wanted to I could walk out onto the terrace area (though the wind was pretty strong and it didn't have a door handle on the other end so I could've potentially been locked out so I didn't really do it). It looks pretty extravagant on their website but it was nice and humble and down to earth when you get there, smaller than their site makes it seem for some reason. Free Wifi, which is great, but it didn't really work for me in the room, I had to go down to the lobby (but I was using my iPhone which has weaker wireless abilities than a laptop so you may have different luck with a computer). They also had a computer for public use, which was nice, but it was old and very laggy and didn't work for me when I was there. Everyone speaks English, which is amazing. If you want to go somewhere they'll book everything for you.. really great service actually! I was impressed, I thought I'd have to figure everything out on my own but they were able to book me the Blue Lagoon, and a bus to the airport, as well as tell me what good sites to see in Reykjavik. They gave me an awesome impression of Iceland and because of them my stay was fabulous and I definitely want to go back. They are very nice and hard working.

The lovely girl on the desk had never heard mention of a ghost (as mentioned in the lonely planet guide) and she photocopied the guide to show to other staff as she couldn't quite believe it!! As for the room being small, well I thought it quite spacious compared to others I have stayed in in other European countries. The beds were incrediably comfortable and everything was exceptionally clean. Some things eg handbasin etc may be getting a bit old but this is really a traditional hotel it is NOT your Hotel 101 ultra modern.Our room had a shared terrace with another room on the same floor but these were the only 2 rooms that did. It was not a problem, it was quite nice to have the doors open in the evening as it was quite warm, but if you didn't like it there were always curtains to draw. Our teenage children shared a smaller L-shaped twin with beds down each end which suited them being away from each other.
