Seems like many groups also stay here, but it is quiet in the rooms. There is lounge/bar, some recreational games available, nice breakfast room, and an area where one can fix food, and/or wash clothes. It is less than a 15 minute walk from the nearest Metro Station, line 1 or 6. Check-in is pretty fast considering they seem to be busy all the time, but there seems to be 3 or 4 persons working, at least during the day time. Key cards for the elevator and the door of your room. I had a room for 1/2 persons, nice shower area, toilet, plus bath room sink, hair dryer. Flat screen TV and free Wi Fi. Beds are comfortable, no air conditioning however for the summer months, but the window does open. I found the heat in the room to be slightly less than it should be considering it is the middle of winter, I did find it a bit cool. The rooms are large and very comfortable. Breakfast is served buffet style, and has a large variety of items to choose from, the breakfast is not included in the room rate. The staff is very friendly and helpful, they do their best to answer the numerous questions they receive from guests which seems to be on going. Stay here once, and if you return to Brussels, I know you will stay here again.", "title": "What a winner", "user": "yvr1", "date": "December 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 188148788}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very Pleasant Stay!", "text": "We stayed in a triple room for two adults and one 4-year-old kid.

The location might not be great. However, the money you saved could let you eat a few great meals. If you work out regularly, traveling from this hotel to the Grand Place by walking actually can make up the amount of daily working out you have missed due to your Brussels trip. If you do not work out, then this is a great time to make yourself healthier by taking a 20-minute walk over to those famous tourist spots.", "title": "Really good", "user": "teens804", "date": "December 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 187658202}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I normally do not like the American continental breakfast and prefer the hot breakfast. The European continental breakfast at this hotel did make me impressed (not my first trip to Europe but third). All of us really enjoyed it. Seriously, I paid 6.8 Euros for coffee and a piece of pie at Paul, but here I got the all-you-can-eat buffet.
