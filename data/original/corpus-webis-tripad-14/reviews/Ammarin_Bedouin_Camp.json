We came with our own car which we could park safely within the camp grounds. I can't say it was that easy to find but if you go to visitor's centre of Petra and turn right after the movenpick hotel and continue driving towards little petra you should see a sign at some point. I had expected a very large camp but is was a bit smaller than expected and even though there were quite some people staying there it did not feel crowded. There were 3 French groups when we were there; the first night there were 25 French camper vans parked on the grounds (but the grounds are big enough so it was not a big issue)! Showers and toilets are clean. They provide clean sheets and towels. The food was good and more than plentiful (we did not opt for the Zarb as the cost seemed a bit excessive). The \"entertainment\" was 1 song on one of the two nights. The service was good and everybody was friendly but it is a larger camp so don't expect to have an intimate local experience.", "title": "Recommended over staying in Petra", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "sebbie33", "date": "November 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 49252491}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I had booked the Petra back trail in advance through the camp which was a tough and nice hike to the monastry (although somewhat usafe, at some points you walk on a small ridge with no protection from a big fall downwards). The walk is not worth the money in my opinion (70 jd for a 2.5hr walk with a guide who barely spoke english). I complained about this and the complaint was dealt with in a professional manner.

I don't know any other camp in the area (although we did see one other camp not too far away). The price is relatively high for what you get but compared to staying at a hotel in Petra itself I think it is a much nicer experience. If you do not have much time and are thinking about staying in Petra for 3 nights and only 1 in Wadi Rum I would advise to stay 2 nights in both. We also camped in Wadi Rum (in Obeid's camp) which was an even better experience as it is more small scale and therefore more cosy.", "title": "the real bedouin experience", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "cde_9", "date": "May 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 30636647}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "After reading the glowing reviews from other travelers, I was sure this would be an experience of a lifetime. I was somewhat disappointed by the experience, so much so that Once I returned, I went back and reread the other reviews to make sure I wasn't anticipating more than could be delivered. I'm not sure if something has changed at the camp but it is definitely one grade below where it's been in the past. For starters, no one at the camp spoke more than a few sentences of English so we learned absolutely nothing about the Bedouins which was one thing I was really looking forward to. Strike 1. Because my husband and I were the only ones there on the first night, it made for an incredibly quiet night around the fire. We anticipated conversation around the fire with the abundant cookies and tea (no cookies, only tea) that other travelers mentioned. Then to our dismay, we learned that the camp doesn't provide towels, although other reviews specifically mentioned they did. We asked if there were towels and after struggling to describe what a towel is, they said sorry, no towels. Strike 2. The shower facilities were fine. Plenty of hot water and privacy was provided. The sleeping tents were just ok. The sleeping pads provided were pretty worn and both my husband and I felt our hips hit the hard ground below. The pillows were as hard as a rock so neither of us got a good night's sleep either of the 2 nights we stayed. Strike 3. Finally, after we saw the other Bedouin camps around on the drive to Petra, we compared prices and accommodations once we were back at home. It appears that the Ammarin Camp is nearly double the price of the 7 wonders camp which is such a shame. I would have opted to stay there had I done more research prior to booking. It seems that the experience there is better (from what I discerned from the Tripadvisor reviews) for a MUCH better price. The positive aspect I can comment on is the dinner. The standard dinner is very abundant and delicious and features salad, hummus, delicious potato dish, chicken, rice, olives, water and pita. We upgraded to the zaarb dinner on the second night and I thought it was utterly overpriced. My husband really enjoyed it and thought it was worth it for the experience, but I think paying 30 dinars more per person (which would get you a heck of a nice dinner anywhere in Jordan) is robbery. The only difference between the regular dinner and the zaarb is they cook the dinner in the ground and add lamb, baked potatoes and a cooked onion. For comparison, we ate an elegant dinner for 2 at our hotel in Aqaba and got 3 courses and a bottle of wine for 39 dinars. Or you could pay a Bedouin 60 dinars to cook some lamb for you....your choice. Overall, I would recommend staying at a Bedouin camp while in Petra, but 1 night is sufficient, and I wouldn't suggest upgrading to a zaarb diner. I also would recommend shopping around at other camps since this one seems to be lacking as of late and very expensive. Also, keep in mind that you have to pay 5-10dinars to get to and from the camp because it's 10km outside of the Petra gate.", "title": "Not the experience I expected", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "September 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 118366823}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Incredible experience!", "text": "This was lovely, basic but lovely.
