There was a HUGE spread of food - although it was the same every day, there were so many options that you couldn't possibly get bored. There were traditional Icelandic options as well as typical American choices like scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc. Although it is a 20-25 minute walk from downtown, the hotel provides free bus passes, and there are bus stops in front of and behind the hotel. One great thing about the location is that it's (basically) across the street from Laugardalslaug, the city's largest pool which has 7 hot pools, 2 big pools, an indoor pool, and perhaps the most kickass waterslide ever. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk there from the hotel.

We were upgraded to a room on the 8th floor. The extra cost was well worthwhile. As with any hotel, if you don't ask you get what you're given! The room was a good size, with space for hanging clothes, and a clean bathroom. Best of all, we awoke to a great view, without which our holiday could have been disappointing. The only niggle was that the windows could have done with a clean. Probably still suffering from volcanic ash. The Hilton is well located within easy walking distance of a geothermally heated .swimming pool which we used twice, and rather less easy walking distance to Reykjavik centre. But the way to go into town is to ask the hotel reception for a bus pass. The bus stop is opposite the hotel, and the drop-off coming back is right opposite the hotel entrance. Another option, if you fancy a walk, is to head towards the city centre and turn right at the first crossroads. This road takes you towards the bay, and you can follow the bay road all the way to the centre. A visit to the Harpa concert hall is thoroughly recommended. What a truly remarkable building! It cost a lot to build and needed government funding to complete, but it's a huge asset to Reykjavik. Recommended eating places include the Sea Baron by the harbour. Great lobster soup for a reasonable price. Also skewers of fish and vegetables, which are excellent. The only downside is whale on the menu, so if you disagree with whaling and prefer to see live whales, don't eat any! Another recommendation is a visit to the Hallgrimskirkja church. If the weather is fine, take the lift to the top of the tower for great all round views and photos of Reykjavik. If you don't like heights, go anyway because there are windows to look out from. The building as a whole is fantastic, beautifully designed? We went to Reykjavik on an Icelandair package, including the Golden Circle tour, the Blue Lagoon, and whale watching. Note that the visit to the Blue Lagoon does not include the entrance charge, just the bus to get you there! A number of us got caught out and assumed a visit to the Blue Lagoon meant the price of bathing was included. It's worth going to the Blue Lagoon once. If you stay for a couple of extra days in Reykjavik, the city is full of interesting streets and buildings, and the people are very welcoming.
