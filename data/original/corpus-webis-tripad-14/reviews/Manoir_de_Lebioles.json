The food is on a par with the best we have eaten anywhere else in the World. The Chef takes you on a fabulous journey with each sitting, we had one 6 course meal and two 4 course meals all of which were exceptional. I chose the cheese course as my 6th on the 1st night assuming foolishly that I would get some cheese possibly with some biscuits. How wrong can you be, Chef Olivier Tucki puts as much effort into this course as all the others it was incredible. NOWHERE else I have eaten has ever devoted any time to the cheese course.

The rooms are large, comfortable, well-decorated; one odd touch is the glass door fronting the toilet (why glass?) but as the bathroom area as a whole can be closed off, it's no big deal. Lovely views of wooded hills and fields; no real neighbors. What sets Lebioles apart is the restaurant: truly inspired, inventive, delicious food served generously in a comfortable, calm dining room that's usually full but with tables spaced far apart so all you hear is a convivial hum of conversation. Expensive but well-selected wine list with lots of biodynamic choices. The hotel may be a bit understaffed, and that goes for the dining room too - waits are sometimes a bit long and the staff are correct but seem a bit distracted at times. Breakfast - oddly - is not to the same standard; it's pretty good but not especially creative or special. The spa is pretty, but crowded, and the expensive massage I had was more like a light stroking even after I asked for strong (sports) pressure - don't bother with it.", "title": "Come for the food, stay for the room", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MarkoP", "date": "March 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 155600814}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013", "text": "This nineteenth's century manor was restored to offer modern, sophisticated and top comfort amenities.", "title": "nineteenth & modern annuities for a restful time in Belgian Ardennes", "user": "alexdiver", "date": "March 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 153588837}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The spa: modern an non-crowded lighted place, awesome to relax and rest.
