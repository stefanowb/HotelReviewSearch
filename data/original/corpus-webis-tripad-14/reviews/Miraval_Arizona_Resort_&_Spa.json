The food was some of the best I've ever had. The service was great overall. The activities were great, I particularly enjoyed the guided hikes, yoga, meditation, and equine experience. There were many women staying there solo. My spa experience was mixed. Overall the facility was tranquil and immaculate, I got a great hair cut, and I liked the prickly pear sugar scrub very much. On the other hand, the showerheads were moldy, and I had the worst massage of my life. I won't go into details about that massage, but it was bad enough that I complained to the management about it. I strongly agree with the other reviewers that at the time that you book your spa appointments you should request an experienced therapist. I didn't spend much time in my room, but it was lovely. There were many thoughtful touches throughout the resort. There are bowls of fruit everywhere, and a nice lady walked around the pool offering guests two flavors of frozen lemonades from her tray. I found that the all-inclusive / no tipping policies did make it easier to relax. The staff informed me that Miraval is planning to expand to Florida and Costa Rica.
