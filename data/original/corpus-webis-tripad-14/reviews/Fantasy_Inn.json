A couple of years ago I asked to see a room and saw their princess suite, but what I was not encouraged. I finally had an opportunity to stay recently when I was looking to spend a romantic night with my wife and the only other rooms available in the city where too expensive standard rooms, or cheap rooms in small hotels with low ratings. For the room features, I felt the rate at Fantasy Inn was worth it. The lobby was much cleaner and neater that it was the previous time I stayed and I was impressed by the appearance of the wedding chappell off the front desk. I asked to see a room and the front desk agent guided us to see a couple of rooms. I was immediately impressed by the cleanliness of the hallways. Both rooms that we got to see were surprisingly clean. We eventually opted to stay in a Royal suite with the heart shaped bath tub and a fireplace. The room features and the cleanliness were the things that stood out and convinced us to stay here since it is so opposite to what I have read in previous reviews. There is no question that the rooms need to be updated and reading the GM's previous responses explaining about an ongoing renovation, I hope it is true. I think the windows should have sheers so that you can have some daylight without compromising privacy, my room did not. There is a huge CRT TV hanging from the ceiling with a sound system connected. I think you can turn it so you can watch tv from the bed or bath tub, but was afraid to try thinking that the tv would crash down. In these days of flat screen TV's, I hope this is one of the things that are changing along with installing a sound system where you can plug in an ipod/ipad/mp3 player; maybe even a DVD player. The two showers were great, but it would be nice with a bigger shower head like some other hotels have. The carpet has seen better days, though it must be difficult to keep clean with a bath tub in the room. The heater was off when we entered the room so it was quite cold and the room took a long time to warm up once we turned the heater on, though together with the fireplace, it eventually got pretty warm. We also had a very good night's sleep on the firm bed. The towels did not seem very old, but were rather rought. I will likely stay here again in future visits and would recommend this for couples, though not for those travelling with kids.", "title": "Pleasantly surprised", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "travelSanFrancisco", "date": "January 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 149043325}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012", "text": "First I must thank Kathy for giving us the october deal even though our stay was in november. I will continue to stay and send my friends to the fantasy Inn! This stay was just as great as the others. We were excited to see that rennovations have begun in some of the rooms. Our fav room 110 marie antoinette appeared to have fresh paint on the walls and new bed linens and a new coffee maker since we last stayed in march. It was clean and well stocked with paul mitchell ammenities and large white towels, as many as we could ask for. We stayed 3 nights this time and love the large sized rooms that you just can't find elsewhere. This year out of curiosity we toured some theme rooms of other motels in the area. And we still remain fantasy inn faithful!! The rooms are huge and we intend to use that giant tub and open shower!!! You can't get that anywhere else. With rooms large enough to hang out comfortably, and all those fantastic mirrors...go for the gusto, get out of your shell, soak in a heart shaped jacuzzi, walk to the beach....

The toilet would not fush well, and would keep runnin until you went in and jiggled the handle. the smoke alarm was dangling from the ceiling, when the people in the room next door turned on thier water (assuming to fill the hot tub) it was so lound, i could no longer hear the fm radio station that i was listening to (am/fm reciever in the room.

The parking lot is about 5 years beyond its life span. The concrete curbs are in bad repair. The sidewalks were replaced with concrete pavers which are cute, but the sand base was not compacted which allowed them to sink. This has d left 1\" tall trip hazards at the curbs. That's a libility for the hotel and a safety hazard for guests. The lights over the bed and tub were not working. I was told that I needed to reset the GFCI breaker at the sink for the tub and there as another swith at the door for the lights at the bed. This tells me the switching was installed by someone who thinks its a good idea to cross the room to the front door in the dark before turning on the lights. The hot water valve for the tub leaked so bad I had to place a towel over the nozzle and drape it to the bottom of the tub to not hear the leak. Did I mention the base of the toilet leaked water as well? There's a fun suprise if your not wearing shoes. A towel around the base of it got us to check out time the next morning. Once on the throne you will see the exhaust fan is starting to fall off the ceiling. This fan is only outdone by the exhaust fan for the tub which either did not work or was drastically undersized. The room fills up with so much steam that everything is wet. The A/C helps a little, but is not the solution to this issue. The wet conditions did however bring out a little thing that most guests would not like which we call MOLD! Mold was on the walls of the tub area and in the toilet near the entry door. Gross by most folks standards. There was so much mositure that the painted wall at the tub were pelling and it has been that way for quite some time. The carpet in the halls is stretched so much it is \"growing\" off the floor. Great if you have skis on, but not attractive to the eye.
