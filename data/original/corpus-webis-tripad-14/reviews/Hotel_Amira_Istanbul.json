The hotel perfect, next to the sea in a good part of the city. Breakfast is served until 11.00. Worth the money, cake, eggs, nice bread, pita, fruit, joghurts and good coffee. Room very clean and smelling fresh. Cleaning ladies very friendly. The city is very organized and touristic a hidden gem. Make cruise at instanbul to see places around. People here have good life, spend time to have coffee and tea and discuss and socialize. Also, the food in the hotel is surprise. Eat at the restaurant. The terrace is a place with nice weather and view to the sea. Wine selection and chess selection in international standards. I think the hotel has to sell some of its products. Cosmetics was at a great standard, my wife agrees with that. We would buy if there is availability. I think that the reviews until now say truth for the hotel. It is position 2 and it deserve it.
