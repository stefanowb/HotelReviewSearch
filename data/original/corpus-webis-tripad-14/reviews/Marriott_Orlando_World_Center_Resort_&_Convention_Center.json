We were here for a Funshine Travle Tradeshow. This place had everything. When I drove up I felt like I was in California. You drive up to and Palm Trees line the driveup and you can either request valet or park closeby. I suggest using the valet. I believe this is the largest Marriott Resort. This resort is truly a hidden Gem. It is actually located across the street from Nickelodeon Holiday Inn Suites. I'm not sure if I'd stay here or there. My kids would love both. This Resort is so huge they had North, South, West, and East towers. I was lost at first, but it was nice. I arrived early and they had a desk to keep your luggage in hand until check in and when our room was ready, they just sent it on up. My room had a balcony which overlooked the pool area, which was amazing. Our kids would go wild for all of this. They had jacuzzi's all over the property, a water slide which was nestled amongst palm trees and a cave like motif. We stayed here for a few days and we ate at one of the many restaurants, buffet style, pasta station was my favorite. The meeting rooms. registration and vendors were located downstairs. There is a grill by the pool and a wide range of food choices throughout the resort. In the wee hours of the morning I would sneak out with hubby and relax in the jacuzzi, it was perfect. I didn't want to leave, I'll definately go back next year. Before we left the Marriott was offering us an excellent deal to return so don't be surprised if your offered one of these deals, be prepared to purchase on the spot. They even have a specfic desk for this purpose. They also had Enterprise Rental Car on the property so you can rent a car onsite. I have never seen that before. Check in and out was a Breeze and Star Bucks onsite was a God Send in the mornings. I definately have to bring my kids with me next time.

The property is certainly well-maintained though--in my experience as a frequent traveler--it lacks the personal service, attention to detail, and unique character of similarly priced hotels elsewhere in the country. Ultimately I found it to be too generic, spartan, and impersonal to justify their typical rate ($200+). In this rate range I routinely receive far more luxurious treatment and room amenities (including full nightly turndown service, 400+ threadcount sheets, flowers, aromatherapy candles, in-room CD players, bathrobe, slippers, upscale toiletries, etc.). If you were to get a rate in the $150 range or less I would say it starts to become a good value. But, given what I paid and based on value for the dollar I can only give it a 3-star or \"neutral/average\" rating. This most certainly is not the best place I've ever stayed though many other reviewers feel this property hit that mark for them.

The outdoor pool and resort facilities were beautiful and judging from the smiles on the revelers faces - alot of fun too. I never made it to the pool area, but I did have to leave the property for several events at area restaurants. A note about transportation options: they don't have a car service on premises, so if you don't have your own vehicle, you'll need a cab to get around as the resort is out of the way and nothing is within walking distance. Ask for a cab, not a car - a CAB. The resort has a relationship with Mears Transportation who are GREAT, but you will pay almost twice as much to go anywhere just because they're a town car service - but they use all kinds of vehicles (cars, vans, shuttles, etc), so it can be hard to distinguish. The valets will flag down a Mears car as they're usually lining the driveway, so you have to be sure to specify that you don't want Mears, you want a taxi.
