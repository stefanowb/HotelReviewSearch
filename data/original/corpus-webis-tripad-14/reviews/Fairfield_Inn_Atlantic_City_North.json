You can enter the lobby thru a front door or a back door. There is very little parking in the front of the hotel so most people end up parking in the back lot. The doors at the back have a un-used security system in place. You are suppose to swipe your room key and then the doors should open and allow you into the hotel. Well, the hotel does not utilize this system. We came back the hotel at 3 am on Saturday night and as we approached the back entrance, the doors opened up for us. No swipe required! We walked right in and didn't see one person....not any employee or security member, etc. I mentioned this at check out and the male employee said.....\"yeah, you don't need to swipe your card. You can walk in\".
