I have a walking handicap (and am \"older\") and although the steepish drive was a bit tricky, it was well worth the effort to stay in this \"grand old hotel\". Our room was a triple: our adult daughter had her own loft above our room with bed, sofa and writing desk-very spacious. Our accomodations included writing desk, wardrobe, nighttables and lamps, TV, air conditioning, and a well done, immaculate bathroom. Outside our french doors a terrace with table and chairs/sun bed and umbrella for our leisure use--all this overlooking the magnificent sea below! Nearby the huge dining room/bar and salon provided quiet corners where we could use the internet, write post cards, or just enjoy a drink and curl up with a book.
