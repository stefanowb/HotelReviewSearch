Upon arrival I was greeted by Mike at the front desk and explained to him that our 1 year old Son had been having a hard time making it through the night without a few crying outbursts lately, and as a courtesy to any guests on either side of us I was hoping to get an end unit (thus only one guest might be bothered), or a room that had no one on either side. I already knew there was a big event planned that Saturday night, so I didn't expect miracles, but Mike very cordially invited us into a complete upgrade to a fireplace king suite that was an end unit with no one next door.....now, how perfect was that! Just brilliant, and kudos to Mike. I asked him what the procedure was to use the pool at Holiday Inn (since Sea Crest's pool/workout area is undergoing serious renovations - re-open again May 15), and he handed me a card that allowed us to show up over there and get towels and use the pool.

Well, we didn't have to wait long to get our answer. We started the day off with the fabulous Sunday buffet in the main dining room. Great omellette and waffle stations served by very friendly cooks. There really is everything you could hope to find in a buffet, although I will say that it is a little steep at $18/person when there is no carving station or champagne - doesn't bother me, but as a reviewer I felt it worth a mention. Our waitress, Sierra, was fantastic, and it is not the first time she has been great for us. We then got out and about to enjoy the sunny but chilly 50 degree day. At 3 pm we decided lunch was in order and called over my Cousins to join us for lunch at Red's - and here is where the fun started. We literally sat in that restaurant/bar from 3 pm to 10 pm (close), just talking and hanging out with the staff and having a great time. The food was great starting with the scallops and going to the sandwiches we had for lunch, they even made chicken fingers that weren't on the menu out of season for our Son - - - dinner was great too!! We started off with the bartender Ryan, who I remembered (and he remembered me as well) from the first time we were at Sea Crest with the new ownership and he had helped me carrying drinks up to the room. Great guy. Then Tom, the new bartender came on, and we got inventive and started making new drink recipes (ok, old ones, but pretty exotic stuff like a Bermuda Rum Swizzle!). Lots of fun. I had a nice chat with Michael the restaurant manager who was a great guy as well, and even our old friend the waitress Laurie stopped by to say hi.

The other disappointment was that there was no restaurant at the hotel but I'm sure once it is all done, it was be great. Our room is a very nice size and very clean. I requested a quiet location and got one. There is no elevator in our building so to go up and down with bags you have to take the stairs so if you don't want that, ask for a first floor location.

The pull out couch looked new, but no bedding was provided, had to call for bedding. Both times service (fireplace & bedding) was quick and friendly. The hotel was under construction, so the indoor pool and hot tub were closed and part of our stay the bathrooms were under construction so while we played on the beach we had to go to the other side of the hotel to use the bathroom. We ate at Reds, the items on the menu are bit overpriced. Of season, they were only serving breakfast; an omelet with a handful of home fires that were over cooked and two strips of bacon was 10 dollars. Overall it was a nice place, and I would stay there again, but I would not eat at Reds again because the food was just ok for the prices they were charging. All of the staff was friendly, the beach was somewhat clean and the board walk had broken boards.
