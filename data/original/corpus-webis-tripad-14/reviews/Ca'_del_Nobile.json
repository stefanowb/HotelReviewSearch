Walking distance from anything you can visit in Venice, in a small street where you can enjoy peace and silence. Rooms are big and well decorated, Breakfast is great with home made cakes and delicious croissants. The thing that gives a plus to this place is the owner, Nicola. He can give you suggestions about everything you need in Venice, his kindness will leave you speechless. Definetely the place to stay if you come to Venice.

Ignore bars and restaurants close to St Marks, and walk for a few minutes in any direction to find excellent places to eat and drink that are much better value and free of the tourist hordes. Don't bother with the Venice museum card unless you plan to spend every waking hour doing museums. Go for the Doge's Palace entry which also gets you into thew main museums. Check out the churches, many of which contain works of art by the great masters.", "user": "rajbooth", "date": "May 13, 2011", "id": 108082602}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great place to stay.", "text": "Me and my wife had the pleasure of staying at Ca Del Nobile during easter in Venice.
