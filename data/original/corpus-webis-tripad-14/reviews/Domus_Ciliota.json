The hotel is spotless and the location close to the Accademia Bridge is very convenient for exploring the unique city with its canals. Piazza San Marco is an easy ten minute stroll from the hotel. Our room was a nice size, a bit bigger than most European hotel rooms, and a very nice breakfast was served in their large dining room next to the outdoor, garden courtyard. They offer free WiFi throughout the hotel. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly with tips on restaurants and boats. We dined two evenings at the nearby Taverna San Trovaso and enjoyed delicious dinners at a very reasonable price. We would definitely stay at Domus Ciliota on a future trip and highly recommend it.", "title": "A Great Place in Venice", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "travelingkellys", "date": "November 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 145074864}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled solo", "text": "This is a very nice small hotel on a side street near Campo San Stefano.

Apparently the air conditioning had been turned off for the year, and when you turn it on you get heat. They didn't have a fan , so we had to sleep withe window open, which had no screen, yes , we had flies buzzing during the night. But we didn't get any pigeons in our room, that was my big worry.
