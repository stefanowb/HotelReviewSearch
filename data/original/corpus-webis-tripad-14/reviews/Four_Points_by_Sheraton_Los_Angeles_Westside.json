Lobby looks really nice, especially for a Four Points. While checking in, front desk was extremely courteous and friendly. Got to my room and it was decent. Smaller than I anticipated but typical Four Points room. While getting into bed, the first thing I noticed was how well I can hear the adjacent rooms. While my TV was on with average volume, I can hear the TV next door, which was on a Chris Rock standup show. To top it off, I could also hear the people, on the opposite side, talking to each other. So while I'm trying to watch TV and fall asleep, I could hear my TV, another TV and people speaking to each other. I could tell that the walls were extremely thin and it wasn't just people blasting the TV volume or people talking loud.", "title": "Average Hotel but Beware...

The hotel is off the 405 so you do hear the traffic. I slept with the a/c fan on all night to drown out the freeway noise. Silver lining....I just had to look out the window in the AM for a traffic alert. Night front desk ladies were really nice. The AM front desk guy was a bit rude and short with me. It's also across from a good mall with a Target. Great if you forgot something and needed to go to the store. I would consider staying here again. But was not overly impressed.
