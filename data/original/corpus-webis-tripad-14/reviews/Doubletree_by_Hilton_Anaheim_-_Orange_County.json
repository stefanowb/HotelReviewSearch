I was in one of the unrenovated rooms. It was clean but not spotless. The service was good but not great. There was no in room safe so I had to use the lockbox at the front desk which was a proceedure and not that convenient. Each time I wanted to use it, someone at the front desk would have to help me. Sometimes they made me fill out a slip, sometimes they didn't. They offered free internet on my rate but it was only good for two hours. Bascially coming back into the room from meetings meant I had to log on again. Not a huge deal but if you offer free internet, why not make it continuous. There was also no fridge in the room and one day I returned at 4:30 and housekeeping still hadn't been in to clean. The breakfast is ok and the people in the restuarant are nice enough. This is also the first hotel I have visited with bouncers in the lobby. They aren't there to get the door, they aren't really there to tell you where to go. If you stand too long in the lobby though, they will ask you your business. Rather strange. Good if you have meetings in Anaheim or south. I would not use this hotel as a base for any business in LA as you will spend lots of time in traffic.", "title": "Probably better for vacation than business", "user": "badwaiter", "date": "October 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 143568858}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "My husband and I stayed a couple of nights here for a quick trip to Disneyland. Several of the hotels walking distance to the park were sold out or very expensive, so we decided to give the Doubletree a try. We stayed in an executive level suite on the 16th floor. We did not have much of a view, but you could see the A from the Angel's stadium from the window in the hallway. The rooms are spacious and clean. The bathroom was small considering the size of the room, but it was fine for the both of us. The hotel offers a free shuttle to Disney every hour - it is a large comfortable bus. We took the first bus out to the park and it was completely full. They did have a smaller back up bus so I think everyone was able to get to the park during that trip. Our room came with free breakfast and it was very good. The restaurant opens at 6:30 am and it is a decent buffet - they also give you the option of ordering eggs from the kitchen so that was a nice surprise. The waitress also gave us cups to take our coffee to go. I thought this was a nice touch. For those without the free breakfast, there is a starbucks in the lobby. I had doubts about this hotel because it is a bit far from the park, but now I would not hesitate to book this again.", "title": "Very good option for a Disney Stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cmoody94585", "date": "October 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 143495074}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in 4 different hotels during our recent vacation in Anaheim and this Doubletree still rises above the rest.

We like the free shuttle service that you don't have to share with other hotels and is just a short drive to and from Disneyland. We also like that the beds are very comfortable and the rooms are fairly modern. Although, we did notice that the rooms are starting to show a little wear. The baseboard under the window was starting to pull away from the wall for instance and the carpet is starting to show wear.
