When I checked in, the staff were friendly and were more than willing to answer all my questions about Vancouver tours and local malls. They also recommended a car rental agency for me and called them on my behalf. They arranged for the car rental to come and pick me up too! The room was spacious and I was told that I had a newly remodelled room and it looked new to me. Everything was clean and bright. I also visited their restaurant for dinner and was amazed by the presentation and quality of the steak and it was very reasonable as well. Breakfasts were also very tasty with nice fluffy omelettes.

I needed an express hotel that had the airport shuttle and I should have stayed down the road at one of the other 3 hotels that were about the same price. The elevator smelled like kitty litter. The first room they gave us had a really strong odor of paint. They changed rooms for us and the first thing you see is a bed that is barely above the floor and sagging in the middle of the mattress. THe light fixture was coming off the wall, there were big cracks up the side of the wall and your room's front door felt like it used to be a motel door (outside) that had recent glass put up to make it feel inside.
