I picked this on other TA reviews for proximity to Metro, which was right outside front doors and 2 quick stops to Union Station, as well as having museums and restaurants close. 6 pm check in, no lines, got room on 15 th floor. Strange though, concierge lounge was down on 2 nd floor. Room nice and clean, had requested a mini fridge, it was waiting when I got to room. Two of the glass cups in the room were stained. No real view just office buildings, halls were quiet never heard any of the neighbors. Bar crowded, they have good happy hour even on weekends. Concierge lounge seemed small for hotel of this size, standard fare in evenings but breakfast was good and attendant did good job keeping everything filled. Coffee was great. We received free continental breakfast on Saturday in restaurant since lounge is closed weekends. Most Marriott\u2019s we stayed at let you enjoy the full buffet at no extra cost, but we were limited to the continental buffet which was fine, since its free.", "title": "Close to Everything", "user": "itbetterbeclean", "date": "November 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185324000}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel has security guards all over lobby, neighborhood is safe we walked around after 11pm both nights and never had a problem.
