With just a smile and asking nicely we were upgraded to a King Suite-sitting area was the adjoining room. Like an apartment. We really enjoyed our stay. When traveling we always rent a car and much to our surprise they waived the parking fee we were there for a week.

The Holiday Inn's staff courtesy and professionalism definitely added to my husband's surprise celebration.

The lobby is beautiful and the staff was very friendly and efficient. Our room was in tip top shape and furnished nicely. We were on the 7th floor and had a nice view. The bar has a full menu and a smaller bar menu after 11:00PM. Food was very good and the bartenders were fantastic.

I booked this hotel through Priceline for $65 a night. The location is pretty bad--like the other reviewer said. Nothing but parking lots for Turner Field down the street. I actually walked all the way to the Centennial Park from the hotel and it took 40 minutes (and through some unsavory streets). The shuttle is the saving grace to their bad location. The shuttle driver was courteous and willing to drive to and pick you up from any reasonable location downtown between 7:30 am and 10pm, including where the conference was held. The rooms are pretty standard. There was no mini-fridge in the room. The maid service forgot to make the rooms one night--which was no big deal, since there were plenty of towels left on the rack. Overall: a bad location made up by a free shuttle service. Good price through Priceline. I will probably stay a bit closer to Midtown area next time I'm in Atlanta. The downtown are is pretty dead after dark. Buckhead is a bit far and you definitely need a car to get around there.", "user": "kcw732", "date": "April 23, 2007", "id": 7420121}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Average at best", "text": "The hotel itself is clean, and looks better on the inside than on the outside.

This hotel is not within walking distance of downtown and the cultural, tourist, restaurants, and entertainment sites. In fact take away Turner Field and the surrounding parking lots and this hotel would be in a very depressed neighborhood that clearly is NOT safe come night time.
