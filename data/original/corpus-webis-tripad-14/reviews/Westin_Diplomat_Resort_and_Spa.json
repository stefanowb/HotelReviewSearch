This is what a 650 million dollar building looks like. The ocean views are astonishing. My first room was an end unit with an ocean view - I wish my family had been able to come along. The 2nd time it was a more modest room with a bay view. Still a nice room. The 2 level pool with a glass floor in the upper pool is astounding. I did try to get souvenirs but a walk of the area revealed miles of run-down condos in all directions (nonetheless populated by Mercedes drivers). The 3rd trip, I stayed at the golf course resort and was amazed and felt the most relaxed in a hotel room in over a decade. It was the height of comfort, in the middle of the summer. Of course, by that trip I had given up on local scenery and just stayed in the hotel complex. Food is quite good. Service is gracious. Security is high but for good reason.

Unfortunately, my initial impression was thwarted at reception when the woman couldn't figure out my reservation and offered me an upgraded room just to tell me it wasn't available for my entire stay so I couldn't have it (not a problem but maybe she shouldn't have offered it to begin with). When I finally got room keys and headed up to my room which was happily overlooking the beautiful pools and gorgeous ocean I relaxed about the check in blunder until I found my bathroom to be unclean. There was hair from a previous traveler, something oily on the shower door and two mirrors had splatter of some sort on them. I called to the guest services and they were apologetic and offered to send housekeeping right away which was agreeable to me. I left a note of the things that should be cleaned on the bathroom door and vacated the room. Upon my return the hair and oil had been cleaned but the mirrors remained dirty however I didn't follow up. The longer I stayed, the more issues I found in the room. The refrigerator was broken, there was wallpaper peeling from the bathroom wall and although this isn't the hotel's fault, a family with a crying baby ended up in the room next to me which sadly had an adjoining door to my room so I was privy to the baby's woes. On my last night there the hotel actually had me checking out so I didn't receive housekeeping service or points which were given in lue of service.
