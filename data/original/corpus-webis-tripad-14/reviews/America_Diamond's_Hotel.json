The hotel was really clean and the rooms were tidy and abundant for the two of us. The price was very comparable and there were not secret costs. The internet was free after you asked the front desk to give you the password to log on and it worked without any hassle. The front desk staff was knowledgable and willing to give you directions to where you are going or to guide you to where the Hop On and Off tour bus stop was. This hotel was so centrally located that we were able to walk to most of the locations in about 15-20 minutes or take the metro and it would take you 5-10 minutes. The only thing I could have seen done better is the breakfast arrangement. The breakfasts are not very good, not does it seem like the food was fully cooked but they did not have enough room for everyone so you had to wait for a table and when a table came open, it would take time before the would remove the last individuals plates. That was the only really bad aspect, other than that....the Hotel was amazing!!", "title": "Excellent, Excellent and Excellent", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Alleria83", "date": "June 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 32913689}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "After hours and hours and hours of consulting online and travel guide reviews, we were overwhelmed with information and just decided to go with the Trip Advisor \"Top Value\" recommendation.

Location, value for money and comfort makes it a top choice. Only a 10 minute speedy ride from the airport, this very modern hotel is central (the metro is on its doorstep), very clean and has all the facilities needed for a city break. A very filling breakfast, hot water, comfortable bed and internet connection (though it's not free to use the hotel computers in the foyer), the hotel ticks all the right boxes.
