This \"resort\" is not comparable to my ownership at the Los Cabos Country Club in Cabo San Lucas. The \"resort\" sits on oceanside but you can't get in the water because of the coral and the beach is not appealing either. The pool at the \"resort\" is quite small but plenty of room to catch some sun if you didn't want to lay on the many beaches not too far from there. The room we stayed in (B101) was clean and had all amenities listed on the description. You're on your own here with no restaurant or bar, no frills just a place to bathe, sleep, cook your own food, if you want and wash clothes. My overall experience was okay because I was in Maui and enjoyed the island very much, but when you exchange a week you expect the facilities to be comparable to what you gave up. I will probably do a little more investigating next time I decide to exchange.", "title": "Just Okay", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "txgirl07", "date": "August 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 8471914, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 clean and grounds well maintained", "disliked": "\u2014 wasn't what I was expecting"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The Maui Schooner is our home resort and by exchanging our 2006 week for one in 2007, we were able to get 2 2-Bedroom units at the same time.
