The Monte Real is clean, pleasant, not luxury but with nice touches including a courtyard for breakfast (but waiter service is slow\u2014would have preferred a buffet arrangement).", "helpfulness": 29, "user": "calligcat", "date": "June 26, 2006", "id": 5389001}], "location": {"country": "Peru", "region": "Lima Region", "continent": "South America", "city": "Lima"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 19, "very good": 14, "terrible": 8, "excellent": 1}, "aka": "Monte Real Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.714285714286}
