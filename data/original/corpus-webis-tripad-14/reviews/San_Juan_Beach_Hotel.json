Since I was only staying for one night I went for this relatively inexpensive choice. San Juan Beach Hotel cost a total of $185 for the one night, a savings of $70 over the Carribe Hilton. Of course, the difference between the two properties is light years. The Hilton is a resort, while the San Juan Beach is a former Ramada property that needs a serious update. The lobby and and hallways are a bit dingy, but the room was fairly clean, large, and quiet. I did not see any of the dirty lampshades or bedding that other reviewers have reported on. There was no visible mold, although the air was stale until the air conditioning was turned on. The beach area is only for sunning as the surf is too violent, and the pool is indeed not for children. The Condado area, where the hotel is located, is safe for walking around with good choices of local and chain eateries. Try the Ajili Mojili, right across the street, for lunch. It has excellent Puerto Rican food at reasonable cost and the portions are ample.

I arrived at the San Juan Beach hotel 8/31/07 and was given a lagoon view smoking room. (I had requested a ocean view non-smoking) I contacted the front desk and was immediately swapped into the proper room. The walls and floor was damp, but being fair it seems almost impossible that they wouldn't be because of the fact that they are between the bay and the ocean. The floors were dirty...no excuse for that...there hasn't been a vaccuum in room 703 in quite some time (maybe months) so the sand just sticks to your clean feet. The bathroom wasn't swept the entire time we were there...I know this because I actually circuled (in pencil) the large dirt pieces on the floor to see if the maid would notice (She did not). The windows were filthy! There was no excuse for how dirty the windows were because having an ocean view it would be nice to see the ocean! My husband attempted to raise the window and the glass and frame literally came out of the track and fell into his hands. (Luckily he got it back in track and left it be.) The elevators are slow, but they get the job done. We had free continental breakfast everyday, expect for the day that someone took the key home with them and there was no breakfast. (I didn't ask what key, I was afraid I didn't want to know.) If you aren't expecting anything grand then you'll be fine...but I do prefer clean accomodations. I honestly feel that with a better housekeeping staff this hotel would be okay. Sure the hotel could use a bit of time from the local handy man...but the main problem is the dirt.
