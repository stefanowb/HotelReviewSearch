My family owns a timeshare and we searched getaways and found an unbelievably cheap rate for the Cayena Beach Club in Punta Cana. It turns out that it was, however the staff worked with us. The cheap rate for the hotel is evened out by the flux of the all-inclusive prices for which you have to pay for the entire week even if you're only staying for four days. We paid our rate and put it behind us, determined to make the best out of our vacation on the beautiful island. The hotel stay was very wonderful, be sure to brush up on your espanol, you will need to use some. Most of the travelers at the hotel were from various european country, and I can say were actually surprised to see young African-American ladies. So not only was there a language barrier, we often felt like we were spectacles. But not to worry we took it with a grain of salt, otherwise our trip went unscathed. The beach was BEAUTIFUL. We loved the hotel staff. Newton, was a wonderful bartender and I recommend looking for him personally. The staff was ready and willing, to meet any of our requests. I did read problems people had with finding a chair when they went to the beach, but we really didn't have a problem at all. The restaurant situation was a little confusing at first, but once we found all the restaurants it was great. There are like six of them, there are so many different things to choose from it was great. We really got every penny's worth. We definitely recommend going on one the ATV tour's through the island it was a humbling experience. The pools were great, but who could stay in the pool when there is crystal-clear water so close by. Although there were a lot of couples and families, I would definitely recommend the Cayena Beach Club to any young, fun-seekers who are willing to step out side the box. Punta Cana and the LTI had so many things to offer, you just have to be ready to experience new things. Oh yeah the animation staff were great as well. The time-share staff figured we were in high-school and therefore didn't even bother trying to sell us a time share.

To encounter other cultures? If you want fast food for supper, stay in the US.

There really is only one, where you sit at a table and are waited on. The Italian restaurant, while very good, was mostly a buffet at supper time too. The other a la carte- the Seafood Restaurant was very good.The Bucanaaro at the beach had the tastiest grilled chicken I've had in a long time. We went there for lunch almost every day. My only complaint was that the wine was watered down. Sometimes it was better than others.One thing we really liked was that you could book your a la cartes in the morning each day, so if there was room , you could eat at one every night if you wanted to.Having said this, the buffet was probably one of the best we've had- lots of choice, and many dishes unique to the Dominican, if you wanted to try something different.
