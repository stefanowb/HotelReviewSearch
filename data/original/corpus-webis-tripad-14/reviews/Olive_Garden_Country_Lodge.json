Gina and Fernand produce an excellent olive oil there. The rooms were clean and well appointed. My husband enjoyed the hiking path up the mountain directly from their property. The best part was the food. The breakfast was a gourmet delight with all the trimmings. We ate dinner there both nights. Fernand is a wonderful cook and Gina made sure that we had a delightful time. Since the menu is limited I am sure that if you let them know ahead of time of any dietary restraints they would be more than willing to accommodate you. Very relaxing time.
