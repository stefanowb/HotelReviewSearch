On the down side, my bedroom window opened onto a wall, but it was ok since not spending too much time in the room anyhow. Location is perfect; as a few minutes from Union Square, shops and restaurants; Bart and tram lines. 10 min tram from Pier 39. Breakfast was ok but unoriginal (bread, coffee, muffin) but there's a great dinner around the corner. The concierge was very helpful in organising bus tours and arranging pick up as well as an airport shuttle service ($15), much cheaper than a taxi.
