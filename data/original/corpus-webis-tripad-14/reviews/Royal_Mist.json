Being able to stay with a family who welcomed us into their home and offered such genuine hospitality, was certainly a highlight of our trip. The rooms were very clean, private and the bathrooms were large with plenty of hot water. They recommended what to do in the area and arranged a fabulous hike for us to do which was great. Jeeva gave a cooking demonstration which was really helpful. The food was delicious here, plenty of it and the fruit was also a treat. Breakfasts were also fabulous and the best we had in Kerala. We ate out on the varanda which enables guests to mingle which was very enjoyable. The location of the home is just lovely and is located in a neighbourhood that is beside the tea plantations with a lovely walking trail nearby. It was a lovely place to unwind and relax and watch the world go by. I highly recommend going on the guided walk with Anil. We mainly used the local bus to get into Munnar which was just at the road and this was very easy to do.
