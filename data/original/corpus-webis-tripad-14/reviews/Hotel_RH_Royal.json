The food is excellent and better than the food we have on our usual cruise holiday. We stayed for 6 nights in march and during that time there was veal, rabbit, duck as well as the usual meats available for the evening buffet. Plenty of choice for breakfast and lunch as well. The rooms were clean, the bar area friendly and not expensive and the pool was lovely with plenty of sunbeds and seats. Only 5 minute walk to old town and we paid 1.20 euro on bus to take us to new town on the night for entertainment, walking back to the hotel took 20 mins. We also went on local bus to Altea, took about 45 mins and that only cost 1.20 euro each as well.
