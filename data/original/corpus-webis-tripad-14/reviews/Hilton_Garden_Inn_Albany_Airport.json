We like to stay at different places when we visit our daughter, but decided on a return to this spot. There were many upgrades since the last stay, and it was a very pleasant surpise. The new mattresses are adaptable firmness, the bathrooms were sparkling, the breakfast cooked to order was excellant. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and welcoming.
