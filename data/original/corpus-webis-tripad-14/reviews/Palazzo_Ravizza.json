Could use a bit of touching up in places (the upholstery on the chairs in our room was quite worn), but overall a GREAT place. So pretty from the foyer right up through the rooms. Everything was very clean and neat. Free internet access on three computers, which was convenient to email the kids. Lovely breakfast, gorgeous patio, great location.

Perhaps it is the old stone facade, the enormous wooden doors, or the lonely grand piano on the second floor. Whatever the attraction, it reeks of history and seeming importance. This feeling carries over to the overall stay, because while the accomodations were not the plushest, they felt more plush simply because of the sourroundings (including the noise from the street through the wood shutters). The cold tile floors bracketed 18 feet above by wood beam ceiling feels authentic and this is the feeling you want in a town like Siena and at a place like Palazzo Ravizza. On a more traditional note, the services including breakfast and internet access were perfectly subtle and provided with aplomb. For all of these reasons, the Palazzo Ravizza should definitely be experinced.", "title": "Curiously Interesting", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "one_spod", "date": "October 26, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4052844}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "We stayed in the suite at the Palazzo Ravizza with a double jacuzzi and three rooms.

The restaurant is also wonderful and a little change from the \"typical\" Italian foods although they were there too. Would not hesitate for a moment to return there. It was wonderful.

The buffet breakfast was also well above average and our room was extremely spacious. (We had chosen a Superior Room. I believe standard would be just fine here.) The hotel is in a quiet location yet convenient walk to the center of town and the cute little shops along the way. The double glazed windows provide complete quiet from any traffic below. Don't miss the garden out back. It is lovely with a wonderful view of the Tuscan hills. Reception staff is very helpful and speak perfect English. One word of caution: On check-out, our bill was charged in US dollars, rather than Euros, and the exchange rate was not the best for that day. This was our only encounter with the practice while in Italy, and it is NOT a convenience, as they stated. This made the room cost $7.00 more than the stated price. (We checked the conversion rate later.) Ask ahead of time that your charges be prepared in Euros and you'll pay what they quoted in the first place.
