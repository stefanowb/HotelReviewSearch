And we defintly got what we wanted with the Omni William Penn. I was amazed at the low prices for the hotel (for the quality of the place, they could've asked for double and even triple what we paid). Our room was huge (it was a king room) - only down side to that - the TV was a million miles away from the bed across the room. The bathroom was a tad small, but very nice. Everything was very clean as well. The staff were all very helpful and attentive. We didn't get in to any of the restaurants in the hotel, but did get some room service and it was very yummy. We've stayed in many hotels all around the world and I'd have to say this hotel is up at the top of our list.", "title": "Beautiful Historic Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "KPOmalley", "date": "August 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8457562, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Huge Room, Beautiful Lobby, Friendly Staff, Comfy Bed, Convient to Stadium", "disliked": "\u2014 Small Bathroom, Room so big - TV's far away across the room"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007", "text": "Booked this on priceline and was thrilled to see the name of the hotel after offer was accepted. I took my two boys to see their first major league baseball game at PNC Park last night (Pirates vs. Phillies). The disclaimer on priceline says only that a room for two adults is guaranteed. I called the hotel directly the day before we arrived and was told that we were given a King non-smoking room. I requested two double beds and the agent said she would note it. When we checked in yesterday we were indeed given a room with two doubles and it was HUGE. I know this is an older hotel so I was amazed by the size of the room. Bathroom was all marble and water pressure in the shower was awesome. The desk agent also ordered a milk and cookie turndown for my two boys - how cool is that??? Sure enough, we returned from the game and they each had two cookies and a carton of milk waiting for them - they were thrilled. Overall, the stay was fantastic from location and amenities to staff and decor.
