The hotel when it was new I'm sure was absolutely beautiful but now the rooms have seen much better days. They look run down and dirty. The bathroom had a massive stand up shower which was great for us but not very good if you value a good soak at the end of the day. They initially had booked us in a room right in front of the elevators so we asked them to change which they did, so that was positive. The hotel is right on the corner of a fairly busy intersection so don't expect to sleep in past 7, that's when the traffic gets busy and the horns get loud. We had issues booking things through the hotel....the concierge do NOT handle that job although some of them make you believe that they do. The hotel has a separate ticket office area where one of the ladies was extremely helpful for us from booking events to writing down destinations in Chinese. Very few of the staff speak fluent English but most of them will at leasty say hello. We had problems with the driver of the private car we hired for a day \"recommending\" a place to eat that charged us the foreigner price. We were extremely disappointed in that. We thought that by staying in a higher end hotel we wouldn't run into things like that but it seems that's not the case in Beijing. Always make sure Taxi drivers start their meter and always have the name of your hotel written in their language...even with a map they will say they don't know how to get there. The positive thing about the hotel is that it's within walking distance to the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven and the main Wangfujing shopping district. You can walk to the Yashow market if you're up to it but it's a solid hour walk. I think the main issue I had with this hotel was that it didn't seem to cater to very well to English speaking guests. I would recommend staying at a more global chain like the Hilton, Park Plaza etc. This hotel fell really short of what I was expecting....", "title": "Total Disappointment", "user": "Janesse", "date": "April 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 14921373}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We booked one night at the JinJiang Hotel in Beijing, after searching hotels on Trip Advisor.

We were very very pleased and shocked to find that not only was the JinJiang Hotel, a good value, at 850 RMB/night...it was a downright steal ! Our room was very new and clean with very stylish decor. The lobby is very lush with marble and crystal everywhere. Although a bit Las Vegas for my personal taste, you can't say it looked anything but expensive.
