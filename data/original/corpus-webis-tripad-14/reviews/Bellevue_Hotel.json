We arrived by train and took a taxi to the hotel, not realizing it is literally right across the street from the train station, about a 3 minute walk. We had a room on the 1st floor with a view of other rooms. The hotel has about 6 or 7 floors, all with long, narrow hallways and long and narrow rooms. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the room has AC and the staff was friendly and helpful. The bathroom was a bit strange since the shower had no threshold separating it from the toilet or sink area, which means that the water goes all over the floor. Even with the shower curtain pulled around you, the water seems to still seep out and wet half the bathroom floor. The breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, sausage, bacon, mini pancakes, toast, croissants, yogurt, cereal, deli meats and cheeses and fruit. There is free Wi-Fi internet access in the room. The hotel is within walking distance to some main attractions such as the red-light district and Anne Frank House, shopping and restaurants, but far away from Vondel Park and some other attractions. Another small issue to note is that the light switches are at the head of the bed, so if you\u2019re sitting up watching TV, you can easily hit the light switches on and off. I would also recommend asking for a room away from the elevator. Our room wasn\u2019t near it, but you could easily hear the TV in those rooms while you\u2019re waiting for the elevator and I\u2019m sure they could hear people talking and the doors opening and closing all night. Our room had a connecting door to the neighboring room and we could hear the TV. Overall it was a decent stay, but we\u2019d probably stay at a more centralized hotel if we find ourselves back in Amsterdam.", "title": "Modern room, close to train station", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jenum24", "date": "July 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 17926885, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Located near train station", "disliked": "\u2014 Small room & shower in the bathroom"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Bellevue is well positioned near to the main train station, however at nearly \u00a3100 per night without breakfast, it was not good value at all.
