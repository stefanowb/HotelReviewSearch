Had taken overnight train in, so arrived at hotel around 10 in the morning. Luckily, the extremely friendly desk clerk checked us in. Room had a fantastic river view and of the stadium across river. Hotel seems really new - everything is clean, modern with a Scandinavian feel/decor to it. Beds were very comfortable, flat-screen TV, apartment-like windows, mini-fridge (empty so you can stock yourself), nice closet and drawer space. We did get a good rate here during White Nights. Weather was good, so we usually walked from city centre to hotel (around 20 minutes fast walking). Or, Metro is a 10-minute walk, then 1 stop away from Nevsky station. Bought water, snacks from \"snack stand\" behind desk few times. Convenient. Only drawback is distance from Nevsky Prospekt, but worked OK for us. Definitely would recommend this hotel. We were very happy with our stay.", "title": "Clean, modern hotel - great stay", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "steptravel", "date": "July 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 33834343}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Brand new, clean, great sheets and towels.

White nights- ok, but when we were there grey and raining nights so not worth a huge hike in prices. If you can get a good rate this is worth a go. The location is not great with not much around it- however it is a mere 5- 10 mins taxi ride to the centre from where most main sites are in walking distance. (watch the rip off taxis tho and barter even with the official ones...) so this is not really a problem and there is also a metro stop nearby which is 1 or 2 stops away from the centre and very cheap.", "title": "new and modern hotel with poor service", "user": "hrp123", "date": "June 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 31649485}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009", "text": "My room was spacious and had an iron, coffee machine and a decent bathroom.

And the decor looks very russian as opposed to Marriott conservative but smart interiors I am used to incl at Courtyards (altho the hotels in China were ultra swish and modern so their recent hotels can look cool too).
