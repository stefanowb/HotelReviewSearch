This hotel represents the epitome in understated luxury and service. The setting is truly splendid alongside the river in the Sacred Valley and the property, although large, never seemed crowded. With our Starwood Gold status, we were automatically upgraded to a suite, even though we were using \"cash and points.\" The room was beautifully appointed and our personal butler, Roger, could not have been nicer or more helpful, anticipating our every need and then some and bringing us complimentary gourmet chocolates. The other staff members were equally friendly and helpful. We thought the food in the restaurant was delicious--the \"surubi\" fish was especially memorable. The indoor/outdoor swimming pool was sublime. Roger escorted us (and carried our bags) to the on-site train station for our trip to Machu Picchu. (Unfortunately, the train broke down enroute and we were delayed one hour while awaiting a replacement). We only wished that we were returning to this hotel after visiting Machu Picchu instead of staying at the vastly inferior (and significantly more expensive) Inkaterra hotel there. Inkaterra should take a few lessons on service and the meaning of \"luxury\" from Tambo del Inka.", "title": "Inka-Terrific", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "DCRE", "date": "May 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130105499}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful hotel", "text": "We spent two nights at Tambo del Inka as part of a quick trip to Peru.
