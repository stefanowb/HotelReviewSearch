The location is in the middle of Carthage so perfect for seeing the ruins and/or catching the train to other locales. The hotel is on a quiet residential street, yet with a little market a few doors down and only 2 blocks from cafes and restaurants. The rooms are quite large, with A/C, sizable bathrooom with bathtubs, TVs and mini refrigerators. The furnishings are not fancy, but it is comfortable and clean. Our room overlooked a quiet courtyard. There is a nice restaurant downstairs with a good menu, including local Tunisian wines (and very yummy lemon sorbet!); the outside porch for dining is especially lovely at night when it is all lit up. Locals come here to eat for special occassions. The staff is very friendly and nice. This is a great deal and I would return.", "title": "Great location in Carthage, spacious, nice restaurant and nice staff", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "fun_adventure", "date": "June 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131620472}], "location": {"country": "Tunisia", "continent": "Africa", "city": "Carthage"}, "review_count": 1}
