Huge, grand, and lavish lobby, spotlessly clean and well maintained common areas. The ground floor was clearly designed to impress even the most discerning traveller, and of course sufficiently ostentatious to even impress the many Arab royalties who do frequent this address. The hotel boasts about 6 restaurants, though not all are open all day or for all meals. The two Gordon Ramsey restaurants within the hotel were certainly not as impressive as I hoped for. The Chinese inspired restaurant - Hakkasan was much better and more lively in atmosphere.

Firstly, the facility itself. For a relatively new hotel, I was surprised to see so much wear and tear already quite apparent. In my room for eg (room 206), parts of the walls were discoloured from leakages I believe, and the floor carpet was not well maintained. The room design looked a bit dated. Even though the hotel opened officially in May 2012, you get the feeling that its \"been around\" much longer.

My first, I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Sharq Village (one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had- very attentive staff, everyone used my name, everyone went above and beyond)... I returned a week later and stayed at the St Regis for a wedding at the hotel that I was invited to, and had a very disappointing stay. The doors for the rooms don\u2019t close behind you so one day I returned to my room in the afternoon and my door was not closed- when I called to speak with the Manager, it was as if they didn\u2019t care. The managers response was 'well is anything missing?' with no apology. I later had a hair and manicure appointment at the salon at 6pm. I arrived at 6, and they didn\u2019t see me until 7. I reminded them about 8 times that I also needed a manicure. By the time they finished my hair, they still had not started with my nails. As I was late to the wedding, as they started doing my hair an hour after my appointment was scheduled for, I had to leave for the wedding and never had my manicure. Both evenings there was noise/construction going on outside until 4AM. The day I left, I had ordered room service. I waited an hour and it never came- I then had to check out so that I would not miss my flight. My colleague that was also staying at the hotel with me complained about the construction noise and the doors not closing well. Overall, I was very disappointed. A hotel of this caliber should not have this many problems.
