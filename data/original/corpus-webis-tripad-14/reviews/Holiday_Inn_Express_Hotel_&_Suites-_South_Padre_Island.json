The first night we were here on March 7, 2008 and we heard LOUD screaming, horseplaying , cursing, running, knocking all night long! Our second day we came back to our hotel at around 5pm just to relax before dinner and there was LOUD arguing right outside our door, this went on for right about 15 minutes before WE decided to call downstairs and tell them at the desk, I am surprised they could not hear this fueding! Then when they sent some guy upstairs (3rd floor) to see what was going on I guess and that did no good at all so we decided to leave, we were tired and just wanted away from this atmosphere! We told Maria at the desk about our experience and she just simply said......well its spring break, they are going to be loud. Well I didnt care spring break or not, I paid for my room just like everyone else and I got a room so I could SLEEP and there is no chance for that here.......we werent the only ones either, we talked to other couples that were not \"spring breakers\" and they didnt get sleep either because the people running this place doesnt care about their \"other\" visitors and that is wrong. There should be some kind of rules.... such as no screaming after certain hours, I know its hard to control that many people but if you let them know you wont tolerate OUTRAGIOUS behavior then maybe some of it would stop. I also understand that kids are going to be kids.........I have 3 teenagers and I totally understand but this place was just a party joint just for kids! I will be taking this issue up with the main headquarters because this totally ruined my vacation, we came home today, March 9, 2008 because we were pretty much told this is spring break and thats just how it is and we (holiday inn express) cant make them be quiet. I know that they cant make them be \"quiet\" but they could have stopped some of the horseplaying, screaming and running that was going on ALL NIGHT LONG! but yet they made no effort! I lost money by coming home early but that was no relaxing vacation, I will never go back and definetly wont stay at the HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS chains anymore unless some how they make it up to me! I not only wasted my money on the hotel but our flights down there too and I had to pay $268 extra to change my flight to leave 2 days sooner. This by far was my worst vacation experience and I ve been to alot of places and I usually dont complain and its never been anything like this when I have. With all this said I will say that the room we stayed in was nice and clean and I wish that we could have stayed for the rest of our trip however we were not able to stay up 24/7 so we HAD to leave! They did offer us another room, they said not so many spring breakers were on the 4th floor so we went and checked it out and sure enough there was LOUD spring breakers right next to us and right across from us and while we were up there they were actually running out of their room to the room across from them(which was right next to us) and was throwing things (I think it was clothes or towels) NO THANKS! I would never recommend HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS if they cannot control their visitors! I am sorry to be so negative but I was very upset that MY vacation had to be changed because HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS needs to make some changes and wont!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "kimrevras", "date": "March 10, 2008", "id": 14174473}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed in the hotel with my very old parents (+/- 80 y !) and we had a lovely time.

The hotel and staff were great and well informed. We had a spacious room and bath and comfortable bed. [My only complaint: While the rooms are very quiet, when guests left their rooms the slamming of their doors tended to reverberate throughout the whole hall.] We also enjoyed a mezzanine level for quiet reading, a short walk to beach and short driving distance to the 6 beach access roads. The breakfast staff was very efficient and kept the food available and tables cleared so--no waiting. EVERYONE we encountered in town (except the KFC staff) was friendly and went out of their way to answer questions, give tips on local stuff, guided us to places and activities not on our list, and just seemed to want us to enjoy our visit. If traveling with children, they will enjoy the turtle sanctuary across from the hotel and the Lighthouse and Treasures of the Gulf Museum in Port Isabella.

Everything appeared to be very clean, and I am a stickler about that sort of thing. (I don't care if a place is older but there is no excuse for it not being clean, with the prices you have to pay these days.) We really didn't take advantage of the breakfast. My husband did go get a couple bagels one day and said they had a good variety of food available. The only down side,which was not a huge problem, was the fridge. It didn't seem to be get very cold until our last day. We could not find any way to adjust the temp either. Had we stayed longer, it would have been an issue and would have told management.
