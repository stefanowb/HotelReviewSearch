For example, we were meeting up with my sister-in-law who had arrived at the hotel the day before and were expecting to meet her when we got to the hotel. She had left a handwritten note for us at the front desk, and the front desk failed to give us that message when we checked in. Instead they gave us the message hours after we checked in, explaining that they could not give us the note earlier because they did not have a room number to match the note to. I.e., they could not figure out how to leave a note for us to give us when we checked in. Thus, we sat in the hotel lobby for an hour just waiting for my sister-in-law, not knowing that she'd be late because the hotel front desk didn't give us any messages when we asked if there were any.
