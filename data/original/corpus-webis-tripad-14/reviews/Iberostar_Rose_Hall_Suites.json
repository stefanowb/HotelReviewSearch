You read all the reviews before you go and you're a little worried that you chose the wrong resort but let me start by saying that you shouldn't judge until you experience it yourself. This resort exceeded my expectations. The service, the room, the food, the entertainment was exceptional. I have 7 & 5 years old girls who are borderline OCD and they were very comfortable at this resort. From check-in to check-out, I have no complaints. Only one minor one and that's the dampness in the room, but we are by the ocean and its HOT so not a big issue, main thing is that we were on vacation on a beautiful resort. This resort is kid friendly, amazing kids club (my girls did not want to leave) with a mini waterpark. Variety of foods for the kids to eat, always, pizza, fries & pasta. And entertainment for them every night. The a la cart restaurants were deli, especially the Mediterrean, awesome seafood platter. If you like jerk chicken, jerk pork, jerk fish, rice and peas & plantain you have booked the right resort, the food as my husband would say was \"exceptional\" Because of the time we went it was quite busy but what resort isn't, so you would have to wake up early to save a good spot by the pool.

My major complaint is that the \"all inclusive\" is not so all inclusive. All your food and drinks are included, BUT if you want to do any water acitivies like snorkling you can only snorkle off the beach for ONE HOUR a day, if you want to go out on a Kayak you CANNOT snorkle, they have a boat that goes out for $39.00. Now everyone knows what a \"banana boat\" is, well you would think that would be included also, no it is $20.00 per person. If you take out a sail boat and need instructions they charge you $40.00 and if by chance you need to be brought back by the boat there is a $50.00 charge for the \"rescue\". I have stayed at all inclusives before, mainly beaches with my family and NEVER had to pay for any of the water activities. If you have small children and they can snorkle bring your own life vest, they charge for those too, $7.00 an hour, they feel if you can swim you do not need one while snorkling. Also the water sports people are not Jamaican and they do not take Jamaican money, only USA dollars. They were very rude when you asked any type of question. We made complaints to the hotel manager but nothing was ever done. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who just enjoys the beach and the pools, if you love to snorkle like I do, do not go to this resort, the area you snorkle at is man made with large boulders, there are fish but nothing like you would see at a reef. Other then the water sports the resort was great, the food was delicious, make your dinner reservations as soon as you get there, the Japanese restaurant books up very fast and is the best one they have.

We booked through a travel agency in Montreal and flew with Westjet. The flight was uneventul but I have to say that WestJet seats and tv are small if you compare with AC, then again, the cost was $400 cheaper for the entire family. The transfer from Montego Bay airport to the hotel took about 2.5 hours from the time we got our luggage and the time we got to the hotel. On my next trip I will forego the transfer included in the trip and book a taxi. Once arrived at the hotel, it was exactly as we expected....but even better, the hall is huge and welcoming, check in was swift, welcome non alcoholic included and with a warm Jamaican smile. The room (3318) was great,big with a lot of storage space and we really liked the fact that it was facing west, so no sun in the morning but great sunset in the late afternoon with partial ocean view. We cant think of anything negative about the room except for the bed that was too soft and the pillows too hard, but that's to each his own. We checked out the beach and pools within hours and were very pleased with it, great for swimming, sunbathing and short walks. We did have to go reserve our chairs every morning though as the hotel was fairly busy, otherwise you ended up on the beach chair without any shade which is still not bad. The shows in the evening are a must, thanks to the team of Stars for putting it on day after day, the kids enjoyed it very much and so did we. The food is simply amazing for Buffet style, fresh, full of variaty to please anyone, we took time to thank the Managing Chef as he was on site every day, at all time (forgot his name). .... watch your weight !! I gained 5 lbs on my 200lbs frame !! Room service was superb thanks to Judith and team, since we have young kids that slepts every day, we asked that our room be done in the morning and it was never missed!! dont be shy on the tip, they work very hard for little money.....goes the same for all the serving staff, we spent about $180 in tips in 7 days. For Scuba lovers, this site offers good scuba dive for all levels, good amount of marine life and great staff to take you there.

Sasha was the first person we spoke to and right off the bat she remembered our names. From then on she was always calling us by name and inviting us to join in the games. Blanka and Monkey were also super awesome!! The shows were always great every night and I would suggest a nap before dinner so you make it to the show.

The host was very rude and the women that cooked our food did not interact with our side of the table or even ask how we liked our food cooked.

There is some confusion regarding the Suites and the # of ala carte restaurant reservations you can make. I\u2019m not sure I can completely clear it up as I am still a bit confused but I will try. The pamphlet of information they give you when you check in states that they guarantee a certain number of restaurant reservations based on the number of nights you are staying, then it goes on to list a matrix of \u201cX\u201d number of nights to \u201cX\u201d number of nights is \u201cX\u201d number of reservations. I THINK they do this so that based on occupancy levels of the hotel they can limit the number of reservations people can make to ensure that if the hotel is near capacity everyone gets a chance to eat at some of the ala cartes. However, I THINK that if the capacity is lower they just let you make as many as you want. I was only staying 3 nights, and while the front desk person was checking to see if my room was ready I walked over to the desk where you do the reservations (If you are standing at the front desk look directly behind you and there it is) I told the very nice lady there that I was checking in for 3 nights and would like to make dinner reservations. She handed me the menus for all the restaurants at the Suites and then verbally told me about the ones at the Beach hotel. Traveling with a 3 year old I wanted an early reservation and had no problem getting 6:30 reservations for my first 3 choices. Since the restaurants are open on alternating nights it took a little juggling around. My suggestion is to let her know which restaurants you want to try during your stay and a range of times you want to eat at and let her figure out a date/restaurant schedule for you. I made reservations (in this order of my stay) for the Mexican, the Steakhouse and the Mediterranean.
