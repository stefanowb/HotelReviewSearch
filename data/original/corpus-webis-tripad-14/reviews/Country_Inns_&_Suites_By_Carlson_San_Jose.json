The hotel was perfectly adequate and was in a great location close to the airport but with no airport noise. We did a couple of trips from here (coffee plantation and volcanos and la Paz) and seemed to always be dropped back first - always a bonus :) ) Breakfast was buffet style and plentiful but didn't have anything else to eat at the hotel as we went down the road to where there are a few restaurants inc. mexican and italian (these being good for the end of the trip when you have had enough of rice and beans!). On our second stay I asked for a room with a balcony or terrace for outdoor access and were put in one of the suite rooms which was much bigger and had a nicer bathroom than our first room so worth an ask ;). We also had a breakfast delivered to our room the night before our early departure, which we didn't have to ask for, so that was a nice touch.

A wonderful family-owned souvenir shop is just steps beyond that- my family's favorite souvenirs were purchased there- at very reasonable prices.
