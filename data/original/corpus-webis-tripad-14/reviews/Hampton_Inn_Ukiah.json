We know this area of town and have always been impressed with the Hilton hotels and inns in general(I am a cardholder). It was therefore easy to decide to stay at the Hampton Inn, right next to the Branches complex (restaurant, pub, bar, deli, pastry shop, market). At the front desk was Ann, who graciously and effortlessly checked us in and gave information. Already, the heavy stress seemed to be lifting. Returning after 6 PM, we went to our room on the third floor overlooking the pool, mountains, and of course Airport Park Blvd. As always, the bed was comfortable and came with two sets of pillows, coffee maker, plenty of space, a good bathroom with separate wash area, and of course the coffee maker. Since a continental breakfast is included in the rate of $117, we didn't need to bother with the coffee machine. Light sleepers may wish to bring earplugs, as occupants in the adjoining room seemed to have their heat on, switching on and off once the temperatures were reached. After a very nice dinner at Branches (superb fish and chips with fresh cod and perfectly prepared hamburger), sleep came easily despite the annoyances next door. Breakfast offers many sweet and fattening items, but at least fresh fruit, yoghurts, cereal provide sustenance.

The other two complaints was that there was no HBO, said that they ordered a new dish as the old one broke.
