The bed was large and comfortable. The bathroom was well appointed with lots of clean fluffy towels. Check in staff were efficient and were able to explain the local bus service to us. The breakfast was served on the roof, in the tent that is described in previous reviews. On one of our days there was a torrential downpour and there were several leaks. It is chilly up there (taking into account that it is January) so dress approriately.. the breakfast itself is reasonable, given the price tag. The lift goes all the way to the roof, but is incorrectly labelled on the inside screen. (get off when the screen says level three when your room is on the fourth floor!) We were put off using the restaurant in the evening but thanks to another review on this website we visited some local very good and very very reasonable restaurants in the local area. (much cheaper and more authentic than the city centre where the tourist premium is high) We went to Ferro e Ghisa on the main road, Circ.ne Aurelia and Joseph's in the Via Accursio. Both of these are close to the Cornelia metro station and we simply called in on our way back from the city.

Shower was left sparkling by the cleaners every day.We booked through Broadway travel and what a bargain! my husband and I look for a high standard and we were not disappointed. Yes there were building works going on that affected breakfast. It was machine coffee and juice but the manager assured me that by the time our teenage daughter and friend arrive for their first \"grown-up\" holiday alone it will all be completed. It is a short 20 minute bus ride into the heart of Rome with the bus stop literally on the doorstep, 1 euro a journey or buy a 3 day pass for 11 euros.On our last day my husband left his medication in the rooms' mini bar and when staff went to look for it it had been removed ready for next guests. The manager must have got them to search the bins or something because they found it just as our airport transfer arrived. In fact nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the manager himself was charming. (He has arranged for dinner \"on the house\" when our daughter arrives. Hows that for service!)

The hotel staff recommended Ferro e ghiza nearby which was very good and contemporary in style. We also ate at nearby Josephs which was more traditional and excellent value (half price of Alturo). Hotel has great location with bus stop right outside and Metro stop 10 minute brisk walk. Metro easily navigated with only 2 lines to choose from. We bought a 3 day Roma pass for 30 euros which enabled us to use Metro/bus/2 museum passes (incl the colesseum but not the Vatican). The pass enabled us priority entrance at the colesseum. The city is much quieter in Jan than the Summer but there was still quite a queue which was worth 30 euros in itself.
