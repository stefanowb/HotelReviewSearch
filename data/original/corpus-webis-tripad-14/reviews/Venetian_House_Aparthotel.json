We were traveling via overnight train and I checked a few weeks before our arrival to see if we could check-in early/check-out late. The hotel said our room was currently free before and after our arrival, so they would accomodate us early/late if possible. They advised us to book the room those extra nights to be sure the room was available, but I didn't want to spend the extra money when the room was already free. This was a huge mistake. When we arrived in Krakow at 6:30 AM after a miserably hot and awful overnight train ride, we found the gate to the hotel entryway locked. I called their number on my printed reservation and was informed reception didn't open until 8:30 AM. We had to sit in the square until then only to find out that our room was occupied and we couldn't check-in early, and there were no other free rooms in the hotel that we could pay for to use for showers/resting until our room was ready. There was also no availability to book an extra night on our departure day. I assume this is in part due to the high season of summer and the popularity of this hotel on TripAdvisor. If you are traveling via over night train, I would reserve that extra night at least on the day of your arrival so that you can shower and rest. Thank you though, to the receptionist that helped us, she was very friendly and professional - let us store our bags, use the office restroom and gave us vouchers for breakfast at a cafe on the corner of the square.", "title": "Absolutely fabulous!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "GillAberdeen", "date": "July 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134352469}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled on business", "text": "This was a a pleasant surprise.
