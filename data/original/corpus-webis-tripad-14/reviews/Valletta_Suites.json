Brian was very helpful and responsive to our questions and a couple of requests we had while we were there. A couple of the reviews have noted that the Vanguard Club across the street can get a bit noisy. We, in fact, loved having the \"club\" across the street. The same group of men sit outside morning until night. They were friendly and helpful, inquiring about how our day was and what our plans were for the next--often making recommendations as to things we should see and do.
