I generally like all Hilton branded hotels, including Hampton Inns.

Otherwise, staff were curt and the room was noisy as we could hear folks moving around in other rooms. We did not have a good sleep. The soundproofing seems non-existant between rooms, to the point that when the folks in the room above started moving around at 5am, it woke me up. For the price you can do far better elsewhere.
