Even though she handles the whole place alone, she goes out of her way and beyond all expectations to make you feel at home and welcome.

The hotel is small and beautiful and Anna the owner is a wonderful hostess. Our bedroom was light and airy and decorated beautifully. There were bunks for the kids and a mini-fridge, which was very important in the heat! There was also air-con which did not switch off when you left the room so we came back to a lovely cool room after a long hot day on the beach. Anna provided a lovely breakfast which always included wonderful bread, home made cake and fresh fruit. She also cooks in the evening if you book ahead and it is well worth it! I had the best spaghetti vongole I have ever had! The wine was included in the fixed price and was excellent and I will definitely ask her to cook again on our next visit! We LOVED this hotel and though we would love to keep it a secret so there is space for us when we want to go back, but it is really wonderful. It is close to the beach and Anna will book a beach brolly for you if you ask. It is also close to town so you can have a lovely passeggiata in the evening and watch the sunset.", "title": "Wonderful hotel and host", "user": "Richard O", "date": "August 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 135977798}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Grazie Anna per una fantastica vacanza e torniamo presto!", "title": "Fantastic Host", "user": "thomas n", "date": "June 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133062213}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Tuscany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 23, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 65}, "slim_ranking": 0.0222222222222}
