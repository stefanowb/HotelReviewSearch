We stayed for only one night. This hotel is very clean, the staffs are friendly, and the price was excellent, we only pay $89 for one night. The free breakfast was also excellent, many choices and kids friendly. I would definitely stay again. And if you stay before June 30, 2006, you will get a free 3000 points for the Goldpass memebership, which can be redeemed for another free night at any Summerfield Suite.", "title": "Great stay.
