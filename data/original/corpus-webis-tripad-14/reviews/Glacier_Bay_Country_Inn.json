Most outstanding were the warm, accommodating staff, whose motto is, \"We will do whatever it takes to make your time with us wonderful.\" They arranged our boat cruise on the bay, sea kayaking trip, and whale watch, plus provided transportation to our departure points when needed. They fed us magnificently, including box lunches for our daytime adventures, and were always ready to fill special requests. One of our tablemates at dinner asked for an encore appearance of the mint chocolate chip cheescake he'd enjoyed his first night and, lo and behold, there it was on the menu his last night! We're not usually big on eating with people we don't know, but we were far from minding here because the couple we shared our table with all four nights were absolutely delightful. In fact, all of the guests we met were congenial--the place seems to attract that kind of clientele. One thing to be aware of: the inn changed ownership this spring and the new owners did't have a liquor permit yet, so you may need to buy your own beverage in town if you want something alcoholic. We were able to hitch a ride to the mercantile in the inn van.", "title": "A Wonderful Place with Great Food!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "WHTraveler", "date": "July 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 18214882, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Excellent Service", "disliked": "\u2014 Smelly Well Water"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed in one of the cabins, which was modern, spotless, tastefully furnished, and equipped with a queen bed, a set of bunks (which we didn't use), and a small but perfectly adequate bath. We would have preferred a seating area instead of the bunks, and the water pressure in the shower was subpar, but these are quibbles in what were excellent accommodations overall.
