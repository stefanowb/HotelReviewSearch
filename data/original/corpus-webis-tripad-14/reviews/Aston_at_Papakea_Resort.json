This place is more like apartments on the beach. Actually some are apartments. A lot of older people (70-90+). Beach is tiny to non existent at high tide. Swimming is hazardous. I consider myself a courtious smoker but this place goes overboard. Smoking is discouraged anywhere on prop even though Hawaii law permits smoking more that 20 ft from a building. Other Hotels allow smoking as long as you're away from buildings, I suggest if you're a smoker to ask first.I wouldn't stay here again.", "user": "hutchie69", "date": "April 24, 2008", "id": 15333728}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Cockroaches!", "text": "One word: cockroaches!!!!", "user": "P_Julie", "date": "April 17, 2008", "id": 15094747}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Great time but will not stay again", "text": "As soon as we checked in and got to the door we found a notice about \"regular pest cleaning\".

The resort was incredible with breath taking views of the ocean and of the fantastic gardens at the resort from our one bedroom suite. The staff did a great job taking care of our every need. The expedia.com team that helps guests with their activities were very helpful and honest with all their recommendations. We went to their orientation on our first morning there and in a fast paced effort so as not to waste any of our valuable time provided info that helped us make selections about what we wanted to do and confirmed all our choices. They also made several reservations for us during the week. We all participated in the onsite activities such as yoga by the ocean and water aerobics several mornings. The resort is located just north of the Kaanapali area where all the major chain resorts (Sheraton, Hyatt) are located which made it great so you could avoid all the hustle and noise there each night, but close enough that you could be in the middle of it if you wanted to. The staff at the hotel did a great job of cleaning our room every few days without any charge, they changed our beach towels at the front desk as often as we needed them changed when we came back from all the beautiful beaches that were close by and were as helpful as they could be. The room had everything you could possibly need and it was very clean and comfortable. The beds and pillows were really nice. The pools at the resort were fantastic with plenty of lounge chairs and grills to cook on. The resort has well manicured grass that goes right up to the ocean retaining wall where you could stay out of the sand if you wanted to and still walk down the steps and you were in the waves. We couldn't have had a better time and enjoyed every minute of our stay. We really missed the Papakea Resort duing the next week when we went to Oahu and stayed at the Embassy Suites there on Wakaki Beach.", "user": "Bob P", "date": "August 24, 2008", "id": 19318920}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful view, beautiful grounds, great unit!", "text": "We just returned from a week at the Papakea resort just north of Ka'anapali in Maui. We loved the location - close to Lahaina (ten minutes) and within an hour of Makena and Hookipa. Our unit, G102, was a ground floor unit, which I was initially hestitant about, but we ended up loving it! The easy pool and beach access and gorgeous view of the koi pond were wonderful. After arriving at night, waking up to the stunning view of Lani and Molokai was tremendous! For a beachfront condominium complex, the Papakea has some really pretty property to walk - many of the condos just seem to be slammed up against the beachfront and very crowded. The management company (we rented through VRBO) and Papakea personnel were great (the owners are very friendly, too! They checked in with us about our stay)- never had any problems! The kitchen had recently been remodeled and had everything, which was great because we cooked in alot. The property has many grills, too. We liked that it wasn't a huge complex, but it was very family oriented.

It's the fifth time we've stayed at Papakea overall. It's a great place for us! It has beautiful mature grounds with some of the biggest koi we've ever seen. We prefer a quieter property with the ammenities that are most important to us. That includes a nice pool area, grounds and of course great BBQ areas. We chose A 202 the first time because we wanted an oceanfront unit to watch whales from. That was in February of '07. We were so pleased with everything we found that we booked it a year in advance to make sure we could come back! This unit is located away from most of the \"outside\" hallway traffic. It has a beautiful view and the owner clearly works hard to make sure everything is clean and in order. We had a small problem when we first checked in this time and called the owner to ask for help. She called back 43 minutes later and APOLOGIZED for taking so long to call me back. That's CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! The problem was solved immediately, well beyond our expectations!
