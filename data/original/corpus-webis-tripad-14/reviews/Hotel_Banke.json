Had to request bath/shower be cleaned. Spacious room for euro standards, but broken furniture and darkness, plus no a/c equaling little sleep, almost ruined our vacation. Vacuuming at 6 am unnecessary. Nearby construction loud. Initial greeters lovely and helpful. Room service couldn't get our order of 2 items correct, even after 3 phone calls.

The service we received from everybody at the hotel was friendly and helpful.

Ours was included in our rate as SLH members, but I do understand other reviewers who felt it was a bit pricey and chose to find breakfast elsewhere. The location of this hotel is perfect - more of a \"neighborhood\" feel (near the Opera) but very close to metro stations that are only a couple of stops from the Louvre - or you could walk.
