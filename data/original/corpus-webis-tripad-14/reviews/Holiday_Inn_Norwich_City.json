The room was clean and relatively spacious; the only downside was the view (front of the hotel) but I wasn't there for that so I didn't really care. Wifi was only available in the lobby area. The bathroom was absolutely fine although the only things you got given in addition to towels was wall-mounted Dove soap and a bar of solid soap. No proper shampoo or other bits. Not a deal breaker but I thought I'd point it out. We also had tea (Twinings Everyday) and coffee-making facilities; best of all the hotel is opposite a shopping area that includes a Morrisons so we popped there to grab some nibbles. The town centre is only a ten-fifteen drive away, about \u00a35 by taxi. I would not worry about the proximity to the football stadium as we were there during a match and could not hear a thing once inside the hotel.

Children under 12 eat free, so that was a bonus. It is next to the football ground which can be a plus or a minus. If you are a fan, it is a plus.
