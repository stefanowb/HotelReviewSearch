I paid $84 and they gave me a room in the new tower (Radius) after I called and requested that tower and 2 double beds. Unfortunately they only had a queen in that tower so I had to change to the older tower for the 2 beds. The beds were great (seemed updated to me) and there was an iPod clock radio with dock which was a nice feature. The bathroom was a bit the small side, but the room was very spacious.

I didn't look for any nearby parking due to the time of night I arrived but I would guess there wasn't much else available due to being located in downtown Atlanta (great location for anyone doing tourist activities). Check in went smoothly except I was placed in a room with a dbl bed instead of the requested king. I was given a voucher for a complimentary breakfast at a restaurant on site and was switched to a room with a king bed the next day which satisfied me.

Yes, you're going to pay $27 a night for parking, $3.50 for a cup of coffee at the little cafe, and $8 if you need a bottle of Pepto from the gift shop. Still, it was a value.
