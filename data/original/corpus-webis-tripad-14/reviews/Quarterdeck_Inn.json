For two nights for two people (one room) we paid a total of $336.40 (CD), including tax. The rooms are on the large size. We stayed on the top floor and the view of the harbor was very striking. The rooms are quiet, except for the banging of the doors as they close (they have a closing mechanism that insures they close with a bang). Even this wasn't too bad.
