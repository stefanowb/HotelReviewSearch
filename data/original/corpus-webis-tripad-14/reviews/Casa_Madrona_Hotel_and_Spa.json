We had lived in the area for years before staying here, and somehow got the impression from the outside of the hotel that it might be slightly tacky and run down. I don't know about the other kinds of rooms, but that is definitely not the case where we stayed. This is a \"hidden\" gem tucked up the side of the hill in Sausalito, and these rooms, while right downtown and convenient to every Sausalito attraction, have a fantastic view of the water with floor to ceiling windows and a balcony. They somehow create a sense of privacy and coziness (romantic!). Though just one large room, they are tastefully appointed, with a large upholstered chaise at the foot of the king bed, another chair and ottoman, two desks, a large bar, and entryway. The room feels light and spacious. The bathroom is sensational, very large with huge tub, double sinks, separate huge glass shower, and a luxurious feel. This hotel doesn't have it's own restaurant but is atop an Italian restaurant Poggio, and they serve room service to the hotel from 7am-10pm which worked great for us! There are a ton of fantastic eateries within walking distance, as well as the bay, the ferry to San Francisco, etc.", "title": "Wonderful Experience!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Epiphany1953", "date": "November 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146399768}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I did not use the in-hotel spa this trip but did last time, and can highly recommend it.", "title": "Great Place to enjoy the beauty of Sausalito and the Bay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jack K", "date": "November 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146347414}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This boutique hotel has a lovely small lobby with friendly, gracious staff, a separate lounge area with computer and sitting area, and valet parking.

Sausalito is a gorgeous little town that seems to have been beamed in from classic American movie and there is plenty to keep you occupied for a lazy weekend with easy access to Muir Woods and Angel Island.
