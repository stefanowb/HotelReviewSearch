The drive in itself from Nanaimo is breathtaking. We stayed in a \"rainforest cottage\" which was exceptionally roomy, finished to a very high standard with very tasteful furnishings, very well kitted out and looked like it had been completed yesterday in terms of the level of wear and tear. Having a cottage and the use of the 'Great Room' for meals and to hang out in if we wanted a change of scene was an ideal set up - a home from home without the responsability for meals if you don't want it. Meal options are numerous - Tofino has some great restaurants and paying for meals separately enables you to sample the restaurants of other local lodges such as the Wickannish Inn which is just down the road. We also made use of the wonderful gas barbeque adjacent to the cottages at Long Beach one night. Meals in Long beach's Great Room were of a high standard, but the menu is not v. extensive and guests staying several nights would probably quickly get through their preferred selections. The serving staff were increadibly friendly and helpful but service was not very rapid. Booking for the restaurant is essential and a good idea to do the day before if you want the most popular eating times. We were exceptionally lucky with the weather, we saw some wonderful sunsets from the breaktaking views from the Great Room. Cox Bay, where the resort is situated, is a stunning location with miles of deserted sand and great surf. The water is freezing, but there are plenty of outfitters in Tofino who will rent you wetsuits and surfboards. We whale watched and bear watched courtesy of Ocean Outfitters in Tofino who were great. I consider myself to be a discerning traveller, prepared to pay a high price for a quality product. I rate Long Beach as a great value, high quality location, professionally run by very friendly staff - if it wasn't the other side of the world, we'd be regular customers!", "title": "A stunning location for a high quality lodge", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "wildatheart78", "date": "August 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19202675, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 spacious, tastefully decorated accommodation - possibility of having a cottage", "disliked": "\u2014 lack of choice and slow service in the restaurant"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My partner and I celebrated our 25th year together by treating ourselves to a night at Long beach Lodge on the shores of beautiful Cox Bay.

Beautiful setting and a nice decor with views of the ocean. The food was adequate but for the same price - superb food and ambience can be had at the Pointe restaurant at the Wicaninish Inn nearby. The service was poor at the restaurant. We waited in the lounge area with a cocktail and were told we would be called when our table was ready. We waited and waited and finally inquired and discovered that there were lots of tables- they had just forgotten about us. Our wait person serviced other tables that had arrived after us and throughout the entire dinner we had to wait an inordinate amount of time for service compared to other tables being served by the same waitress. We observed her giving attentive and friendly service to the other tables, but to us her service was perfunctory at best. As a same sex couple we wonder if her treatment of us was somewhat coloured by a personal bias. For the standard of the restaurant we would expect much more. Also our reservation info was incorrect & upon checking in when we brought this up we discovered at the end of our stay it had not been updated. We had been asked if there was a special occasion and we said it was our 25th Anniversary - so you expect some sort of acknowledgment of this during our stay but there was none.

Far from being \"nestled in the forest\", the cabins are actually lined up on either side of the access road that comes from the highway to the lodge. Our room in the lodge seemed small and claustrophobic, though it may have just been my mood. One ridiculous \"feature\" was a window between the bathroom and the bedroom that had wooden louvers. This was supposedly so that you could sit in the tub and look out at the ocean. It seemed to me they were just trying to emulate the Wickaninnish Inn, just down the road, which has rooms where the tub is right up against an outside window.
