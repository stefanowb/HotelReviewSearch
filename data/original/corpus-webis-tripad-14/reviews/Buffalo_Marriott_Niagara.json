Now I had stayed at the this property multiple times over the past 10 years and always liked it: great location, good sized rooms, helpful staff. But for this weekend trip, after the first night of sleeplessness on plastic, I discovered the plastic mattress cover. So I called the front desk to ask them to take it off and they told me that housekeeping would do so. When I got back to the room late that night and found the plastic still there I called down to the desk. I heard \"Housekeeping isn't allowed to remove the plastic as it protects against bed bugs.\" I explained that I had stayed in Marriotts all around the world and had never experienced a plastic-coated bed, and that the bed was quite uncomfortable. Desk staff said there was nothing they could do about it. I checked out early and won't stay there again. I did email the manager following this and was told that I was given wrong information.
