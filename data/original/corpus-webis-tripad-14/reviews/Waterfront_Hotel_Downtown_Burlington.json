There were a few surprises, practically no toilet papering the bathroom when we arrived, the door to walk outside on lower level was not working, one elevator broken (out of 2), hot tub (spa) by pool broken and the room was, again, small.

Unfortunately today when we arrived we were told AFTER being registered that the elevator was not working and that our room was on the top floor (6th!). We were also told that the technicians were working on it. They suggested that we go have a coffee and all would be well, but they would not be pinned down on the ETA for the repair. So we drove about town, went to the mall, gave it a couple of hours and came back. That is when we found out that the elevator had been out since the morning and that first one elevator broke, and then when the repairman was working, so did the second. There was still no clear indication of any ETA, although the repairman did remove a very large and intricate looking piece of machinery. Other guests were advised to take rooms on the first or second floor, but there were no king/jacuzzi suites on the lower floors. Advising us initially (like, say, BEFORE we registered!) that this was problematic might have mitigated our displeasure, but as it was, we added 127km in 40 degree heat and wasted 4 hours, and still didn't have any place to stay. That's a lot of time and gas. While the desk staff did the best they could, they were less than empathetic with our circumstances and should have told us the details up front. Had we been informed at arrival, we would have turned around right away and made other plans. It is the waste of our time and energy that really hurts. We have been repeat clients of this establishment, but would certainly think twice in the future about trying again.

They assigned another room, but the front desk clerk was surly and indifferent. The room inself was musty and needed upgrading.
