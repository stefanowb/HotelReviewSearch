They also have a lovely little patisserie on the side of the hotel where you can buy their cakes to take away. If you love quaint older style (romantic) hotels with a view to die for then this is for you, (just make sure you book a sea view room with balcony).

I was pleasantly surprised having experienced so called 5 stars in Croatia before which was not up to scratch; this is not the case in Milenij. Our room was in the new wing, very clean and well appointed. It was unfortunately partly overlooking the street which was a little noisy but this could not be avoided due to late booking. Try and book a room with a sea view. The room was very hot but we just left the window slightly ajar. We never actually complained but I'm sure the excellent staff would have assisted. We had twin beds, which yes, were soft but I enjoy this in a hotel.We did not seek to change on account of the twins so just be aware of this when booking and request a true double if you would prefer. Our package included use of swimming pool and spa (which I would imagine all deals do?) and robes and slippers were delivered to our room. Room service turned down our room on only one night with a lovely chocolate but unfortunately no water, although this is available in the minibar at a very reasonable price. Room service made up the room adequately but did not replace toiletries although again I\u2019m sure you can request these. Penhaligon\u2019s toiletries in the bathroom! Bathroom was fine, no natural light but a good size with double basin. I\u2019m sure these can be requested.
