What a wonderful hotel. The staff is gracious and attentive, we always felt like we were taken care of without being hovered over. Check in went smoothly and we were shown to lovely room with a view of the Parkway. The furnishings were in true FS form, elegent and classic. The bed was very comfortable and of course the bath was the best part of the whole room. We had some appetizers and drinks in the bar area before heading out to our dinner in the city. The items were pricey (it is the FS after all) but good. While there, we decided to inquire about reservations for their famous Sunday brunch the next day (I had requested the brunch upon making my reservation, only to find it had been booked for forever). An extremely helpful waiter made some inquires and eventually the manager came over and instructed us to arrive early and request a table and the staff should be able to squeeze us in. We did just that and were not disappointed - we were quickly seated and the brunch was to die for. The brunch staff was excellent, always there with coffee or juice at just the right time and each time we went up to the buffet we arrived back to a table that looked as though we had never sat there. All in all it, was a fantastic stay and I would definately go back.", "title": "Great New Years Stay", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "kmunis", "date": "July 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5417061}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I Love the Four Seasons!!!", "text": "After staying at the Miami and Chicago Four Seasons hotels, I checked in to the Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia with my kids with high expectations.
