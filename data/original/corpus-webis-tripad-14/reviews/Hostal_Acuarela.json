There is one guy who runs the place, thankfully he was there when we arrived otherwise the doors are locked and you're not able to get in. We were the only guests there, he went out for a few hours. During that time a few other travellers knocked at the door, leaving only us to answer it! We explained the guy had popped out and they could wait inside. An hour later he still wasn't back and we had to go out, so we had to ask the other travellers to leave!
