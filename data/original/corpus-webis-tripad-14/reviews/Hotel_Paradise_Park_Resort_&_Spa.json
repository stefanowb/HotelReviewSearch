We were told all rooms were 4 star and had a/c. We booked an apartment as we didn't want to be limited to eat at the hotel. On arrival to the hotel we were impressed with the reception area but this was to be short lived as we were shown to our apartment. It was of average size but very dated. It was in need of refurbishment. There was no a/c. Foy my husband and I this is a definite requirement when booking accomodation - especially in July. We went back to reception to voice our concerns and ask for another apartment/room. We were told that none of the apartments have a/c. After some persuasion the duty manager said we could change to a hotel room (which had a/c) but there would be a supplement of 6 euros per night per person. We discussed this with him as we didn't think it was fair but he said to take it up with the travel agent. We paid the 84 euros but managed to get breakfast included in this price. On arrival to the second room we were a little disappointed as we thought this would be more like a 4 star room. It wasn't. I would class this hotel as a 2 star. Please bear this in mind when booking your holiday. The balcony was terrible. It had a \"roof\" and there was a barrier, probably for safety reasons, but this meant you couldn't see anything other than sky!! It also had bird excrement on the floor which was to remain for the duration of our holiday (1 week). The dining room was very big and breakfast was good. Lots to choose from and not too busy. The evening entertainment was a bit cheesy but what else do you expect?!! The pool area was nice and we didn't have any difficulties in getting any sunbeds. The location of the hotel was good if you don't mind walking. It took us around 20 minutes to walk to the centre of Los Cristianos which isn't too long but on the way back it was uphill.

However we had a Modern Executive Suite on the top floor, and it was fabulous. It was huge, very modern, extremely clean and a beautiful view towards the sea. Easily the best hotel room we have ever stayed in, both here and abroad. There were two large single / small double beds, fitted wardrobes, a lounge area with a three-seater sofa and LCD TV (although only two English channels - Sky News and Zone Horror!), a bar area with a fridge and tea-making facilities, and a balcony that ran the whole length of the room, with two sets of the French doors from the bedroom and lounge. It made a change to see a proper table and chair set, instead of the usual white plastic! And it was great to sit and watch the ferries and boats come into the harbour. The bathroom was huge \u2013 a large sink unit, big corner bath, huge walk-in shower behind a frosted glass door (showerhead the size of a dinner plate!) and another frosted glass door leading to the toilet area.

The decoration has a \u2018Tuscan\u2019 feel, with lots of terracotta and wrought iron. An interesting feature is the yellow house built into the wall \u2013 apparently this is the original farmhouse from the banana plantation that stood on the land before the hotel was built, so they kept it intact and built the hotel around it (it now houses the lift to the rooftop). There is a mosaic nearby showing the plantation as it was. We didn\u2019t spend much time around the pools downstairs, but they looked very clean and never too crowded. In particular, the \u2018natural\u2019 pool looked lovely, I wish we\u2019d spent some time in there. The hotel grounds were very nice, again very clean, with lots of flowers and places to sit. The best part for us was the adults-only rooftop terrace. We spent every day up there; it was so peaceful and got the sun all day. You had to go up before breakfast to \u2018reserve\u2019 (e.g. put towels on) your loungers. Not something we like doing but it is rife among some of the other nationalities, so if you can\u2019t beat them, join them! Luckily our room was very close to the stairs up to the roof, so we went on our way to breakfast. We always got two loungers that were in their own little corner, surrounded on three sides by the glass panels (don\u2019t look down!). Pool towels are available from the hotel, just ask at reception when you check in and they\u2019ll tell you where to get them. The rooftop terrace has a snack bar which serves the usual burgers, chips, toasties etc. It\u2019s not the cheapest place to eat (a small pizza, portion of chips and a soft drink cost 12 euro), but it was the easy option, and the views are lovely (and the pizza is nice!). On the other side of the snack bar, there are more sun loungers in private wooden gazebos with curtains, and steps up to the deck with a small plunge pool and two small Jacuzzis \u2013 the views from here are amazing.", "title": "Nice one", "user": "tebciak", "date": "February 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 24844773}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "As with any buffet restaurant, the dining room gets very busy and crowded. But there are two smaller rooms just off the main one, where we sat for every meal (much nicer than the main room, only a few tables with nobody squeezing past you). Actually getting your food is a bit frustrating due to some guests being rude and pushy, and not waiting their turn. Breakfast is excellent. They have the usual fry-up items - bacon, sausages, eggs, omelettes, beans etc. There is also a stand with fresh fruit, tinned fruit and a variety of yoghurts. Lots of different cereals, dried fruit and nuts, different types of bread, gorgeous pancakes freshly made (had these every morning \u2013 lemon wedges available next to the teabags!) and dozens of types of fresh pastries. There are also various items on the main buffet stand \u2013 meats, cheeses, and other hot items (including, bizarrely, peas \u2013 which some people were eating!). Hot drinks and fruit juices are from a machine, and the queues can be long. But they are plentiful and free, so no complaints. We didn\u2019t try the open-air lunch buffet, but it looked nice \u2013 you pick your meat or fish from the fridge and they cook it in front of you, and there are the usual salads, pasta, pizza etc on the buffet. It would have been very good value if we were on full board, but it would have cost us 9 euro each to eat in there, and after a big breakfast, we didn\u2019t feel we would eat enough to justify that cost, so we just shared something from the snack bar. There is also a room service menu available from 8am to 10pm, and it is surprisingly reasonable. Dinner is very good with lots of choice. There are soups and salads, meat and fish cooked fresh (we had steaks one night and fresh tuna another night), vegetables, potatoes, chips, pasta, rice, stews, cheese, crackers, pate, breads, nachos \u2013 you can easily have something different every night (although things could be better described, it is a bit off-putting not knowing what something contains). Desserts are also good \u2013 dozens of tiny cakes and chocolates, gateaux\u2019s and pastries, plus the usual angel delight / jelly / tinned fruit for the kids, fresh fruit, yoghurts, eight different flavours of ice cream, plus a hot option such as crepes or baked bananas. Let\u2019s be honest, buffet food is never going to win any awards. But the food here was the best variety and quality of anywhere we\u2019ve stayed. Admittedly, the drinks set-up is a bit strange. When you arrive at the dining room, you go to the welcome desk and are given an empty bill slip, which you take to your table. The waitress comes and takes your drink order, and then writes it on the bill. At the end of your meal, you take it up to the welcome desk and pay. The first night, we didn\u2019t know what to do, so we sat for ten minutes before the waitress came to take the drinks order. After that, we went to get our food straight away, and she would normally come for the order when we were mid-way through our starters. The waitresses are so busy clearing tables, it is difficult to get their attention for a second drink. It would be much easier if they had a bar area, so you could go and get your own drinks. This would leave the waitresses free to clear tables, and would mean no waiting for guests. There were no free drinks with dinner, even coffee and water were charged, and the drinks prices were quite high \u2013 we stuck to soft drinks all week, but a tiny bottle of coke (mini-bar sized) was 2.40 euro, and you had to drink it out of the wine glass on the table. A bottle four times the size was 0.95 euro in the shop next door, so it is difficult to understand why they charge so much \u2013 especially as the drink prices at the snack bar are quite reasonable. Dress code for dinner is \u2018formal\u2019 but this just means no shorts, and no sleeveless tops or flip flops (for men \u2013 women can wear vest tops and sandals). Smart t-shirts are fine for the men, or a casual shirt.
