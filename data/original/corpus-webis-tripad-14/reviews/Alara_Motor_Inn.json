We actually stayed here on 2 separate nights a week apart. The first night we checked in we had a great staff member checking us in who gave us directions to restaurants and recommended some good ones. The rooms have all been renovated. (Refer to their website not Expedia etc as those pictures are not accurate at all) The rooms were decently done but it's a no frills Motor Inn that we found to be extremely expensive for what you got. People start leaving at 5am and don't seem to be very courteous to other travellers....since the parking lot is right outside your door you hear EVERYTHING. Doors slamming, people talking, cars starting and especially TV's from the rooms closest to you. We were going to stay somewhere else for our second night but didn't have the time to find anything before we got back in Mackay so we ended up here again. This time however we had the RUDEST staff member (Karen) that we've ever encountered. That put us completely over the edge regarding this hotel and I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. There are lots of Motor Inns in Mackay on the same street....pick a different one.", "title": "Stay Elsewhere!", "user": "Janesse", "date": "March 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 26504545}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Alara Motel for one night while on a driving holiday.
