Stayed here for a week, B and B. Friendly helpful staff, fabulous service, cool modern decor, big comfy beds, decent wardrobes with loads of hangers, great bathroom, ( with a bidet too) air conditioning that really worked, fabulous view from balcony over the stunning lake. Breakfast on the terrace, (huge choice from the buffet) and everywhere is immaculately kept. Its right in the middle of Sirmione by the ferry terminal and main square. Noise at night ? Not a problem, with the balcony door open we heard people in the cafes enjoying themselves, but not in a rowdy way, close the door and use the air con and we never heard a sound, slept like a log. There is no pool and no real garden so perhaps not ideal for children, but a fabulous hotel and we would definitely go back.", "title": "Absolutely loved it !!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "sandyCornwall", "date": "May 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130101718}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I spent 4 nights here as part of my honeymoon and I cannot say enough about the place.
