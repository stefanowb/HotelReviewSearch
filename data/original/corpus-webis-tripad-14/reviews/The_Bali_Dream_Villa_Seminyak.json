I wont even bother adding pictures of my own as again the previous reviewers have given a good all round view of Bali Dream Villas ( BDV ). I truly cannot fault the staff. All of them cant do enough to make you feel welcome and help in anyway. Everyone from the manager to the gardeners ! Location has been correctly described by others. It's a nice quiet location , down an unassuming street and close by to everything. Unless you like to have your own transport ,I really recommend taxi's ...whether it's getting into Kuta or Seminyak ..the beach etc...it's only like 20k a trip...dirt cheap. Better still the courtesy buses from BDV are great too. Villas are private and well equipped. A few have mentioned the fact the sun doesn't shine much on the garden and pool. I can see where they are coming from..but perhaps we was lucky in our villa..we had sun from 10.30 pm up until 4.30. Yes the pools are a bit fresh :) ... but clean. for a chilled week in your own private pool villa... BDV get a YES vote from me. Now ...the little downsides. Our particular villa just needed a little bit of attention here and there. Cupboard doors need attending as one was nearly falling off. Some plug sockets didn't look safe at all. It isn't really suitable for home cooking although there is a small kitchenette and some basic utensils. Breakfast really wasn't all that. We particularly like breakfast, but if you after a ' big varied and hearty'' one, this isn't the place..not enough choice. This needs to be addressed. No bar. No dog problems but Cats are problematic whereby you can come out in the morning and find 1 or 2 sleeping on the sofa and chairs. So invariably we would ask the cleaners to pay a bit ''more attention '' to the living area. Free water bottles are not in abundance. WiFi is free but the signal was weak and crashed sometimes. But we coped. So the downsides are not bad...but if those little things were looked at it would make a world of difference. Would I come back ?,, I guess so...I would not deter anyone from staying here.", "title": "I would return and recommend ....", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "TheGeez", "date": "August 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172903423}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "We started out the first couple of nights of our honeymoon at the Bali dream villa resort in seminyak.
