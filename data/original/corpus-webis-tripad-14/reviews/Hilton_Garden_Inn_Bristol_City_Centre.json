Car parking was \u00a310 per day.There was a bus stop directly outside the hotel and the regular bus service took you to the flourishing Cabot Shopping Centre and harbourside which has a wide choice of restaurants. The railway station is conveniently located a few hundred yards from the hotel We had a rear room on the top floor and never heard any traffic. The lifts were silent and efficient. Agnes the Receptionist was particularly pleasant and very helpful. We visited the fascinating MShed museum on the harbourside which has free admission and enjoyed an outstanding interactive display of the historical development of Bristol and its people. There was a charge to visit the display of fashion photographs on the 3rd floor. Have booked another stay at The Mint Hotel next month although I understand it has just been taken over by the Hilton so I hope it maintains its high standards and customer focus.", "title": "Perfect for our Needs", "user": "Mark_Helen_8", "date": "February 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 124520681}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011", "text": "Nice clean and quite room, with a nice view over the park.

You could rotate what I assume was the temperature control - there are no symbols or instructions - right round and make no difference whatsoever to the heat of the water (I did check the other dial, this just turned the flow on or off).

Having navigated a huge roundabout and eventually found the correct street I quickly checked in , left my bags and went to work.On my return I discovered how bleak the area was and apart from the big , imposing roundabout, the office blocks stood bleak and empty on a Saturday night ion the snow.

Basic enough with a nice big bed but excellent in terms of plugs, access to WiFi, mac and excellent and multi use apple television.
