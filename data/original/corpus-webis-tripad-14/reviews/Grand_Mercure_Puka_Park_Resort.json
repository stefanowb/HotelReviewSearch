The hotel is set in bushland and paths are fairly steep but it is such a pleasure to be there. Pauanui was very quiet but the beaches and views were wonderful.

It could have been much cleaner. The toilet was not cleaned and it was absolutely disgusting. It was cleaned after we contacted reception but really it should never have been overlooked. I had asked that there be a cot in our room when I made the reservation and then I called before we left home to remind the hotel and when we got there the cot was not there. It was bought in by staff who did not know how to assemble it and had to wait for some time for someone to come assemble it for us. Puka Park is definitely not worth the normal nightly rate.

But we're very disappointed. Firstly the reception was quite blunt and not very welcoming. We were often no bell service to the chalets which are quite a walk from the parking. We booked into the restaurant the night of June 4 and the service was quite lacking. It took a long time for our order to be taken and once taken we hardly saw the waitress. Both ordered medium steak with sides. The steaks came out after a long time but the sides were forgotten. My steak was medium well. We finally got our sides after catching a waiter to ask. We sent steak back to be warmed up because at this point were quite cold. Then my medium steak came out well done. Would have loved to have said something to the staff but again they were nowhere to be seen. The next morning went to make a cup of tea only to find out that the milk had expired on 24th of May. Almost 2 weeks old. Couldn't make tea the next morning because there had only been 2 tea bags, nothing was stocked up. Needless to say we didn't recreate our time in 2010 and probably won't be back to Puka Park.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 9, 2011", "id": 112471694}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We are new to New Zealand. We have travelled quite a bit and found the hotel to be barely average. The rooms were spacious and great settings, but there were cob webs in all corners, and the vacuming was very suspect. The food was good when we could get service. We had lots of servers coming up to us and asking us what we wanted, however no one brought us anything until we flagged down a server. This happened at dinner, and at breakfast.

The staff and service were excellent. We had waited over an hour to be seated for our dinner reservation, the staff more than made our wait comfortable and we were very pleased with how we were treated. The meal was delicious and more than made up for the wait. The only complaint we would have is a banging noise which was quite loud and went on for several hours during the night both nights which interupted our sleep. We thought it may have been a vent on the roof or outside wall. Otherwise we were very happy with our stay and would definately recommend this resort to our friends and look forward to returning.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 8, 2011", "id": 112318151}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We went to Puka Park for a relaxing weekend with some friends.

We utilised the heated pool on both days... this was heaven for the kids, quite the novelty in Winter!

It is an amazing setting with Tree Hut chalets dotted around the hillside of Mount Pauanui amid native bush. We arrived and were made to feel very welcome by the Receptionist. Our rooms were not quite ready ( having not arrived until check in time at 2pm thought this was poor) however the Front Desk was very apologetic and took us up to the restaurant and had a drink while we waited. Our Chalet was nice, windows however needed cleaning and cobwebs removed. The set up with the cupboards that housed the TV and DVD player was a bit odd..you had to close them every time you wanted to boil the jug etc. We booked for dinner on Saturday night and were not dissapointed.
