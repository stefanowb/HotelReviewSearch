I had been reading reviews on here before we left and got really worried from what people had said. I had pretty much no expectations because I thought it was going to be horrible. That wasn't the case. Please don't listen to the reviews and just enjoy Cuba. We stayed overnight in Toronto at the Fairfield Inn and suites. That place was great. Awesome room.

One receptionist for a whole bunch of people. Check in is at 3pm. We arrived around 12:30pm and was told the room would be ready at 3pm. We went to eat at the buffet and walked around. Washrooms by the main bar are gross. They are smelly and no toilet paper and broken locks on doors. Went back to check if room was ready at 3:20pm. Not ready. Went back at 4:00pm and still it wasn't ready. We were told another 20 minutes.

My daughter had her own room at night. If you are a family ask to get a corner room!

Got to the hotel okay. Check in was fast (we were first off the bus). It was around 11am but our room was ready for us. The bell boy got us and drove us waaaaayyyy to the last door of the last building. We get in the room...its so dark and gloomy. No cushion on the couch, no lamp shades on the lamps, no pot in the coffee maker. It gets worse...we look out onto the balcony....our view is of a service road and some bushes. It does not feel like a vacation if u arent at least overlooking the pool or something. Its been a long day my boyfriend goes to use the washroom and have a shower before we go back to the desk. The toilet doesnt work well at all, you flush it with a string and it will take 2-3 times to get everything down. The shower had no cold water coming out, so he had A HOT shower.", "title": "First vacation, wonderful experience, March 22-29 2010", "user": "Canuck-kayaker", "date": "April 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 60215648}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled with family", "text": "So we walk to front desk...its not super long walk but enough to irritate you. They arent busy. We look at the girl and tell her whats wrong. This girl was not interested at all. Im thinking they get these complaints all the time cause you could just see her face change instantly. She say I cant do anything come back tommorow. Luckily the girl who actually checked us in walked over and asked what was going on. I dont know if she is newer or just happier but thank god for her. She right away started looking at the sheets and got on the phone. She comes back and says that a room in the main building has just been vacated, its ocean view but it is consided an upgrade which will cost us and extra 100 for the week....well worth it! She let us go up and look at it (the maid hadnt cleaned it yet) it was 10 times better. We took it. I swear if I had to have stayed in that other room the whole week I would have been so depressed. So heres my first tip. Just pay a bit more and book ocean view and request the main building. Save yourself the pain. We gave that girl 10 bucks and she was so happy.

Warning...if u bring ketchup, hide it after you use it. A fellow vacationer nearly squeezed half the ketchup out for her kids. There were no people getting sick that I heard of. Be careful of the snack bar, they serve hambergers and hot dogs through out the day and sometimes it doesnt look to clean. The al acarte were okay.

The resort is only about 30 minutes from the airport and the drivers are great. Check in wasn't bad, it was about 2am when we got there. There is a bar in the reception area but it is never open, which is too bad because a welcome drink would have been nice. The resort is too big, luckily bellhops are usually available to drive you and your luggage to your room, make sure you've got a couple bucks to tip. The first room we had was huge and about a kilometre away from reception. No drawers in the room so you will be living out of your suitcase. There were no lights in the hallways where our room was so we blindly made it back to reception to switch rooms, we wanted to be a little more central.

The balcony was terrific for relaxing. The buffet was great with lots of selection. They had a problem acquiring wine while we were there, so you never knew when you were going to get any. I bought some wine at the local plaza ($5) and the servers at the buffet bent over backwards for me to open it and put it in a cooler with ice at our table. Sometimes, the service was lacking though. For breakfast they were slow at coming around with the coffee, utensils, etc. We tried all 3 of the restaurants and as mentioned before the Italian is the only one worth booking.

Tip, if you love garlic with your pasta tip the guy there and he will give you real garlic rather than garlic powder!! Service at the bars (main pool bar & the beach bar and the pool bar near the a la carte restaurants was not that good.

There is a poolbar that way with a beautiful view of the ocean, breathtaking view I might add. And the bartender there is awesome!! Tip him the first day and he will bring drinks to your chair!!
