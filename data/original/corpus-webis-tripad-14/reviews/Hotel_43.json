Everything from a decor standpoint is brand new and very nicely done. However the ergonomics and space issues throughout the hotel keep this property from soaring to heights previously unavailable in Boise. The first time you notice the tight quarters is when you step off the elevator. We stayed on 6. Come off the elevator and the hallway is so tight, you cannot walk two people pulling roll-away bags down the hall without bumping into each other. Next, the rooms are very small - no more than 300 square feet. Again, nicely decorated, modern furnishings, the bed was comfortable, and HVAC worked well. The room was clean and tidy. wireless interent access was however unavailable - which is unforgiveable for a new property. But - by far - the most confining part of the hotel stay was the impossibly small bathroom. I could not use the toliet without the door striking my knees. It's impossible to step out of the tub without closing the bathroom door. My wife and I felt like we were stationed on a submarine in that bathroom. The shower head in the bath tub was mounted at chest height - I'm 5'9 - not that tall -so to get my head wet I had to duck down. We really had higher expectations, and recieved a fair nightly rate, but this one is not for the claustraphobic. At this point - it's too late to fix these issues, they would have to remove walls and completely redo the space. It's a shame, it's really a nice place, great downtown location but comes up short on space.", "title": "Disappointing", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "BusiestBizTraveler", "date": "September 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 8737149}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled on business", "text": "I've stayed at the Grove, but no more.
