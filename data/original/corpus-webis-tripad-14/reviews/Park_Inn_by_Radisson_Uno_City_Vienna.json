A coffee making facility is provided in the room so as an ironing facility. The view from our room is nice overlooking UNO City.

The U-Bahn stop callled Kaisermuhlen VIC is just 6 stops from the strict centre called Stephansplatz and takes less than 10 minutes. You needn't worry about the transportation as the U-Bahn is always on time and is simple yet works impeccable. The hotel offers a nice lounge at the entrance with free coffee and biscuits, following is the breakfast room. Rooms are pleasant and big enough, offering also a mini fridge, tea kettle and even an ironing board with an iron. Bathrooms are standard. Cleaning staff is quite early with cleaning but they do a great job every time. The only thing in the room I didn't like were the pillows which were too soft and the sound isolation of rooms could be better. The best thing about this hotel is the amazing breakfast. It starts at 6.30 on working days and you can get pretty much everything your heart desires-from croissants, various types of bread, cereals, salads, yoghurts, jams, fruit, juices, teas, eggs, beans, cheeses. The staff is always at hand and ready to help.

The staff was friendly and helpful with directions etc. Very close to the underground and convenient to the autobahn. Room was clean and spacious. Another pro is the free parking. On the Cons side is the towels and bed linens that look and are quite worn. The pillows were terrible. Had to use the down comforter as a pillow. The room was too warm for a comforter so I removed the duvet cover to use as a light cover on its own but on the last night of our stay the cover was taken away and not replaced. Should have called housekeeping to ask for one but it was very late.
