Service was excellent throughout and facilities were superb. Whilst a bit of an eyesore from the outside, it is great within. This is my favourite area of town and I have now found a hotel I enjoy staying in. It is closing in July for a year for refurbishment, although I can't see what really needs to be done. Pool small but does the job and never had a problem finding a bed. Gym excellent and quiet. Club Lounge too popular, perhaps. One day, I couldn't find a table so paid for drinks at the pub instead - hardly a working atmosphere, sadly! One but if advice - please make sure keys are extended to allow for late check out when offered and agreed. It is not fun having to go down from the 7th floor, and to reception to ask for a new key whilst wearing a sweaty gym kit in front of business people and a wedding party! A minor pet hate of mine.

However , we had a wonderful stay at this hotel. We are SPG members so we stayed on the SPG floor. We had great views of the creek and all its activity especially the dinner boats which were are lit up at night much the same as one finds in Shanghai. The hotel had a lovely pool and restaurant overlooking the Creek where one could sit in or outside. It is the perfect location to tour Dubai. The Creek taxi's and Abras are nearby as is the very clean and modern metro line to take you anywhere else in Dubai, and yes, you can easily and quickly walk to all of them. We arrived very early (around 6:00am) and at first we were told that we had to pay approx. one hundred dollars extra to check in before 9:00 or 10:00am even though our room was ready, however that was quickly reversed and we were shown to our very lovely room, which was clean, inviting with great views. Bottled water is complimentary and one has coffee and tea service facilitates in the room. The Bathroom area was marble and wonderful with a bidet and a not often found amenity at even the best hotels, great make-up lights and mirror. The staff was terrific and aim to please. Being our first visit to Dubai, we debated long and hard as to staying on the beach or the creek area. If you are going to Dubai for a relaxing beach vacation you may want to make another choice but if you are going to tour Dubai we can't think of a better location. It is a plus that the hotel itself was great.
