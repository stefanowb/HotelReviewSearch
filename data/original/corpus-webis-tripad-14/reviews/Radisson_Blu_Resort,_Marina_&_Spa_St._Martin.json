At this time we also met Alain Alidor, the concierge, who became invaluable in recommending restaurants and activities around the resort. While checking in we finally met face to face with Ingrid Mathurin, the reservations manager who was extremely patient and helpful to us when we were making our reservations. She ensured everything was perfect and exceeded our expectations. She is truly a very warm and cordial person. On our second day we met Jean-marc Jalbert, the General Manager. He was a poised, gracious host, who we believe really cares about his guests, his people and his property and takes great pride in the Radisson Blu's success. While we were enjoying the infinity pool, we befriended Patricio, who made delicious drinks and served them with a flair. All of the staff was outstanding and a pleasure to deal with. The grounds are breathtakng, the beach calm and relaxing and our Marina Suite was beautiful and immaculate. We enjoyed our daily breakfast at Le Marche and dined once at C Le Restaurant. We also dined at Le Calypso (across the street) which was also very good. We went to Grand Case and dined at L'Auberge Gourmande (Maggie is a sweetheart), Le Pressoir and also went to Sandy Ground to dine at Le Santal. All of these restaurants exceeded our expectations and in our opinion were outstanding!!! Albert was our taxi driver and he was absolutely wonderful.
