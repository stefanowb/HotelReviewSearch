The expansion of Taunton during the 1970's led to new housing being built on the former farmland. The farmhouse, with its secluded garden, small orchard, and stone barn was left intact. As a result, Yallands has become an unexpected 'oasis' of peace and tranquility within a modern corner of Somerset's county town. Yallands offers Visit England 4 star accommodation in Taunton, Somerset. The house is situated 1\u00bd miles from Taunton town centre, on the north-western edge of the town, and is easily reached from the M5 motorway - junction 25 (4 miles), and junction 26 (6 miles). For those who are reliant on public transport a local bus, with a stop at the foot of the garden, provides a frequent daytime service to and from the town centre. The lovely town centre provides excellent shopping and county cricket, horse racing, golf, theatre and other leisure facilities are all available nearby. Taunton has a good selection of restaurants and wine bars to suit most tastes and the surrounding countryside offers many delightful pubs which serve excellent food. There is ample car parking space in the private grounds together with lockable cycle storage in the stables. Why not enjoy relaxing in our gardens in the summer or sitting in front of our open fire in those cold winter months? Yallands is open all year round and - whether you are a tourist or a business visitor - you can be assured of a warm welcome and our individual attention.***We are now able to offer evening meals. Please see menu tab on the left of the screen - 24 hours' advance notice is usually required.***Yallands is particularly convenient for Taunton School, The Somerset Heritage Centre & Nuffield Hospital."}
