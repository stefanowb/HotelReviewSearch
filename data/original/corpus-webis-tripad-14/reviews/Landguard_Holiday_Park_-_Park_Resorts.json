However, it was not particularly clean when we arrived which was odd as we arrived at 1pm for a 1.30pm check in and we were told to come back at the correct time because they hadn't finished cleaning it! The shop assistant was very friendly and helpful. The swimming pool was very quiet but it was low season. We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning which was ok but the chef was also waiting and operating the till and there didn't seem to be a lot of hand washing going on! We have a small baby and so we didn't experience the evening entertainment and therefore can't comment on it. One last complaint - the parking spaces are nowhere near big enough!
