We have stayed in some very nice B&B's and they have nothing on The Chance. Sally has taken every possible step to make sure everything you need, every convenience you may want and every question you have will be satisfied and answered. There are little touches Sally has added to these rooms that make you shake your head as you come across them, wondering how she thought of it. As I told her on several occasions during our stay, she could make a fortune in the United States with a bed and breakfast. She understands what people need or want from a B&B and provides it without hesitation and with the kind of friendliness that is not always found. Her welcome is more than friendly and her breakfasts are incredible. Her knowledge of the area is like a history lesson. She asks your plans for the day each morning and her suggestions are always right on. She welcomes you each evening, asking how your day has been and is genuinely interested in your thoughts and experiences. She seems to really enjoy sharing her home with you. At the end of the day, what more can you ask for. Chipping Campden is a beautiful village to explore The Cotswolds and The Chance is more than you can ask for.
