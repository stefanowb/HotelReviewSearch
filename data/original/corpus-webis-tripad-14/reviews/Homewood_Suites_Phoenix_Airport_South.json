Although this hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport and the planes can indeed be seen out the window of your room, there is NO noise from the planes. We stayed in a very spacious and sparkling clean 2 bedroom, 2 full bath suite, which included a living room and kitchenette. It was very comfortable for a family of 4 with two teenage boys. And you can't beat 3 tv's! We stayed for 7 days and appreciated the full-size refrigerator, microwave, stove, dishes, glassware, silverware and dishwasher. The pool area with a hot tub was very clean and quiet. And the free continental breakfast and free internet were much appreciated. This will definitely be our home away from home when we are out visiting our son in college!", "title": "Excellent choice!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "finerthings2", "date": "September 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 79162833}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I frequently stay at Homewood Suites for business. I've had some mediocre experiences and some very good ones. This particular one was not up to par with some of the others. The facilities and rooms are clean, and the rooms quiet...no complaints there. Mostly minor stuff. Iron was missing from room. Only one TV remote, but it did control both TVs, so just a minor annoyance in having to carry it back and forth between the room and living area. No wine or beer in the evening reception (they say they are \"close\" to getting their license). They have a TV in the reception area, but might as well not as their \"mood music\" drowns it out. As a Silver Hilton Honors member (not very high up, I know), it still miffed me that they wouldn't allow me a late checkout (8pm) even though I offered to pay half the daily rate. The hotel wasn't packed out, so it doesn't make much business sense to let a room go vacant when you could at least realize a partial payment AND satisfy a loyal customer.", "title": "Okay, but could use some attention.", "user": "TomT_9", "date": "August 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 74039143}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I think with a little more attention to the little things, this facility could be one of the better ones, but if I was going back again in the near future I might try a different Homewood.", "title": "A great place to stay - highly recommended!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CarolEPBayarea_CA", "date": "August 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 73673284}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I rated this place 29 out of 30 points possible even though there was a slight, irritating snag at the beginning - they aren't listed on the hotel shuttle numbers at the airport, for one thing, and for another, when I called another Phx area Homewood Suite and they tried to connect me, we did this three times and they never answered the phone! When I got there (after taking a taxi - note: taking any taxi from the airport is a minimum charge of $16.00, no matter how short a distance you're going - the cabbie said it was legislation, see the sticker on the window...) the guy at the desk said he'd tried to answer the phone but there was nobody at the other end. Phone problems, I guess. Still, I rated them very highly because the room was very comfortable, very clean, and very nice - little well-equipped kitchen, pretty furnishings, and lovely comfy bed. They have FREE internet access in the business center (I hate lugging a laptop with me) and those good free Homewood Suites breakfasts with actually good coffee and decent eggs and other real breakfast stuff...almost anything you could want. M-Th they have a happy hour with pretty good (especially for free) food and offer wine. Staff were outstanding - everyone, the housekeeping staff, the driver of the shuttle, the people who tend the meals - everyone! Helpful, personable, accommodating. They have the little convenience store there and I went to buy deodorant because I'd forgotten mine - the woman at the desk stopped me and handed me a complimentary one instead! They have a great, if small, but very well equipped gym, and a lovely pool and spa - actually big enough for more than 4-5 people at a time and shaped so you could snuggle with your sweetie and still be somewhat private from the other snuggling couples...and they pipe in nice music. They even have a laundry room where you can do yours. Little touches like fresh fruit at the front desk instead of those under-baked kinda icky-sweet cookies they have at other hotels.", "title": "Five Star Experience at the Homewood Suites PHX", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Pokymike", "date": "December 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 50543034}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled with family", "text": "The only point off I gave them was location - and that only because it's kind of an industrial/business area, not much of any place to walk to in the evening or mornings.
