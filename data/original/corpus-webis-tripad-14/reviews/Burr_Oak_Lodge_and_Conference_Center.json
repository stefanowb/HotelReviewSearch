We had a two room King patio suite and were very satisfied with the accommodations. The bed was extremely comfortable, there was nice furniture in the sitting area and there was two new flat screen TVs. The work at the resort is still in progress and we were disappointed that the mini-golf was not completed yet. We did not use the indoor pool but it looked very nice. The dining room in the lodge has a decent but limited menu selection. They were out of several items on the second night making the choices even smaller (this is an important point because of its remote location; there are no alternate dining spots just \u201cdown the road\u201d). We found the resort and dining room staff very friendly and accommodating. They even let us tour one of the cabins for future reference. The location is very peaceful and scenic.

The meals and service was very good and their prices were reasonable. As I mentioned, the guest rooms were clean. Some of the other areas could have been better.

While this state park lodge (and cabins) are off the beaten path and accessed by picturesque country roads, it is worth the drive from campus. Very well run lodge, restaurant, bar, gift shop, front desk, etc. Clean, efficient, staff is very friendly and accommodating. The Saturday ight we checked in they offered live entertainment (two acoustic guitar players, excellent players, some original, some covers). A smattering of older couples, young families with little children were watching (and dancing to) the music and enjoying the main lodge room area (also second floor gameroom/balcony area). We observed the indoor pool area around 10 pm and it was quite an active place with a dozen or so middle school aged children. Also, pool and pool deck was very clean and well stocked with clean towels (although we skipped the pool, with so many children present). Earlier in the evening we opted for pizza delivery and were quite satisfied with our Little Italy pizza (although if you order pizza delivery, remember to ask for napkins and paper plates, we forgot to and I had hoped they'd include them since they knew we were in the lodge but they didn't. The bar hostess was kind enough to give me extra napkins). We booked our room which included breakfast for two in the morning and were very pleased with our meals. Delicious food, served promptly by a very friendly waitress. The view from the dining room is stunning. Finally, since I arise earlier than my college aged daughter (shocking I know), I ordered to-go coffee from the restaurant but they gave it to me for free. I of course generously tipped the hostess.

The cabins are running but I have not stayed there....yet. I will and let you know how that goes. Many rumors surround the question of why it closed. But whatever. The hiking trails have been cleaned up and marked. There are a lot of miles to be hiked there. Its not over hiked so you must pay attention to keep on the trail. Its important to have a map and compass in case you lose your way. If you have decent amount of hiking under your belt you will enjoy the continuous up and downs of the lake ridge trail. If you are feeling ambitious try the whole 22 mile loop for an all day workout. There was lots of people dropping their boats and quietly fishing. So its quiet but your never alone. Its beautiful and historical if you tend to see things that way. If you want perfectly marked trails that are so well beaten you will never lose your way then this place is most likely not for you. There are nice picnic areas and people seemed to be enjoying themselves with reading and fishing lake shore. We did see the park ranger two times so I would say they are keeping a good eye on whats going on. So bring your boat, your hiking boots and poles, your fishing stuff, your picnic lunch and a smile and you will enjoy. If you don't have those things better head on down the road.
