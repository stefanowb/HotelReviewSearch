We felt the enchantment of Taos the minute we arrived with a personal welcome note awaiting us. The room was large and spacious, with a kiva fireplace complete with logs and kindling for us to light. We went to sleep to a crackling fire every night and looked forward to a hot breakfast each morning. Meeting new guests each morning was a special bonus, as everyone sits down for breakfast at the same time to share a little of themselves. La Posada is a special B&B that shouldn't be missed.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Liz1953", "date": "February 26, 2005", "id": 3231686}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice Getaway", "text": "Nice little inn by the Plaza.
