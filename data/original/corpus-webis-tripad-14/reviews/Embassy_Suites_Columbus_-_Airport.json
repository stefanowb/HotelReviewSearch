I've always been a fan of Embass Suites, but I don't like the lobby of the new design. Breakfast didn't have enough seating, which was never a problem in the old atrium design. The new design just isn't as interesting as the old design. The room design is outstanding! Very comfortable bed, large flat screen tv's. No bathtubs which I enjoy, but nice bathroom. Only problem was I could hear my neighbors showering through the exhaust fan. It was very loud, as though they were showering in my room - obviously a mechanical or design flaw.
