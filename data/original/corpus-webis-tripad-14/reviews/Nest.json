The hosts, Sally and Marko, are wonderful; they're very social and knowledgeable, and they have mastered the perfect mix of being readily available and letting couples have their space. They provided plenty of information on things to do with recommendations for restaurants and activities along with brochures and maps. The house is amazing in a beautiful wooded area with a great game room, wonderful shared-space, and decks complete with a pool and hot tub perfect for star-gazing. While the private rooms are not suites, the accomodations were spacious enough and had everything we needed. We did not take advantage of their spa packages, but they have great studio space for a couples massage. Breakfast was fantastic every day. Also, don't let the presence of a dog, Tulo, scare you off if you are allergic to dogs; the dog is hypoallergenic, and while I was skeptical, my dog allergies were not bothered in the slightest by him even after spending time playing with him. Overall, we couldn't have picked a better B+B.

Design and decor were really special and the grounds/landscaping was really incredible. It was so quiet and peaceful. Our room was very spacious and clean and the bathroom with steam shower was such a wonderful amenity. We really enjoyed the game room and played pool, table tennis and the pinball machines into the wee hours of the night. The pool and hot tub were absolutely stunning and even though the owners live at the house, we felt we had plenty of privacy and seclusion the entire trip. We had a fantastic couples massage provided at the house by the local spa. The breakfasts were gourmet and they even accommodated my husband\u2019s favorite, banana chocolate chip pancakes for his birthday.

The rooms were super cozy, decorated extremely tastefully and very very comfortable. Extra surprises that really set this place apart were the wood burning stove in the kitchen and the steam shower (like a personal sauna!). And every morning the breakfast was really out of this world and extremely fresh and tasty. We went skiing at Shawnee and Marco got us a great deal with lift tickets. Nest was the perfect distance from Shawnee while still maintaining individuality and charm that the large commercial and touristy hotels and resorts do not have. Overall a great experience!
