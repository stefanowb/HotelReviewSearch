Valets also very helpful with driving directions. We had three rooms with river views, perfect for viewing the lights. We worked out at the sister hotel, the Watermark.

The location is still great, however the noise, need for major renovation and could care less attitude of the hotel staff made what could have been a very romantic 2 night anniversary weekend, for my husband and I, a huge disappointment. I called \"in-house\" reservations upon booking and told the woman we were celebrating a special weekend and wanted a \"quiet room on a high floor\" of the hotel. I booked a \"Riverview King\" for $329/night. Everything seemed OK at the time of booking and she was even going to put a \"little something special\" in our room. The little something turned out to be an $7-$8 bottle of champagne (which would have been appreciated, had the room been worth $329/night or $771.22 for 2 nights (with all the taxes). We received an e-mail prior to our arriving asking us to confirm our reservation with a time of arrival and credit card (which I did). We parked across the street in the parking garage to avoid the $24/nite valet parking fee. Our room was on the \"river side\" of the hotel, but the \"view\" was that of a huge tree...could barely see the river through the tree. The room was very dated, small and \"absolutely nothing special\". The door to our tiny, balcony would not secure (only had a lever that kept it from opening). The bathroom looked like it had been somewhat renovated, but certainly not clean. The tile grout was dirty and the pillow headrest on the tub was filthy! As far as being on a high floor (the 4th to be exact) that didn't happen. We were at the end of the fourth floor next to emergency exit & closet to a major street that serviced the SA bus line, garbage trucks, etc. Beginning at 4:30am we were awakened by the noise of buses and trucks, motorcycles (you name it). My husband asked for us to be moved to another room the next morning, but they offered us a room on the 5th floor (closer to the middle of the hotel), but located right next to the loud (very slow) elevator traffic and it had a small, dirty chair in the shower w/o a door, a dingy shower curtain and tile floor (it was a handicap bathroom made to roll a wheelchair in and out of). Not very romantic if you ask me! By the way, the girl at the desk said the hotel was only 60% occupied and they had no other rooms to move us to? The weekend took a no return downhill slide at this point, We had friends joining us the 2nd night, so we were obligated to stay at this hotel. Needless to say, the 2nd night (Friday night) we were kept awake by the noise and partying going on along the Riverwalk until 3am, then awakened again by the buses and trucks. Exhausted, we checked out at 8 am on Saturday morning and drove home.

The service was nearly flawless - the staff was polite and called you by name. We made reservations in the spa for the afternoon, and before hanging up I mentioned that we were going downstairs for breakfast. When we got to the restaurant, they made a note of our name. While eating, the spa had a cancellation and they were able to get us in earlier - and they called down to the restaurant and have the hostess track us down. I felt like the staff went above and beyond when it came to service. The spa across the river at the Watermark was decadent and tranquil (and extremely overpriced; my girlfriend and I loved every minute of it until the bill arrived). I would like to return to the spa, but it will be awhile before I can afford to do so. The only major issue was the parking at the hotel. You have the option of either valet parking at the hotel for $30 or self parking at the garage across the street for $15. We decided to be lazy and paid the extra money for valet. Saturday night we went to get our car to go to a concert and waited over 40 minutes for our car. It seems that when the hotel's garage is full, they park cars across the street in the other garage, and there was a bit of a traffic jam getting out of the garage. After 40 minutes, we opted to share a cab with a couple of other guests in the same situation and got to the show just as the opening notes were sounding. The hotel did take off one night's parking charge for the inconvenience. They also double-billed us at the spa, but we were able to fix that at checkout without a hassle.

We chose to stay at the La Mansion Del Rio because we got a good rate online. I had seen the property before and had always wanted to stay there. The location is great, directly on the river walk so we were very excited about that. Upon check in we were advised that there is a $50.00 a day charge for incidentals which we were not aware of prior to arriving. I know most hotels keep a card on file for things like this, however here at the La Mansion, you are billed automatically and refunded 7-10 days after you check out. This was not a problem for me, I was just surprised so I wanted to make others aware. We were given our room keys, we were in room 150 across from the main lobby in the other building. Now this room is directly behind the double door entrance and directly across from the elevator so we heard people coming and going all night long. The room was a nice size with two double beds and a flat screen tv. We noticed when we first went in the room was not cooling properly, we decided to turn the ac down lower while we went to dinner hoping it would cool off by the time we got back. We were gone for a few hours, when we returned the room was still hot and muggy. We noticed this in all of the hallways of the hotel as well. We decided to call it a night as we arrived late and were very exhausted. My husband did not sleep due to the heat and noise coming from the hallway all night. We contacted the front desk early the next morning to make them aware of the issues we were having with the room. At that point we were told that they would let the manager know to contact us as soon as he was out of a meeting. In the meantime they did send up a maintenance worker to check the ac in the room. Come to find out the filter needed to be changed, which he promptly did. We noticed a difference right away, but we were still not happy with the noise so we requested a new room. Taneeka, one of the front desk clerks advised they she would move us to a new room as soon as one was available because they were completely booked the night before they didn't have any rooms available right away. We were fine with that since we were leaving to get lunch anyway. Around 3:00 we were contacted by Taneeka again to let us know that our new room was ready. Tankeeka also offered to have a member of the staff move our things from the old room to the new one since we were out. She also gave us two complementary tickets the breakfast buffet for all of the inconvenience. I have to say that Tankeeka along with all the other front desk representatives were amazing to work with and went above and beyond trying to make our stay more comfortable. We really did appreciate that. Our second room was 405 with a pool view; it was clean, cool and quiet. We were very happy with this room and were able to enjoy our last night in San Antonio.
