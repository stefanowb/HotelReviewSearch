The previous visit was to celebrate a birthday and this visit was to celebrate our anniversary. On both visits we found special chocolate dessert plates waiting in our room with personalized welcome cards. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The \"lodge\" atmosphere fits perfectly with the location, which is lakeside in rural Georgia. We have dined at all the restaurants and found them to be nothing less than superb. The Linger Longer Steakhouse offers especially great steaks and don't miss the Godiva chocolate souffle. Gaby's by the lake offers large portions in a completely casual setting. Just sitting by the infinity pool looking out over the lake is hard to beat. The pool staff provided chair covers and towels, as well as delivering drinks and food poolside. You actually never have to leave your chair. My wife enjoyed the spa and said that everything was great from the facility to the treatment she received. I don't really golf or fish but both are widely available and this is a golf destination. Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the grounds and lake. There were no problems with the condition of the room and for all practical purposes it appeared to be in perfect shape. Prices are what is to be expected at a Ritz Carlton. The area around Lake Oconee is under development and there are a few new shopping centers with various restaurants. There is also a new movie theater nearby but we did not have a chance to visit it. If you just want to relax and stay on the grounds for meals, we found the Ritz Carlton Reynolds Plantation to be perfect. Sitting by the pool during the day, sitting by the lake during the evening, and the free smores by the fire pit at night was exactly the relaxation we were looking for.", "title": "Complete Relaxation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LexingtonTravelKY", "date": "July 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34470988}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our trip was a delayed honeymoon.

Speaking of Gabby's, the atmosphere is great. I love the rustic look. The servings are big. My husband and I could have split the turkey wrap. We also tried the nachos and homemade chips.

To do it again, we would have asked for a step more rare than usual. My theory is the steak cooks a bit more in the covered skillet during the travel from the kitchen to the lake.

First, this resort is supremely convenient to Atlanta and especially the ATL airport. Second, the setting is, no hyperbole, stunning. So close to such a major city yet tranquil and gorgeous: large lake, beautiful trees, meticulously groomed golf course, convenient services (Publix, etc.). Third, the resort is thoughtfully designed with a separate but convenient and completely equipped spa and fitness center plus indoor lap pool, and variety of dining options, including the creative Chiminea lakefront private option which is worth the $125++ per person price. Furnishings, amenities and service are typical Ritz-Carlton, and that is an accolade, are what drove us to choose this resort, and did not disappoint. Only constructive comment is that the outdoor pool f&b service could be a little more attentive. For all of this, the room rates available in July on ritzcarlton.com represent tremendous value.
