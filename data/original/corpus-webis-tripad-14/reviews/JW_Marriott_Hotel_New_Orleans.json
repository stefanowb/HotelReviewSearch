I'm giving the hotel 4 stars for service, but the room was very underwhelming. The bathroom was tiny and outdated. Didn't see a shower cap. On my first night, I kept hearing noises all night. At first, I thought I had very active neighbors, but I soon realized that no one is that active. It sounded like a mechanical noise coming from the ceiling. The club floor was right above me so perhaps a machine there was acting up. Regardless, after like no sleep, I called and they moved me to another room. I expect nothing less from Marriott. Plus, they gave me free breakfast. The room service menu said the hot chocolate came with whipped cream. But, all that arrived was a pot of hot water and a couple packets of powder hot chocolate. Rather lazy effort.

You fully expect a room that runs $175 per night to have a mini fridge. The office chair looked to be one from the 60's, not very comfortable and cushions made out of vinyl. The bathroom was a total disappointment. Very old and not taken care of. The spout on the tub was hanging on by a thread. There was very little water pressure coming out of the shower. May have been due to the leak at the junction between the two shower heads. The sink in the bathroom had hardly no room to place accessories. There at least should have been a shelving unit beside the sink to place a shaving kit, toothbrush, hair brush, etc. The wireless internet was not very reliable. Thankfully, I had a MiFi device that took care of internet needs. I have recommended to my company not to go back to this hotel for business travel. On the positive side, the bed was very comfortable and the HD TV received a good variety of HD channels.
