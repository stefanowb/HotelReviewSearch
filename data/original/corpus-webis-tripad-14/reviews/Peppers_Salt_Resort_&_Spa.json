We live on the Gold Coast and wanted to go somewhere close but feel like we'd gotten away from it all. The location at Salt Beach next to the fishing village of Kingscliff gave us that .. and whilst we thought we'd wander the village and generally do the things locals do, we ended up just staying at the resort instead. Our 1 bedroom apartment gave us enough space to relax, enjoy the wine we'd bought and the treats that were left for us in the room. The apartment and resort are well equipped .. free inhouse movies, free internet (not that we used that!), free bikes and tennis. Conclusion .. we loved it and next time will make sure we do a 3 or 4 night stay so we can enjoy Peppers AND Kingscliff.", "title": "Perfect for a relaxing or romantic weekend", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LittleBuddy8", "date": "April 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27217488}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect from Peppers @ Salt.

We got a great deal through the Peppers website for a 2bed with plunge pool that included breakfast for 4 and unlimited free movies and thought it was a great deal. The resort was lovely and new, the pool was great and the SAlt village had everything you needed. We hired bikes and went into Kingscliff which was an easy and pleasant ride. The breakfast was busy but really good variety and we tried the Italian restaurant in the village for dinner which was great. The pub was also lively and good value for money meals. Beach was beautiful too altho did see a little guy get attacked by some nasty blue bottle stingers which did not look pleasnat. All in all the perfect destination for an extended family weekend away.

I have experienced Peppers before and that is why I booked. This place drags the name down, it is more like a mid-range beach hotel than a boutique luxury spa. Actually those two words boutique and luxury have no place in this review!!! Upon arrival an older female on reception was extremely abrupt, curt and snappy with me. I shuddered at the amount of money I was to pay for my weekend only to be treated on arrival like a prisoner arriving at a state penetentiary. This terrible start was rescued by the well equipped suite room. These rooms are almost like a small 1 bedroomed apartment. There is a wc with shower and seperate bath, a kitchenette with microwave, toaster, kettle and stove hobs. There is a work desk where you can plug into the internet, this leads to the living area with tv, stereo and sliding doors to the balcony. The tv has a function where you can watch all the latest dvd releases but the general programming provides only basic channels and a poor quality signal. Our balcony had a nice view out towards the ocean. However well equipped the room was it was also dirty in equal measure. It appeared to not have been cleaned properly for a couple of weeks with dust everywhere, streaks all over the kitchen, a very dirty bathroom with dirt and dust in every crevice. So at this point I had been at Salt for 15 minutes, had been treated badly by an obnoxious women on reception and then been bouyed by the rooms facilities but disappointed again by it's dirtyness.", "title": "Dirty, over priced, extremely badly managed, not remotely 5 star.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "1doyler", "date": "May 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 29724989}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We accepted that the standard of cleanliness would not change from room to room and unpacked and went for a walk.

There is also coffee shops, a bottle shop and a bar. The bar lacks an atmosphere but is fine for a quick beer, they also have most sports you might be looking for on tv. The lifeguard patrolled beach is very clean and perfect for a dip, we found the water warm enough for a good long swim.
