The room was clean, more than big enough and the bathroom had a nice shower. Our room was directly above the lobby looking out onto Times Square. (room 1, second floor) Never thought in a million years we would get a view in Times Square (i filled out the notes section on the booking form asking for a view) Just shows if you don't ask, you don't get!!! All the staff were really friendly and helpful and the free breakfast was really good. Selection of pastries, juice & coffee. Can't fault the cleanliness, no funny smells and strangely we heard no real noise, even though we were above the bar and facing the street. The hotel itself is just on a small sidestreet of Times Square, this worked out perfectly. You can see all the crazy action from the the hotel doors but the throngs of people don't come down by the hotel itself. I was nervous about what i would find when i got to this hotel but i wasn't disappointed. It seems like crazy money compared to what you could get at home for the same cost but that's the reality with New York, you pay alot for something basic. I wouldn't bother paying more at a fancy hotel, as you are never in your room for more than showers & sleep.

We stayed in a superior room which wasn`t that small. There was enough room for both of us and our shopping and still feel very comfortable. The bed is quite small but then we are both tall, me being 5ft 10 and my boyfriend 6ft 3. The bathroom was really nice, fresh towels everyday and a great powerful shower. You also get complimentry internet access which was great as it meant I could e-mail photos to my family and keep them posted on what we were up to. The breakfast was a great statr to the day with mini danish pastries (my personal favourite), bagels, muffins, coffee and some of the nicest orange juice I`ve had. The staff are very helpful, they are there if you have a problem (which should be quite unlikely) or just to ask what to do and where to eat and drink. If your after a nice friendly hotel right on Times Square go here, you can`t go wrong!! Just one tip (especially to all you brits as I know we all like our shopping!) nothing is at face value in New York (including food and drink).

The heart of Times Square (i.e. centre of the universe) is literally only a 30 second walk away and the hotel is down a side street just off Times Square so you don\u2019t get any of the noise or bustle. As mentioned in other reviews there is a major subway station 20 seconds walk from the hotel which has all the main routes (N, Q, R, W, S, 1, 2, 3 & 7 lines). Turn right out of the hotel and Macy\u2019s is a direct 10 minute stroll down the street, and the Empire State is another 10 minutes on from this. Port Authority Bus Station is a 2 minute walk (maybe less) and from here you can catch buses direct to all the major airports \u2013 this costs $15 ($27 round trip) and buses leave/arrive every 20 minutes all day. I was going to get a taxi until I found out about this service \u2013 it is so reliable and cheap I\u2019d recommend you do this. The Rockerfeller Centre is nearby also (can\u2019t remember how far but I recall it is only about a 20 minute walk).

It is my understanding not to expect good views from any of the rooms and there is at least one room whose view is directly onto a brick wall just a few inches away! Bear in mind that all you will do in the room is sleep and change so this doesn\u2019t really matter. Our room was very clean with new sheets and towels every day. The cleaners seemed to spend at least 40 mins in each room. Air conditioning was excellent \u2013 the room was always nicely chilled. I found the room a good size with enough room to manoeuvre comfortably even with two cases and many bags of shopping on the floor (bear in mind there is no where in the room to stow away cases). There is a good sized digital safe. The bathroom was really nice and modern \u2013 all glass and white tiles with a huge mirror and good lighting. It was a good size, but there is only one small glass shelf for toiletries. A good TV and DVD player is in every room, and should you be bored there is a free DVD rental service available from the lobby. Our room was really quiet as we had no neighbours and the lobby was below. There is an iron and ironing board in every room, and the superior rooms each have a full sized fridge (left empty for your own drinks) \u2013 I don\u2019t know if standard rooms have this.
