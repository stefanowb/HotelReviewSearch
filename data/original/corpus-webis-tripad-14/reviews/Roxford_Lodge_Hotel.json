Location: it was not bad at all for getting to the Dublin city center, once you understand that you need to walk a good 20 minutes (we are both moderately fit and able to walk quickly and easily) or take a bus. This made dining something of a problem. There was no option to just step out of the hotel and find a place for dinner (except for the one pub around the corner) or even buy a bottle of water. Given how rainy a city Dublin can be, this really became a bother after the first day.

So, there is the added effect of an unwanted steam room. On the other hand, it looks like a bed and breakfast. Sadly, it lacks the helpfulness and charm of a friendly staff (with the exception of one lovely desk clerk) and has no hospitality to speak of.

Despite being told in advance that we could have breakfast even if we were not able to check in, we were rudely informed that he kitchen closed at \"half ten\" and the city center was a 15 minute walk. Not exactly the charming hospitality of some of the less expensive but more cordial B&Bs. So, what does the Roxford want to be? A luxury accommodation or a B&B? Now it fails at both.
