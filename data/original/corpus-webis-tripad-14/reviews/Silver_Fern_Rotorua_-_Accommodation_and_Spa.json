We had most of the interaction with Allan during our two day stay here. As we approached the place, we had mixed feelings. The property was just outside the main area. Property has not many rooms and they are doing a good job managing it. He was quite helpful in checking in as we approached. The room was quite spacious with spacious spa wash room. Bed and towels were best out of the hotels we stayed in NZ. We particularly liked the jacuzzi bath tub. He helped us in planning the two day trip quite well and we did as he suggested. Now i check we covered most of the places. He also provided us with discount coupon for Geysers which was quite close to this property.
