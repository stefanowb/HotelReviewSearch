The web site is rather old by deaign,but the place has been renovated recently. Very nice, clean rooms. Simple,but spiritly furnished. Location is on a quiet street in the middle of the old town Skiathos. Very nice bargain for the money. The only negative are the scooters running around all night. Take the room upstaira if possible, it is a bit bigger and quieter than the ones downstairs.", "title": "Excellent value for money.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Ilia T", "date": "September 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 80555566}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We hadn't a room with a view but it was very beautyful and great decorated!The stone wall,the mirrors and the hidden lights made it very romantic!It was located in a traditional small road and very close to the main road and to shops and restaurants!The cleaning was really good and the price very logical!It also has a small kichen and plates,forks ect!
