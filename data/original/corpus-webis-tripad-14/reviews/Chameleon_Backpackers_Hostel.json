The place is very well run, with comfortable rooms, decent internet and all the facilities that a traveller would need, as well as a fantastic kitchen. Only thing I would say is that the drains smell a bit in a couple of the downstairs rooms (Kudu and the ones either side). If they haven't fixed this, then ask for an upstairs room - the smell became a little bit opressive when we were there! Despite that, this a great place and very good value too.", "title": "Reliable choice in WIndhoek", "user": "Dom-n-Lin", "date": "September 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 43298352}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The backpacker place to stay in Windhoek without question", "text": "Really great place to stay.

Parking is a problem, so is directions to get there, in a city where the streets have been changed and staff cannot give directions over the phone. A pity also they employ rather incompetant front desk staff and that the female owner is rather unfriendly. A good backpackers to us need to have a good balance between clean, safe facilities and good, friendly staff. Making guests feel unwelcome and providing incorrect information is not a way to keep business. Untill this changes at Chameleons I would not recommend anyone to stay there. Getting hold of them by telephone also proved very difficult - we were told at arrival that we should have emailed them. This is Africa, the best place in the world to me, but a place where getting hold of reliable email is still difficult!! Come on, they should know that, you cannot run a business on email only. Especially if their own email does not even work well!! On our arrival several other guests were getting very irrated because the email at Chameleons was not working.
