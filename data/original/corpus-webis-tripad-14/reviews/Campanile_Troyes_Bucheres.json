Nothing has changed despite our optimism! The concrete stairs to the upper floor were cracked and the supports rusty and in one place almost eaten through. This time at least it was warm enough, but the restaurant is still not good. Campanile restaurants used to be good value for money but not now. My partner ordered a roast lamb dish and was dished up three large pieces of fat, reminiscent of pork belly without the meat! He complained and he got another three! In the end he asked for fish. When we paid the hotel bill the next day they tried to charge us for the fish as well! Breakfast had almost run out with 45 minutes to go before they closed and a request for more croissants was met with a surly \"Finit\"!!
