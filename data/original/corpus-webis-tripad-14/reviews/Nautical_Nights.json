I was getting discouraged trying to book any weekend in Sept or Oct then I was referred to Nautical Nights. After checking out the website we decided to have out first bed and breakfast experience here. We didn't really know what to expect from a B&B being that we usually always stay in large well-known hotels. The pictures and description on the website were right. We were only a few feet from Seneca Lake. The atmosphere was so nice and relaxing. Michelle and Tori greeted us and made us feel right at home. We stayed in the tiny bubbles room and enjoyed the jacuzzi and the view very much. The room was clean and neat. The breakfast was also very fresh and delicious. I just wish there was more of it. The other review was correct that it does get very bight from the sun in the morining, but we didn't mind because we were up in time for breakfast and ready to start our day. Also there is a steep dirt road leading to the B&B. We were glad we brought the SUV. There was also a computer with internet, canoe and chimena available. We enjoyed ourselves very much.", "title": "very nice B&B", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "steph44w", "date": "September 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8654984, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 great view", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the bungalow which is just off the deck from the main house and just a few feet from Seneca Lake.
