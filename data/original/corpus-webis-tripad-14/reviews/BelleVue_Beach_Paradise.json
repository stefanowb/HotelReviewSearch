The swimming pool was lovely temperature although some days when a lot of people were in and out u could see suncream around the edge! The beach is just down the steps from the pool and was very warm too almost as warm as the pool! The sand was beautiful and white just like u c in the brochures and never really expect to see when u arrive! The local 'plaza's' are great there is one called 'luxury avenue' it really is luxury with its inside water fAll effect walls and 100% genuine designer goods, but you will find the odd cheapy shop in there too. If you go to the further away plazas there is a big american type mall which is great! and also cheap! /we swam with dolphins which was the most amazing experiance ever and much cheaper thn we were imagined and had been told by friends! neway back to the hotel, the bedrooms are very comfortable no shower probs, lovely big towels, the room we had got 2 king size beds, we had a balcony looking over the beach which was so lovly especially when u have just woken up and open the curtains to what you would believe to be paradise!
