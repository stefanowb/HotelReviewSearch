We stayed at two 3 star hotels (this being one of them) and one 5 star hotel. This is the hotel we will be returning to on our next visit. Rationale: 1) SERVICE was excellent - Laurent welcomed us to Paris, helped give us an overview of the area, and he made us feel at home. 2) CLEAN - Our room was so well clean and updated as was the hotel. I think they are almost done with some renovations (there were some tarps in the lobby that led me to believe this). 3) LOCATION - the best jumping off point for all of Paris. 1.5 blocks from the river, 2 blocks to the Louvre, 6-7 minute walk to Notre Dame, 5 minutes to Latin Quarter, and 8 minute walk to the \"Soho\" of Paris (The Marais Area). We were on our honeymoon and this hotel was perfect for what we were looking for. The best way to decribe this hotel for us is a very nice Hampton Inn. They have the best in the basics (hairdryer, hot water, etc).", "title": "Excellent for Hotel Category", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ohiocouple", "date": "September 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 175442288}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I've been staying at the hotel Louvre Rivoli in Paris for about ten years now and on each occasion their have been improvements to either the rooms or the facilities. This year a new breakfast bar downstairs has greatly improved the early morning experience with a small child in tow. The reception area was also being re carpeted while we were there. The management seems to be constantly aware of the need to keep the hotel bright and fresh, it's almost unrecognisable from a decade ago.
