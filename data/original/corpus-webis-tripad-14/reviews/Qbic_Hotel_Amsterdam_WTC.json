Well needless to say I was told that check in at around 11pm would be no problem whatsoever. On trying to talk a cab driver into taking me to the WTC he adamantly wanted to tell me that there is no hotel in the compound and nevertheless proud me to an entrance to a very lifeless architectural structure. I rang a bell at 11.02pm, entered and the real story begins here. Finding the hotel in the empty, lifeless lobby-like structure is somewaht possible if you are brave enough to conquer a space that seems very empty and as if you are trespassing every step of the way. One can find the approximation of a reception though, eventually, I did around 11.10. It is all machines, very 2001, unfortunatedly the checkin machine was not working and I was refer to the clerk, who was nowhere to be seen. At around 11.15 I started to call the phone number on my reservation paper. I spoke to somebody in Maastricht who told me that the situation I was in would be impossible that I couldn't be all alone in that compound, yet: I was and after he was somewhat convinced of my desperate need for a bed and my right to have one due to the reservation numbers I gave to him, he gave me a telephone number to call. I did and was perplexed when the phone right next to me in the empty machinery scenery began to ring. I was so surpised to pick up....and hear myself on my cell. I called mastricht again, got another dose of disbelief and eventually a cell phone number. I called that number at around 11.30, wandering around in the empty modern wilderness, thinking about Jim Jarmush and Will Smith in I am Legend and thinking of hitting one of the sofas while waiting for someone to answer that cell phone. Well nobody did. It was Maastricht again, they told me to go back to start. 11.45. Now what do you do in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to go to. You think about your early flight out, 6.50 and how precious minutes of \"sleep\" are replaced by anxiety and amusement. And you swear that you will fire your secretary and tell everybody and their dog that Qbic is not a concept but a fraud. Obviously when thinking to oneself, one uses another kind of language, not advisable to rephrase those words here. So thoughts about home cross your mind, you look out of the windows into an outside that is as empty and desolated as the strange inside you have to share with...machines, nothing else, just things, ticking away. Ring, something like a elevatorbell from where the checkin machine was! You run back, and: a person welcomes you, sort of. Nice guy, you hate him immediatedly but he actually is so nice that you forgive him and go to the room taking the card from him and preparing yourself for what a hip hotel might be like.
