We went for a friends wedding and didn't get a choice of where to stay so we were a little doubtful after reading other peoples comments. The reviews we read said the food was bland and repetitive - Wrong. We experienced top rate food and a huge variety for all. Vegetarians and fish lovers were well catered for, but not so for big meat lovers. There was not much beef on the buffet, although one evening we did have steak with a choice of sauces. A section of the restaurant was reserved for children and looked just like a small nursery, with small tables and chairs. The children even had their own buffet consisting of nuggets, burgers, smily faces and chips!! What more can you ask for. Adults were treated to themed dining. Such as Greek food night, Italian night and of course traditional Cyprus food evening - all complete with entertainment from that country, ie. Greek dancing etc after dinner. Lunch was on a lovely terrace by the pool with views over the harbour. The chefs prepared the food infront of you and often replenished the buffet so all the food was fresh. The salad bar was well stocked and fresh friut was always available for those who didnt want much to eat. We never had any snacks as we eat 3 meals a day and that was enough! The bars were open 11 - 11 for all inclusive and you could buy drinks after 11pm. The staff were very nice and gave excellent service. Champagne was not included in the all inclusive. They gave bottles of it away as prizes. We won a bottle on the music quiz night.", "title": "Great stay with a wedding too!", "user": "Ant354", "date": "October 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143841457}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I went with my family to my sisters wedding within the hotel, on arrival we where greeted by the bell boy who was very helpful, We then checked in and was told if we needed anything not to hesitate in ringing the reception. When we where shown too our room which was a triple room consisting of 3 single beds I noticed there was only 1 pillow each. I rang reception and asked for 3 more which they brought them up straight away. We found everything in the room very clean, the maids came everyday to make the beds, clean the room ect nothing was to much trouble for them. We ate in the resturant 3 times a day, we where welcomed by the staff with open arms and by the end of the week they knew us well enough to put us in our regular seats. The selection of food changed daily there was always plenty of choice and always topped up.The pool was cleaned every morning, we had beach/pool towels in our rooms which we could take to the lesuire room to change if needed we could do this as many times as we needed.. The facilitys where amazing as where the staff always smartly dressed and willing to help.The childrens entertainment team was fantastic they made a real effort , by the end of the week they knew us by our first names as did we. There was entertainment through out the day if you wanted it but if you just wanted to chill by the pool that was fine too.The view from pool side over the beach was fab and only a few steps down to the beach. We had our hair and nails done in the on site beauty parlour the staff there where lovely nothing to much trouble they gave us glasses of champain when we had our treatments.The indoor pool and spa was also lovely it was a little cold when you first get in but fine after a few seconds. The on site shop sells most things but anything you cant find there is a shop just a few mins away. There is a bus stop right outside the shop taking you into town we personally didint leave the hotel only to go to the shop as it had everything we needed. My only little moan would be not enough toilets. They need some by the pool side and in the resturant as the toilets are down stairs yes there are lifts but when you have children toilets on all levels would be ideal. We had a fantastic time the wedding was amazing nothing was too much trouble its a beautiful setting and we cant wait to go back again in 2013/2014.", "title": "Perfect setting for a wedding or chill time!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cindy c", "date": "October 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 143773957}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "stayed at the golden coast for a week in october, everything was perfect cant find any fault with the entire holiday and hotel, very clean spacious lovely pool, grounds, private beach, food was plentyfull and good choices, we stayed all inclusive myself and boyfriend would recommend, excellent staff.", "title": "Great", "user": "jackthehat34", "date": "October 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143747815}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stay here every year.

Next to the cleaners store with a balcony overlooking a service yard we disliked it so much we enquired about an upgrade to be cursorily dismissed by the only unhelpful member of staff we met. Rest of the staff were lovely and worked very hard to keep guests happy. Only one wedding while we were there but we were told that in high season there can be 5 each day! The hotel was just opening for the season and we enjoyed not having to worry about claiming a sunbed or a bit of sand. Food was excellent - but occasionally let down by being lukewarm or cold. Otherwise variety and quality the best we have ever experienced in an all inclusive hotel. Swimming pool was cold but it was the first week. We were there as a couple but this would be a good choice for families - excellent animation team kept the children amused literally from morning till night.
