It was a first class hotel. Spotless in all areas with 5 pools to choose from. The food was the best I have experienced in a European hotel with buffet style meals. Always plenty of choice and it never ran out! The only thing i would mention is that it is favoured mainly by Spanish which did not bother myself or my daughter, but a younger family may have problems as the children are unlikely to find many other English children. We only had a couple of English families staying there when we were there. Evening entertainment was a bit hit and miss being mainly aimed at the Spanish audience. Need to brush up on your Spanish if you stay here. Would thoroughly recommend it for couples though. Great position opposite the beach and just a short walk to the Marina and Playa Blanca shops and restaurants along the lovely promenade.", "title": "Loved the Hesperia Playa Dorada", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Holby62", "date": "July 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8247020, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness and buffet style restaurants", "disliked": "\u2014 Predominatly Spanish staying at hotel"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "We had a junior suite for the stunning price of Euro 69 per night.

Hotel is in one of the best locations as it is about 8 minutes walk from the new Rubicon Marina - which has some nice restaurants and shops. A very peaceful way to spend a morning. They have a small market there on saturdays and wednesdays. There is another market near the centre which was basically africans selling bags and belts and where very pushy. The hotel was better than expected after reading some of the earlier reviews. We had room 119 which was on the outside and on the ground floor. We had a superb view of Playa and the port . The beach was clean and safe with a good beach bar that did snacks/drinks during the day and a nice place to have a drink/cocktail in the evening. The hotel restaurant was large and airey. Food was the same sort of thing you get in most spanish hotels. Could have done with something a bit spicier. It was a bit bland after a couple of days but ok. Breakfast had a good selection including freshly squeezed juices which were lovely. We sat outside for most of our meals. Pools were nice with plenty of sunbeds - could have done with a few more umbrellas. Pool was not heated but still ok to swim in. Mostly Spanish with a few Germans and English staying here. We booked through Expedia in May and got a good deal. We were'nt interested in the entertainment but it looked ok. All in all we enjoyed our stay as all we wanted was a relaxing holiday with walks along the prom, which went on for miles.

Rooms were a very good size, with separate toilet and bath rooms, and were cleaned every day. The balcony had a table and 2 chairs. Unfortunately no coffee maker or kettle which was greatly missed. The hotel is very nice - with a lovely bar, pools, nightly entertainment, gym (although you have to pay extra), and 2 restaurants. We chose full board, but I would recommend just getting B&B. The dinners were all buffet and we got tired of it after just 2 days. Plus everybody seemed to be in an incredible rush to get their food, like it was going to run out or something - a bit too pushy for me. The breakfasts were good, with a good selection of either hot or cold food. The food in the pool restaurant, The Papagayo, was excellent for lunch. The hotel is very close to the beach, and shops and restaurants in either direction along the promenade. There were a lot of German people staying -- mostly 60-70 age range, a few British, and some Spanish, and only a handful of children. The hotel is incredibly quiet - I didn't hear a thing at night. We had trouble being understood by the gym assistant who didn't speak any English, but the rest of the staff spoke at least some English. I would recommend taking your own towel for the beach and pool, otherwise you have to rent one, which I think was 2 Euros a day.", "title": "Amazing!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Xtina079", "date": "November 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10697477, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, breakfasts, pools, cocktails...", "disliked": "\u2014 I put on about 90 stone!!!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend for a second time this July.
