Not only was wifi outrageous, but the room and drinks were ridiculous- 200 dirhams for a rhum and coke! As well, when we left, they charged us some thing called promotional taxes 99 dirhams a night- when I asked what it was- they said it was a city tax. This is totally untrue as the city tax is 5 dirhams per night. They basically added $15 a night to our room. Avoid this place at all costs.

To begin, the rooms were hot - 80 degrees F while it was low 60s F outside. Turning the room fan on produced noise but no discernible air movement and certainly no temperature reduction. The somewhat complex room thermostat clearly didn't work. Opening the window -- barely, due to a safety lock - you enjoy the diesel fumes, traffic sounds, and the constant car horns of Casablanca, but the room did begin to cool- but only a few degrees. The bed is modestly comfortable, with a mattress with a few lumps and bumps, along with very thick and very hard pillows that leave your head elevated well above your body and with difficulty in finding any comfortable position.", "user": "Larry L", "date": "December 5, 2012", "id": 146814018}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good hotel with excellent service", "text": "The real horror story was the bathroom ( see pictures).
