The snow storm we witnessed that weekend was very interesting to see from that viewpoint. The hotel is right on I-95 with easy access to New Jersey & Center City Philadelphia. Minutes south of the hotel by car you'll see a Target, a Walmart, United Artist movie theater and many other national chain stores. Fast food outlets and WAWA are not far away.

The hotel is poorly located away from the city (which does give most rooms good views) but it is about a 10 minute walk to shops and restaurants and you have to cross a very busy 4-lane road to get to anything. The rooms are stylish and modern and the furniture is comfortable, but the rooms are not well maintained (stains on ceiling, damage on walls, mold in bathroom). All of the rooms are sprayed with fragrance which is overwhelming if they have just been cleaned; I nearly vomited when I opened the door to my room and had to move to another room, which was better but the odor was still very noticeable. I will stick to Starwood hotels in the future, their rates are more reasonable and generally a better value.
