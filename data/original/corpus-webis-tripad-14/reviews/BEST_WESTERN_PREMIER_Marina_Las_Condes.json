Rarely have I ever experienced a hotel restaurant this bad. Although breakfast was included in my rate, it was usually inedible or allowed to run so low that food wasn't available. One morning, I had to scrape a hard crust of scrambled eggs from the bottom of the chafing dish, while most other mornings, the scrambled eggs resembled a yellow soupy mess with small clumps floating around in it. On more than one occasion, I bypassed the soupy eggs to get cereal, only to find that the milk dispenser was empty. It was usually difficult to find a place to sit, not because the restaurant was crowded, but because all of the tables were dirty from previous diners. I tried dinner a couple of times and left most of the food on my plate, since it was just that bad. For a good meal, I would recommend Chilenazo, a barbeque restaurant that is about a ten minute walk from the hotel.", "title": "Sparkling, contemporary hotel... very nice choice for quieter area in Santiago", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AP_Phoenix", "date": "October 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 84362033}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here for a week for a large number of colleagues.
