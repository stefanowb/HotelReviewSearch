But this is a near waterfront location in a delightful little town - home of the famous Rock - so expect it to be both full and expensive during peak season. The service is friendly with welcome cookies sometimes and coffee in the lobby. It has a restaurant - not sure why as there are five restaurants within a five minute walk. The bar is intimate with live music on the Friday we were there and decent food. Rooms are large and some have glimpses of the sea although the property is set back a way from the ocean front. It has a pool and fitness centre.
