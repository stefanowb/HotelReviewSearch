You feel relaxed and cared for the moment you walk on to the property. Larry, one of the owners, goes out of his way, as does everyone else to ensure that your stay is a relaxing one. The rooms are more than clean and comfortable. Each room has complementary snacks and a fridge with various beverages. Larry made sure we had everything we needed, introduced us to other guests and made himself more than available should we require anything at all. There are bicycles on the property should you choose to use one. There are fresh pastries and newspapers each morning. There is a firepit that you can sit around in evenings and look up at the stars. The rooms surround a beautiful pool and incredible landscaping.

We didn't take advantage of the kitchenettes but it was nice to have cold beverages waiting in the fridge for you when you got back to your room after chillin in the pool with the other guests (that all become your friends by the end of your visit). Judy and Larry rock! Judy helped plan my weekend since I was surprising my bf, Loran, for his bday. She made dinner reservations for us, scheduled a couples massage (which was heavenly) and even picked up a cake for me. Michael (the limo driver) took us out and brought us home each night. The limo definitely added an old skool palm springs vibe to the night. We loved the fire pit, beautiful grounds, the free movies (what a fun collection of movies...all my favorites), the tasty brewskis and the amazing company we had. The atmosphere is so comfortable and relaxing that it was tough leaving the place to explore the area. We were too lazy to take a ride on the bikes that they had available to borrow but we'll make sure to next time. Couples, friends or staying solo...all will enjoy the Desert Riviera.

It is exactly what you read - immaculate, funky, beautiful, and unique. So instead I'll tell you what the staff did for us. My husband and I arrived in a rented vintage volkswagon camper van, that had started stalling from Joshua Tree to Palm Springs. It was a hot day, our nerves were thin due to the stalling, and when we finally puttered up the Desert Riviera, we were immediately welcomed by Larry with a cold beer for my husband, which he so needed. Long story short, we planned on staying just one night before heading to San Clemente, but between the car problems, coupled with the fact we simply could not bring ourselves to leave this gem, we decided to stay two nights. We lounged by the pool, enjoyed the mountain views, we took the cruiser bikes out for a self guided architecture tour, and we slept in in the luxurious bed. Judy and Bob were delightful, and it was really fun to take the limo to dinner in town, and not worry about drinking and driving.
