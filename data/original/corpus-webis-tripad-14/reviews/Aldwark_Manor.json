The hotel is situated in the wonderful countryside far from any busy roads and is therefore fabulously quiet. Check-in was simple and our room was excellent, in a newer extension and right at the top (there is a lift), the window was a velux and so to appreciate the view we had to balance on the sofa but it was well worth it! The room was clean and spacious and the beds were beautifully soft and comfortable, there was a supply of up to date magazines and a small selection of toiletries. The spa area is great, lovely pool etc, there was a shortage of lockers though and only 2 hairdryers which were always in use. The inclusive lunch was a buffet, we were offered soup, a hot pasta dish, a lasagne and jacket potatoes with salad, for dessert it was a fresh fruit salad. The evening meal was excellent, we had an inclusive deal so the set menu was perfect, lots of choice and really good VFM, the a la carte also looked brilliant though quite pricey. The staff were very efficient and attentive and we had a most enjoyable evening. The following mornings breakfast service was \"interesting\", a group of young girls came down in their dressing gowns and pyjamas which raised a few eyebrows and I would question the management allowing them to do so in a 4* hotel. Also the cooked breakfasts were served so promptly that we had barely finished eating our cereal and the bowls hadn't even been cleared when the young man arrived with our plates of hot food, we observed this happening to most of the other diners, some having not even finished their cereals and so having to do so from the side of the table...bit of a timing issue here!?

Although it is spacious and has a view of the golf course, the furniture is scratched to pieces, worn and tatty, the furniture is ready to collapse, is dirty and the bathroom is older than my grandparents which was installed in the 70's. When you pay \u00a3150 per night you really expect better than this. This room was supposed to be superior and did have a four poster bed but a very tatty one, on dirty worn out carpet and you just didn't feel comfortable at all. The room hasnt been updated since the 80's, maybe earlier. People have talked about upgrading going on but we saw no signs of this. The room had no mini bar, no fridge, no water, no ice bucket and basic tea/coffee. I heard reports about a refurbished wing with contemporary rooms but it seems that you take your chance here and without any discount on the old run down rooms which is not fair. The shower had no pressure and temperature was impossible to control. The bath was tiny and so old fashioned (pale pink) that we didn't want to use it. The tv does not show sky channels yet the bars downstairs do. A cheeky way of getting guests out of their rooms when sport on tv and into the bar area and buying drinks.", "title": "Poor room standard", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TOGETHER_WE_TRAVEL35", "date": "March 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 99119098}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room service menu is small and triple decker sandwiches come as single decker and are average.", "title": "Fab setting but the hotel is tired", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "traceashley", "date": "March 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 99106961}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "The spa was very nice and relaxing.

We couldn't get near the jacuzzi for ages as it was full of women and when we did we found the water cold. The sauna and steam room are nice and so is the pool but be careful to make sure you choose the adults only pool times if you want piece and quiet. On a weekend they have periods every now and then where parents arrive with children and that can be a distraction. I have to mention that the mens changing facilities are very poor indeed.

The challenging course is set amidst gorgeous rolling hills. This hotel is a real mix of old and new. With 54 individually designed bedrooms which are split between the modern contemporary wing of the hotel and the traditional Manor house. If you are staying on business then the hotel has 6 conference and meeting rooms for up to 240 people. What's more the superb grounds covering 100 acres are ideal for team building events.
