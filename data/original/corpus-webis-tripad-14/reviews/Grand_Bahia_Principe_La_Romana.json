The rooms were very tidy and well equipped. Like I said I take a bit of time to adjust so I was up the first morning at about 5am so the coffee machine and dressing gown came in handy while sitting on the balcony watching dawn break. There was a noise at about 6.20 ish every morning that sounded like a chain saw, could not not hear it in the room but very loud while on the balcony. It was not until about day 4 I realised it was hotel groundsmen spraying the bushes to try and reduce the mosquitos. Then the water sprayers would turn on and more groundsmen would appear to tidy the green areas with the pool staff in the background cleaning the pool.
