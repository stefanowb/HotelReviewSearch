Our room was very comfortable with two double beds, tv and shower room. Only little thing it would have been nice to have coffee making facilities in the room. We were located in italian quarter so lots of great italian restaurants. Not far from china town either which is worth a wonder. We found a fantastic cafe for breakfast called pats cafe it has a bright yellow front. and is located in taylor street. Found it on our first morning we were jet lagged and starving, food and service were excellent and the coffee kept comming! Kept us going till the evening! Not far to pier 39 but we recommend going in the morning its quiet but a little tacky and go and see Alcatraz its brilliant book tickets before you go we went 9am boat and its quieter.
