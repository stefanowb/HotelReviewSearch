Both rooms were upgraded to a Club Room with jacuzzi jets in our bath tubs. However, not many people must use these rooms. After our first night, we woke up to no power at all in our room. No lights, no heat. After a call to the front desk, it appeared to be fixed, but then the power was off again for a short period of time before power was finally restored. The 2nd room had no hot water. We were in a hurry to catch a flight at the airport and this did not start our day off right. After waking up the 2nd day, both rooms did not have hot water. They sent in a technician into our rooms and fixed the problem. Before I went to bed, I set the thermostat for 23 degrees celsius when it was currently at 19. I woke up to the thermostat reading 17 degrees. Another technician was sent into the room to fix the problem. One of our phones was not working and they had to replace the phone. All of this for a supposedly \"5 star hotel\". I've done a good amount of travelling and I've never had to have a technician have to come into my room ever to fix something. Basic things like power, heat, and hot water should have been tested out and fixed prior, especially since they were club rooms at a 5 star hotel. We were not given any consolation for our experiences, only an apology from the manager on duty. Despite all of these issues, the food at the restaurant was good, the service was very good as the staff tried their hardest to keep us happy, and the pick up and drop-off at the airport was fairly smooth. I would recommend going to one of the chain hotels like Hyatt, Radisson, or Intercontinental instead.
