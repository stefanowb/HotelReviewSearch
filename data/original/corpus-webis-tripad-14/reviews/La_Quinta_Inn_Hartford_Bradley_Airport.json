Early on, around 3 years ago, I sampled some of the other hotels in Windsor Locks and it was terrible (except for one very expensive one in Avon.) For a mid-priced hotel, LQ cannot be beat and the shuttle is reliable and the staff very friendly. Some of the staff have virtually watched my daughter grow up from an infant barely over 1 year old to an almost 5 year old now! She thinks of LQ in Windsor Locks as \"Daddy's big house\".
