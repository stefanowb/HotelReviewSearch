The bed was very comfy and we were delighted to find it was a Temperpedic (memory foam) bed, which is what we have at home. We spent two nights at the Inn at the Market before a cruise to Alaska and one night upon our return. Literally every staff member made sure to mention that all staff were trained to help with conceirge duties and they were all very helpful to help us find our way around, providing maps and bus information. We ate breakfast across the street in the market, where you are really hardpressed to not find a large variety of food. The other morning we had pastry and coffee in a french pastry shop just down the street. We picked up great fruit to snack on in our room. We ate at Etta's one night and had delicious fresh oysters, halibut and fabulous coconut creme pie for dessert. One night we selected a variety of cheeses, crab, bread, olives, berries, peaches and things from various shops in the market. We bought some wine from Cost Plus, just down the street and had a little picnic up on the 5th floor deck. It was great! Gosh, we just had a great time and the situation of the hotel made it perfect for a nap before dinner and stopping back in to drop off packages. We were greeted each time we came and left by the very friendly staff. The staff called for cabs for us when we needed to get to far away destinations. They were wonderful!! So, a nice clean room, comfy bed, great bathroom, perfect location, great garden deck to watch the bustling crowd below. They have coffee/tea in the lobby....as much as a person could possibly want!

So...if you are looking for convenience, great staff, nice hotel...not cookie cutter...this is the place. I am surprised to read some of the less than favorable reviews. Perhaps these will make it easier for folks like me to get reservations. I spoke with a number of people up on the 5th floor deck who always stay at the Inn and know that a reservation well in advance is necessary. It seemed the saavy travelers enjoyed this facility.

The related restaurants, including not only Campagne but the related bistro in the basement and the lively breakfast place located separately within the same building, are really good. But the whole ballgame here is the location. The views, if you are fortunate enough to have a water-view room, are simply stunning -- not only because of the comings and goings of ferry boats, freighters, liners, Coast Guard cutters, fishing boats, and pleasure craft, but also because of the astonishing mountain range visible across Elliott Bay, which catches the sunset in truly glorious ways. It is also a pleasure to be able to walk half a block down the steep hill to the Pike Place Market, with all its produce and its bustle of activity. There are countless restaurants and clubs within walking distance. As gentrification neuters most of downtown Seattle, this area remains edgy, even a little challenging if you go in certain directions at certain times. The area is not for you if you are uncomfortable with street people and occasional strong smells.
