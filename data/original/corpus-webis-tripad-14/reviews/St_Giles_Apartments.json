Not so with the St Giles appartments,they lack anylove what so ever and in fact feel quiet cold. I think these particular appartments are very over priced compared to other accomadations.last night when we paid \u00a339 for a double bed & breakfast and were more than happy,tonight we splurged and paid \u00a389 with no breakfast and are disappointed. The bed is very uncomfortable with a very cheap mattress , no TV in the bedroom,no face washers,tissues. The washing machine / dryer is one of those all in one's that we can't work out how to use.

It really is the perfect place with one MAJOR exception! It's very very loud in the lounge and front 2 bedrooms. Although the road below is closed to most traffic, given the stone street, when a car drives by you hear it. When the deliveries to surrounding shops and flats begins at 6am you hear that too. When the bells of the St Giles cathedral start at 6am you hear them, and when the groups of students return from the pubs at 1am you get to hear that too. This makes for very short nights.

It was clean and well equipped with everything that you would need including appliances, iron, cleaning products, towels and tableware. They had even left is complimentary orange juice and bottled water. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were lovely with good showers. We were in apartment 6 on the top floor so the stairs were a bit of a struggle, especially for older people in the group-if you have anyone who isn't very mobile, it's probably not the best place to stay, so check that you are on a lower floor. The bedrooms were lovely however the one we stayed in was quite small and got very hot at night - the other 2 bedrooms were bigger. It is noisy outside at night but I wouldn't expect anything else from a city centre location on a Saturday night. The price wasn't too bad but maybe a little on the expensive side.
