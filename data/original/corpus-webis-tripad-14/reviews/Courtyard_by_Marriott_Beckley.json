The hotel seems to believe it is of a higher quality and standard than it is or should be in this area. There is not free breakfast and the price of food or drinks in their \"cafe\" or \"market\" are outrageous. I paid over four dollars for a bowl of cereal and a banana. A chocolate milk was over two dollars. The gym is a joke. It is the smallest gym I have ever seen at a hotel and the equipment is laughable. The rooms are nice, but have a very funky layout. The rooms are like playing a game of Russian roulette. Unexpectedly yo may have a refrigerator and a balcony or neither on various stays. The hotel is noisy due to its location to the interstate.

The entire hotel looks as if it has been renovated in recent years and the lobby is very spacious, modern, and welcoming.

Great layout also...I wasn't actually in the room long enough to really enjoy it but appreciated it while I was there. The bed was fabulous (as it felt much like my own) and if it had been a warmer time of year we would have enjoyed the small balcony as well.
