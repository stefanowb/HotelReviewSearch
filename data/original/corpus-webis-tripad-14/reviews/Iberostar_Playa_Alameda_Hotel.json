The resort is set up in blocks of condos, with each condo with about 24 rooms spread across 3 floors. I would recommend asking for a room not located on the first floor in order to avoid bugs coming in from the doors. I emailed the resort a week before our stay, also asking for two rooms close to each other and that is exactly what they gave us. The ROOMS themselves were spacious, with coffee tables, a couch, double beds, a functioning safe and AC (sometimes even too cold) and a bathroom that had both a shower and a tub with a pull-out shower nozzle - however the tvs in both rooms did not work well. There is also an electrical plug that is converted for North American voltages. Our rooms were cleaned everyday, complete with towel art. However, if you would like the mini-fridge to be restocked - you will need to write a note to the maids in order for them to do so, same with asking for extra towels and pillows.

The ticket is valid for the day and you can hop on and off, if you wish to go back to the resort for lunch and head back out later on! The bus picks you up and drops you off right in front of the resort and is a great option for those cloudier days. And if you are willing to pay a little bit more to go out of Varadero - I would definetly recommend taking a tour into Havana.

I loved my vacation then and loved it even more the second time. The main reason for this is the amazing staff! This time I travelled only with my 18 year old daughter (last time we were a group of 9 family members aged 15 to 70). As with our last visit, the animation team (Star Friends) under the leadership of Alexis, absolutely made our holiday the most memorable and enjoyable experience it could possibly have been. From the moment we arrived at the pool on our first day to the minute we left the beach on our last the saw to our every need, kept us entertained, and generally treated us like family. Alexis has an amazing team and does a SUPERB job. I will go back to this hotel again and again because of the work that he does. Special mention also goes out to Yudi Romero, a Star Friends team member who went above and beyond every day of our holiday to ensure that both my daughter and I felt welcome and a part of every activity going on. We miss her already!! Be sure to look both she and Alexis up when you choose this hotel. Pepe, the gentleman on the beach will take care of all your needs regarding beach chairs and anything else that you need on the beach. He was also there two years ago. Eduorado, the egg chef could always be counted on the morning to greet you with a generous smile and perfectly cooked eggs...another long standing employee. I believe that this is the greatest asset that this hotel has going for it; employees who have been there for many years and treat the guests liked people visiting their own home. In addition to this wonderful feeling, we had comfortable beds (pillows were awful), good food, beautiful beach, plentiful cold and delicious drinks (especially the mojitos)! Could not have asked for more. There were several folks there with younger children who seemed to be having a great time with the entertainment team as well! We had two minor issues with our room that were dealt with immediately and professionally by the folks at reception who were also most helpful in getting us a taxi when we needed in and helping me to try track down a lost item. Live entertainment in the evenings in the form of bands with dancing and then shows were great. In all, there is NOTHING I would change about this trip!!
