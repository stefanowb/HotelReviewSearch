We used the stackable washer and dryer alot. That is something you are not going to get in most rentals. The grounds are beautiful, it is very quiet, and you feel like you have the pools to yourself.

We stayed at the rost in February of 2006. The one bedroom unit that was appointed to us was a one bedroom, groung level unit that had a view of a black tarp hiding the construction going on 50 feet from our unit. This unit was the very last one; the furthest one away from parking area. My husband and I are active vacationers and we come and go throughout the day. The walk got a little old and the golf cart traffic was annoying after a while (going on all day long in the walking path to parking area), especially when no one ever offered to stop a give us a ride. The room was clean, the kitchen was well equipped, and spacious. The furniture in the living room was uncomfortable with the cushions on the chairs slipping out from under you. When we checked out, we accidently left out cellular phone chargers on the kitchen counter. I called the resort upon arriving home and asked them to check and see if housekeeping found items and ask them to call me back. As of this date, I have not received a call back from anyone. I will not stay at the resort again.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 25, 2006", "id": 4386158}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful Christmas at Holua Resort", "text": "The room was nicely decorated and spacious.
