Reasonably priced with a nice easy going atmosphere. I had single which was small and already populated by an extremely large teddy bear, but it was all i needed. The hotel had building work next door and as a result they had given all guests a small wooden hammer. Although the instructions were in German, the girl behind the bar prompted me for it on ordering my first beer. A free beer a day as compensation for the workmen starting about 7am. Where else have you ever heard of this? Great friendly hotel bar, my only complaint they sell Jagermeister in small miniatures which they ran out of. Probably a good thing as my hangover was huge. Great breakfast buffet, and friendly efficient staff. A good base in a nice town and a easy commute into Vienna.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 4, 2006", "id": 5296754}], "location": {"country": "Austria", "region": "Lower Austria", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Modling"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 18, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 13}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
