It was our first hotel stay without children in 14 years so we thought we would push the boat out and go for the very 'grand' looking Marriot Royal. Being regular visitors to Marriot hotels for many years with our children (mainly at Slough Windsor Marriot, Gatwick Marriot Renaissance and Portsmouth Marriot) we were expecting this one to be special... oh dear... special it certainly was not!!! Although we had asked for a room with a view over college green, we got a very dingy,scruffy room overlooking other sides of the hotel, the furniture was old and tatty with odd fittings. The decor was tired and the carpets were worn out. The room itself was quite dark and we found it to be a little depressing. As we had specifically asked for a room with a view, we politely asked reception if we could move and they obliged without fuss. That day we went down to the pool (which looks fabulous in photos) and were looking forward to a relaxing swim and sauna.Pool was ok, again a bit tired and shabby in places, but ok. The steam room on the other hand was absolutely disgusting...I sat down on the seat and put my hands behind me... the back of the seat was covered in filthy, green slime! The walls in the steam room reminded me of a public toilet and the stench of mould was overpowering. Needless to say, we got out of there pretty swiflty! Our 2nd room was more pleasant than the first, the bed was comfortable and we were not disturbed by other guests at the hotel. Air conditioning was not working, but this was not a problem as it was not hot that night! Breakfast (always our favourite bit) was terrible - certainly not worthy of circa \u00a316.50 price tag! the food was cold and we had to wait ages for stock replenishment, staff were not particularly friendly or attentive. Again, the dining room was dingy and really is in desperate need of refurbishment. Overall, I would say that this was the shabbiest, most disappointing Marriot we have ever stayed at. What makes it even sadder is that I was born in Bristol, it is my home town and I would much rather be telling people that this is the best place to stay when you visit my great town...
