You have to be buzzed in the first time and then you take the elevator or stairs up to the third floor to check in. There is a desk on this first floor, but it didn't seem to be manned by any staff, which doesn't seem very welcoming. This is a historic hotel so it could be that they are just working with the space that they have. Our room was nice, but there were a couple of negatives. Being a historic building, we had a huge column in the middle of the room. It added character to the room, but it was in such a central spot that I was concerned my husband would walk into it in the middle of the night getting to the bathroom. We used his laptop as a night light so that would not happen. Huge floor to ceiling windows were nice, but they needed to be cleaned. The wood floors were pretty, but creaked quite loudly in some areas and there were 2 spots were the nails had come up - very dangerous when barefoot. The best thing about this hotel is location. It is fabulously located right across the street from the Riverwalk, about a block form the Alamo and walking distance to the convention center.

The doorway entrance is somewhat hidden, but if you follow the directions they provide, you can find it easily. We followed their instructions to park in the nearby loading dock to drop off our bags. After they rang us into the building, we were greeted as we exited the elevator and taken directly to our room. We then drove one block away to the parking garage recommended by them. The garage was so close that upon check-out, we just wheeled our suitcase directly to the car from the hotel. At the hotel, the 17 foot tall windows are as wonderful as other reviewers describe. The fresh baked cookies, the wine in the early evening and the breakfast the following morning made us feel as if we were staying in someone\u2019s home. The leather furniture in all of the sitting areas throughout the building were welcoming and we almost decided to stay indoors rather than visit the Riverwalk. But we eventually did, and it is a quick walk across the street and down some steps. You can\u2019t get any more convenient than that. We had been concerned with street noise, but the provided white noise machines worked perfectly. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've found traveling causing us to sleep in late the following morning, something we never do. Throughout the building, there were books to read, games to play, antiques to explore, even classic movies which could be checked out and watched in your room\u2019s DVD player. The shower was refreshing and the provided bath amenities were luxurious.

I will definitely be back. The staff was very warm and accomodating, I checked in late at night and early in the morning, and there was someone there, ready to deal with my demand for hot tea. It is true that due to the location and age of the building there is some street noise to deal with, but between the air conditioner and the white noise machine, I didn't hear anything and slept like a baby (but I live downtown in a major US city, so maybe I am more accustomed to noise). Also, the proximity to the riverwalk (as well as its actual location near the riverwalk-- really, it is in a prime spot) both explain and justify any street noise. As for the crickets, there was a dying cricket in my room, but we decided to ignore each other. Finally, the hotel/B&B does not have a fitness center or pool, but apparently they have worked a deal out with a local hotel to use its facilities. In all, I highly recommend this little gem and will be back!
