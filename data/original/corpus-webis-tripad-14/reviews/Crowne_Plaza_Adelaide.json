So close to the main hub of Rundell Mall, and a $20 taxi ride from the domestic airport. Our room was clean, tidy and larger than usual hotels we have stayed at. It had two double beds,that were soft but comfortable. A large bathroom, huge bathtub, gigantic shower, mini bar, bathrobes and a balcony overlooking parts of Adelaide. The reception staff were always friendly and helpful, even at 4.30am when we checked out to head back home. We also requested extra towels, that arrived within two minutes of our phone call! A flat screen TV is centrally located on the wall, internet available and it was more than adequate for our four night stay. The security for the hotel was fantastic, with access to the hotel available only with a room key. A great idea, and a real sense of security! The valet staff (valet costs around $35) were always very helpful, polite and friendly and every morning had our car ready for us to explore the rest of Adelaide.
