The one glaring omission the rooms don't have is a in room safe, how they missed this is beyond me. The bathrooms are very tiny and would compare to those of a Ramada or Days Inn .The closest mall is the Factoria Mall, it seems to have more closed stores than open ones.

The staff is very friendly & the hotel itself is spotless. They have covered parking so you can keep from getting wet. That's a nice plus in the Seattle area. I requested a quite room & that's what I got. Even though the hotel is right beside I-90, I never heard a sound at night. My room was extremely comfortable. The sofa was wonderful to sit & relax on, but the bed was the best. For whatever reason, I love sleeping on the Hyatt Grand beds. The extras at the hotel are, however, what really give it true \"value.\" The WI-FI is free & had a strong signal. The complimentary breakfast was amazing.

We were going to a special dinner on a Saturday on the East side of the Puget Sound region and the Hyatt House was the best location we found for price and amenities. We were not disappointed. Overall the room was very nice considering how affordable it was. The style of the entire building is very modern. The room itself had a comfortable bed, a large LCD that was viewable from anywhere in the room, and a decent bathroom. It also came with a small kitchenette that included hotplates, a small fridge, basic utensils and storage for dry goods. One could spend a couple weeks in this unit and live comfortably away from home with the setup. We were only in town for one night and did not use the complimentary breakfast, but we peeked in and it looked superior to most continental breakfasts I've seen in bargain traveller hotels. We had a very restful sleep. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, and the room stayed comfortable warm all night. I'd recommend this to travellers although the location is inconvenient if you're visiting Seattle. Redmond is about a 30 minute drive from downtown Seattle, across one of two bridges that can get clogged at rush hour.
