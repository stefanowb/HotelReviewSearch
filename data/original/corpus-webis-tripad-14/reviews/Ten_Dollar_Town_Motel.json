There are some nice outdoor areas but the room was small, dark because of the brick walls and pretty average. The double bed was adequate with the standard 4 pillows and a bedcover that I've seen in many other Australian motels, and starting to look a little worn. The veneer on the bathroom bench was chipped, the towels thin, the toilet not dual flush (really outdated in this day and age). The person on the front desk was pretty indifferent and could not be described as interested in us or pleased to see us. No fresh milk was offered though mugs were supplied in the room. Hooray! One wine glass was not clean. The only bed lighting was a flourescent globe over our heads - I hate this.

I decided to head out and spend a couple of days with him as I have never been to Gulgong before. As we had a 4.5 month old, we weren't going to camp, so we checked in here for the night. The rooms were spacious and had eveything we needed. Was basic and a little out dated but was comfortable. The air con was quiet and there were foxtel movies for free. Was right in the centre of town so we could walk to the shops and to get dinner and breakfast, very handy. The staff were friendly and helpful.
