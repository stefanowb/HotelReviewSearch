We got the manager of our tour company to contact them on our arrival day and request that all the rooms has hot water and that any water heaters be switched on - we had been camping in Awash and had a tight schedule on the night we arrived in Addis. About half the rooms had no hot water, and it was clear that nobody had done anything about checking to make sure they had. Maybe this was in part due to the fact that they could not get into the rooms in the first place as some of the key cards were not working.
