It is exactly what we were looking for and in a great location with the bus number 64(pickpocket express) stop right at the top of the street. We used the bus frequently and never felt uncomfortable. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard every day. The staff were lovely and helpful. We had a balcony room(108) and it was fab to have somewhere to sit outside with a glass of wine or 2/3 before going out for our evening meal. The breakfast was plentiful and the cappuchino with the little designs on top put a smile on your face every morning. They also made a great smoothy. There was no safe in the room but we left our money in a suitcase along with our passports and felt they were very safe as there is a locked door to get onto the hotel room floor.

I am a second generation Italian American raised in New York City and this was my first trip to Rome. I took a taxi from the airport, which cost 45 euros. The hotel is situated on a quiet side street in the ancient Rome neighborhood. I checked in with no problems took a nap and ventured out into the neighborhood. I was amazed to turn a corner and see the Coliseum. The Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain is also within walking distance or you can take an electric bus for 1 euro to get you there. It was a perfect location for me. You are in a real safe neighborhood with cafes and restaurants at every corner. The staff is very nice and helpful with anything you may need. The rooms are so clean it reminded me of my Grandmother\u2019s house where you could eat off of the floors. Anna was especially helpful and set up a few tours and told me how to get around. I loved it and am extremely happy with my choice. The rooms are clean, comfortable with Internet access. They even have Ethernet cables for you to use as well as ac adapters. The shower was great, the breakfast was also really nice and they have a little open-air garden for you to eat in. I booked the hotel through Orbitz and though no fault of the hotel, Orbitz charged my credit card when booked but it did not go through and never notified me or sent the payment to the hotel. This was worked out at 6 am in the morning. My advice is to double check with Orbitz when booking from the U.S. I will definitely return next year and would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "keysmia", "date": "September 2, 2008", "id": 19678769}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Thanks to the overwhelmingly positive feedback from TripAdvisor I booked our little family early into this hotel (my wife and I and our 10-year-old daughter).

Because we had luggage, we took a taxi from the local train station so we wouldnt have to walk forever to find this hotel. Unfortunately, after the taxi found the street, he couldnt actually find the hotel. He left us off about a block away and we needed to go into another Inn to ask for directions. Sure enough it was indeed on the same street but we drove past it twice and never saw it! Its a small quiet side-street that has only a few Inns with signs. This hotel has a small bronze plaque, so its hard to see. But after arriving, we were greeted by the son (family business for sure) and from that point on we were very very satisfied! The hotel room are mostly on the second floor (we think). There is a broad stairway up, but the son that greeted us insisted we take the ancient lift...which apparently is one of the oldest working lifts in Rome. The second floor had security so things seemed safe. The room was modern and updated with a king bed that was quite comfortable. Really nice updated bathroom (with bidet) and a nice new shower. Very nice marble everywhere. The room had high ceilings, air conditioning, and a TV. All features were quite nice, however the TV was a bit hard for us to figure out. An internet cable was provided for free, so we were able to stay connected. The one window looked out to the building across the street, so there we no view and no balcony, but we didnt care about that given everything else we had to go see in Rome. The hotel is not too far from the Coliseum and the Forum. Its an easy 10 minute walk. Plenty of restaurants nearby....and the hotel has some local favorites that were really really tasty. The neighborhood seemed safe at night too. Breakfast was provided in an outdoor patio - which was clean, refreshing and erelaxing. Plenty of breakfast food - but not your typical \"English Breakfast\". So we are happy to recommend this hotel and would stay there again.
