Having already seeing the price on the internet I thought it was a little overpriced for us. Fortunately for us we were given a standby rate and were even fortunate enough to get a 1 bedroom apartment and 2 bedroom apartment with only a hall wall in between. The apartments are quite roomy, the 2 bedroom apartment would be liveable as it had a bedroom and seperate bathroom at one end a large kitchen and living area in the middle and a decent size main bedroom with a bathroom with a spa at the other end. the decor is very modern (it is a new apartment). Because we got the rooms on the day we ended up with the ground floor apartments, this has a plus side as well as the downside. The negative is that we were on the same level as the main rubbish shute, ok in the apartments, but an unpleasant smell in the hallways. We were also next to the gym and sauna - which could be annoying for some, but was easy access for us. we didn't have a balcony but we had a large patio area that was three times the size of the balconies, there was also a direct gate to the pool.

Having the secure underground parking was great, and is very safely guarded having to use an electronic tag to enter and exit - same as accessing the lifts.
