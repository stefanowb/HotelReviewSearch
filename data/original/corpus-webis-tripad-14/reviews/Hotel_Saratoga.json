First impressions were good, until the young male receptionist decided to give us a room with no balcony overlooking the entrance to the underground car park on the ground floor. Having already requested a room with a balcony, after seeing our room we complained. A female receptionist, after a lot of persuasion and complaining from us and having to show them our original booking a number of times, eventually gave us a room over looking the marina at the front of the hotel. This room was nice and big with a balcony. But it was a little grubby with dirty floors (covered in dust) and the shower fittings were coming away from the wall, not particularly worthy of its 4 stars - especially as the room rates are not cheap! There is not much storage space for your clothes/luggage despite the big room! However, the hotel is ideally located for everything in Palma, walking distance to the marina, restaurants, cathedral (great view of the cathedral from the bar/pool on the top floor of the hotel) and if you have a room at the front of the hotel - a great view of the castle on the hill too. The hotel does have parking, but it is charged at \u20ac10 per night (still cheaper than other car parks). Breakfasts are good, but staff are very sour faced. Tea/coffee is not fresh but from self-service machines. There is a good choice of cheese, meats, cereals and fruit and delicious pastries. It also has internet access in the foyer/lobby - but be quick - there is only 1 PC and often a lengthy wait to get on. Don't be surprised if you return back to your room for a shower and there are no towels - this happened to us a few times and when we requested towels the staff are not particularly quick and bringing them up to your room either!

After three months of fighting, No chance of winning this type of dispute with the credit card because they faked a handwritten \"minibar\" bill and will continuously insist the charge is valid. I know a little Spanish and made the honest attempt to converse, but try questioning a charge and they will conveniently forget their English. 57 euros is 57 euros, not a truly devastating loss, but they're still thieves. Think twice while traveling in Mediterranean countries on the brink of economic collapse because they know you will not win in the credit card dispute and you will be long gone before you notice the charges on your statement.", "title": "Great for enjoying the best of Palma", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jdeanknight", "date": "January 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 123396029}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Booked this hotel at short notice when visiting my brother in hospital.

It was extremely clean as it always is when we visit. We always use this elegant hotel when visiting Palma. The Jazz club is perfect for an evenings entertainment but the food there is not the best.
