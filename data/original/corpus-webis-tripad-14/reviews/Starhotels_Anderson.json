We enjoyed seeing the Last Supper and visiting the Duomo. However, I don't feel any need to head to Milan again, unless it again serves as an essential place to change trains. Milan seemed to have a more business-centered, efficient culture than other cities we visited in Italy.

Bought a metro pass and went the quick 4 stations or so to city center (Duomo) for sightseeing. Beware scammers in subway. Room was nice and quiet, with double windows, could open the outer one just slightly to get a read on the weather. Bathroom was spacious with good toiletries. Breakfast downstairs was included and was OK. Liked the cappuccino and croissants. The scrambled eggs were so-so, and the chopped hotdogs were room temperature and not so good.

Also, there was no plug by the bed, so couldn't have my phone next to me. Dinner menu prices were in keeping with that of a good restaurant but too expensive for a hotel of that size.

Also pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the rates were for the quality of accommodation available. We stayed on the 9th floor, the room was clean, spacious, well appointed, very comfortable bed, big window looking over the city (not much of a view though but it was fun watching the lightning preceding the thunderstorm that evening). You can set the aircon to a pleasant temperature of your liking. Oh and there\u2019s a bathtub in the bathroom (one must not assume that this is standard issue in Italian hotels).
