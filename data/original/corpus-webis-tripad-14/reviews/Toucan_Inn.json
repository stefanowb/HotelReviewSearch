The music around the bar is turned off at 10:30pm so I didn't notice any noise apart from the dawn chorus of birds and roosters each morning!

Nice little inn - met some really nice people - fellow scuba divers - most of them seasoned divers who were full of great stories and suggestions - much appreciated and we hope to meet you all again on a return trip! We started out in Cabana #18 - didn't work well for us as it was located adjacent to a yard full of roosters and overflow tables for the restaurant were right outside our door - so we had some noisey late nights and very early noisey mornings - we requested a room change and Lisa (Reception) offered to move us with no problem - we were moved to Garden Room #4 - nice room - large and very quiet with icy cold air (which my husband loved, me not so much). Breakfast was included and we ate some lunches and dinners there as well - food was always good - we tried some of the local specials too. We also ate at some of the local restaurants - beach is a good 10 minute walk. We enjoyed all of our meals - both at the Inn and around the Island. We took two trips with Mr. B - who is a very well informed tour guide and patiently answered all of my questions - we saw most of the island with Mr. B and we really liked what we saw - gorgeous, lush and very hilly island with a lot of bays - some are not suitable for swimming but look lovely. Locals are extremely friendly - always greeting us with a good morning, afternoon or evening. R&Sea Divers - Wendy and John (and Katie, Dive Master) - were amazing! Very professional - from pre-trip emails, to airport pick up, to scuba and +++ Highly recommend them for all of your diving needs - they are located at the Toucan Inn which makes for a perfect Dive/Stay Package. While we were still at the Inn, my husband booked a return trip in April. One wish: a direct flight from Toronto to Tobago - the inter-island Caribbean Airlines flight was quite good, inexpensive but we were forced to take a 1:45 a.m. flight into Trinidad and wait in the airport for our 7 a.m. flight back home - Please WestJet hurry up and offer direct flights.", "title": "perfect for Tobago", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "orlandosue", "date": "February 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153085112}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "First time we have stayed there but me and the wife liked it quite a bit.", "title": "Toucan Inn - A Very Nice and Affordable Hotel...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BruinSpartan", "date": "February 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 152749323}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "PROS: The rooms were clean, orderly and styled very nicely.
