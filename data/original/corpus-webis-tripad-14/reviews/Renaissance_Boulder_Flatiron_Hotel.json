It was a beautiful hotel in a very convenient area. It was located next to a shopping mall that you can walk to. The room was very spacious and had a separate living room and bedroom areas. The decor of the hotel was also beautiful and the room was spotless. The room service was excellent and they catered to every need that you had. I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler to Boulder.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "BornToTravel", "date": "December 28, 2004", "id": 2947447}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great hotel but where were the suites???", "text": "Great hotel but felt a little misled by the \"Suites\" part of the name. We have a 2-year-old and specifically stayed there so junior could take a nap in the bedroom and mommy and daddy would be able to watch TV or come and go as we please. Unlike a Crowne Plaza, Embassy Suites or even a suite at a Holiday Inn Express these Renaissance \"suites\" didn't come with a separate room! Basically it was one very nice, big, beautifully decorated room but no \"suite.\" \"Suite\" to me means a separate bedroom; this room was basically a \"studio!\"", "helpfulness": 27, "user": "Frqflier", "date": "August 16, 2004", "id": 2453343}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Broomfield"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 33, "very good": 85, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 135}, "aka": "Renaissance Boulder Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Experience the uniquely designed and artfully executed luxury of the Renaissance Boulder Suites hotel in Broomfield, CO, located along the US-36 Denver-to-Boulder corridor in the Interlocken Business Park and across the street from shopping at the Flatiron Crossing Mall.
