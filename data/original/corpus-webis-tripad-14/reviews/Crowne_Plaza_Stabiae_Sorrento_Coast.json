To say I'm fussy is an understatement (I'm the one who notices if the grouting is dirty in the bathroom!) so I was really relieved when we arrived here. The first view you have as you drive down to the entrance is gorgoeus - out over the Bay of Naples with Vesuvious directly infront of you, and so close! The hotel itself is modern and contemporary with a very light and airy feel. The staff were faultless, from reception who went out of their way to assisit, to the doormen, pool staff and everyone else we spoke to. Our room was clean and modern with everything you could need, with a bath (vital!) and a shower. I guess the only negative might be our balcony. It was a small decking area with a wooden square coffee table and 2 chairs, which was right next to the room on our left and 3 further rooms to our right in a sort of semi-circle. The only thing dividing them was a railed partition. However, as we only saw one other couple out on theirs fleetingly it really wasn't a problem, as we only spent the odd 10 mins here out on it ouselves. The pool is gorgoeus, with ample loungers and towels. The small private beach is a godsend. The restaurant setting is just lovely - outside overlooking the bay and Vesuvious. The whole area is lit by oil burners and candles - very romantic. The staff were discreet, polite and helpful - we are both vegetarians and the chef made us wonderful pasta dishes on the 2 nights we ate there. Some reviews on this hotel have been negative about the area and I was prepared to be disappointed but really it is not atall bad. Ok, it's not up in the mountains of Ravello, but we drove everywhere anyway so never even thought about it. However, the driving is something else. Be warned! We read all the stuff about the Amalfi Coast drive and the scooters and driving standards, but really, nothing prepares you for just how horrific it is. There are dozens of scooters everywhere, often they ride without helmets, and believe it or not, often 2 on a bike with a tiny child wedged inbetween or a baby slung on the womans hip. The scooters and cars overtake on blind bends constantly or cut across infront of you. You need to be a very confident and assertive driver! It was also crazily busy and frentic. We visited Sorrento via the hotel courtesy bus, but didn't much like it. We went to The Foreigners Club on several recommendations from this website for a light lunch and I have to say it was vile! Perhaps others ate in the evning but I had a cheese and tomatoe roll (all on offer for a vegetarian) and it was a burger roll and disgusting. The service was surly but the view was nice. We also visited Positano - pretty but very touristy, Ravello - our favourite, views to die for and a bit quiter, and t\"Vico Equenzie\" the next town on from the hotel where we ate in a restaurant recommended by the hotel one night which was very good. We spent a day walking round Pompei which is only about 15 mins away, a serious \"must see\" and walked up the the top of Mount Vesuvious on the only day it wasn't shrouded in mist! Also a \"must see, but this is a steep walk up and you need flat shoes, preferably trainers not the strappy stilletos I saw one young girl staring off in!

The best hidden secret is the Circumvesuviana train which will take you anywhere all the way from Naples to Sorrento. The hotel also has a shuttle and free bus passes but the best and easiest way to get around is via the Circumvesuviana stop at Pozzano which is 1/2 mile or less from the hotel, right next to the public beach.
