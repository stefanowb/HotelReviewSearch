One of the attractions of the hotel was the \"salon\" downstairs as a place to read and relax: however, the TV seemed to be always tuned into MTV on volume and guarded by a couple of the owners' (?) daughters.

We stayed there in September for about 5 days and the visit was flawless. I learned of the hotel from the reviews on TripAdvisor and we weren't disappointed. This is a small hotel run by a small but very helpful staff. They provide a simple breakfast each morning that in our opinion was perfect. The staff helped us figure out where to park our rental car (there is a free parking lot about a 5 min. walk from the hotel). The room had everything we needed including free wireless. A lot of the other hotels in and around Biarritz were pricey and crowded. If you're looking for a big hotel with lots of amenities then this is probably not the place for you. However if you're looking for a little oasis in what can be a very crowded and busy place then you will love this hotel.

The only negative was the fact there was no air con but Eric (the proprietor) assured us this was being installed next year. The room had double glazed windows/shutters but when opened it was noisy during the night time, however the room decor was great - very contemporary in design and you could see the owners took great care in their hotel. The bed was large but a little uncomfortable for more than a couple of nights - as it dipped in the middle - or perhaps just used to my own bed! The daily room cleaning was brilliant. Location is superb, approx 200m to the main beach. Eating out can be somewhat expensive, a average meal for the 3 of us (with a bottle of wine) was a little under 100 Euro!! A pint of beer will certainly cost you 6 to 7 Euro - so be warned. However, this did not spoil a great holiday and would definately recommend a visit to the local food market (a great choice) and the 2 seafood restaurants at the port is highly recommended. Located very close to the airport (but no airport noise at all) and the beach is fantastic (especially as we've lived in Manly, Australia for the past 12 years!). We recommend breakfast at the cafe on the main beach (under the casino) - not the cheapest but the best service and value and a brilliant view watching the surfers. We didn't try the hotel breakfast so unable to comment.
