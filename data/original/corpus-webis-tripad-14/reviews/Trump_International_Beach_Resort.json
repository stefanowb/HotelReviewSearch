The bed linens and towels were pristine white. The bathrooms were just okay. The sink was made of plastic and the countertop, althoug granite, it was an ugly, cheap-looking granite. The faucets were cheap-looking as well. The hairdryer took me twice the time to dry my hair as the one at home. There was a bathroom scale, but non-functioning. If it doesn't work, just remove it from the room or replace it with one that works. The balcony was nice and large with nice patio furniture. Be careful when you book a room here if you want an ocean front view. There is \"Ocean view\" and \"Ocean front.\" Big difference. If you want ot wake up and easily see the ocean, get the \"Ocean view.\" If you don't mind mostly views of the street and a view of the ocean if you stick your head out a bit, then get the \"Ocean view\" room. But, I would pay the extra money for the Ocean Front. The pillow-top Serta mattresses were divinely comfy :-) Each room comes with a wet bar with cabinets full of snacks, drinking glasses, wine glasses, and a Keurig coffee maker. They provide the coffee and accessories complimentary. There were two terry-cloth robes with slippers, so that was great. the foyer and bathroom floors are marble, so the slippers are very much appreciated. The decor is nice, not fantastic, but nice. the flat screen tv was pleaseantly big.

At around 1 pm I went up again (not very happy) to Andreas, he said, no not yet, well finally at 3 pm my husband was annoyed. He went up to Andreas and he said the room was still not ready, then my husband asked to speak to the manager, Daniel DeMoura. My husband told him we have been here for 5.5 hours waiting for our room, he said he asked housekeeping and they are not ready yet and they said \"well check in isn't until 4pm\", I said we have never been to a hotel they didn't accommodate the guest if they arrived early, he said he would call us when our room was ready, basically he didn't care, well at 3:50 they called to tell us our room was ready.", "title": "Great but.......", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RGLA112", "date": "August 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8449200, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The room, pool and ocean view", "disliked": "\u2014 check in"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007", "text": "We were upset because we were up since 5am and we wasted an entire day of our 3 days in the lobby, if they would have told us we were not getting in our room till 4pm we would not have sat there ALL DAY, I did read that from ours that they don't check you in early.
