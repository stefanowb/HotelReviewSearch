So, with a room on the 15th floor, if you wanted to visit a friend on the 4th, you would need to go to the 15th floor, and then go down to the 4th. On top of that, the room keys themselves were prone to random deactivation. And, when in the elevator with more than one person, the elevator was wont to ignore multiple floor requests, and only stop at the first button pressed. I had issues with this every single day of my stay. One evening, it took me 10 minutes to get from the lobby to my hotel room, due to room key and elevator issues. This is the kind of thing that should really be easy for hotel guests.
