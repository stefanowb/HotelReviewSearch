The rooms were very good and although the area has been developed more there were no noise issues. TV and wifi very good and the rooms were clean and serviceable.

We had a ground floor room enroute from Italy. It was a hot day & there was no Air Con. Full size windows had no security so had to be kept shut. Bath/Shower old and rusty with tap that moves around. Lights kept turning themselves off. when female receptionist came to investigate she got shock from fittings. Room was so small bathroom door would not close as beds in the way. The only saving grace was bed was comfortable and clean. Manager on leaving was not interested and shrugged his sholders.

There is parking and a restaurant, but we didn't eat there except for breakfast, which was a pretty nice spread. There is an electric kettle in our room and some coffee and tea. Wi-fi was strong and never gave up. Staff was friendly and understood english. Comfortable, but small twin room was good enough for two people(if you are looking to hang out in a hotel room, this would not be the one). The grounds were very clean, there were even landscapers putting plants into the planter boxes in the windows, a great touch.
