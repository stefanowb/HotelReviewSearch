At check out we told the people (2) at the front desk about the glass, they said thanks for letting them know. Then we told them about the bathroom incident (which was still in the sink) and they said they would contact maintenance. Then, they asked us if other than that, was our stay okay?.....No sorry for the problems, or offer on a discount rate, or another night stay. I was under the impression that JW Marriott Hotels were the elite, the best in the world. I'm not convinced.
