It was a bit of a way out of the centre of Rome. We walked everywhere, but at the end of the day we just got on the No. 2 tram at Popolo/Flaminio for 3 or 4 stops. The hotel reception staff were very nice, except one girl who was a bit miserable, and not very polite. We ate at a couple of typically Italian resturants, very close to the hotel, which were lovely, and probably much cheaper than in the centre.

From there is was easy to walk or take the subway anywhere you wanted to go. I was definitely stay here again. On a side note - i do NOT recommend the bus tour they use (Green line).

The English is so-so, but since Rome is an international city it is possible to get aropund with any of the top 4 languages- even at Villa Glori. There is an elevator, though tiny (maybe two skinny adults fit) it is also extremely quiet. If you get a room by the elevator do not be concerned because you will not hear it. The hotel has less than 50 rooms and the desk will require that you leave the room key with them as you leave for the day. thats just fine because very room key has a large metal plate on it.
