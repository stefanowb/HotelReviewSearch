The pool was full, loud, crowded around it, and it did not close on time for the night.

We had such a nice relaxing stay here lounging by the pool. The rooms were really nice, very new with really comfortable linens, flat screen TV, and very nicely decorated bathrooms with marble countertops, etc. The food at the hotel was not too pricey and was pretty decent - decent enough that we didn't leave the resort our entire stay. Even though the temperature was in the low 100s, it was still comfortable under the umbrellas by the pool. And, they have a great shuttle service to take you wherever you want to go if it's too hot.
