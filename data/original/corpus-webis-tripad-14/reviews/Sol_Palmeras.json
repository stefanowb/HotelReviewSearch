Now it now comes out of a machine in the restaurant (seriously yech) and the espresso machine produces something that is good but not great. Second disappointment was the music: whereas the lobby bar offered a live Cuban band most evenings the last time we were there, a karaoke machine is featured now, with a mediocre selection of \"golden oldies\" on offer by singers who have more enthusiasm than talent. Only two of the restaurants offered any live music -- a fabulous Cuban group in one, and a so-so woodwind ensemble in the other. Elsewhere it was recorded music, favouring electronic pop stuff played too loudly. Maybe the fact that we were there during the busy March Break week last time explains the difference but the music was something we had looked forward to and really missed. The sound system on the beach was in bad shape but it hammered away at full volume most of the day.

The beach is beautiful and the fun pub at night is a good option for those looking for something to do after dinner within the hotel. With that being said, please be aware that this hotel is by no means a 4 star even within Cuba. It is difficult to hang out in the lobby area at night, because the air does not appear to be circulated, there are no fans or open air spaces within the lobby so it gets extremely stuffy especially with cigarette smoke. The food in buffet restaurant is ok, you will never go hungry but again selection is not as varied as in other hotels where we have stayed.
