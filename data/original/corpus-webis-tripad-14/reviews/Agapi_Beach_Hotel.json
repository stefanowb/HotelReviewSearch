This was problematic for there were many unoccupied \"reserved\" chairs at the beach and pool thoughout the day and none available for those who didn't think of saving a chair. The beach was clean and had the \"Taverna\" close by where you could get food, beer and soft drinks. It was also supervised by a lifeguard. There were no waves suitable for surfing/boarding. Buy an inflatable raft at the \"dollar\" store across the street and mellow out on the small waves.
