There is internet available everywhere (wireless) and in the reception area. Every room has its own mini fridge with few free drinks inside.

The bedroom is nice and so it' s the bathroom. The whole suite has balconies with a stunning view of the Arno which makes it ideal if you are looking for a romantic treat or simply want even more privacy.
