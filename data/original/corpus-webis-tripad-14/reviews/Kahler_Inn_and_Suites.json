The convenience of this hotel was wonderful. We stayed in a small suite that had a mini kitchen, pull out couch/seating area in addition to two queen beds. The hotel room was very standard but definitely served our needs. It was comfortable and clean and I felt well worth 109$ per night. But note, it is nothing fancy - from what I understand, nothing is in this area. Ours was on the second floor which is the same floor as the complimentary breakfast, workout area, and pool. Our room, number 241, and the others on that hallway, all had large ( maybe 12 X12?) balconies which would have been wonderful to use had the weather been warmer. In addition, staying on the second floor enabled us to avoid the slow elevators.", "title": "Worked wonderfully for our needs", "user": "gee_ess61", "date": "November 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 48787893}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled on business", "text": "It appears that the hotel is working to improve some of the issues mentioned by previous reviewers over the past few years.

When I peeked in, the room was completely torn apart! I asked the person working in the room what was being done - upgrade? new fixtures? what?
