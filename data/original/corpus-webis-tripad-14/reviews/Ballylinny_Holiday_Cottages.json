They are a 15 min walk or few minutes drive to some of the loveliest beaches that I've seen, its a great location. A 10-15 min walk will take you to a lovely pub, The Nook, just at the Giant's Causeway which is a super sight. 5 min walk is a tiny steam railway that our kids loved. The cottages are in a cluster but despite proximity to other cottages feel private and we didn't have noise issues. They are simply furnished but with everything you need (e.g. hairdryers, hoover, washing machines...) - think whitewashed walls and pine floors rather than flowery carpets/curtains and nic-nacs. If you want lovely scenary, great walking and beaches and a clean uncluttered house to come home to, this is for you.
