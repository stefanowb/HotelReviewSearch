The service was outstanding and the rooms amazing. However do not order a carton of Bingtang that which would cost around $25.00 at the shops and they charged us $120. The staff are unbelievable very friendly and welcoming but I was disappointed with the General Manager of this hotel because through no fault of mine I slipped inside on their marble tiles villa and broke my clavical bone and fractured it in four places. They were very good at assisting me at the hospital were the General Manager and Manager of the hotel accompanied me there. I was x -rayed and we were informed that I had broken my bone. I was in too much pain to fly home, and wished to stay there, where i felt a lot more comfortable. When I spoke to the manager within regards to compensation, and paying for my hospital bills, his response was, we take no liability for you slipping, you should have been wearing indoor slippers. I might add the indoor slippers would have caused me more damage if I had them on, as they had no grip what so ever under neath the bottom of the shoe. I might also state, that when the cleaners cleaned our room both day & night, none of them were wearing shoes, or slippers, so why did this rule only apply to me????? I am suggesting to you all, that if you have an incident, make sure they have a sign to state you must wear slippers!!! as they did not have a sign stating this. I was soooooo happy with the ppl who worked here, and it pains me to write this report. However it was blantantly the hotels responsibility in this case to pay my hospital bills and furthur more they did not, and when I asked to extend on because of the fact that I was in serious serious pain.....they told me to book through my travel agent as they would give me a cheaper rate??? A cheaper rate.......wouldnt that have been the least they could do????? One would think??? They have no mats to the entrance of any of the doors when you enter the villa. I was not wet nor was I swimming, so they cannot claim this was the cause. So although they seemed concerned to begin with, they used an excuse of it being a slippery surface because I did not have indoor slippers........WHAT AN ABSOLUTE JOKE. THERE WAS NO DISCOUNT GIVEN NO NOTHING, AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART I WAS STUCK WITH A VERY HEFTY HOSPITAL TAG. As you can all see Im quite upset. I cannot work for 12 weeks, who wil pay my loss of income? Certainly not them, and for them to use such a stupid excuse of a slipper, when none of the other workers wear slippers while cleaning, was just beyond belief. I have my husband doing everything for me....typing and dressing me etc. The owners of this establishment, should be proud of the ppl whom work for them, as they were wonderful, however management (the english general manager whom made this decision of no compensation what so ever should be overlooked) My husband and I travel 6 times a year..... this certainly doesnt look good, when there is nothing to at least pacify guests for their pain.", "title": "A very Important read within regards to management and hurting yourself at hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lombi1", "date": "October 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20863336, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the pool and the bed was very comfy. bathtub was great, was too hot to use but lovely.", "disliked": "\u2014 accomadation was great, management decsioins very disappointing."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The reviews below will tell you all you need to know and I kid you not they are all 100% factual!", "title": "Simply superb!", "user": "philbybilby32", "date": "October 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20743534}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Samaya was our first post-honeymoon trip away and to be honest it bordered on a honeymoon all over again.", "title": "The Absolute Pinnacle....", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Lozza74", "date": "October 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 20721038, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything", "disliked": "\u2014 Absolutely nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The grounds are impeccable, the location perfect (far enough away but close enough to drop into Kuta), the food (i.e Breeze restaurant) sublime and the staff ... well there are no words to explain just how good the staff are!", "title": "Exceeded expectations", "user": "Sputnik2008", "date": "October 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20692432, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Agree with the Ku De Ta call re: sunset drinks v The Samaya, although I should add we did enjoy a good meal there alongside some pretty good funky music.", "title": "Honeymoon in Paradise", "user": "Mideojo", "date": "October 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20647992, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The secluded room with private pool and the Breeze breakfasts", "disliked": "\u2014 Evening dinner can be a bit expensive every night"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Its pretty much impossible to say anything bad about the Semaya.
