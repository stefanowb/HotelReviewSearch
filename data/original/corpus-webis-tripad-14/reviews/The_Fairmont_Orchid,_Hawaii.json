We wanted a short flight to the Caribbean but at the last minute decided to go back to the Orchid. For us, the ten hour flight is long but so worth it once we arrive and we never regret it. The weather is always warm and sunny, the people are friendly and more restaurants are opening every year. The one year we went to USVI and regretted it (tropical storm, misquitoes, and closed restaurants due to it being the off season) so we have been back ever since.", "title": "See you next year", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "hotelbandit2010", "date": "September 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 178198501}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed a week and got upgraded to nice room free of charge.
