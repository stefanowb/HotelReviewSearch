Every single staff member that I encountered stepped right up to the plate and hit a home run. ( and the staff is plentiful). Check in was pleasant even though a lot of people were checking in when I was; the house keeping staff was speedy and thorough; and the rooms, well, the hotel website photos just don't do them justice. The rooms are large and well equiped with a marble topped area with coffee pot, microwave and refrigerator. The beds are awesome, firm but pillow-topped ~ which is excellent for someone who struggles with back pain like I do. You won't want to get out of bed! The lighting in the rooms is diverse, allowing either bright light for working, or soft light for R&R, and the window opens partially for fresh air in the room. The continental breakfast foods are typical of a quality continental breakfast, with yogart, pastries, oats, make-your-own waffles, several juice varieties, hot cocoa, cereal, fruit cups and whole fruit, and a variety of breads, but the service kicks it up a notch. As you walk into the area, the staff wishes you a good morning and then acclimates you with the spread to ease the normal confusion of a continental breakfast , and there is even an open air patio where you can enjoy your breakfast. And the pool, hot tub and finess room do not dissapoint either. You're 10 minutes from the outlets, and you're surrounded with both fast food and finer dining including Red Lobster, a fine looking steak house, Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Taco Bell, Wendy's, a Mexican restaraunt, ect. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. It's brand new ~ 18 months old in Sept. 06.

Hotel was very clean and the decor was charming. Reserved the king suite which was spacious and the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.
