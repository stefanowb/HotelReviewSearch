I'll sum up two years in this review. EXCELLENT. I am a Dallas/Ft. Worth native, and am very familiar with Irving and Las Colinas. I don't know how old this Marriott is, but it is relatively new and maybe even just a couple of years old. First, it is conveniently located off highway 114 by the famous Mustangs of Las Colinas. My fiance and I stayed there last year and this year because he was working the Thanksgiving Cowboys game, and my parents live just west of the airport. Therefore, this was a very convenient choice to the stadium, my family, friends, and plenty of restaurants. Last year, we felt like we were in The Shining because nobody was there, or so it seemed. This year, the Jets stayed at the hotel so there was a lot more activity, but still, very quiet and peaceful. The room itself is your typical Marriott room - clean, internet, comfy bed, etc. The bathroom is roomy and we had a nice size balcony overlooking the pond. It was very relaxing to sit out there, even though it was 80 degrees one minute and the next minute it had dropped to 40 degrees. There are robes in the closets, which is always impressive to me. The concierge level was closed, so they comped our breakfast for 2 days. The restaurant is big, and they have an excellent breakfast selection and buffet including lo-carb and lo-fat options. There is a bar and a nice seating area in the lobby. The workout center has treadmills, bikes, efx machines, weights, bottled water, towels, and 2 HD TV's which allowed me to watch ESPN and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade simultaneously. This Marriott also has a computer and printer at the front desk so that you can check in and print boarding passes on the way out the door. They have their own parking garage so there is plenty of room to park conveniently. Finally, my fiance asked for laundry service and was concerned about the holiday...no problem, they had it ready for him Thanksgiving morning. Great service, great location, and you can't beat the value you receive for the price. If you are staying in Irving or want to be close enough yet far away to downtown Dallas, TX Stadium (for one more year), or DFW airport, I would certainly recommend this hotel.", "title": "Nice, but somewhat stale", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "KJR0711", "date": "July 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8065302, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Standand Marriott quality", "disliked": "\u2014 Construction"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Opted to stay here for a night in July instead of Arlington (was in Texas to catch a Rangers game) and can honestly say I'm happy I did.
