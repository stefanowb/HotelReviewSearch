After having had breakfast in the Premier Inn, Chester for two days, I was really disappointed with the breakfast there. We has breakfast at 10am and service was until 10.30am. There was no bread, the coffee was stewed and cold, no orange juice without bits for the kids and we had to ask for salt, etc. The staff were nice enough and did replenish these items for us. The actual cooked breakfast was fantastic and cooked very well. At Chester we were allowed to use the coffee machine but here the coffee was pre-made and tasted awful. My last stay here the coffee was awful too. Maybe if we had our breakfast earlier stocks would have been fuller but if service is until 10.30am then stocks should be replenished until then.
