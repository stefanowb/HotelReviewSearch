This is in no way a critisism, as it enables the hotel to provide modern facilities which probably would not be possible in an original. Our room, which I think was one of the simpler rooms was of a reasonable size, had a spacious bathroom, with power shower and also had mini bar, satelite tv etc. The usual facilities provided in a modern hotel. We had a wonderful meal, in the restaurant, mine a beatifully cooked Sea Bream, my wifes a vegetarian Cannaloni, We finished with a selection of fruit sorbets. We had a lovely bottle of wine and a couple of extra glasses and I think our bill came to around 55 euros. Fantastic value for the quality of food and wine.
