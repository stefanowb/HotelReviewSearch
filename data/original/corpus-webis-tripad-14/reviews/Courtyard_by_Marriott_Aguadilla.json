The hotel is pretty much what you want from a Courtyard but it is in a building that used to be an old military hospital which means the room layouts (at least mine) are not optimal for a hotel. I am in a wheelchair and although I did not specify an accessible room, I have never before had issues with accessibility in the walking space around the bed but this time I could not move around the room at all. Luckily, I could get next to my bed since it was right beside the door. Since I was traveling with my father for just an overnight stay, it wasn't worth switching rooms. I had reserved a 2 bedroom suite and was a bit surprised by the layout. The 1st \u201cbedroom\u201d doesn't have a door and is basically just an adjacent area to the sitting area. The 2nd room has a door (due to be old building, the doors were just wide enough for my chair but not by much) but is very long and narrow with 2 large comfortable beds. The ceilings are incredibly high and the windows are higher than normal which meant I could just barely see out of them, but couldn't look down. The bathroom was very small compared to other Courtyards I have stayed in. Admittedly, an able-bodied person shouldn't have my issues and would probably give the hotel a 4 out of 5.", "title": "Typical Courtyard in an atypical building", "user": "sbenus", "date": "January 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 123760776}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fun time", "text": "Other than the room, the staff were courteous and helpful.
