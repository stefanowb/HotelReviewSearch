The rooms (we had a Studio room, 43 m2) are just right - a comfortable bed separated from a couch and desk area by a low table w/ swivelling TV that can thus be seen from bed or couch - plus a huge bathroom with separate shower - made me think 43 square meters are all a couple really needs... The bathroom amenities (Shambala own-brand) were beautifully scented, gentle and plentiful. The restaurants (3 counting the bar which doubles as Thai restaurant) were excellent, and the breakfast easily the best we've had in hotels (choice of 3 fresh juices, lots of fruit on small, frequently-replenished plates, nice baked goods, and uniformly delicious mains like fluffy pancakes, waffles just sweet enough but not too much, very good coffee). The staff were, without a single exception, friendly, knowledgeable, helpful without obsequiousness (& the Yohji uniforms are great). Decor was a kind of minimalism that's common in hotels but almost never executed this well - minimalism can often seem severe or brutal or agressive, but at the Met it's just pleasing and restful. The pool and workout room are fine; the spa's lovely too (though probably sort of a waste, since you can get a good massage anywhere in Bangkok for about 1/10th the price). There's literally nothing of importance I'd change. (Note, it's in an office-tower area which isn't nice to look at, and you have to taxi or skytrain everywhere; there is a nice walkable street with a Starbucks, one or two highish-level massage places and a couple of restaurants on the way to the nearest Skytrain stop.)", "title": "Just Perfect", "user": "MarkoP", "date": "February 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4519438}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic!", "text": "Lets be honest this hotel provides urban chic for a stylish clientele. We stayed in a Met room on the 5th floor - it was large and very comfortable, the bathroom was really spacious and I found the sitting area in the bedroom very useful. The pool did only get the sun for 3 hours from about 10.30am but then again one does not want to spend a whole day in the Bangkok sun - apart from that it was a beautiful area to relax and the pool is very large. I did not use the spa but did the gym which had all the necessary equipment. The breakfast, which you have two restaurant choices, was included in the price and to be honest I have stayed in so many hotels over the years but this was simply the best. Take time out and enjoy it every morning. Coming from London the Met Bar felt a little old hat and we went to more current bars (Koh being one of the best) whilst we were there. Overall the staff were very polite and helpful orthough they could do with a top class concierge as the guys seemed a little clueless on the restaurant/bar/club scene. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys a contemporary lifestyle - but definately not my mother!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 25, 2006", "id": 4518875}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "One of the best", "text": "It's always harder to write a glowing review than a bad one but here goes.
