Nope. check in took forever and then my husband tells me he read reviews about how horrible check in was (ughh). So I'm looking and watching the check in counter and I don't know what it is - maybe the employees were tired because they were very slow- or their check in system was slow but whatever the reason was they sure didn't look at the line and acknowledge us or tell us \"we will be with you as soon as possible\" or anything. NADA. So right off the back bad customer service. When we were getting attended to or rather being given our keys we had to ask for directions to the room- guess they just assume you look at the number and know where to go- where to park etc. SO we get to our room and beds are made but made our way to bathroom and maybe the maid left on a break while cleaning and forgot to come back because that's exactly what it looked like. Some dirty towels some clean and hung- shower hadn't been cleaned (opened containers of shampoo and soap) so I called housekeeping because what was the point of calling the front desk - they were so slow at checking us in why not go directly to the source and told housekeeping to come and clean the bathroom real quick. And then go to get on the internet and decide to call guest services (figure they could quickly answer the call ) and they said that the wifi was not free. THEN WHY DO ALL THE BILLBOARDS STATE FREE WIFI AT WHISKEY PETES? SO I pay for the wifi so I could play (stream) a movie on my nook to help my son go to sleep and the service was so crappy the movie couldn't stream. And then my husband said the service was very slow even for his email or facebook. SO I have asked the carrier LV.net for a refund and their last email to me was asking - why do I feel I deserve a refund after they show (some amount) of downloading during my 24 hour period- um hello!!!! first off the service (on the billboards stated) was supposed to be free and then I ya I can see how mb were used but the service was not equipped enough to stream (what I paid for). Oh my gosh I almost forgot. I sent my husband down to McDonalds and asked him to get me a hot coffee. The kid with the gauges told him they didn't serve hot coffee. Only Iced. At that point I think my husband just kind of gave up on the hotel and came back empty handed. I am so glad I did not go downstairs and attempt to get a coffee.

Upon arrival, the staff was quick and helpful and we found our room with no trouble. We decided to go play in the casino. Played a few slots but the blackjack tables looked so inviting. Not all the crazy crowds like the strip and everyone looked like they were actually enjoying themselves. It was a blast! The dealers were great, the cocktail waitresses were friendly and prompt, and the social atmosphere was relaxing yet alive! We had a lot of fun and won a few free hotdogs and had an absolute blast. I plan on stopping here every time I go to Vegas from now on. I see a lot of negative reviews so I'll sum it up. If you are a regular person who likes to have fun you will love this place.
