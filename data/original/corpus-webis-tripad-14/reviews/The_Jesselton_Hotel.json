It's a very pretty little place, the rooms are quite big and very comfortable. Location is excellent on Jalan Gaya, easy to walk everywhere. The staff were very very helpful and attentive. Breakfast was included which was fine if you prefer a western style breakfast but you don't get much of a choice. But there's lots of other places to eat nearby. All in all a very comfortable stay and service was excellent.", "user": "emypie", "date": "July 3, 2010", "id": 69586628}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Colonial spendor in the middle of the city", "text": "We loved the Jesselton Hotel with its slightly faded colonial spendor, and were very comfortable there. Staff were charming and helpful from the doorman in his tropical whites with pith helmet to the maids in their frilly caps and aprons. It's situated right in the middle of Kotakinabalu, so one steps out right into the fascinating streets and markets. In fact, the big Sunday Street market is outside its door. It has become a little shabby - the marble tiling in the bathroom, for example, could have done with a bit of grout whitening, but this was minor and, for us, did not detract from its unusual charm, and it is very clean. I wished I'd packed my sweeping skirt and lace parasol to be in tune with its ambience.", "user": "MaryFremantle", "date": "June 19, 2010", "id": 68006095}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Avoid the Bella Italia restaurant on the ground floor", "text": "It was a Sunday afternoon, and friends and I wanted to have a quick and good lunch on the way to the airport.", "user": "GJaga", "date": "June 10, 2010", "id": 67034450}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "No idea why it is a 4 star hotel?", "text": "And boy, were we dead (very nearly too) wrong when we went to the Bella Italia rest. on the ground floor of Jeselton Hotel in KK.

Breakfast, which is part of the price, is also satisfactory, but the order in which the fruit/eggs/toast/coffee-tea come is erratic. But go with the flow. The front office can organize day tours and tours to other parts of Borneo. Found the tours all very efficient and on time.
