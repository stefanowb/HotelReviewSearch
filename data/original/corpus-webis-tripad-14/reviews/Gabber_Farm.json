The room was well furnished, clean with modern ensuite facilities. But the downside was unfriendliness of the host, and the unflexibility of the time of breakfast. This can be used as a good base to visit Plymouth and the surrounding areas, and Wembury beach is a nice little hideaway. Ideally you would use this B&B just as an overnight stop not as a week long holiday as we did.
