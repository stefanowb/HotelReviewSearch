The room was spotlessly clean and had a view into the gardens at the back of the hotel, so lovely and quiet. Comfortable bed, great bathroom and very good location.

The front staff who we saw most deserves a very big \"thank you\". I have rarely experienced a stay in a hotel where the staff is so professional, so kind and so smiling at any time of the day. We really felt like home and were always greeted no matter what time of the day/night and how many times we left or came back to the hotel. (Dear Staff, it is thanks to your excellent work that your hotel will not only reach the top ranks of Tripadvisor but also stay at the top). The hotel is contemporary and very quiet which is must for us. I loved using my fingerprint to open our room door. This is such a clever idea and it so convenient not to carry out a key or a card. Our room was very spacious and simply decorated but with much taste. Our bathroom was big but did not have a door which means that you do not have much intimacy, but the goods news is that we had a separate toilet which is very unsual in a hotel room and again a bright idea. The hotel location is perfect for shopping, sightseeing, going out to restaurants, etc. We took a bus shuttle from Barcelona airport to Pla\u00e7a Catalunya which costs 10 Euros for a return ticket. It is a 15 min. walk to the hotel, but there also plenty of taxis waiting at Pla\u00e7a Catalunya if you do not feel like walking and/or if you are travelling with heavy luggages.

I figured if they couldn't get us into a room early, we might just be able to have our bags secured. One of the concierge workers had us sit down as she worked to arrange an available room for us. While we were waiting another worker whisked our bags upstairs. I was truly amazed and thankful that she did that for us. We went up to the room, took a much needed shower, and slept the day away. The room was gorgeous, modern and spartan. I need to alert travelers though: even though there's a partition between the room and shower, the shower is very much open! This is fine for couples but is not very family-oriented. There was a black-out door which was lovely considering we just needed sleep.
