We picked Grotto Bay because we got a great deal and it seemed nice enough to meet our not-high expectations. It wasn't. I'm not quite sure how this place gets even decent ratings on TripAdvisor. Is it the bugs all over the filthy resort bar that was just randomly closed one day? or the run-down rooms with no deadlocks? or the north-facing beach? or the totally rude front desk staff who were expert at making you feel like you were putting them out by making even the smallest request (e.g. \"you can check out at noon but you better not spend one minute longer in your room\")? or was it the dirt covered room floors (we spilled some apple juice on the floor and the towel we used to wipe it up was black from the dirt)? or perhaps the safe that didn't have a key that they were \"working on\" getting? or the shower that opened into the bathroom drenching it with water (unlike bathrooms like this in Europe, these didn't have a drain, so the water just sat there)? or the broken glass in and around the beach shower? or the overgrown path that was almost impossible to navigate down to the water? or the bed's blanket that was covered in (presumably bodily fluid) stains? or the towels that were so old that they all had frayed edges? or the torturously uncomfortable old mattresses? or the TV that defaulted to a volume of full blast whenever it was turned back on? We spent five nights at Grotto Bay, and would have been much better off spending the same amount of money to stay somewhere else for a shorter period of time. We were certainly not expecting a five-star hotel, but I've stayed in two-star and one-star hotels in many, many places and they were all better than Grotto Bay. If you are the type of traveler that feels uncomfortable in a clean, nice place, Grotto Bay might be for you. Otherwise, my advice would be to look elsewhere.", "title": "Easy-going travelers not easy-going enough for Grotto Bay", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Ben1400", "date": "November 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 6182386, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Close to the bus so that we could get away from it.", "disliked": "\u2014 everything (cleanliness, service, overall experience)"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just returned from Grotto Bay and had a wonderful time.

Our room smelled like a dirty drunken sailer when we first got there,.. but were able to correct it with candles... Room size was fine... big king-size, refrigerator. We liked the caves on the property... very interesting... breakfast buffet was good but some items were cold. Weather was constantly changing but overall was very good, over 75 degrees.. Went to Horshshoe Bay one day and had a great day full of sunshine.... Bus is convenient, but a tad far away and gets to be a drag by day 3... Will definately be going back to Bermuda...
