He has had a stroke, and uses a wheelchair or a cane to get around. We wanted a small property that was fairly accessible. We were not disappointed. The hotel is compact, and I could get him anywhere... except the beach without much problem. A couple of the ramps are steep, but the employees are eager to help, and readily available. The only way to the beach are stairs. We tried it one day, and it was just too hard. It would be nice if there was a ramp access, but for the handicapped, even if you get there, you're going to have a tough time in the sand anyway. The rooms are nice, although a couch for relaxing would be a good addition. We had a great balcony... unfortunately, it overlooked the outdoor evening steak cookout, so the smoke was so bad, we had to shut our door. The only other area that definitely needs improvement is the shower water temp; switches from very hot to cold every day. Again, the service is 5 star, the food is 4 star, the privacy and enjoyment is 5 star, and the location for a peaceful getaway is also 5 star. If someone wants to be close to the famous Cancun drinking bars this is not the place... but it is for adults only, most of which were couples or family members... very few \"wild\" ones. There are activities by the pool each day, and shows every night (we didn't attend, but I hear they are nice). Also, part of the all inclusive includes being able to go to any other Palace resort. Though we didn't take advantage of this, it's a great benefit. Remember, it is SMALL... more like a boutique hotel; perfect for us. If you are looking for lots of shops, more activities, water slides, big gardens... this is NOT for you. Finally, the city bus stops right outside the hotel door, and makes it very easy to get to shopping, etc. for 65 cents a trip. The Timeshare folks are not too overbearing, as they can be at some hotels.

There are always people working and cleaning everything. Our sweet housekeeper kept our room immaculate and fridge stocked, she even made swans with rose petals out of our towels on the bed! The staff was very friendly and it is clear that customer service it at the top of their list. We got room service for breakfast 2 of our 4 days and each time something was delivered to the room, it was followed by a follow up phone call to make sure everything was to our liking. The room is stunning and I felt like we were practically in the ocean, the view was so amazing. Nice pools, lots of lounge chairs on the beach, and they have waitstaff that brings drinks and food if you wish right to you. I never had to wait too long for a drink at all. The food was very good, the restaurants had a gourmet flair to them which was a nice touch. There are 4 restaurants, we ate at them all and had to say that 'The steak' was our favorite, but we love food on an open grill. The other restaurants were great too. The Italian restaurant had a nice wine list.
