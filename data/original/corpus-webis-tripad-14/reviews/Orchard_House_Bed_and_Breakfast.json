Situated a few minutes walk from the centre of Ledbury, Orchard House is yet quiet and tranquil, providing a warm, welcoming and relaxing experience. The room was delightfully decorated and furnished - the extra large bed a boon as husband is 6ft 2. The bathroom was great with both a large bath and separate shower. Jane provided a wonderful breakfast which set us up for the whole day.

I stayed here with my daughter to attend the Friends of the Dymock Poets autumn conference in October 2012. Jane Churchill put us up in her best bedroom, but at the price we had agreed for her second room. She went the extra mile, replacing the double bed with twins and giving us a lift to the station. Our room was elegant, well-appointed and spacious, with the most luxurious bathroom. Downstairs guests have the run of the garden and a lounge with a piano.

I had tried to get into several Ledbury pubs but they were all full, being that it was bank holiday weekend. Then I found Orchard House on the web just by chance and what a wonderful fluke that turned out to be. The house looked and sounded wonderful on the website but on arrival it surpassed all expectations. The hosts were super friendly, helpful and welcoming on our arrival. The room (Mulberry) was a beautiful large room with a stunning view from the bay window, where you could sit and have your morning tea. I loved everything about the room, from the gorgeous decor, lovely furniture, huge enourmous super comfy bed, lovely welcome tray including home made biccies and fresh milk in the fridge. Oh, and the bath room which was bigger than my bedroom at home. It had a freestanding deep bath(for me) and a separate big shower (for hubby).", "title": "lovely Ledbury visit", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bowiechoc", "date": "September 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139527032}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled solo", "text": "I spent four nights at this fantastic bed and breakfast and can't praise it enough.
