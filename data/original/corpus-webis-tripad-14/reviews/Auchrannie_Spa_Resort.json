We all had a treatment, which again was very relaxing and the girl that done mine, was very nice. With regards to the party night, the meal was absolutely beautiful. And the service was great. The only think i didnt like was that because our party was quite small, our table was at the far end of the hall away from everyone else, so we kind of felt quite out of it. And unfortunately, because the other two people in my group were extremely tired from their treatment earlier on, they left as soon as the tables started to get cleared, which meant i had to go along with them.
