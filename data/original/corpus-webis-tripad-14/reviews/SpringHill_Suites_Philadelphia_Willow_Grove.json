The rooms are larger than average. The quality of the accomodations were above average. The pool is very nice and there is a separate jacuzzi. The breakfast buffet includes everything one needs for a full breakfast. Staff was very helpful. I would have liked a tip jar for the breakfast staff but there wasn't one. As a business person I really like the hard wired high speed internet because it is much more secure than wireless. Even casual users should feel safer using a credit card or checking a statement than on a wireless setup.
