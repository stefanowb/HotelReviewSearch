I like so many others had read the reviews. This is my third trip to Jamaica, but the first time I have stays at Rooms. First of all when we checked in we had paid for Ocean View with Balcony, 2 rooms, but they were not available, so they put us in two Junior Suites, with the promise that we would receive our Ocean View Rooms the next day. Well the next day came & we still did not have the Ocean/Balcony rooms, they overbooked the hotel and there were just not enough rooms. They informed us they would continue to look. The front desk is not to friendly especially Shanda she is rude and will roll her eyes at you in a minute. The manger is better. Well they informed one of our party that they could get our rooms on Tuesday night, we checked in on Sunday and were leaving on Thursday. We had already unpacked so we stayed where we were. The bath rooms could be cleaner and the tile on the floor. The worse part is the towels, you have to almost sale your first born to get them to bring you towels. We were infomed that there was a towel shortage and they prefer if you reuse your towels for days at a time. (no way). The continental breakfast is the same each day, toast, danish, muffins, jelly, coffee and juice. No fruit, can you believe it . An island with fruit hanging from every tree and none at breakfast. I don't know about the lunches are suppers at the restaurant. I only saw a couple people eating there. Well enough of the negative, the beach was beautiful, Rooms sits right on the beach, the drinks were GOOD and reasonable. We visited Bob Marley's Village up in the hills, Dunn River Water Fall and off course the Straw Market and T-shirt Warehouse. The hotel is located in a very good spot, with all the shops you can walk to and places to eat. We loved Mama Marley's.

We were very disappointed. I will start with the beach. In pictures we noticed that about 50 -100 feet out it was roped off. Being people who love swimming in the ocean and snorkeling, this made us nervous. So much so, that we called the hotel prior to booking our vacation. We were told by the hotel staff that they were not sure what the ropes were in the pictures but assured us that there were no problems with the beach or the water. We then asked if there was snorkeling right off of the beach or if we had to take a boat out. We were told that we could opt for a boat but that snorkeling from the beach was just fine. This was all lies! The water is roped off because the hotel sits only yards from where the cruise ships come in. So not only can you not swim out far or snorkel for fear of being hit by a boat, there is also no view of the ocean from the beach or your room. We spent 4 days staring at the side of 2-3 cruise ships. Because we had called and asked before booking our stay this made us very angry. On our second day, we decided to take a boat out past the ships to snorkel. We were told 65 US dollars for 90 minutes of snorkeling. We tried to negotiate but they stood firm. Asking around we found out that most of the boat owners in that general area were brothers, cousins and friends so the $65 rate was very firm! We decided to go out since snorkeling was one of the main reasons we go to the beach. At first we were pleasantly surprised...the boat was a glass bottom boat. When we got out about 10 yards past the ships and the captain dropped anchor we were mad. Being in the shipping lanes, the water was stirred and mirky and fish were few and far between. I asked the captain if he would take us out further and was told if we wanted to pay the daily rate of several hundred dollars he would take us out \"a little further\". Having realized we had been taken, we decided to make the best of it. After 1 hour of snokeling, the captain pulled anchor and called us in. When we complained that it had only been an hour (not the 90 mins we were told) we were told that the 90 minutes of snorkeling included travel time. The whole thing is just a scam. On day three we decided to go looking for a beach to snorkel from. My husband and I are seasoned travelers and walking through huge cities like NY and Chicago or the jungles in Mexico don't bother us. But by the third or fourth block we realized we were in over our heads. Downtown Ocho Rios (not the touristy section where the markets are but the \"locals\" downtown) is not a safe place even at 1oclock in the afternoon! We took a cab and asked him to take us somewhere we could snorkel. We went 4 blocks he stopped told us we were there and that we owed him 7 us dollars. Even by NY standards that was a rip-off! The place he took us was a little better, sorry don't know the name of it.
