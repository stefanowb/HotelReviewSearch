The hotel was very quiet. Right off I-75. Rooms had 2 full beds and a full size sleeper sofa. I just couldnt get the air conditioner to work to my liking. It would run all night without turning off. The room would be freezing until I shut it off, then it would become to warm. I think this was probably operator error! The room and bathroom were average size. Room was clean. Breakfast was good. Krispy creme donuts, great coffee, small selection of cereal and fruit, make your own pancakes.Scramble eggs ran out about 9am and no more were made. Two computers in the business center, or free wifi in your room. Hotel is around 25 mins to Silver Springs. Mall is one exit away. Wanted to go horseback riding, but couldnt find a place that had trailrides-even though you are in horse country.
