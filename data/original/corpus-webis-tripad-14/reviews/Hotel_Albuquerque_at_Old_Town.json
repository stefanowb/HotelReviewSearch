The rooms are a good size and the beds very comfortable. Each room has a small angled balcony that affords great views of the surrounding area if high enough. The bathroom is a bit small, but there is a nice dressing table area with a good makeup mirror and large mirrored door closet directly outside the bathroom. Unfortunately, the bathroom door opens right into the toilet. A pocket door would be better. Good lighting throughout the entire room. The decor throughout the hotel is Southwestern, which suits its Albuguergue location. The grounds are lovely, with many mature trees and interesting shrubbery. The pool is immense and there is a hot tub, firepit, large provided towels and many comfortable lounges and chairs around the pool. There is also an on grounds chapel with a little separate courtyard and a lovely fountain just outside it and the pool. The main lobby is beautifully quaint, with high beamed ceiling and shiny dark adobe style tile floors. The hotel would be a perfect wedding setting. The only negative was the service time in the cafe. The waitstaff, while trying to be accommodating, seemed overwhelmed at breakfast when they were busy. They were very disorganized, causing an extremely long wait before we received any menus or before they took our orders. Food arrived fairly promptly once we ordered, however. I think a dedicated host or hostess is needed in the cafe to help supervise the operation. Food for our group dinners was good and plentiful on all three nights of our reunion, especially on our last night there. It was a sit down banquet style affair with a very tender steak plus salmon topped with a spicy mango salsa. Steak was cooked perfectly, which is often not the case at convention hotels. All in all a very pleasant place to stay when visiting Albuquerque.
