Check-in was no problem and our room was in the Tower (3rd floor). Overall the room was clean and everything worked ok. The carpet was in bad shape in a number of places and the sliding door to the balcony was in dire need of repair. The door would open but the sides of the door would wobble badly when the door was opened. The balcony was nice but very dusty. We think the maids would dump the dirt/dust from the rooms above and it landed on the balcony of the lower rooms. This meant that each evening everything that was left on the balcony (towels) was covered with a fine layer of dirt and dust. Our travel agent had told us the room would have two queen beds, in reality all the double rooms (according to the front desk) had double beds, and not queens. Not a big deal unless you\u2019re expecting to get 2 people to bed -- the smaller beds made for very uncomfortable sleeping. Lesson learned \u2013 check with the hotel about the rooms if you have any doubts. We ended up having one of the kids sleep on a fold-out-bed, not comfortable but better than the previous night. We went to the family BBQ that was on Wednesday night on the beach at the hotel, the food was ok. A bit pricey for BBQ, but we enjoyed it. We went on the free cruise around the bay. Is you time it right you can take the cruise during the Sea World fireworks \u2013 the kids enjoyed that but were mostly bored by the cruise (not much to see or do for kids). We had heard the beach right across the street from the hotel had a more rowdy crowd so we decided to go to La Jolla for the beach. La Jolla was an easy, quick drive and the beaches were beautiful. We ate dinner most nights at the hotels restaurant. The food and service were fine, except for one night. One night we went to the restaurant and along with everyone else in our section ended up waiting 30 to 40 minutes for menus and to even see our waiter for the first time. I made a number of trips to talk with the manager, who said the waiter was on their way, but again we waited. Normally we would have left but we were going on the cruise that night and didn\u2019t want to waste any more time driving somewhere. Eventually a waiter was sent, he offered a lame excuse (they were very busy and understaffed) and apology and that was it \u2013 we expected maybe a free drink or appetizer but we but got nothing for the wait. The restaurant manager never even stopped by to say anything to us, or the 3 other tables that also waited. The pool area was nice and the bar made it easy to get a quick drink. The game room is located by the pool and all games are free - the kids loved that. Although the hotel is badly in need of an upgrade we did enjoy the tropical feel of the resort. Unless the hotel gets upgraded soon we probably would consider other resorts before the Catamaran.", "title": "Nice Tropical Feel, But A Bit Outdated", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "aperio", "date": "September 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 8655937, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Tropical Feel", "disliked": "\u2014 Outdated rooms"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The front drive of the Catamaran looks as impressive as the pictures on the internet.
