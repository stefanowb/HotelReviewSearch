The staff were very friendly, there were good parking facilities and it was very well located. The room was huge, exceptionally clean and looked brand new! Ticks all round! We were greeted warmly by the staff and you could tell that they take pride in their hotel and want to help where they can. We had a corner room which was huge!! Lovely big flat screen TV and large bathroom (no tub but that did not matter to us). Breakfast was included and it was lovely - hot and cold options and presented well. The only thing I thought odd was that they used paper plates and plastic cutlery - this did not matter to us at all as the hotel and breakfast area was lovely but because the hotel was so well presented it didn't seem to fit the ambience if that makes sense. This may well be to keep costs down. I would definitely stay again and recommend to others. You can certainly tell why the hotel consistently gets such good reviews and well deserved they are too!

We reserved a room with a balcony and it was definitely worth the extra few dollars. The balcony was spacious with a nice roundtable and four chairs which we used each evening for our happy hour.
