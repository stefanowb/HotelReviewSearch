Chose the Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower because it was across the street from a restaurant where we were meeting family. The service at this place was spot on. Literally five minutes after check in, the doormen, concierge and front desk staff was calling us my name. They handed my boys Trump Hotel, Chicago baseball caps on the way to the elevator and were gracious without being gratuitous. We were in room 1429, a spa room which means big bathroom I think. The room itself was done in a more contemporary way than I typically like - more like the Park Hyatt Chicago than the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton. There were coffee stains on the end tables, but other than that, the room appeared clean and well kept. My absolute biggest issue with the room was the all the gadgetry. Never did figure out how to turn on or off the bathroom lights. The phone only worked as a speaker phone. Curtains open with buttons. A heavy, frosted sliding glass door to the bathroom that didn't shut completely. But back to the service - turndown was perfect, leaving popcorn, root beer and water. Upon leaving, the valet brought our car and it had four bottles of cold water, one in each cup holder. All inexpensive touches, but certainly nothing that I seen at the Park Hyatt or Four Seasons in Chicago. Room was $475 for a Sunday night in keeping with other hotels of a similar brand. After *many* contiguous nights at the PH and FH in the past, they had no idea who I was or cared to be bothered.
