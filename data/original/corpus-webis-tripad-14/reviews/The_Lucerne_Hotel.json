The staff is very friendly and helpful, the hotel is beautiful, and the location is excellent. There is a subway stop just one block away, and many destinations, restaurants, shops and Central Park are within an easy walking distance. The hotel is located in a very safe, family-friendly neighborhood. I shared a one room double with my daughter, and the room was really nice, clean, quiet and comfortable.

We had a suite, giving us a small sitting room, which was great, and well worth the extra expense (2 parents, 2 teenage daughters). It was really clean and comfortable, but the best thing was the location, just 3 blocks from Central Park and the tour bus pick-up outside the Natural History Museum. It was also near a subway station, with just a few stops to Times Square. The breakfasts (15% off at the attached restaurant) were lovely, and offered a good variety, ranging from fruit to the New York Heartattack! When we needed a taxi, the doormen were great at finding one, and it was very reasonable. On a wider front, we loved New York, and were amazed at how clean everywhere was, and how friendly everyone was.

The location is great for our itinerary since we walked to everything - the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park and Central Park Zoo, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Children's Musuem of Manhattan, and Times Square. We go to H and H Bagels, Zabar's, Patsy's, and Celeste all of which are within a 5 to 10 minutes walk. We almost didn't book the hotel due to the cost but we were able to get a reasonable rate since it was August. We are now spoiled and my husband doesn't want to stay anywhere else!

A bonus was to discover that the Upper West Side has become more fashionable lately and there are lots of lively restaurants/bars on Amsterdam, right round the corner. The a/c was fine and it was a bonus to be able to open room windows. There was very little traffic noise on 12th floor.
