To our surprise Sabrina was the one who greeted us. From the start it was an outstanding experience. This was a birthday gift from my husband and I was never disappointed! Our room was beautiful, it was called \"The Old Oak.\" Sabrina explained all the workings of the Inn, when breakfast was served, and how we could make coffee earlier if we wanted. She also mentioned that at 5 p.m. they served wine, beverages and hors d' oeuvres, and hoped we would join the other guests. My husband asked about some dinner choices and she gave us excellent suggestions. The next morning we were served a 3 course Gourmet Breakfast!! The food was fantastic! We had 3 of these lovely Gourmet Breakfast's and everyone was wonderful. I even asked for a couple of the recipes and Jennifer was more than glad to get them. On our way home 3 days later we looked at each other and said this was most definitely a place we will come back to. We were sorry we hadn't booked 5 nights.
