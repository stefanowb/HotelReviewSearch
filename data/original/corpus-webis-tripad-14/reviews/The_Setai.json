The rooms are amazing because they are the best in South Beach. We usually stay at the Delano but decided to try something different this time. The rooms here are way better than the delano and the pool area is larger but not as hip. I didn't try the beach but my family members who did said the beach was not as nice as the Delano's. Even if you never stay here, you must have dinner at the hotel's restaurant at least once. It is excellent. The decor is modern with an heavy asian flair. The common areas are very clean. Upon check in you are guided to your room and all the gadgets in your room are explained to you. Listen closely, you will need a PHD to figure out the lighting system. Pool attendants were good and the sun beds were plenty unlike Delano where you have to bribe and beg to get one. The gym is very small and there is nothing available to wipe down the machines after using them. The spa looks nice but is very overpriced. This is a great hotel but the service is less than perfect. For 1000 dollars plus tax a night, service MUST be perfect. I can't even begin to detail what went wrong with this property from the time of reservation making ( I booked 3 rooms at 1000 each and was treated like I was booking a room at Motel 6 plus the girl barely spoke english) all the way up to departure. I detailed to them which family members were staying in what room, who had kids, who was celebrating an anniversary, and what names to put each room under. If one of us ordered an iron, it went to someone else's room. Flowers were delivered to the wrong room also. Each room comes with a beach bag but our room didn't have one so I called housekeeping and it arrived 45 minutes later. I had to call again after waiting 30 minutes for it. Service in the lounge was so slow even though we told them we have a flight to catch. We ordered car service to the airport and even that was messed up. I couldn't understand for the life of me why this property thinks it's better than all the others in South Beach when it's service is so spotty. I notice that this hotel's website sometimes puts out deals for $650 a night so if you are a south beach regular and want to try this place, wait until then b/c it's not worth 1000 a night.

They cannot guide you to food, arts or even a New York Times on a Sunday. I was there one night before my husband, went to the concierge on duty and asked for a good restaurant bar I could eat at without being bothered. Though we've eaten at the Setai, it's just ok, I should have stayed put. At least the clientele are adults. He sent me to a place called \"Touch\" that featured disco lights, repulsive food and a barely dressed \"dancer\" and a drum kit. THAT is the recommendation from the concierge at the \"most sophisticated\" hotel in Miami. ai yi yi. The Setai also seems to be hitting rocky times as they now \"host\" two parties a week that turn the quiet oasis of a courtyard into a pulsating disco. One which I am sure those facing the courtyard in the small hotel rooms are privy to every second until it ends.If you must go, ask for a tower room. And, $6 for a single nescafe at breakfast with no refills is frankly insulting. Nothing special on the pool menus --if you eat there once, you're done which is a bummer because the Setai is out on the fringes and a bit of a hike to other venues.
