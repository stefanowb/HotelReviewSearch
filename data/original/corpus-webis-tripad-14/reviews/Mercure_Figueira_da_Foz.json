Hotel is directly across the street from the beach and walking distance to restaurants, cafes, and the casino. Which is what a love in a hotel's location. The hotel itself was also very nice, got a room with a balcony facing the beach. I was given a closed in balcony, room 301, which was nice but an open balcony would've been better. Still the view of that enormous beach is amazing. The staff was very welcoming and helpful, and the hotel was very clean. I forgot my 5 month old daughter's stuffed sleeping lamb in room and when I called later that day the hotel said nothing was recovered from that room, I guess it's to be expected at any hotel :(. I was able to find a parking spot right in front of the hotel, which was free, I guess going in mid september has it's benefits, even though Figueira was pretty dead at the time. This was my first time in Figueira da Foz, and only spent one night, but I believe I picked the right hotel. You cross the street and your on the sand, getting to the water isn't as easy(did I mention the beach is huge?), and your a short walk from the food and booze.
