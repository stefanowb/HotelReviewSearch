When we arrived, Barbara was picking fresh fava beans for the mornings brunch and was so gracious and helpful. Don, an angel for taking my in laws for a tour of the property in a golf cart. We took a hike around property. Great way to get a little exercise. My father in law was born in the area and was familiar with much of the history, so Don provided some reminicsing for him. We had a wonderful sleep in a comfortable bed and warm room surrounded by antiques. We can't say enough about the Union Hill Inn and its owners. We will be back. Thank you again, Barbara and Don, for a wonderful stay.", "title": "amazing", "user": "MDAdams858", "date": "May 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 110590551}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled solo", "text": "I just spent a glorious weekend at the Union Hill Inn. The food was amazing and the setting beautiful, filled with all kinds of perfect spots to dream and have a good time. I sat and watched a spectacular sunset over the rolling hills of the gold country. I relaxed on both the huge outdoor porch and later a hammock under the oak trees filled with japanese lanterns; slept in a big comfy bed in a dormer windowed meticulously redone attic room; There is so much to explore in the area, and the Union Hill Inn is the perfect place to stay while doing just that! Don and Barbara, along with their animals, are outstanding hosts. I'm looking forward to the chance to go back.", "title": "A glorious weekend!", "user": "ColumbiaPierce", "date": "May 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 64736105}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Sonora"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 2, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 20}, "aka": "Union Hill Hotel Sonora", "slim_ranking": 0.363636363636}
