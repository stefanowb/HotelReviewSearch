Armando and Rosalba Balestrazzi, purchased the farm 14 years ago, the only people outside the original family to have owned it. In search of a slower, healthier way of life, they traveled the whole of Italy, only to return to their native Pugliese soil where the time-honored rhythms of the land set the pace of their days. They have brought the abandoned house back to life and oversee the land, its produce and the gardens with a passion. Rosalba reigns in the kitchen where she recreates dishes of the past and newer innovative recipes using the products and herbs grown right outside her kitchen. The farmhouse has ten guestrooms, each one homey yet elegant. Outside, a shade garden and a nearby citrus grove add to the pleasure of the place, but it is in the evening, when guests are invited to succumb to the pleasures of the table (8 course- dinners), that makes a stay here so memorable.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 19, 2005", "id": 3488034}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "outstanding food and ambience", "text": "Loved this place and wish I could have stayed longer and tried the legendary dinner.

Our schedule has us staying at Il Frantoio for one night on May 1 which is a major public holiday in Italy. This was unfortunate because it meant we would not be able to one of Rosalba's famous dinners. (Am I using the word famous too much?) So you can imagine our delight when we arrived at lunch time to be welcomed with the words \"Welcome home!\" - not sure if that is a deliberate mistranslation of the phrase \"Bienvenuti a la nuestra casa\" (welcome to OUR home), but it was certainly very lovely. We had not made a reservation but a table was set for us outside (no room inside) and we were in heaven for the rest of the afternoon. Just before lunch we were taken on a tour of the gardens, orchards and the ancient olive presses from which Il Frantoio gets its name. Armondo, the owner, left a high position in a dairy factory to buy the abandoned farmhouse 17 years ago and he and Rosalba are clearly in their element there. Their love for what they do (organic farming, hospitality, living in the countryside) trickles down into everything at Il Frantoio and our stay there had almost a dreamlike quality.

Upon arrival at the Masseria, we were offered an apertif ( a special drink and local snacks of nuts, olives and Pugliese crackers), introduced to all the staff and generally felt the warmth of being welcomed into someone's home. Armando and Rosalba have done an excellent job of making guests feel welcome and comfortable. This is not a hotel, but a home, so if you are expecting a luxurious vacation stay this is not the place for you. Our room was the bridal suite, so it was very apropos for our celebration. The bed was comfortable (slightly smaller than a king size bed) and the room was bright and airy. The bathroom was large, with a tub and hand held shower. The grounds are beautiful and the patio area calm and relaxing. Everything was super clean, from the bathroom to the patio. A tour is given of the Masseria and the history is presented to understand the special place in which you have been welcomed. I found the cave to be the most interesting. This is a place where the olives were pressed and made into oil, all the original equipment still available to view. Plus it is a working storage area for the farm. Now for the absolute best reason to stay at the farm...the food. Breakfast was the typical Italian breakfast, meats, cheeses, fruit, yogurt, pastries and cakes. But here the fruits are bursting with freshness, the pastries ever so tender and delicious and the yogurt fresh from the farm. By all means make sure you have dinner at the Masseria. Every course, and there are between 6-10, is lovingly prepared with the freshest of ingredients, cooking only the foods of the season. Each course is prepared with a different olive oil from the farm and Armando presents each course with a story of it's origin, preparation or special ingredient. Also accompanying each course is an endless flow of local, organic wines. You are seated at tables with other guests, if you choose, or you can sit by yourself. We chose to sit with others and had wonderful conversation and made friendships we have saved in our hearts. After a day of site seeing or going to dinner in one of the many little towns nearby, we were welcomed back to the house with an after-dinner drink of the local Rosolio. Another nice touch was when we were invited to share a bottle of Prosecco by another couple staying at the house, we asked if they could put together a few snacks to go with our drink. Wow! They presented us a tray of salami, cheese, nuts, olives and the Pugliese crackers...and here's the best part, we were never charged for any of these little extras! We thought the costs were very fair, 88 euros per person per night and 53 euros per person for the dinner. We stayed 3 nights and wished we could have stayed one more so we could have enjoyed another dinner.
