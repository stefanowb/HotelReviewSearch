All we needed was a great place for the out of town bridal party and family to stay and be together. After contacting Deanna Rowe and touring the Homestead House B&B, we agreed to rent the entire house for this big event. The B&B was a perfect location for our family with walking distance to the spa for our hair and manicures, rehersal dinner at \"Oliver Twists,\" everything we needed was provided to us at the Homestead House. Each room was exquisitely decorated with elegance, generously sized, and private baths. The bed was very comfortable and the rooms are very quiet. This was a real bonus due to our need for sleep. Deanna provided a beautiful breakfast considering our needs to keep a tight schedule for all our arrangements. Fred was never seen until it was time to leave, but I am sure he was always busy. The Homestead House was very clean and organized, with good parking and a great front porch with nice rocking chairs to relax and watch. Location was a very big factor when booking this B&B because the wedding was at the Catholic church about 1/2 mile away. Willoughby has always been our favorite city to live, and now to visit. Now that the wedding is over, I am looking forward to visiting the Homestead House B&B for a relaxing stay for my husband and I. Deanna and Fred, thank you so much for helping to make this very special event so memorable and perfect for my daughter and her husband, and us. You are the best.
