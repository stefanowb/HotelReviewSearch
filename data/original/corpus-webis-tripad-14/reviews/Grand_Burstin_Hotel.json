A receptionist came onto the coach and explained what the \" crack \" was. As we got off the coach, she gave us our room keys, telling us which floor we were on and which wing and therefore avoiding the need to queue at reception. Our room was fairly basic but adequate and at least it was clean. We were overlooking the harbour, which to be fair isnt the best view in the world but we had asked for a sea view and at least we got it!! We ate in the Harbour restaurant and found the food to be of a high standard considering what we had paid. There was plenty of choice and certainly no need to go hungry.

Doorman lacked charm and humour when asked whether we had a reservation. He was refusing entry to anyone without a room key or card. At check in the receptionist mirrored the doorman. No warm welcome here, just practicalities. Once checked in we had to walk through the entertainment lounge to get to the lift to get to our room. It was teeming with a DJ, loud music and many patrons drinking in the very big lounge. All eyes on two people walking through with suitcases. Room was fine and clean. Decent shower and bathroom but room was a twin when a double was requested (resulted from credit card error detailed above).
