It was not our first time in the Boston-Cambridge area; I come there frequently for work. The Marlowe is too posh, really cheesy and expensive for its quality. Rooms are confortable but the decoration is just cheesy and heavy, unless you like leopard bathrobres, fur blankets and dark colours everywhere. The service is not up to the image they want to sell: on a Sunday night someone was passing the vacum-cleaner at 9pm. We had to ask for a coffee maker since there is none in the room and when they did give one to us, they just left it over the sink in the bathroom. No one helped us carry our luggage to the taxi and, when we checked out, we had to go get a taxi ourselves since no one at the front desk could help us. We paid $60 for two average sandwiches and desserts; just outrageously expensive. Yes, the hotel is located close to the mall and not far from the Technology Museum or the T stop but, other than that, it is really in the middle of nowhere.

Albiet this was ordered at 4am due to jet lag and because no in-room tea making facilities are provided, only coffee makers, room service was the only option. The \"executive\" gym is tiny - too small for the number of guests wanting to use it not to mention the workout required to find it. No pool or spa amenties, which would have been a nice plus for what is deemed a 5-star hotel. Bedroom very spacious with great views of the Charles River, however felt stifled by the constant air conditioning.

Upon arrival I got a glass of wine in the lounge area (designed to be more like a big, cozy living room than a lobby area) and wonderful jazz music when entering the room. The rooms was larger than average (compared to Marriott or Westin in similar price ranges), very clean, and decorated in a hip, modern fashion.
