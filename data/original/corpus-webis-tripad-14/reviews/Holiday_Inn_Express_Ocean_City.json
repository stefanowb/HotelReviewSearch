I am a pool person so I chose this hotel for the hot tub and pool first then considered the room. The room we had overlooked the bay and smack over the Winterfest lights so if that is your thing this is the perfect hotel at that time. Our room was smallish but neat and clean and good for two of us. The front desk was fine, we are priority members and stayed on points, we were not offered water or gift bags or anything like that which was fine by us because that may help in keeping the prices as low as they are at this time of the year. Also the only toiletries in the room is shampoo and conditioner but the note said you can have other necessities on demand, I just wanted lotion, this too was fine, I loved the price if we were paying. There is a really nice refrigerator which was really cold if set all the way up it semi froze our water etc., microwave nice too. Now to the best part of this hotel: The Pool!!! It was steamy in a rather cold room....no problem because you just want to get in the water and stay there it was in the high eighties, no kidding, I had it all to myself both days as this is the slow season. The hot tub is a corner part of the pool and was nice and hot, little jet issues but no worries it serves its purpose. I really didn't even need the tub becasue the pool was balmy and no shivering getting back in the pool from the hot tub. Ok so the place is not spectacularly 5 star but is in good repair and very clean. The area is home to numerous seafood restaurants many of which were closed for the winter but the Crabcake factory is just two blocks away open year round and had amazing food and fries and REALLY strong drinks. There is a Denny's not too far away for breakfast...oh that is if you sleep past 9:30 for the free breakfast.We looked at the 6600 Holiday inn and the 1701 also on this strip and further down the strip near the end and they looked really nice from the outside and directly on the water but thanks to the reviewers here who said they were dated we went with this one and had a good time. We did have trouble when they changed the wi-fi password and didn't give us the correct info we had to do some digging, but that was minor. All in all if you like peace and quiet and lazing around in a nice hot pool while the cold wind whips outside and you can see the five (now brown) palm trees waving around outside while you warm up your bones... I say go and relax here. Good value in the off season and a nice getaway.", "title": "Ahhhhhhh-ma-zing Pool", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Myrts78", "date": "December 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 148006770}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have stayed here several times this year....the last 3 days in a 2 week period.

Courtious and helpful staff. It is located on the bay side of main street, but short walk to the beach. The breakfast meal is a winner, unless you want a formal breakfast. The room was clean. There was a minor problem with the tub drain, but was tolerable. I think they have a smokers section, so smoke does not spew into other area. We'll likely stay here again. Oh, the community park located behind the inn is great for running, biking, or walking. Sit on the benches, watch the ducks, or the crabbers along the extended walking deck to the bay area. (My wife and I did not like the italian restruant located behind the Inn), but this was several years ago...cups, utensels, found its way in the artificial greenery and left there, next to the tables.
