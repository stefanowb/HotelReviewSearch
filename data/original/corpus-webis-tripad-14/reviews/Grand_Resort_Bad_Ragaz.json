{"user_rating": 5.0, "review_count": 168, "name": "Grand Resort Bad Ragaz", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Surely this hotel complex which also includes the Hof Ragaz must be one of the most fabulous resorts in the world. I give full five-star ratings to all the above six criteria because there simply is nothing to complain about - if you want real luxury and are prepared to pay for it, this is the place. We stayed at the new \"Spa lofts\" which leave nothing to be desired, once you have mastered the rather complicated lighting system. Spa treatment superb, food as well. If you do not want to eat the rather rich food at the \"Bel Air\" restaurant, there are several other restaurants within the \"Grand Resort\" and outside, i.e. in the Bad Ragaz village. Lovely countryside with two golf courses and some of Switzerland's best vineyards (do try the local red wine from Fl\u00e4sch village). If you wish the spa treatment, try the \"Vino Therapy\", a real treat, but massages are excellent as well. In both piano bars, the pianists are excellent. We would definitely like to return to this resort but would probably choose a slightly cheaper accommodation, e.g. at Hof Ragaz, linked to the Quellenhof. Some of Switzerland's most famous ski resorts are very easily reached, either in your own car or by public transport. So is the Lake Constance but avoid the German side (Lindau) because of terrible traffic congestion. Bregenz (Austria) is okay.", "title": "Superb!", "user": "blacklab", "date": "September 14, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 79525033}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled on business", "text": "This is a really nice hotel with almost the best breakfast I ever had.
