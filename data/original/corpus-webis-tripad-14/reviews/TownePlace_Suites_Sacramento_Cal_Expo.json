The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was convenient - close to a freeway but very quiet. The room was great - nicely decorated with two club chairs, two queen beds, a dining table for four that doubled as a desk and a full kitchen, including good size refrigerator, cook-top, dishwasher and microwave. The bathroom had a very nice tub/shower, very nice fixtures and a few amenities.", "user": "GinOaklandCA", "date": "December 26, 2007", "id": 11969302}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Comfortable three nights", "text": "We didn't use the pool or exercise facilities.
