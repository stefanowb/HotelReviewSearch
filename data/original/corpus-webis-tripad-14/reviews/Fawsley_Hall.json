Adored the spacious room and huge en-suite, comfy large bed, views of the beautiful countryside. Very clean- the bathroom in particular was sparklingly clean. Plenty of hot water, a powerful shower, lovely products, the room was warm enough without being too hot. A small fridge was provided, which was lovely to pop a bottle of wine in we had bought along.Check-in was quite late, 3pm, so don't race to get there unless you want to have lunch beforehand. We very much enjoyed our lunch, valentine meal and breakfast.Not sure the set valentine meal was worth the price, but a lovely idea and menu nevertheless. We went along to the spa for a swim but unfortunately the boiler had broken with the cold snap we've just had and the pool was too cold to go in. The outdoor hot tub/jacuzzi wasn't hot enough either, which was a shame because we'd have loved to spend some time in it. We didn't have any treatments because they were fully booked, so i think the spa is popular- so book early if you can. Overall thoroughly recommended for a romantic break.", "title": "Great romantic get away in the middle of the countryside", "user": "SARobinson", "date": "February 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 124525311}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We visited Fawsley Hall for our Romantic Valentines Weekend and its the best place to go in the UK. The staff were very helpful, friendly and would do anything for you if asked. The food was outstanding even though I dont experiment outside my comfort zone I was so happy that I did as the taste was superb, compliments to the Chef, however if you decide to dine here you must book early as it got very busy throughout the evening and the staff was stretched which in turn seemed to be working under pressure. You must try the afternoon tea as its an experience in its self being in the Great Hall with all the history around you. Also I would recommend you to book the 1575 Suite as its amazing and huge, I walked in and was stunned with the character of the room and couldnt believe all the space and rooms that belonged to the suite. We went for a walk around the grounds and as you can gather we had snow this weekend and the scenery was fantastic. The Spa was very relaxing and we enjoyed every second of it.

If possible we try to avoid Valentines events as generally you don't get the best service, but decided to do it anyway. If you're expecting clinical perfection; forget it. This is a stunning hotel in a beautiful location, I experienced a deluxe facial and it was to die for; I was so relaxed I nearly forgot where I was. Sadly the outdoor jacuzzi which is usually 38 degrees was malfunctioning and freezing so it wasn't to be. The bar is small for the size of the hotel and could do with being a bit more relaxed perhaps a few comfy sofas; if you know what I mean, its a bit like a small dining area. We booked the Valentines menu at \u00a357 per head and reserved a table at 8:30. We enjoyed a couple of pre dinner drinks in the hall which is quite frankly superb, but the open fire which is the crucial centrepiece went out whilst we were sat there and no-one rushed to relight it. We were ready to eat early and went to the table around 8 and we're so glad that we did. We ordered all 3 courses with the promise of sorbet and peach scnapps in and amongst. The service was slow and we heard our waitress apologise to the next table; saying that they were short staffed. The restaurant filled up quickly after our arrival and we enjoyed our starter and the sorbet but had an unusually long wait for our main course; around an hour if the truth were known. During this time at least 2 couples on other tables got up and left, one quietly, the other not so quietly; in fact kicked up rather a lot of fuss. We felt very sorry for the waiting staff who clearly were not to blame but there didn't appear to be anyone in charge who was willing to soothe the situation. The peach schapps never arrived and our sweet arrived a further hour after the mains. One very patient couple waited 2 hours for their starter.... come on Fawsley, you can do much better than this. All that said, we were not in any particular rush, there's nowhere else to go and the surroundings are just lovely, we just sat back and waited and we couldn't fault the food. The beds are SO comfortable; we stayed in a club room and slept really well. Breakfast was good and our waitress from the previous evening apologised to us for the service and said it was a disaster but they did the best they could. I told her she had nothing to apologise for; she looked after us very well; a maitre D could make things flow a whole lot better!", "title": "Service could be better", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Ladyfivestar", "date": "February 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 124487741}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned from a weekend stay at Fawsley hall,the hotel itself was fantastic.", "title": "Lovely Hotel,Service could be better", "user": "mrsmythe", "date": "February 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 124481047}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012", "text": "We had a beautiful room up on the second floor with great views over towards the church.The first night we ate in the Brasserie which was good but could have been better,the service was very slow with no water or bread being offered so had to be asked for, even more annoying was \u00a328 service charge being put onto the bill,however the equilibrium was outstanding, service was superb and food just amazing!", "title": "Shame the service lets it down", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Stevenev", "date": "February 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 124263127}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "What a wonderful building and magnificent setting. Our expectations were high having read the reviews. What a disappointment, not with the building but lack of attention to detail and staff training. The radiator in the room could not be adjusted so even with the windows open we roasted. The TV did not work. There was no marmalade at breakfast or yoghurt and the tea and coffee were served lukewarm from flasks. The check in and check out experience was efficient but not particularly welcoming or interested. We were not asked if we had enjoyed our stay, something that is usually asked in the most basic establishment.
