This time I stayed on the \"executive\" floor which is the 6th floor. Even though our room was the furthest from the beach the view was still great. Nice balcony to sit outside. Free drinks and breakfast were a bonus. I booked a suite which has a living area and king size bed and was quite spacious. Don't get me wrong, this is not an upscale hotel but the rooms were clean and quiet and the location write on the beach was excellent. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. I have been to Cocoa beach multiple times and this is probably the best hotel overall on the beach .", "title": "Good location", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "spyderwoman", "date": "September 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8670540, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location on the beach"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for the first time on August 12-15, 2007. I was a little aprehensive due to some of the negative reviews. Let me just say that our stay here was PERFECT!!! We stayed in a partial ocean view room (see pics above). Positives? Room was kept very clean everyday. Very friendly and helpful staff. I've stayed in quite a few 3 star hotels throughout my life and my boyfriend and I agree that this hotel has the most comfortable bed of any we've stayed in! We always had plenty of towels, and other supplies. Very good location! We only ate breakfast at the onsite restuarant but it was delicious . Another great restuarant close by that we highly recommend is \"Coconuts on the Beach\". We ate there twice during our 3 night stay. Best burgers ever.
