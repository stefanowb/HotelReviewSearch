Ice machine was broken and the bar keep (who the the front desk manager directed me to) said it stayed broken.

While some reviews say it smells HORRIBLE, it really isn't all THAT horrible. Just stale and can tell the rooms were all once smoking rooms. I am a smoker and still noticed it. The couple that went with us had a broken bed and a broken coffee maker. I could tell that while it APPEARED fairly clean, for that money, I did not want to see dust on carpet around furniture, gum candy and dust in ac vents, etc. The lounge? Well its definitely still in 1970's decor, small, dark and got a little awkward later in the evening after we attended the godsmack concert and wanted a beer. Just too OPENLY GAY for me. I have no problem with gay but I don't like to see heterosexual people grinding and humping eachother. The drinks ARE inexpensive!! If you run in real quick and chug you'll be fine. I have also been made aware that all rooms are pet friendly. We all know what THAT means!! Thiats probably why it has a stink about it. I HAVE stayed at worse, but, that was a 13.00 hotel outside of FT. Benning GA. Back in the late 80's. However, I wouldn't plan another stay at this HOJOS! Ever! Unless it truly was $45.00.

The pillows were old and had long passed their time...should have been thrown out 20 years ago.The carpet in the room was nasty and I'm certain had not been vacuumed in the last month if not year. The bathroom had mold on the ceiling above the shower and the shower curtain was stained. We had asked for additional towels as there were only 2 in the room. We had to ask 3 times to receive towels that have probably been around since they opened 50 years ago. They were very thin and one had a hole in it.

It's an okay place to stay if you're drunk and need a place to sleep it off. It is NOT a family friendly hotel. Often times, you'll reserve the room online for $50, and when you go to check in, it's $70 or more. When I plan on staying at hojos, I pack a kit with my own bedding and lots of lysol.
