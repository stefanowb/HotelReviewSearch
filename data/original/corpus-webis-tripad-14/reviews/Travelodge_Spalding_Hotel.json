Would not recommend you have the Sunday lunchtime carvery though, stick to the menu items. Just up the road ( 5 mins by car) towards Boston is a Morrisons Supermarket and you can get an excellent breakfast or evening meal there.

The removal of any artwork and curtains gave the room a stark and depressing feel. The lack of any toiletries and hotel literature again added to this feeling.

Two thin pillows were supplied and a single extra one was provided on a shelf, however this was stained and a rolled up jumper was used in place of using the second pillow.
