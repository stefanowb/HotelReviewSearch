The first thing we asked when we arrived on Friday was where the make=up case was. The desk clerk (who was the one I spoke with on the phone) went to the back and got the case (in a plastic bag). I opened it and noticed my pill box was missing along with one of those little silk jewelry pouches. I said something immediately. She said was I sure, I said I would check my carry on again, but I was pretty sure. Went to the room and checked all our luggage-nothing! Went back down and said it was not there. Asked if they had drug addicts on the staff as I had Vicodin and Tramadol and some over the counter sleeping pills in the pill case that was missing. I got blank stares. I was told they would look again-I asked again on Saturday and they called the housekeeper. She would not look at me and said they found nothing.
