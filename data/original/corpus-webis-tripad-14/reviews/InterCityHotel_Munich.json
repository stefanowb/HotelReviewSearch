The rooms are clean and fairly quiet, but very small. The d\u00e9cor is plain. The surrounding neighborhood appears to be fairly safe, but is slightly seedy. The U-bahn & S-bahn just are a few steps away. The hotel includes a free pass to the public transportation system as part of the cost of the room. The center of Munich, the city hall & etc., is about a 10 to 15 minute walk.", "title": "convenient location", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "34isit", "date": "November 23, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4140162}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great hotel, great price", "text": "This hotel is PERFECT for the traveler(s) who are taking the train and have some luggage they are toting while trying to stay on a travel budget! It is right beside the train station, literally around the corner. I was hesitant to book it at first but after reading the reviews and finding and AWESOME deal online (75 USD for double bed room!) I went ahead and did it. Although you are literally beside the loud train station, it is not a big deal because they have double paned windows which get rid of ALL of the noise! no problems there! The rooms are very contemporary and bathrooms/entire place is very clean and neat. Does not seem like a less expensive hotel. Rooms are average size for Germany- not large like rooms in US, but standard for Europe. Hotel staff was EXTREMELY friendly and accomodating. upon checkin you receive a free in town transportation pass which is very helpful and saves you 11 euros per person per day. If you have 2 ppl in the room, they give you 2 passes per person per day that you are staying with them. That is like 22 euros savings for 2 ppl per day! do the math! that perk is worth it to stay there! PLUS no worries for a taxi if you took the train there because it is right there, even if you have a lot of luggage. Very nice walk to the Marionplatz area which is the tourist area. Not a problem to get around, you can even take the underground train to get to the city center in minutes! WONDERFUL hotel!! Would definitely stay there again!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 6, 2005", "id": 4089103}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 34, "average": 119, "very good": 200, "terrible": 19, "excellent": 64}, "aka": "Munich Intercity Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.486979166667}
