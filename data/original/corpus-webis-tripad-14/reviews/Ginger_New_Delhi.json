First advise is that this Hotel is just opposite to Railway station and is at walking distance though a bit confusing. I took an Auto as i had 4 luggage and wife with and they fleeced me by charging 150 Rs, this is not worth as it is hardly 200 m from the Ajmeri gate. My Check in was a cake walk and was in the room in 5 minutes. The rooms are pretty small and locks are worn out, i was afraid that somebody may break in but did not worry to call front desk as i had to wake up early morning at 3:30 am and it was already 11:30 pm. I didn't have a chance to check out their restaurant. The Hotel is in a pretty safe place and close to railway station as well as Metro and Metro airport express. One thing some people may find annoying is the train siren and the constant blaring of horns even in the middle of night.
