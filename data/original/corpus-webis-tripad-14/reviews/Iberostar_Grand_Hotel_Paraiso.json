This hotel was incredible. We have always enjoyed the Iberostar Pariso Lindo and on our last visit they were building the Grand (almost 5 years ago). This was our first time back to the cancun area and we were so happy with our choice. The Grand is so clean (there was always someone cleaning or polishing the floors, etc.). The mini bars were always stocked with what we wanted. We ordered champagne to the room and they brought glasses, an ice bucket and tray. So nicely presented. The food was incredible. The special restaurants were great but to be honest the lunch buffet was the BEST. The gym was small but it was never fully used so it was perfect for our needs. All and all, the service, the friendliness of the staff, the quality of the food (jumbo shrimp and lobster daily at the buffets), the wine selection, the beds, the size of the rooms and bathrooms. Everything was just perfect. We will definately be returning to the Grand on our next Cancun trip. In fact, we are alreayd looking at the other Grand hotels in different locations.

The employees work hard to take care of the guests and most everyone is very friendly!!!! For the first 6 days of our stay the star friends were only at half (or less) staff and they were WONDERFUL!!! On the 7th day of our stay the resort seemed to change with the resort trying to ready itself to come back up to full capacity (e.g. The previous week we had been trying to do different activities and were having trouble locating them at the appropriate times... on the 7th day star friends handed out an activity listing, complete with map, that outlined all the activities for the week (would have been nice to have earlier)).", "title": "Heaven on earth if you go looking for it", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "texashessfamily", "date": "June 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 31414585}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009", "text": "Things we loved about the resort in no particular order...", "title": "A Perfect Paradise Wedding!", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "nmmayra", "date": "June 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 31414085}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "This hotel is great!

I am experienced world traveller with high standards for lodging and cuisine, my husband wanted a beach, never ending drinks, and to feel safe - The Grand was a perfect choice for the two of us. The Grand is a 5-star, adult-only resort within a 5 or 6 resort Iberostar complex - it is the top of the line and Grand guests may visit/dine at any of the other resorts (via complementary golf cart shuttle service available only for Grand guests) but at Iberostar, you can only \"visit\" resorts that rank lower than yours...so no one could come to the Grand.

My husband is bi-lingal and staff visibly relaxed around him and we were treated to fascinating conversations and extra service. Everyone can speak English, but for many it is an effort so they were so appreciative of the opportunity to speak their own language...especially the bartenders, bellhops, and service staff. Tips are not necessary but REALLY appreciated, even just a couple of dollars. Tips go a long way with the butler - we found \"suprises\" in our room - rose petal bath, fresh flowers, chocolates, Champaign and strawberries, our favorite beer refreshed daily w/ fresh limes. Many options for food and most was excellent - the buffets were spectacular. I am a vegetarian and did not have trouble finding enough to eat. The Mexican restaurants at the other resorts should not be missed - no Mexican at the Grand b/c it's considered \"too common\". We attended all of the evening shows - the dancing and costumes were fantastic, singing was ok. Italian restaurant was the best.
