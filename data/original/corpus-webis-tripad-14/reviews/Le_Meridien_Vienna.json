As other reviewers have noted, the two chairs in the room are completely impossible to sit in, maybe my 3 year-old would fit, but an average adult cannot. The TV was extremely limited with only CNN and BBC as your English choices. Then the bathroom, whoever designed in ripped off the hotel. The sink takes up about 80% of the space meaning that your razor, toothbrush etc have to be placed on one of the four corners, with limited space so that you either have to put stuff on the little glass bench under the sink or on the desk.

For 2 people, the mini bar included 4 bottles of water (still & mineral), 1 beer, 2 cokes, and 2 bottles of juice. There is free internet access in the hotel lobby. The plasma screen TV offered only news channels in English. The room was very large and the beds and pillows were comfortable. The bathroom has glass translucent doors and walls. The bathroom floor is continuous with the shower floor. A tip for not flooding the bathroom is to stand blocking the doorway so that the water doesn't flood the bathroom. If you plan on taking a cab to the airport do not allow the doorman to call for a larger cab. A standard cab costs about 30 Euros and a larger cab to the airport costs 65 Euros.

The hotel is very close to the Opera House, and about a 15-20 minute walk from the CAT train station - the CAT will take you directly from the airport into downtown Vienna in about 16 minutes for 10 Euros. The hotel is a modernized older building, but it has been dressed up to be a very modern chic boutique hotel. There is an outdoor cafe in the back of the hotel, which was good, although service was inconsistent -- sometimes slow, and bill delayed - and the hotel's main restaurant, Shambala, was also good (but not a destination restaurant). Because the hotel was remodeled from an old building with floors on slightly different levels, you have to go up and down stairs on each floor after getting off the elevator. The room was very modern in appearance, and attractive. There was no clock, and, of course, no clock alarm, in the room. The bathroom was quite large, with a separate tub and shower area, but the shower had no door on it. My first shower completely covered the entire bathroom floor with water. After cleaning up the floor, I went down to the lobby and asked the staff if there was some trick to avoid flooding the bathroom. They told me that the shower was a \"designer defect\" and that they were putting doors on all the showers, but only some rooms had received their doors. I developed a strategy of putting a towel on the floor in front of the shower, and then using only the lower shower heads, aimed into the far corner of the shower, to avoid future flooding, which to a large extent prevented the floor from flooding. Others at the convention complained about shower flooding their bathrooms. The techno music and weird sound effects (jungle; water rushing) in the elevators and in common areas was a bit disconcerting and annoying. Staff was very friendly. If you need a boarding pass, they will print that out for you at front desk. Price of room was about 200 Euros per night, which was not bad, given quality of hotel and great location.

The unconventional lobby is just the beginning. It is more similar to an art gallery than hotel. Elevators have only blue lights which beats harsh white lights. Lights in the ultra mod bathrooms can either be white or lime green! Comfy, hip furnishings throughout. Free use of 1st floor healthclub, pool, sauna.
