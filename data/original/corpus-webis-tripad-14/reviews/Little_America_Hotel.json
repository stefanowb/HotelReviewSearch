They are tiny and the bathroom is so small that you almost have to back in to use the facilities. My no smoking room reeked of smoke and was beside the street with a barking dog in a room in my building. Sleep is impossible since the road noise is constant and loud and the blinds are wraped and will not close properly. There are drapes but if you close them they block off the air conditional vent. There is no in room internet service at all and no work area. The mattress and pillows are out of the dark ages.The cafe was an experience. I sent my food back but it came back worst the second time. How hard is it to scramble eggs with out burning them? The front desk was no help at all. I had prepaid and when I saw my room I requested a refund and wanted to go elsewhere. They refused the refund and they would not move me to another room. In 30 years of business travel I have NEVER been more disappointed by a hotel. This hotel is grossly misrepresented by the hotel's website and by Orbitz. I can make no sense of the positive reveiws that this dump has gotten.
