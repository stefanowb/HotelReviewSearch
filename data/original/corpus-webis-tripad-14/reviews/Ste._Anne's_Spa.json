From high end spas to luxury hotels and very fine dining, the experience for me has always been marred by the entitled attitude of the \"service\" staff and often the fellow clientele. Must indulging in luxury go hand in hand with snobbery? Happily not so, at Ste. Anne's Spa! Whether your lifestyle includes regularly partaking of spa living, or enjoying this as a special treat, you will be welcomed and treated with the utmost respect and professionalism and FRIENDLINESS. Always a smile, team members available throughout the property to attend to any and every need, and a genuine desire to treat every guest to the most pampered experience possible.
