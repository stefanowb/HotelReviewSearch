Pleasant staff who attended to your needs. Bed was large and too firm for me - but others may be OK with that. Car parking is tricky in Trani old town so the parking at The Regia was very welcome - a sat nav is useful in locating the hotel.

So when we found ourselves able to re-visit Trani for 2 nights last month, the Regia was the only place to stay- though it's pricier than other hotels in Trani. Its great attraction is its location- the only commercial property in the Cathedral square, overlooking the lovely white cathedral and the deep blue of the Adriatic. Just round the corner is the harbour, with lots of lively restaurants and bars, but the square itself is very quiet, once the children playing ball against the Cathedral walls have gone to bed. The hotel is a small 18c palazzo, but inside it is remodelled in a light, airy, modern style. We didn't get a chance to eat in the hotel restaurant, but breakfast on the terrace was fine, (so long as you only want a typical continental breakfast). Staff very pleasant; like most staff in Puglia not much English is spoken. Trani old town is lovely, and the cathedral (actually 2 churches, one on top of the other) is very interesting as well as lovely. A great long day trip is out to the Gargano peninsula, quite unlike the rest of Puglia.", "title": "A truly beautiful place to stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Shawpathways", "date": "July 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17615615, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Its great location", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfection on the Adriatic Sea", "text": "Just returned from Puglia and had 2 nights at the Hotel Regia.

We dined at the Hotel Regia one night and the food was good and representative of the area. The church just in front of the hotel is spectacular and very different.

This small hotel is perfectly situated on a picture perfect piazza in front of the town's cathedral. Behind that is the Adriatic Coast. All of which make up your room's view at this hotel. Some rooms also look out onto the nice fishing harbor and you can watch the boats come in with their catch in the morning. Our room was large with a large window and walkout balcony. It had a big roomy bathroom. Plain but nice enough furniture. The breakfast had gorgeous fresh fruit . The staff was very nice They even helped call the airlines for 3 days to find our luggage. Very helpful. But did not know much English. For us it was not an issue, as I speak decent Italian but in Puglia knowing some Italian really helps!

The Regia is completely charming, located across from the incredible Duomo in Trani. The rooms are simply furnished but spacious with high ceilings and roomy, handsomely tiled bathrooms. If Room 30 is available, it is especially large and has the best views of the cathedrale and the sea. The staff doesn't speak much English, but they are all sweet and helpful, moving your car if necessary, and they also decided to move us from a perfectly acceptable room to an even nicer one when it became available the second night. Breakfast is included and while it's just like breakfast in most Italian hotels, it is served in the light-filled hotel cafe. Take the hotel's recommendations for dining. They suggested Corteinfiore, which is a short walk away, and we had a most amazing lunch there. Don't let the ugly apartment blocks that surround the village keep you away.
