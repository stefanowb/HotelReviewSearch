Beautiful grounds with tropical flowers. Nice exercise room with both weights and cardio. Very tasteful lobby area. Thought the breakfast buffet was excellent with much fresh fruit, breads, etc.- more European style breakfast than American. We really liked the dinner buffets- wide range of interesting salads, many main dishes, and lovely desserts, all changing every night, at a price well below what would cost in US. The tourist desk helped arrange private transportation to falls in Argentina and driver knew how to bypass long lines at passport control and long bank lines for exchanging currency. And of course, a 5 minute walk to falls in Brazil from San Martin. Have traveled very widely to many countries and many nice hotels. This was a very positive experience; I'd clearly book it again if we return and would suggest to friends. No complaints.
