I asked for, and got one of the recently remodeled rooms. The room was very clean, the TV channel selection was good (we got the Patriot's opening Monday night game!). While there were guests in rooms on either side of us, it was one of the quietest hotel/motel nights we've ever experienced. The grounds are very pretty, and the restaurant on the property appeared to do a brisk business, although we ate in Wolfville - just a couple of miles away.

Today, not so much. We arrived shortly after 1 pm and they weren't busy, so we were pleased we didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered very basic things - 1 hot dog, 1 small hamburger, and 1 large hamburger with a cup of soup of the day- homemade corn chowder. And we waited....and we waited.. and we waited. Finally my hubby's chowder arrived. As he described it 'warm milk, utterly tasteless.' The rest of the meals arrived. You know you have a problem when they make sure you have a fork and knife to eat your hamburger with. The large hamburger (4 oz) was overflowing with large slices of onions, fried in butter and very greasy. The plate was greasy and you couldn't even pick up the burger. It was eaten with a fork and knife and all you could taste was onions.

The Inn was clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable of our trip, we had a king. My complaints are the shower curtain wasn't sufficient and we got water all over the floor, as it's a claw foot tub with shower head added and the floor was has an obvious slope to it, which made me nervous, but they are aware of it as evidenced by the block under the front feet of the beautiful wardrobe (the Inn is furnished nicely). My only other complaint was the room was so hot when we checked in because the windows had not been open, but the curtains were open and the sun heated the room. This could have been alleviated by merely keeping the blinds closed or open the windows prior to our arrival. There was no air conditioning, but there was a small fan to help us stay cool after our showers. By bed time, the room was comfortable. This was a good value and included breakfast at the diner. I wasn't clear how far the diner was, but rest assured if you are wondering, it is on the premises just across the parking lot. The Inn is also very close to the winery, you can see it and is certainly within walking distance, but we drove, because the cars fly on the road, since it is close to a major highway. We enjoyed the gas station across the street, as it was full service. I haven't seen a full service gas station in many many years! We would have preferred the other Inn in Grand Pre for our stay, but this was certainly enjoyable and again, a very comfortable night sleep on a great bed.", "title": "A comfortable stay in Grand Pre", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "giddyup22", "date": "February 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 13682870}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great meal and Service", "text": "Super food all made from scratch and the deserts ( pies ) are to die for.
