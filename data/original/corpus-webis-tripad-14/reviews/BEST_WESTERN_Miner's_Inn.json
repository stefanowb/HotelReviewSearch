We had a downstairs room, #102, with a sliding glass door that opened up to a long stretch of well-manicured lawn that ran alongside an attractive creek. The rooms along this area are #101 through I believe #117 and are perfect for dogs. It gave them a pleasant place for them to run, socialize with other dogs and do their thing. There were several dog cleanup stations along the fenced in area and I found the area to be very clean the entire time we were there even though we did see a handful of other dogs each day. There are also chairs and chaise lounges on the individual patios to sit on and some nice sturdy picnic tables out on the lush lawns to gather with friends and to watch your dog play. The rooms were extremely clean and quiet. Although the freeway is close and in view from the lawn area along the creek, the freeway sound was never an issue and did not disturb any of our conversations while we were outside.", "title": "Best Dog Friendly place to stay, Clean and very relaxing stay.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "SonomaDude", "date": "April 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28764601}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The rooms are very quiet for sleeping and I never heard the people upstairs or next-door at anytime during our stay.

As far as food goes I'm sure it fine but if anyone has ever been to Yreka they know the place to go is Grandma's....which is another reason for staying at BWMI.....right next door (well, except for the gas station).
