The front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful. We booked a corner suite with two bathrooms and a small kitchen/dining area overlooking the canal. We were really happy with it. The rooms were large and well appointed with classic contemporary furniture. I agree completely with all the other reviewers who liked this hotel. Most amazing was the room rate which we found to be very reasonable in Venice. Because the hotel is so close to St. Mark's Square, you can buy a day pass on the vaporetto (city public water taxi) and be anywhere in the Venice area for sightseeing locations in minutes.
