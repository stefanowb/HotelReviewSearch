We got just that at the Cottage Inn. We had an excellent room (clean, comfortable decor and roomy enough for us, with a mini fridge, electric fireplace, etc.), that opened out to a patio garden that ran about 50 feet to the cliff (with a railing!) by the sea. It was really beautiful. We could take long walks on the surprisingly empty, huge beach below, and then come back and sit out on the patio and watch the sun set, and then fall asleep in a very comfortable bed with the windows open to the sea - tremendous! Add in an included, expanded continental breakfast (hard boiled eggs, fruit, waffles, etc.), a pleasant staff (\"Service\" rating is only because we had very little need for service while there), a small, but clean pool with a large 'hot tub', and very reasonable rates for the area and season, and it made a great time for us.
