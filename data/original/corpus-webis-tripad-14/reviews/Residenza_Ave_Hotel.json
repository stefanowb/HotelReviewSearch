It is a small hotel, I think just 7 rooms. The rooms are at sidewalk level, but everything is just beautifully decorated. The room seemed spacious by European standards and had air-conditioning, a hairdryer, a safe, and a minibar. The owner, Salvo, is a wonderful man, who took quite some time to explain everything to us and answer all my questions. His staff was likewise gracious and very helpful. The location cannot be beat--right by the Tiber River, across from Castel S'Ant Angelo, a 10-minute walk to Vatican City, less than 5 minutes to Piazza Navona, and another 5 minutes beyond that to the Pantheon. I also felt very safe even late at night, because there were carabinieri posted at every corner it seemed.
