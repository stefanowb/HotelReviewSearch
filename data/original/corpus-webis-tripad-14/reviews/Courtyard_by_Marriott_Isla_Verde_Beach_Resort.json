However, the room as adequate if a bit small for a longer stay. You could definitely hear the jets from the airport, but also the waves from the beach.

The Casino and lounge were hopping and the pool is open 24 hours. We also had morning breakfast at Bananas Ice cream parlor/cafe in the lobby and it was fine. Coffee especially good!

Trust me, to date, everything that is in walking distance is to the right when you exit the hotel and stay on the right side of the street because the sidewalk there makes it easy to walk alongside the wide streets. You will pass the Ritz Carlton and you will see a Denny's. Then you will see the parking opening for a strip mall on your right and the sign for Drums. The restaurant used to be called Shots. This is a good place for nightlight on Friday and Saturday nights after 10pm. If you want food though, don't enter the parking lot on your right. Instead, look to your left and you will see an island on the street with bus stop vestibules. Further across, you will see Metropol which doesn't look like a big restaurant from the facade. It opens at 11:30am and closes at 10:30pm and serves big portions of cuban and puerto rican meals. The portions are large and it could have been enough for two people. The sampler appetizer alone could have been the meal. My friend ordered and loved fiesta cubana and I enjoyed my friend's red snapper. The chicken was great as well (and contrary to my cousin's jokes, the chicken could not have been from the cockfighting arena next door. And even if it was, it was incredibly delicious.) I also enjoyed the grounded beef and make sure you try the puerto rican hot sauce...it is definitely based in vinegar and chili peppers.
