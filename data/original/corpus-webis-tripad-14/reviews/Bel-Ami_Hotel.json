If everything is OK, then this is great, but if you are planning a special occasion visit, beware, you might be disappointed. We went there for our 10th anniversary honeymoon. During our whole 10 days stay, the next door apartment was being renovated, which meant, that the smell of plaster, the banging and seesawing started at 9 and would go on through the day. My each complain was net with - yes we could move you, but its going to stop tomorrow. Never did so. I have noticed, that in general this is a great place, but the hotel lives its own life and if it ruins someones holiday, they really don't care, so again, if you are planning something special, a romantic trip, just beware it can be ruined in this hotel.", "title": "Great Hotel, don't care for guests", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Sviz", "date": "April 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 28841997}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "We stay around the corner from the Bel Ami and noticed that they have a spa facility now that is available to non-guests.

Imagine our surprise when we arrived to find out the bookings were for the wrong day. The woman at the spa acted like it was our fault and the concierge, well, he shrugged his hands in the air.

To be honest, I think you would have been able to almost make out the words of people speaking in the next room if they had just been speaking in normal voices - we, unfortunately had the pleasure of being next to people who yelled obscenities at each other and slammed doors for most of the duration of their (and our stay), irrespective of the time of day or night.", "title": "Perfect location - but don't risk wasting your money", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Sleepophile", "date": "April 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 27580230}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled on business", "text": "We foolishly put up with it for one night but on our last night had to call the Duty Manager at 2.30 am and again at 6am to intervene \u2013 essentially turning our planned restful stay in Paris into a nightmare.
