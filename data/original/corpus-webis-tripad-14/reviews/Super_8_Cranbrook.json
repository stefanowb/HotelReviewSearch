We picked it because it was the least expensive place in Cranbrook since we were only going to be there for 10 hours. Rooms were clean, customer service was good. There was free wifi and free breakfast - which had some hot items and a waffle maker. Helped us get up and on the road quickly. The hotel is at the north edge of town which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. Made it easy to get out of there quickly if heading north but that is only if you have already filled up with gas and don't need to make any stops since there is really nothing past the hotel.
