I used a business room, which was more spacious, had better view and more amenities than a standard room (incl. bathrobe and slippers). The hotel is quite new and the bathroom nice, but it's obvious that the hotel itself does not want to offer anything beyond the 4-star service. They are supposed to offer evening cleaning service, but their standard of cleaning service in the morning is quite low: they do not empty the trash every day (only every second day), they do not change used towels and they do not even touch the towel rug on the floor (they leave it there!). Even in the \"business\" rooms the supposedly rich amenities do not include sewing kit, body milk, conditioner, nail kit or cotton and cotton tubs. The carpet is clean, but of poor quality, while room temperature could not be adjusted. Furthermore, electricity was provided by the cardkey (following a policy of many resort hotels, but not business city hotels that claim to be 5star). Regarding their breakfast, it was not of a 5star quality, as there was no warm bread-like thing (you could only toast your bread,, but the rest was not really fresh)anywhere and no croissants. Their service at the restaurant (used also as breakfast room) was poor, they did not offer to do but only the absolutely necessary and smiles were literally inexistent. Their standard lunch buffet was poor and they had a strange policy of having water pre-served in the glasses and left on the table before customers' seating (that obviously saves them time!). In general, they never go out of their way to help you. All their 3 salads on their standard lunch buffet were around seafood -- no really vegetarian salad, which was very difficult for me who am allergic to seafood!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Jchm", "date": "January 16, 2006", "id": 4355547}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very comfortable", "text": "And one more tip regarding this hotel: They price in Euro and send confirmation of prices in Euro, but when it comes to payment, they ask for 10% more if currency other than Kroon (their local currency) is used. They say that they have legitimate reason for that, as Euro or Dollars are not their currency, but then why do they confirm prices in Euro? On the one hand they hedge their pricing against risk of their currency's devaluation and on the other they use that way to bring you in a situation of having to pay the 10%extra when you have no possibility to go out to exchange when you check out (when it's possibly no banking hour or have no time). My reason to recommend this hotel would only be the fact that you can hardly find something better in Tallinn and that it is not far from the old town (10 minutes walk).
