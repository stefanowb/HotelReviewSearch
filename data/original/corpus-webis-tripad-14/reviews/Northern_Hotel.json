It is very good place to stay if you are going to explore Angus, the birthplace of Scotland, because if you are staying in Brechin - you can explore all the attractions - beaches of Montrose and Lunan Bay, all the golf facilities of the region and cities like Dundee and Aberdeen and many many more.", "title": "Very very nice!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lexx_Naxxx", "date": "December 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 51615896}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled on business", "text": "This is a great, small hotel situated between Aberdeen and Dundee. Agreed with the other visitor's comments about the bath towels - very small; but no other complaints. Hotel is stylish and food is good. Rooms spotless, but a little noisy as all rooms are on a main road. Bathrooms are to a high standard. Would definately stay there again. Was there on business with some colleagues from England and although we arrived late, the bar closed at 11pm. The place was completely deserted after this - no-one around at all. We were given a front door key, which also allowed us to access our rooms, so ended up going out and finding the gem that is the 'Brechin Arms'!

It is only a couple of minutes off the main A90 road. I stopped off recently to find accommodation in Brechin while on a business trip because all the places I had phoned ahead to in the city were full. I was really surprised to find this absolute gem in such an unlikely location. The Northern Hotel, Brechin has undergone major refurbishment recently and it shows. From the outside it looks clean and neat but nothing special. A typical Scottish small hotel really. However, inside it is a city-slick stylish hotel with classy decor, comfortable rooms and a standard of service and comfort well above it's Scottish Tourist Board 3 stars. The room had a modern look, the bed comfortable, the bathroom spotless, with quality toiletries and soft, warm towels (shame the bath towel was not bigger). The dining room is also a pub, which offered a great, hearty Scottish breakfast including the famous 'smokies' (smoked fish) from nearby Arbroath.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Jenny_01", "date": "August 11, 2006", "id": 5598409}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 7, "very good": 31, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 37}, "aka": "Northern Hotel Brechin, Scotland", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
