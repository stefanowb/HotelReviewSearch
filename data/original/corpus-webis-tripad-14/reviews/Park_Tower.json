We seriously considered the boutique hotel in Palermo thing, but we decided that we wanted to splurge on this trip. Boy, are we glad that we chose the Park Tower. We liked the location, right next to Plaza San Martin and within walking distance of Recoleta, Calle Florida, Casa Rosada, and other big Buenos Aires draws. Otherwise, cab rides to farther reaches are really cheap-maybe $4 US to La Boca or Palermo. They had a room for us when we checked in at 9:30am on the 1st, which was a huge plus for us. We were on the 16th floor, and road noise was barely audible. I am a light sleeper and I didn't notice any noise at night. The bathroom was all marble, with 2 sinks, a tub and separate shower. The bed was good, but not the best hotel bed I've ever slept in. Not a negative-it was still good. Our room also had the desk and couch with a coffee table. There was a minibar as well. I've read that these standard rooms are among the largest of any hotel in Buenos Aires, so that is pretty good. Pretty much all of the staff were friendly and helpful, although one or two of the younger guys there were a bit aloof. Not a problem at all-still a good experience. The rate included a very good breakfast, which ran from 7-11am. There was also free access to the internet in the business center, which we took advantage of daily. Room service was a bit expensive, but we only did that once-just a sandwich. We highly recommend Las Nazarenas for steak, and it is across the street from the hotel. So overall, we had a great stay at the Park Tower, and we'd definitely stay there again.", "title": "Park Tower-Highly Recommended", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CosmoC", "date": "September 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8692536, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Quiet Comfort", "disliked": "\u2014 Nada"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very Nice - But Check Your Bill", "text": "I spent three nights at the Park Tower and overall it was very nice with a few issues. First the good points: I arrived at 10:30 am after an all night flight from the USA and my room was ready. I was able to take a brief nap and recharge . That was a huge plus. The Staff was extremely polite and all seemed to speak English. The room was large and had a great view. The bathroom was also large with marble floors, a seperate shower, and a 110v outlet that was appreciated. The Lobby Lounge was great and they served complimentary snacks when you ordered a beverage.The location near Puerto Madero is great. Now for the not-so-good. The bed was mediocre and the pillows were hard and lumpy. The hotel restuarants were run-of-the- mill. The phone charges are outrageous: nearly $5 US just to access and outside line to make a calling card call. Imagine my shock on check out when I discovered a $15 charge from the Business Center, which I never visited, and a whopping $70 for a massage that I never had. The gracious staff, however, quickly rectified the errors and the Manager insisted I accept a beverage with his compliments for the error. I recommend the Park Tower but watch for those billing errors.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "greggariouspdx", "date": "September 4, 2007", "id": 8655483, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, Courteous Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Mediocre Bedding, Billing Errors"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "The hotel building itself is very elegant. It's got marble from floor to ceiling....but so do the ATMs in Buenos Aires. (Marble is very plentiful in Argentina and you'll find it everywhere.) There are tons of people around to help you all day. ex. one to open your cab door, one to open the door to the hotel, one to call the elevator, etc. This will leave your wallet much lighter if you tip all of them. The guy who brought breakfast to my room straight up asked for a tip, and not in a nice way either. It was 6a.m. I was bleary eyed, and hadn't even had the chance to sign the check before he was like, \"Tip! Tip!\" Before I left, I asked the front desk lady if tipping was mandatory and, if so, how much should I tip. She said that tipping was common only if you found the service exceptional, blah blah blah. Anyway, a friend of mine and I scheduled appointments to get manicures and pedicures. The service we got would be about what you'd get if you asked your best friend to paint your nails. I could have done a better job on myself. Totally not worth it. If you have time, though, the massage service is worth it...so is a visit to the steam room, sauna, and indoor pool. The only other problem I'd mention was that they never managed to send the maid when I was out of the room. Despite the fact that I was gone for half the day, I would come back, ready to sleep, and the maid would be in my room. I've been at other hotels with \"butler\" service where this NEVER happened.
