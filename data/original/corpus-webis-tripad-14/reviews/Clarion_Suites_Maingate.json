I must stress location! Within walking distance there is a Cracker Barrel, Carabbas Italian, TGIF Fridays, Dairy Queen and a small strip mall with a food market! The hotel is surrounded by nice sidewalks and I never felt unsafe even walking around at night. The suite was alittle disappointing because it is one room; the living area was separated by a half wall. There is only 1 TV so you could not watch TV in the \"living area\". The room was very clean and freshly painted. The bathroom was large with plently of counter space. Plently of towels too. In the bedroom area was the refrig & microwave. The coffee maker was in the bathroom. I was disappointed in the number of drawers for clothing: only 3 drawers! If you had alot of people you would have to live out of a suitcase. The beds were very comfortable and each had 4 pillows. The rooms were quiet from any outside noise; the only noise was the A/C unit. Even on low it was somewhat noisy. Not good for light sleepers! The pool area was fine; they have a bar open during the evening. The breakfast room was ok; small and noisy when full. They had cereals, juices, waffles, pastries etc. I only used it for coffee and a bagel. We walked over to Cracker Barrel for the best breakfast. If on a budget you can make do with the hotel's breakfast. The front desk staff was fairly friendly; they just did their jobs and that is all. All in all a good experience !! Great location!!

They also had a kiddie pool with a mushroom waterfall, and a hot tub that I never visited. My kids went back and forth from the kiddie pool to the large pool (right next to each other), and had a great time. The large pool was heated and very comfortable. We did NOT come for Disney, which was great, because we practically had the pool all to ourselves during the daytime! The only downside was that the breakfast area (though HUGE) was extremely crowded. It was a madhouse. At any given time during breakfast hours there were over 100 people in the breakfast area! The hotel could use more staffing for breakfast because the poor guy filling the stations could not begin to keep up! It doesn't help when selfish people (with no social manners whatsoever) hold up lines for 15 minutes while they make 6 waffles for their entire table!!! I also witnessed people grabbing fruit out of the employee's hands as he brought it out and tried to replenish the supply! People's manners are not the hotel's fault; however, if the staffing and supply had been adequate there would not have been so much chaos. I would highly recommend this hotel!

I would not stay there again. First of all, it being the height of the tourist season, they charged $149/night when I booked through Comfort Suites web site (Choice Hotels), which came out to $135 or so with AAA discount--no bargain here. There are many nearby hotels, some closer to the Disney approach road. (For those of you who are not familiar with the Disney World area, this hotel is over a mile from the entrance to the approach road, and after that it's another several miles to the Magic Kingdom and other Disney parks.) Anyway, while I can say Comfort Suites Maingate is clean and well-kept, several things irked me, which may have been less bothersome if I had paid $65 or $75, but for $135 I expected better. The bed was uncomfortable because the mattress pad was like one of those waterproof plastic baby diapers. It felt like sleeping on a thick sheet of plastic, which bunched up and stuck in our backs uncomfortably. Such a mattress pad is expected in a cheap motel, but not a mid-priced Comfort Suites. Also, the bedspread and blanket had cigarette burns in them. Again, fine for a cheap motel, but not a mid-priced Comfort Suites. Moreover, at check-in, I was asked to initial that I understood I would be charged $200 if someone smoked in my (non-smoking) room. After seeing the results of someone having smoked in MY room (well, having smoked on the bedspread and blanket that were now in my room), I felt like I should have charged THEM $200 for having to tolerate such a disgusting bed in a NON-SMOKING room.", "title": "poor value", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "LorenzoAtlanta", "date": "December 29, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 6517950}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "I am also totally perplexed by glowing comments from some previous reviewers about the pool, bar, friendly service, etc. I felt it was just an ordinary motel like many others I have stayed at, with an ordinary pool, tiny \"bar,\" typical motel complimentary breakfast, etc..

I think you may end up feeling misled if you stay here because there are a relatively large number of very good reviews while there are fewer good reviews for other hotels in the area.
