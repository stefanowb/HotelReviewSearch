The staff was friendly, check-in was quick. The rooms small but excellently maintained, offer free wifi, flat screen tv, ironing board and iron, in room safe, comfortable beds, bath with shower. A fantastic buffet breakfast is served each morning including freshly squeezed orange juice, a variety of meats and cheeses, soft boiled eggs, pastry and a variety of breads, plus other items. If you prefer, breakfast can be served in your room or you may take breakfast on the nice garden patio weather permitting. The hotel is also 100% non smoking. It is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station Pereire on line 3. You certainly won't be disappointed in this hotel.", "title": "A Real Gem", "user": "yvr1", "date": "December 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 188502178}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Enjoyed my stay @ Magellan Hotel", "text": "Hotel located in a nice and safe neighbourhood very close to Pereire station, in the area you can find local restaurant and couple of supermarkets as well.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Nando1970", "date": "December 18, 2013", "id": 187939069}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Breakfast was superb, room cozy and clean, staff polite and helpful.", "title": "Very clean, perfect location & awesome breakfast", "user": "knapo", "date": "December 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187003935}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Surely I ll come back on my next visit to Paris.", "title": "Days out in Paris", "user": "sixmice", "date": "December 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 186870200}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Hotel is perfectly located, my room was clean, breakfast was good and tasty.
