I would like to tell any bride-to-be who is looking for a classy and upscale location and staff that Queen's Landing is definitely Niagara's finest. 14 months of planning with Lisa Javor, Queen' s Landing's very own wedding planner (with the booking of a wedding reception comes a wedding planner) It is very rare to find a younger woman nowadays who is professional from the very moment you make contact with her to the very end of the big day. Lisa and Queen's Landing's staff ALWAYS treated me with priority and respect. I never felt I had to hesitate with the number of e-mails or phone calls I placed with Lisa. Lisa had an answer and a solution for every question I had.

As one might expect from a pricier hotel, the service was excellent, and the facility well appointed. The facility is old, and at points shows its age. It is located near a harbor that opens onto the lower Niagara river. The view from the dining room overlooking the harbor and river was superb. Grounds were scrupulously maintained and filled wit florals and plantings of many varieties. Fountains and statuary were very nice. The interior was finely appointed. The library/computer room was stately. The staff was cheerful and friendly. When calling the front desk to help with operating the in-room Keurig, someone was sent up immediately, and was very helpful. Early morning coffee and tea outside the pool/exercise room area were a nice touch. A newspaper appeared outside the door in the morning. The room itself was clean, but noticed some dust around the feet of the desk. A sheet of glass that topped a nightstand was not properly secured with anti-slip disks, and thus slid around a bit. A number of channels on the T.V. were snowy. The bed was very comfortable. However, the bed pillows were not up to the level we would have expected from a facility of this price level. A bit lumpy, I suspect due to being filled with shredded memory foam. The patrons were a mix of nationalities and ages, with a bent towards an older, more sedate crowd.", "title": "Nice, but overpriced.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Buffalodave45", "date": "May 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161828069}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Another Great conference at Queens Landing - thanks to the staff including Peggy & Paul who met our every request with friendly and amazing service.

A last minute change in our timing was quickly accommodated by the business office without any fuss. Peggy was great; fun to deal with, smiling, calm, and organized. Our conference was held at the Queen's Landing Hotel. Our dinner was at the Prince of Wales. Lovely walk through the park between the two facilities. Dinner portions were a little too small, but the wait staff were great. The banquet coordinator Dan was excellent to deal with. We stayed overnight back at the Queen's Landing. Accommodation was lovely with nice soft beds and pillows. Had the Tiara restaurant in the Queen's Landing Hotel been able to accommodate our group for dinner we would have stayed there. Lunch and breakfast in the Tiara Restaurant were top notch. Overall I have to say food quality was better at the Queen's Landing (world's best gluten free brownies for the celiac in our group as well).
