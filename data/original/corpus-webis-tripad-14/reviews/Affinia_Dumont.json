About a 20-25min walk to Time's Square and close to the 6 train's 33rd street stop on the subway. The hotel has great views (especially if you are the xx05 room on any floor.. corner room). You can see the beautiful skyline and Hudson from your room! The rooms have a mini-kitchen, large flat screen tv, a leather desk with chair, couch (in the corner room) and a nice bathroom. Beds were softer than the usual hotel bed which I really appreciated! The rooms were clean and had an iPod compatible clock radio. I feel that this is a hidden gem in Manhattan with non-Manhattan prices (especially on priceline.. I may have just gotten lucky as I paid $175 per night and got a free upgrade).

And was very, very happy with that decision upon arriving. Were welcomed in a very warm and welcoming way by Iris, and her warm professionalism was carried thru the next days by her colleagues. Upon arriving our room was what we hoped for; very spacious, and with a simply wonderful view over both the Hudson River and downtown. As I had advised it was a special trip for my daughters 18th birthday, there was even a (delicious) chocolate birthday cake waiting for us! The separate kitchen area was just wonderful as several nights we were simple too exhausted to sit in a restaurant so we bought something from one of the many deli's and cooked ourselves a simple meal. Apart from being very spacious, the room also had wonderful beds and - very important for a terrible sleeper like myself - really great beds. Also, though you could faintly hear the bustle of NY going on, it didn't disturb our good nights' sleep. Further would like to add that room was kept extremely clean. Unfortunately didn't have time to use either gym or spa, but did take a peek and it looks wonderful. Had some trouble with the internet one night, and within a few minutes someone came up; service was very prompt. I really can't find fault with this hotel or with its wonderful staff. Though I've read in reviews about other NY hotels that the size or comfort really doesnt matter as you're not in NY to sleep, I have to disagree. Especially after getting up early and do nothing but walk and sightsee all day long, knowing we had this wonderful, peaceful hotelroom to go back to was great. All in all; excellent value for money, cannot recommend it highly enough! This first visit to New York definitely left us wanting to go back, and we will not hesitate but book directly with the Affinia Dumont.", "title": "Simply loved the Affinia Dumont", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MarionEngelschman", "date": "May 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 15592082, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Size of rooms, cleanliness, friendliness staff", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I was placed at the Affinia Dumont by the company I was working for in New York for two weeks.

The fitness center has plenty of machines, and supplies headphones for the TVs that are on all the treadmills and elliptical machines.

I took some advice from one contributor and emailed the hotel asking for a room with a view, they replied saying that they would do their best but could not guarantee anything. Well we weren't disappointed!! We had booked a one bedroom suite as we were taking our teenage son and wanted a bit of space; however when we booked in we were upgraded and were not only given a one bedroom suite but were also given a fitness room with a sauna and another bathroom!! I have never stayed in a hotel with so much room before!!(and probably never will again!!). We also had a superb view of the Chrysler building. One of my best memories will be of doing a yoga workout looking out over the New York Skyline!!! The staff were really friendly and I liked the fact that it didn't feel pompous! The Murray Hill area was great; it was fantastic to be staying away from all the crowds and all the hustle and bustle yet walking distance from so many places. We did try the Murray Hill diner but ended up going to the local deli and buying our own supplies for breakfast. We went to the River Cafe for 'Brunch' on Sunday which was superb. We also went to the NY Nicks basketball game at Madison Square Garden and had free drinks and food all night as it was their last game!! It was an experience just watching the amount of food some people can put away!! We found a great little fish restaurant in Greenwich Village called Mary's Fish Camp (they have a website) - very small but great food. We also visited Central Park Zoo which I was a bit apprehensive about but ended up enjoying. Would thoroughly recommend the Top of the Rock for views; we went twice and the first time we had a lift to ourselves - both times were quite quiet. We went to the Top of the Empire State building at about 10pm - we didn't have to queue but it still seemed busy at the top. We were getting very frustrated by being sent all around the houses to get to the top even though it wasn't busy!
