Received a great last minute weekend rate of $89 from Marriott so we gladly switched from the La Quinta, which was not downtown. Great location and easy valet parking ($10 daily). Very quick valet service which was surprising. Even when we checked out at 11:00 on Sunday morning only had a 5 minute wait on our car. The lobby is quite nice with a little bar and our room was extremely clean. My wife worked out in the small exercise room with a couple of treadmills, bike and a weight machine. We thought downtown Fort Worth was actually better than Dallas. Had numerous restaurants and bars within an easy walk from the hotel. If you are in your 20's or early 30's would definitely recommend 8.0's bar. Puts most Dallas bars to shame and has an awesome patio. All in all would certainly recommend the Courtyard and downtown Fort Worth for those of us who usually take weekend trips to Dallas.

We reserved our room through Travelocity for $98 a night, plus tax, which is a good rate based on our check of the other downtown Ft. Worth Hotels. We also highly recommend the Cowgirl Hall of Fame.

We brought in dinner from the Chili's across the street, and ate it at our table on the terrace. The room itself was very clean and well-appointed, but was pretty cosy when we had the rollaway brought in. If you want lots of room, get a suite. We were shown one, but decided to sacrifice the space for the terrace. The staff was very friendly and professional, and the little desk clerk who checked us in , Shaunte, was especially accommodating.
