Like most hotels in Amsterdam during this period the Ibis was booked solid. The last 3-star hotel I stayed at was the Avenue (single room) and I had not been impressed. I was very pleased with our choice this time. The location is great and much closer to Dam square and Central station than I was expecting. It was far enough away from the hustle and bustle to be relaxing and quite peaceful (discounting the unavoidable NYE crackers!), yet close enough to comfortably walk almost everywhere. It was always cold and sometimes snowing during our stay yet we never bothered with trams or taxis and walked everywhere with ease. The rooms are cosy and comfortable. They're not big rooms but they're big enough for two adults and they're modern and clean. At all times we found the staff to be enthusiastic, pleasant, helpful and efficient and all had perfect English. They seemed to be quite a young crew, always well groomed and we thought they did a great job considering they were dealing with a full hotel of mainly other young people who were in Amsterdam for NYE party celebrations (as were we - though not so young!). Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, noise from the corridor is evident although we found it to only ever be momentary and never found it to be a source of disturbance. Our only complaint would be the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We knew this to be the case when we booked and thought it wouldn't matter, but once there we really missed this facility and also missed the convenience of a mini-fridge. The Ibis Stopera was great value for money and offers the security of \"what you see on the website is what you get\". I would recommend it to all, but I think I missed having a kettle and a fridge a bit too much and will probably look for a different hotel next time just so as to have those facilities.", "title": "Vaule for money", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "marcus007", "date": "January 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4365566}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great stay", "text": "Stayed here for one night, as Ibis Central Station was booked.

There was a heat wave in Amsterdam and the temperatures were in the 80's. the hotel made sure we had 2 separate beds as requested. The bedding and the shower was wonderful. The staff, I cannot say enough about. These young men and women were so patient with everyone. They made all kinds of calls for us to get reservations in certain restaurants. Circled maps for us detailing the way for us to get to anywhere we wanted to go. Never rushing anyone that was waiting to ask questions or check in or out. My sister-in-law had a knee problem and every night when we came back to the hotel we stopped at the bar for ice. They were always accommodating. The hotel was very busy at this time with people watching the world cup in the restaurant and bar. but they never made you feel as though you were a nusance to them. We knew when we booked this hotel that it was kind of an economy hotel. Other than not luxury bath items or large closets, or coffee making equipment in the room, the staff, location, cleanliness, air -conditioning, more than make up for these other things. I would love to visit Amsterdam again and once more stay at this hotel. Thanks to everyone who wrote reviews before we finally booked.

Staff are very friendly and offer a city map and general advice when checking in. Breakfast was listed as \"American breakfast\" and there was ample to choose from. Cereals, different breads, toast, cooked breakfast, cheese, meat, juices. We arrived earlier than check in and left later than check out and they provide storage space for cases.

Yes, we heard people walking down the corridors, yes we heard other guests doors closing but I've never been to a hotel and not heard such noises.
