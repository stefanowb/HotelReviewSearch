It was totally pitch black and we couldn't see the map. It is very romantic once you know the pathways, but on check-in it was annoying. The first thing we thought when we walked in was \"Oh my God, where are we? Liberace's house?\" Once you get over the shock of how really retro-1970's it is, you actually appreciate how well they did make it appear 1970's and you start to have fun with it! We had this HUGE black and white photo of Carol Channing with these giant glasses on in our room. Our friends had all these retro black and white photos in their room too, it just added to the unusual theme and made us all laugh and start to relax. The rooms were very clean, but you don't want to hang out in them, the grounds are where you want to be. The pool was perfect and relaxing. A waiter comes by about every 15 minutes to check if you want food or drinks, they are very professional and keep in tone with a relaxed, but efficient vacation mode. You really felt pampered with this staff overall (except the front desk). The spa was so relaxing and clean, we spent about 5 hours in there just laughing and talking and relaxing. The restaurant on site was wonderful for breakfast and lunch. For breakfast the menu was very creative and different (about $125 for four) and worth the money. Some places you go the food is expensive and mediocre, but this chef and his team were quite good. The servers were excellent, and even accomodated us for lunch when they were near closing time for them, and they didn't make us feel rushed-very cool people. The grounds are immaculate and welcoming to relax in. They have lawn games, hammocks, private seating areas, all very inviting and well-thought-out; and again, with the wait staff checking on you in these areas to see if you need anything. We were SO relaxed and pampered we really didn't want to leave! We look forward to going again, and we highly recommend this hotel if you want to truly \"get away from it all\".

This is not the place for those kinds of people. As a Starwood Platinum member I have been to Westins all over North America and most of that was just this summer. The Parker is one of the most unique and amazing properties Starwood has. Everything has been incredible. The standard room (I was offered a suite but took standard because the three children don't care for rollaway beds) is very spacious. Upon check-in one of the hotel manager's learned all of our names and on various visits to whatever we were doing during the day called us by name and checked on how our stay was going. I have rarely, if ever, experienced such a personable crew of associates. They manage is stay bright and cheery even when they have difficult, demanding guests (there were many of those types here this weekend). If coming be sure to hangout at The Lemonade Stand. It has amazing concoctions and fantastic associates. I love them! They treated my children like a regular guests and offered them lemonade anytime they simply walked by. Also, if you want a place where you can let your children wonder a bit without ever having to worry then this is it! Security guards are quietly everywhere. I am not sure if it is because they get the famous and wealthy or if it is just to make sure things go off without a hitch, but either way it was a wonderful feeling. Additionally they keep rowdy guests in line. While we were here we witnessed a wedding and if you need a place for that then you should consider The Parker. There are only a few, minor things I would change. Firstly, I do think it would be nice to upgrade the television to a flat panel and to add a coffee maker to the rooms. Additionally I would like to see a king suite with a pull-out bed. That's probably about it. These are just personal preference items and with that said I know a resort can't be everything to everyone so if they never change these things I don't care! I am on the phone to my Platinum Concierge associate tomorrow booking my next week. I can't wait to come back and wonder the grounds, relax, and get away from it all.
