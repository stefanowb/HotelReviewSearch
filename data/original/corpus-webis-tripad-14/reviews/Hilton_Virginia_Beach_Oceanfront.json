The staff was great, there was always available beach towels, even complementary sand chairs everyday. The rooms were fine, one of our rooms had some toilet troubles, they were there within 5 minutes and fixed the problem quickly. One of the televisions wasn't working when we checked in, again someone was there within minutes to fix it. There was never a problem with housekeeping, quite the opposite, they left extra towels in both rooms, cleaned them in a timely fashion, and even offered us extras the morning we were checking out. And there is no way someone can complain about that pool on the roof. I would say the only valid complaint I have read here would be the cost for internet service, that just seems silly given the price of the hotel... but it was easy enough to go across the street to Starbucks for wireless. We didn't try the restaurants so can't speak to that. Just don't want everyone to believe what has been said here because it was far from our experience.

It is very expensive, $300-400 per night so one expects luxury when paying those prices. It is worth springing for the oceanview rooms and they have nice balconies to sit out and watch the jets, beach, concerts, etc. We stayed on the concert side, north side, and that was great for our needs. The beds are plush with lots of pillows, the towels are large and soft, and we found the housekeeping very good and done in a timely manner. The staff was friendly and accomodating. We requested 2 rooms next door to eachother and at first were not able to get that but the front desk took our phone numbers and told us if we were willing to wait a few hours, they could do that for us. We had 2 teenage girls that would be hopping back and forth so it was important to us to be next door so we waited, ate, did a bit of strolling on the boardwalk, and the staff called us when the rooms were ready. The hotel amenities are basic for the price and not very exciting. There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms and all of the restaurants in the area seem to serve large portions but taking leftovers is not possible since there is no place to store anythng of that nature.
