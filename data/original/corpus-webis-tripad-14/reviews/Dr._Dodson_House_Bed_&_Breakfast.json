This is an outstanding B&B in a great location close to the town's main attractions and the Bay. The Hosts were fantastic taking care of our every need and added great tips about where to eat, drink and shop. The breakfasts were delicious (french toast, eggs benedict, pecan waffles, fruit). The comfortable rooms had everthing you could want plus TV and wireless. The decor of the house takes you back to the end of the 1800s.

We both have traveled to many places in the states & in Europe. The one thing I have found is that it is not always the actual place you stay at that makes it great, but the people who are running it & the other guests that are there. Ben & Jaime are the best!!! They make you feel like you are old friends and are delightful to talk with. The breakfast was delicious & I would not have changed a thing. They also are right on with their recommendations for places to dine & drink.

It was my husbands first expereince at a B&B and it was a great one and definitely my best one! We were greated by Ben and he gave us a tour of the place which was really pretty and clean and then he provided us with our choices for breakfast the next day (all of which were delicious). He and Jaime both have such great personalities and made us feel very comfortable throughout our stay. They really made sure you had everything you needed. We stayed in the room on the very top floor of the house. The bed was comfortable and the room was decorated very nicely. They also have a great second floor balcony where you can enjoy a nice glass of wine and people watch before heading out for the evening. Location is great and you can walk everywhere. We would definitely stay here again during our next visit to St. Michaels.", "user": ";-)", "date": "September 5, 2012", "id": 139483712}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Location, Hospitality, and Accommodations!", "text": "Dr. Dodson's #1 ranking on Trip Advisor is well deserved and comes as no surprise to anyone who has stayed there. The Dr. Dodson House is centrally located and within walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the Maritime Museum. The innkeepers, Ben and Jaimie, are super warm and friendly. As soon as you walk through the front door, they make you feel right at home. We stayed in the Dodson room, which is the largest of the three rooms. The room was extremely clean, and we slept well in the super soft bedsheets. The updated marble shower had a rain shower head, which was a pleasant surprise. Ben and Jaime's recommendation's for dinner was very helpful. The fish tacos and crab nachos at Gina's were delicious! In the morning Jamie and Ben provided two options for breakfast, caramel french toast with almonds or eggs benedict. It was the hardest decision I had to make all vacation. Luckily, my wife ordered one and I ordered the other. Ben cooked them perfectly! We cleaned our plates. The coffee was excellent, as well. After breakfast, we borrowed the house bikes and made a big loop around the entire town. We could only stay for one night, but we will definitely stay longer in the future. The Dodson house was the perfect getaway location for some R&R.", "user": "Drewseph", "date": "September 4, 2012", "id": 139439634}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Stay", "text": "A nice stay in St. Michaels.

The Harbor View room was wonderful--very cozy and a nice view of the water. Everything was clean and the breakfasts were delicious! Fresh fruit, orange juice, coffee and the tomato cheese tart and banana pecan waffles were such a treat! Jaime remembered talking to me on the phone when I described the nature of our getaway and specifically wanted to make sure we had a great reunion stay.

Jaime and Ben are the warmest, most generous hosts. From the greeting to the suggestions we got on places to eat and visit, to THE MOST AMAZING breakfast we were well taken care of.

The house is a historical landmark and highlight of several guided tours, so we learned a lot about it just by listening to tours from the porch.

We stayed in the Harbor View room which has beautiful updated decor and a very cozy king size bed. We only left the room the following morning because breakfast smelled so good that we could not pass it up. Ben and Jaime are a very sweet couple and you can tell they love what they do as much as they love the town- Ben's blueberry crepes were delicious, and if you get a chance to eat his Eggs Benedict, you won't be disappointed! They also made great recommendations for other places to eat and hang out around town, which helped us have a great stay.
