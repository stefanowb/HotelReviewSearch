Called earlier in the day on the day of our arrival to notify them we'd be checking in late that evening and to ensure the handicapped accessible room we'd requested would be available. After some confusion regarding an accessible room with the number of beds we needed (2) not even existing at that hotel we said we'd take the accessible room with one bed and a sleeper sofa and were assured we'd get that room no problem. When we arrived later that evening we were informed that due to an \"emergency\" because of the recent flooding in the area all the accessible rooms were taken and we wouldn't be getting the room they promised us earlier in the day, however, they were giving us a suite for the same price. We were tired, it was late, so we accepted. We went up to the room and neither key worked. So we went back down to the desk and ran into the desk clerk on the way who as bringing us up towels (which I thought odd since we didn't ask for extra towels) She let us in and we sat for a few minutes in the living room area while we called home. When I went in the bathroom a few minutes later I found used soap and shampoo in the shower and a used towel as well. Then in the bedroom area neither bed had the customary duvet... just blankets and the one blanket had holes in it! The beds were definitely not made up properly nor up to Hampton Inn standards. I phoned the front desk and asked if the room had actually been cleaned and the clerk (a different one from the one who checked us in) said \"I sure hope so.\" I explained the conditions we'd found and she offered to move us to the adjoining room. At this point it was after 11:00 pm we'd already changed into pajamas and I asked if she'd just send up a new blanket to replace the one in with holes. She said she would and also said she'd remove the charge for that night. She brought up a duvet and more towels and again assured us she'd remove the charge for the room. After she left we then discovered a large wet area on the rug in the bedroom area. Definitely the most disappointing stay I've ever experienced at a Hampton Inn property.", "title": "Not the best stay I've experienced...", "user": "the-way-2-go", "date": "September 10, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 117887792}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I have stayed at this hotel quite a few times.

Checked and there was none. Next morning, I inquired about getting one and was told one would be there when i returned. I returned that evening and none was found again.
