Upon arrival we were offered a room \"upgrade\" which we were happy to pay for, given the occasion. On first inspection, our room appeared to be well decorated, clean, and comfortable. However on close inspection we noticed stains on the carpet, broken floor tiles in the bathroom and stained bedding. My Husband and I requested to move room but were told that there was nowhere else to go. It became aparrent that the room we had originally booked had been double booked, hence the offer of an upgrade. Not knowing the area we had no choice but to make the best of a bad situation. Being an old building we expected a few creaks here and there but we did not anticipate trying to sleep under what sounded like a tenpin bowling alley! I have never had such a bad nights sleep in my life. Breakfast was a buffet style affair. We were seated at our table, got our drinks and returned to the buffet for our food. When we went back to the table another couple had been seated there. The waiting staff were less than helpful, but we were beginning to lower our expectations by then. At dinner we waited an hour and a quarter for a soup which was cold. The following morning my husband and I checked out early and despite our complaints we were not offered so much as an apology. All in all I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Do not be fooled by its flashy facade and website.

Due to a double yellow line outside the main entrance, thought we'd better go through to the car park at the rear. This involves going through what must have been the coach entry, so narrow and off putting. However, good parking area once you've girded your loins and driven through. However, you are then faced with a long walk to reception involving a flight of stairs, so not a good start. The receptionist was not the most welcoming person I've come across. There didn't seem to be many people staying, but she couldn't find our pre paid booking. Presumably she eventually did, although she left us standing there for some minutes without communicating with us , as she then asked us to sign in. We had asked for a ground floor room when we booked as I'd read there was no lift, so I was surprised to be put on the second floor. The newer, very ugly, part of the building has a lift, but we were put I the original part of the property. We do not look either particularly young or fit, so locating us up on the second in a reasonably inaccessible position is interesting. We did not purchase this stay as a bargain or last minute deal. The receptionist was surprised when I asked for help with our bag. The situation was salvaged when a young lady who we saw working in the dining room later ensured our bag was brought up. Not only were we on the second floor with no lift, there was a spiral part to the steep staircase and a further 'up & over' part to navigate along the corridore before we got to the room. The room was disappointing - noisy, as it was on the main road, and as it was stuffy, we had to have the window open ( no air cooling); there was a long brown drip on the inside of the bathroom door; the tiles were discoloured (old, rather than dirty) and there were unwholesome marks on the carpet. We love old and period properties, but they can be well kept - this wasn't. However, the staff in the dining room were a delight. The more mature chap and the younger men and women - all cheerful, helpful and working so well as a team. They are the only reason this review is scored as three stars. It certainly wouldn't be if reliant on accessibility, reception on arrival ( excellent on departure), or the room.

The location is great, just off the M40 in the centre of Banbury. The hotel offered free parking, although the entrance to the car park is through a narrow passage that some larger cars might struggle with! The hotel looks lovely from the outside, and the reception area was very nice too - the room let it down as although it was clean it needed a bit of a refurb, mainly the carpet that was rather worn and the windows were old and needed re-painting. That said, the bed was comfy, the TV was huge, the bathroom was lovely and clean with a fab shower. The room had tea/coffee making facilities and a hair dryer, plus an iron and ironing board. We didn't have a view from our room, but the gardens at the back looked lovely. We didn't have breakfast so cannot comment and I think if we had had a better room with a better view, we may have rated it higher, but to us it was just an average hotel - great for a one night stopover. What made it great was the town of Banbury - lots of restaurants, pubs and shops, a great little place. There are two Wetherspoons pubs in walking distance - we had breakfast there for half the price they were charging at the hotel.
