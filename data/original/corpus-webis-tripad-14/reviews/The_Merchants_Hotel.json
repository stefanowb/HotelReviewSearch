Another thing about this hotel is the stairs, be warned there are lots of them and no lifts! Also the hotel could improve on a few things such as providing soaps and towels in the toilets and the staff could be more helpful and also they tried to get me out of my room at 10.00am earlier then the 11am advertised.

Then I read the reviews which made me a little nervous. We booked 2 double rooms, one which was room 1 and the other room 5. Me & my friend walked into room 5, turned on the very dim lights and were very disappointed. The mirror was above a sink which was very difficult to look into, outside of the manky windows was a lovely view of extractor fans from the building across. They didn't have wardrobes, just hangers on a rail from the ceilingl. Was a good job we brought ipod speakers because the TV didn't work at all, neither did the remote. Downstairs in room 1 was slightly brighter and had laminate floors. When my friends walked into the room after our night out the room was flooded as the sink had leaked. Before we went out I needed to have a shower in the shower room (we didnt have an ensuite). I was scared 2 death because there was a big window but no curtain and I didn't know if anybody could see me on the other side. I relucantly got in the shower cubicle and could feel it moving as though the fitting would come off! The Polish woman on reception warned us that the fire alarm would go off between the hours of 6am and 7am for a few minutes but not to worry. What kinda hotel does that on a Sunday morning? Anyway it did and was the loudest noise in the world. There were lots of other crap things about it too including it smelt like an old folks home. Plus u have to leave really early in the morning.

I arrived at 7pm and it was already dark. I walked along the dark alley and rang the buzzer. As I made my way up the stairs I was aware of the tatty decor, but for \u00a335, I wasn't expecting the Ritz - so I carried on. At the reception, all was ok. Got my key and made my way to the room. This is when alarm bells started ringing. The floor was covered in wallpaper that had been scraped off the wall and I was dodging a set of ladders on the stairs with a Polish guy about 40 foot in the air scraping away at the wall. Once I got to the top of the stairs and walked along the landing, he was still higher up than me! Anyway, into the room I go. No toilet or shower. 1single bed, a sink and a rack for hanging things up. I sat on the bed and was over powered by the smell of dampness, so I opened the window and went out for dinner. When i came back I went straight to bed but couldn't sleep because the dampness was sticking in my throat. When I looked at the wall, up in the corner, you could see the black dampness coming through the wallpaper. The wall paper looked quite fresh, but cheap. Eventually I went to the reception and asked to be moved. The manageress / receptionist / breakfast host / housemaid / cleaner (I seen her do all these jobs) was nice enough and agreed to move me. Whilst I was at the reception I noticed 6, 2 litre cartons of milk lying in the hallway, and it wasn't a chilled hallway. Tomorrows breakfast milk, I thought to myself! Anyway, she then phoned the boss and he said I could go into a \"better room\"! It was better. It had a double bed and a TV but, Stinked of smoke and DAMPNESS. The smokey smell masked the dampness, so I stuck it out all night. Woke up a few times because of the loud drunks in the alleyway. Breakfast was cereal and then toast, which suited me. I then checked out and breathed a sigh of relief when I was back on the street! I was going to stay at the youth hostel before I booked but I prefered to have my own room. Wish i had now. Only stay at this 'hotel' if you are used to cheap furniture, poor quality housing or sleeping on paper sheets! Oh, nearly forgot, the artiificial walls are paper thin too, so pray for quiet residents in the next room(s). I would have gave this hotel 1/5 if it wasn't for the fact I was able to move rooms.
