Overall, we were very disappointed and would not stay there again. Firstly, we were directed to our room to find cleaning staff still preparing the room. Rather than being advised to contact front desk we were left to stand in the car park with our luggage while waiting for the room to be finished. Then, we discovered that our 'deluxe hotel room' was a tiny room which did not include anything to sit on other than the bed nor was there a seat on the balcony to enjoy the view that we had payed extra for. As we were trying to unpack, our door was then opened by a staff member who seemed very surprised to see us there! Staff did eventually find us a chair --- we were informed that rooms at Outrigger are furnished individually and there is no guarantee as to what you will find in your room. Unlike other reviews, when we tried to raise our concerns, we were informed that it had nothing to do with Outrigger and that we would have to discuss it with the booking agents. That night, we enjoyed the sounds (and smells) of our neighbours in the adjoining apartment as they prepared their steak meal and unpacked in the connecting room. We discovered that there was only a very thin door that separated us from them. On the day of our departure, we were awoken by staff knocking on our door at 8.30am to ask when we were leaving. Given check-out time was 10am. we informed them that we would be leaving then. About half hour later, we heard water dripping over the balcony from above, quickly followed by a down-pour of water that lasted for about 10 minutes, causing us to close the balcony door so we wouldn't get drenched. On check-out when we mentioned this to staff (thinking they may be concerned) she pleasantly and unapologetically informed us that the water came from the spa in the apartment above which was being cleaned.

There are plenty of places to stay at Queenstown -- if you're considering one of the hotel rooms rather than apartments, think twice before booking Outrigger at Beacon.", "title": "Very disappointed", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "slowtravellers", "date": "March 31, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7260972, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the view", "disliked": "\u2014 unhelpful staff, small room, noise, spa water from above being dumped on our balcony"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled on business", "text": "I was quite surprised by the quality of the hotel.
