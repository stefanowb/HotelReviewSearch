I was very disappointed when the owner pointedly asked me if we planned to bring our dogs with us when we were heading out for the day. I told her we would be usually but if we were shopping or eating out they would be in the room. She then told me of all the times peoples usually well behaved dogs behaved poorly in her rooms (chewing a bed corner=, ruining the blinds, and barking). It was less than 30 minutes after we left to shop we received a phone call saying the dogs were barking excessively. When we got there a few minutes later they were not barking at all. Upon check out we found out the time at which they were barking the place was a \"madhouse\". There were people coming and going, tons of people checking in, three dog sled teams checked in with their dogs barking in the trucks, well no wonder they were barking. Not to mention the dog friendly room we were in was on the main floor in the center of the parking lot that saw the most traffic out of any other room. The room was so hot we had to sleep with the windows open, even though we had the heat off in the middle of winter. The second and third night we just had to sweat it out because of the barking dog sled teams\u2019 right outside our windows. The walls and ceilings were so thin we could perfectly hear the conversation or upstairs neighbors were having at 12:30 in the morning. Our dog dig tear a sheet with her nail on their \"Expensive Organic Sheets,\u201d Fortunately we were only billed $25.00, which we were not notified of until after they charged it. We received the receipt in the mail a few days after the charge with a demeaning note telling us maybe we \"learned our lesson\" and that the sheets are normally $125 since they are organic, but since these sheets are older they only charged us $25.00, which come to think of it is how much my husband and I paid for our sheet sets that are organic at target. By the way, the sheets on the beds did not even match. This was an awful stay, snowmobiles ran by all night, the hosts were inhospitable, the bed and room uncomfortable, and not all that dog friendly.", "title": "Very cozy", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Aljennings", "date": "February 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 152033245}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Decided to take a last minute weekend away to Ely for the winter festival.
