The room was big and roomy, the bed comfortable, the pillows nice and fluffy, which is not always the case. Also, the blackout curtains were heavy enough to really block out light. There was internet service, a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. The TV got dozens of channels. The complimentary breakfast consisted of bread, bagels, coffee and two cold cereals, but no fruit or pastries.
