So a few minutes later we left & arrived at the front desk at about 5:25. I asked the lady where the shuttle was and she said it just left. Well I exchanged some words with trying to figure out why it left 5 minutes early, and than walked outside. I eventually walked back in for some more words but before I said anything she told me that a gentleman named Willy would take us once the shuttle for back. When the shuttle arrived we tried to board but was denied by the driver who also happened to be the hotel manger, Natu. We told Natu that his employee Willy agreed to take us but Natu didn't care and proceeded to yell at us in front of the hotel. He told us we were late and had to wait for the next shuttle in an hour. My friend looked at Natus watch and told him it was six minutes fast. Natu still didn't care and kept yelling at us. It was such a terrible experience. He eventually gave up and let Willy take us. Willy was a super friendly guy and it was very much our pleasure to meet and talk to someone like him. Willy was the highlight of our stay and I hope he can seek employment else where because he doesn't deserve working for someone like Natu. Natu should be removed from his position. Besides Willy, this place was awful and no one should have this kind of experience anywhere, especially when your a paying customer. Find another hotel!
