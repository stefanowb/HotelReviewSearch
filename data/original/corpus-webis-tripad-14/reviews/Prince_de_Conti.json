The hotel is a small inn. Our room was in the front with windows on the street. This is a very busy street (some called it an alley) and it was loud all night long. I liked the uniqueness of the hotel. It is not quite as elegant as in the pictures, but it is still a very nice hotel. We did have a confusing discussion with one of the front desk persons over whether or not there was a second bed in the room. He insisted there were two beds in the room. We jokingly went upstairs and started looking in drawers and closets to find the second bed. That was very strange. Never went to the lounge or the courtyard.

There was no air conditioning throughout our stay (the builders had apparently cut through it). The courtyard where we were hoping to relax during the day was unavailable because of the building works. The \"superior rooms\" were tired, the paintwork was chipped and dirty, matresses worn and bathrooms were dirty with a cracked sink in the 6th floor room, but I have to say the staff were always pleasant until the last day when they presented the bill offering to take 30 euros off one room because my pregnant daughter had complained she could not sleep on the first night because of the lack of air conditioning. After further embarrassing complaining they reduced the bill by 20 euros a night, saying that we should have checked to see if they had building works on before we arrived.

The stained carpets need to be changed and the dark green paint in the hallways also needs to be redone. The reception is just fair. The layout of the property is lovely, but better use of the open courtyard is recommended. The little private patio our traveling companions had also stored the hotel's potting soil!
