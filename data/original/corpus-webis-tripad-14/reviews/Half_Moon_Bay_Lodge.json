After touring other cities in the area, we wanted a couple of days of relaxation, and this property was perfect. Room was a nice size with plenty of room for my family of 4 (2 queen beds), very clean, comfortable, and we appreciated the back patio overlooking the golf course, heated swimming pool and really nice spa area, outdoor fireplace (it was chilly in June!) in-room fridge, coffee, wet-bar area, high-end complimentary toiletries and good internet access. The included breakfast was so nice, too. Fresh items both cold and a few hot items (great waffles :) in an atmosphere that makes you feel as if you are in a nice restaurant. Even though it is self-service, the atmosphere really makes a difference - real plates, cups and silverware, classical music playing, fireplace/hearth, etc. Room service is available for lunch/dinner from adjacent restaurant (did not use, but was available if needed). Landscaping around the property is beautiful, and well-tended. I loved sitting around the pool area and watching the hummingbirds. My only disappointments were on the first night, there was lots of noise from the room above us, but it must have been vacant on the second night because it was quiet. Also, there is no air conditioning at this property, only central heating unit. For the most part, I would imagine that it is not needed, but our room did get a bit stuffy by the morning when it was all closed up for the night. When we were in the room, we keep the patio door open for a cool breeze and the bathroom window open to circulate air in there. Although the window is very high, and has a screen and translucent glass when you close it, it still felt weird to have the window open while showering and such, and hearing the people walking by. We closed/locked both the patio door and bathroom window when retiring for the night, and with ceiling fan on it was ok for most of the night. By the time morning came, it was a bit stuffy and we needed some fresh air. Keep in mind that the temps here in June were in the upper 50's during the day, and low 40's at night. Even with this, we enjoyed our stay very much. This is an affordable option with lots extras that make it feel special. I would stay again.", "title": "Very nice property, budget friendly with lots of extras", "user": "Tessa C", "date": "June 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 164741288}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Poorly maintained room. First off, as we were leaving for a massage the slider did not lock. When I called the front desk the person said \"Oh, well it is pretty safe around here.\" Really? You know everyone that checked in? You can guarantee the couple who looked like they had not showered in days, who were hitch hiking in front of Original Joes were not going to come onto the property? You know that no one stopping at Original Joes would not cross over to the hotels parking lot (no fence), and look for rooms unlocked? (I saw at least four people walking across the back lawn where this unlocked slider door was. I don't care if they are wearing polo shirts, anyone can come in and steal my laptop!) So after insisting she send someone, and after being told they might not be able to fix it, someone comes (Now mind you, I am now late for my massage at Cloud Nine, all because the management here cannot maintain their locks.) He fiddles with it, slams the door, opens the door, fiddles some more and some more (no tools were being used), and opens and shuts it (as my massage time is a ticking) and finally he gets it to lock. I ask what was wrong. He does not know, now it is locked. Guess I don't get to open my door again (and when I do in the morning, I cannot lock it to go to breakfast, meaning I had to pack my car first and drag my damn lap top to breakfast).", "title": "Not worth the price; Poor customer service", "user": "MissT115", "date": "June 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 163981277}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "Ceiling fan was not working and there was no switch for it (was it only for looks, in this room that was now 85 degrees with the heater off?), so at 11pm I was brought a fan which was so dirty and dusty I had to wipe it down and wash my hands after handling it.

Our relatives' \"basic\" room on 2nd floor seemed even larger with cathedral ceilings and a balcony. Pool, hot tub beautifully maintained; also a small exercise room with sauna. \"Continental Breakfast\" included real scrambled eggs replenished frequently, waffles, sausage, juices, teas and coffee, plus an array of pastries and breads which delighted my husband. The lovely breakfast room overlooking the pool was quiet, charming, and had classical music playing - no TV blaring! Hotel doesn't have its own restaurant for lunch and dinner, but Joe's, right in front of the hotel, on Hwy.1, has good fresh, well-prepared food and will provide room service. Good beds. Any request was met with an immediate and helpful response. Virtually everything about Half Moon Bay Lodge was better than expected. The value is exceptional, if you reserve via hotel website.

Although we only live forty-miles away, we decided to spend the weekend at the coast, visiting the elephant seals at Ano Nuevo State Beach, as well as the Moss Beach Tidepools. HMB Lodge was a perfect location. Our young daughter LOVED the heated swimming pool, and we loved the lovely hot tub/gazebo. And breakfast is included, which far exceeded most 'free breakfast' at hotels. Excellent. Yes, some of the decor is a bit dated to the 80's, but they were actively upgrading rooms while we were there. Although this is no Ritz Carlton (which is behind the HMB Lodge), it is perfect for moderate budgets and taste.
