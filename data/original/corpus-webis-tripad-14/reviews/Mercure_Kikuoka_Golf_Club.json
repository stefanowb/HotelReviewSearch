We were on a bike trip along the Mosel River and the value of this hotel enticed us. It is in a beautiful rural setting. The hotel is clean, modern and run by a professional staff. The restaurant was excellent. We sat out in the courtyard by the golf course and had a tranquil and delicious meal. Our family room was two-tiered. The kids were on the bottom floor while we had an open aired room at the top of the stairs. The indoor pool was awesome. We opted not to have the pricey breakfast and ate a bakery in a nearby town. I give five stars for the above reasons, but also because we got an amazing online deal.", "title": "Beautiful, Quiet Setting", "user": "chetsuabo", "date": "January 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148831881}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "after reading the very good tripadvisor and booking.com reviews I had great expectations of this hotel... maybe too high expectations :-) Hotel is located in the middle of a beautiful golf course in a very green and quit environment about 20km from Luxembourg city. Eating at the hotel restaurant is the only option... whe wanted the fresh pasta but were told that if we don't eat several dishes we should go to the bar. Bar food was ok / Kikuoka Burger was world class. Service is ok, although people have language difficulties they are very friendly.. Rooms are big and clean but 'cold' and boring design... almost no bathroom stuff, no mini bar - go to the soda machine- a lcd tv with the size of a computer screen and the bed isn't what you would expect in a 4* hotel. I was really disappointed when they told me in the leisure area that I had to pay an extra 8\u20ac for the sauna ... this wasn't indicated on the website... pool was free and nice.", "title": "Wrong expectations I presume.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Stephen-Gent_Belgium", "date": "October 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 143564270}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I think this could be a nice hotel when you want to invite all of your friends to a wedding party... but with a reduced price of 89\u20ac on a friday evening I'm sure you can find alternatives that are much much better.", "title": "excellent for a weekend stay", "user": "nicholas m", "date": "October 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 143505552}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "hotel is right on the golf course - good sized rooms - excellent sports facilities - lots of free parking - ideal for young families and golfers - the hotel is about 20 minutes from the centre of Luxembourg and 15 minutes from the airport -", "title": "overnight stopover", "user": "philip r", "date": "September 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 141510799}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Used this hotel for an overnight stop on a long journey.
