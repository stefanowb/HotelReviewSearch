The stay was excellent. We arrived at 9PM and checking was fast. We were located on the second floor. There were two elevators so there was never much of a wait there. As soon as we entered the room, I checked out the bathroom. It was very clean and pretty roomy. The counters were marble and included a coffee maker and hair dryer. The shower was clean with a multi stage shower head. The room had two double beds and each bed included four pillows each and very comfortable sheets with duvets. The room included a chair and also a desk with an office chair. There was a flat screen television with full local cable of at least 60 channels. There were plenty of storage if one would need storage in the drawers and also there was a refridgerator also in the room. It was not a full size but it was not a \"mini\" fridge either. Also a celing fan complimented the room as I never see celing fans in hotel rooms. I then checked out the rest of the hotel and it included an indoor swimming pool that starts at 3ft and goes to 5ft deep. There was no hot tub but we did enjoy the pool as we were the only family there. There is also a nice workout room as well as a buisness center with two computers for general use. I used the wireless in the room and it worked fine. Breakfast was complimentary and was fine. They had three types of cereals, several danishes/muffins/bagles. They also serve two hot items, Day one was belgin waffles and potatoes and the second day was cheese omlets and sausage. They did not have any sodas in the breakfast area but they did offer coffee, milk, water, apple, orange and cranberry juice. Checkout was easy and fast. Everyone that worked for the hotel was nice and greeted us.", "title": "Humbled by Hampton", "user": "Campuscop", "date": "March 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25876697}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "New and well constructed hotel with very nice landscaping, lobby area, and pleasant staff.
