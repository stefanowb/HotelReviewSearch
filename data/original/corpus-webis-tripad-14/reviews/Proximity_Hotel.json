I have to say it was worth every penny. We stayed in a Loft King Center Room room on the 7th floor. Last time we stayed in the Loft King Spa and it was breathtaking. This room was much more roomier and the layout was wonderful. I liked the bathroom was separated more than the Spa room. The Spa rooms are nestled along the long hallways and the Center rooms are on the ends so you have a lot more privacy. We didn't hear a peep and there was a wedding party, Bachelorett's party, etc. there during out stay. The check in was friendly and we were offered assistance with dinner reservations. We ate at the recommended Lucky 32 Southern Bistro and Print Works Bistro. See my reviews for them as well if you are considering trying out the local flair. Hope this is helpful.
