My husband and I had lived in Milan for a year and a half so this would not have been our first choice had we wanted to book for convenience or price. However, because we are HiltonHonors diamond members, the room was booked with points, which meant it was free, we were upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival, were granted free Internet access and access to the executive lounge. We found this service to be superb. Our suite was very nice and typical U.S. Hilton standards. Very large, clean, and quiet with water and fruit provided upon check in. The executive lounge was top notch and reminded me of the British Airways lounge in Heathrow. The staff was wonderful and allowed us to check out late. The hotel is a convenient location if you are passing through Stazione Centrale, but it is not near to the famous sights of Milan. That being said, the sights are all easily accessible by tram or taxi. Would definitely stay again if we could book the room for free but I wouldn't pay my own money to stay here because I prefer a budget hotel when I'm paying.", "title": "superb, if you have Hilton honors diamond status", "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "September 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117876140}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We chose this hotel because it was convenient for the transfer bus from the airport and in that respect it did not disappoint.
