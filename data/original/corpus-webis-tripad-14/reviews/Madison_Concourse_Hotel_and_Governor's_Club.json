I had two rooms -- one on the 8th floor, one on the 10th -- and the contrast between them was considerable. The room on the 8th floor was clean but felt very small & there was no refrigerator; there were also no screens on the window. My second night, I moved up to the 10th floor, and the room felt much bigger; it had a decent-sized refrigerator, which made all the difference to me, as I like to keep water, milk & fruit in the frig for hotel stays of more than one night; there was a screen on the window, which had a great view of the state capitol; so the experience of the two rooms was really very different. The hotel food was decent, but not in any way exceptional, but there are so many restaurants on State Street just a stone's throw away that there's no reason to limit yourself to the hotel restaurant. The meeting rooms were standard hotel meeting rooms; the only really annoying thing was that they were kept at Antarctic temperatures and hotel staff had to be asked to turn down the air conditioning -- ridiculous, given that it was only in the low 70s during the week I was staying there in August.", "title": "A good, solid, business class hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "savvyworldtraveler", "date": "August 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117271448}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed for just one night with my husband as part of a wedding-block.
