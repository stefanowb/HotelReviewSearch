Great to be close to Margaret River yet away from the loads of tourists who were around there. Visited Augusta, Cape Leuwin and the Jewel Cave, all of which were well worthwhile though for a first visit to this area you should include a guided wine tour.

Stayed 2 nights, wish it was longer. Immaculate, very comfortable room, with your own back patio area. Very comfy bed with plenty of decent pillows! It's 10 mins from M.River and many of the great wineries in the region. Beaches and other attractions a little further away but all within 1/2 hours drive. Room facilities are excellent incl microwave and dishes/cutlery if you wish to eat in. Amenities provided are exellent....even a full bar of soap, :) Nice little touches in the room to make you feel comfortable. Hosts, Donna & Rod are very friendly and helpful & address you by name and take a genuine interest in you and your holiday. They provide plenty to eat at breakfast; all healthy (which you need after indulging in the fine wines and other gourmet delights in the region) . Our personal recommendation for fine dining in the region is to lunch at at one of the wineries and eat in for dinner. We found it hard to find a decent meal in the evening from M. River through to Dunsborough but to be fair we didn't try the local one(s) in Cowaramup. The words...\"guest house\" is 'spot on' in the name as we truly felt like guests. Stayed 9th & 10th March 2011. Wish it was longer. Thanks Donna & Rod for a peaceful, comfy stay.
