While this is a 'resort\" and I am sure some people never leave the grounds for their entire stay, it is very easy to get to San Diego using either the hotel water shuttle or the local ferry. (We walked from Amtrak station to ferry to hotel--no need for a rental car!) There are several good restaurant options within easy walking distance if you don't want to eat at the hotel. The grounds are lovely, complete with ducklings, fish and flamingos. Our room was good-sized and had a balcony which was a great place to sit and read the newspaper, etc. There are several pools and hot tubs, including a lap pool for more serious swimmers. The main pool overlooks the Bay and was a great place to watch fireworks after the ball game at Petco Park.

Genuine resort experience, but with a relaxing and unpretentious feel. All staff we interacted with very customer service-oriented. The location is perfect, looking across the harbor towards the downtown skyline, with the span of the Coronado Island Bridge in view. A pleasurable 5-minute walk along the harbor takes you to the Ferry Landing village of shops and restaurants, including Coronado Cupcakery (which we frequented), Il Fornaio, Candelas On the Bay, and Village Pizzeria, all of which were satisfying. A short drive to the ocean side of the island through charming houses lands you on a beautiful, wide beach (lifeguards included), with the stately Hotel del Coronado completing the picture. Great place to take kids - we and our two teenage boys loved the pool, restaurant, and all the hotel amenities.

We arrived on Saturday July 7th for a one night stay and arrived very early to the resort. Thanks Ilana! They quickly tried to accommodate an early check in and we used our points for the stay. One reviewer said you were not eligible for a bay view upgrade but they are wrong. It is a $29.00 charge and the best money you could spend. The parking is $22.00 for self park or $28.00 for valet. The self parking is underground and is super easy so I would suggest going with that option. The lobby and bar are spacious, with modern decor. We had a light lunch outside on the patio area. The Baja Fish Tacos were awesome but the rice and beans were bland. The fresh Margarita's were WONDERFUL! Not loaded down with sweet syrup mix...For dinner we walked to a beautiful restaurant nearby and had a romantic dinner.
