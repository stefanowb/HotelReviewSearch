I was starving after traveling for so long, and Mark recommended a great place to eat at nearby. Kudos to Mark! The hotel is beautiful inside.... rooms are gorgeous and clean.

I had watched the prices on this hotel and they became lower a couple weeks before our trip commenced so I contacted Marriott Rewards and they changed the existing reservation to the much-lower rate. The hotel is historic and was renovated not long ago, giving it a nice retro look and feeling. We got a nice room on the 12th floor and had a good river view, which afforded us a front row seat to the deluge that started after (thankfully) we got to our room.
