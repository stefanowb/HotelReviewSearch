We were very happy with the location and the ease of getting to all theme parks. Directions from the air[port were right on. When we arrived at 11:00am, not expecting for early check-in, the front desk staff were very, very nice and checked us in immediately! We were very happy with the cleanliness of the room, comfort of the beds, and the separate toilet/sink set-up, that's always nice. Free buffet breakfast was a great plus. Breakfast included is usually not all it's cracked up to be, but, this one was. Hot belgian waffles, assorted muffins, bagels, cereals, breads, yogurt, fruit, juice, coffee, etc. I would highly recommend this hotel. Only one downside, we arrived on Thursday May 31st, not knowing that apparently this was some kind of lesbian convention. The Marriott Village was completely taken over by this event! My daughter and myself felt very uncomfortable walking around the village, as many lesbians were drunk, obnoxious, and very affecectionate to each other, shall we say!!!! If we knew this was taking place that weekend we would have made it the following week. Anyways, we didn't let this ruin our vacation, as we spent very little time at the hotel. All in all, I would definetly stay here again!!!", "title": "Really good", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Ruba06", "date": "May 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7720333}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is among the best.
