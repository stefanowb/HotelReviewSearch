The beds are very firm, and one of the two beds in our room was very creaky. The shower was small and tended to flood onto the bathroom floor. Room service was fine the first few days, but the attendant failed to replace our towels on the last day; also, she typically left the room with the window wide open (with no screen). The closet setup was bizarre, with drawers that couldn't really be opened, and it was oddly cold compared with the rest of the room (probably only a problem in the winter), resulting in an unpleasantly chilly experience when we first put our clothes on in the morning.
