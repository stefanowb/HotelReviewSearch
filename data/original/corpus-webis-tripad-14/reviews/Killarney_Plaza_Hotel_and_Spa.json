We had dinner in the Petrus Restaurant on one night and this was superb great value at 45euros per person for 3 courses, the buffet breakfast offered a fantastic choice of hot and cold meals, something for everyone.. The leisure centre had a very nice indoor swimming pool in a very calming environment, jacquzzi, saunas and steam rooms were also available and all complimentary, spa treatments and a gym was also available but we did not use these. The hotel offers complimentary car parking in the secure basement area of the hotel for the duration of your stay, a hire car is definitely recommended to enjoy this most beautiful part of Ireland. For best hotel room rates contact the hotel directly on telephone number [-], we got a rate of 310euros which was per person for a 3 night stay and included full Irish Breakast each morning and Dinner on one evening. We will definitely return to the Killarney Plaza, choosing another hotel simply is not an option! When in Killarney you must eat at the great \"Cooperage Restaurant\" located just off the high street and about a 5 minute walk from the hotel door, you must also visit the most picturesque fishing village of Dingle just 40 miles away, enroute to Dingle stop by the beach area in the town of Inch, it is most beautiful.
