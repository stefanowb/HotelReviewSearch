Also I saw him with two caucasian teenagers who were guests at a table in the lobby, discussing something quielty that made me think it was a drug deal. My other buddy saw the same thing.

He was there every night (again not a guest) he had some hightops and past the knew shorts. My wife also saw him walking next to one of his girls and made a hand motion that made the girl put her hands up as to protective herself from a blow.

Lobby areas and restaurants fine. The rooms however, well ours at least, were unacceptable for a 4* hotel. l can only describe them as tired ,scruffy and worn out. Polyfiler used throughout bathroom to cover patches, broken tiles and infills. Shower head blocked so, after making a complaint, it was replaced, new one kept falling off. Hairdryer with no guard on so children could poke fingers in! On top of that it was dirty as well. The maid never cleaned the toilet, just put bleach or similar down it and wiped over sink taps.TOWELS! We spent every single day with some issue over them. Being all inclusive we thought we would have nothing to worry about instead every day was hassle.Only once in 14 days did we have 2 bath towels, 1 hand towel a flannel and bath mat. Be warned it wasn't just us. Our teenage children were in the room next door and had exactly the same problem as did other people on our floor, block 3 main building 4th floor. On two occasions for 2 whole days we had NO towels at all in ours or our kids room! When we did get towels even if we hadn't put them out for washing the maid would still take them! We complained to staff and rep many times, nothing seemed to help they just say ok or in 10 minutes. After a day at the beach what do you do! We tried tipping but after a couple of days we thought why should we tip for such appalling service. In fact we think the maid checked to see if we had left a tip and if we hadn't took she took the towels! Our beds were only changed once in two weeks and after 3 days maid knocked and gave us pillowcases! As you can imagine we will be writing to our tour operator with these unacceptable issues.Please dont choose this hotel there must be better.

This was a trip booked in April (our trip took place June 24 to July 1). Fancy drinks do not make up for their lack of organization and intentions to work. The room we actually booked for was given to someone else, so we were put somewhere else. I would say that they took advantage that we were to young girls ( 20 & 21 ) and could careless about our \"accomodations\". Our room was in building #1, and I think we were the only ones staying on that side of the resort. Why, you ask? Probably because there was no hot water, thats if there was water to begin with and because there was literally a \"dump\" on that side of the resort, and it smelled horrible!!! After countless number of phone calls to the front desk, we gave up. They simply don't care and have no intentions to work. They said they would put us in the room we were originally supposed to be in the next day, so we figured we could survive 1 night. Not suprisingly, when we went to switch rooms they told us that the people who were staying in that room decided to stay another week. Hmmmm, ok, but we told them we could not stay in that room another night and still wanted to switch. So they took us to a room that was \"newly finished\" and they were sure we would be completely satified. So there we were, in our new room. Little did we know, one night there was a tropical storm. Very close to being a hurricane. Chairs were flying, glasses were breaking, plantpots were breaking, pretty scary. And our room was flooded. There was water in the bathroom, in the living room (thank god we had one), and part of our bedroom. And when i say flooded, i mean it was like the little kids' pool at the resort. And might i add that we were on the 4th floor. Well, the next night came the blackout and it was just as eventful. I would say our entire stay had its ups and downs.

Just got back from the Barcelo Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. The service was horrible and communication was impossible. If you don't speak Spanish or understand it you are in trouble. The bartenders in the pool bar all had very bad attitudes no matter how much money you tipped them. The conversion rate at the time was 33 to 1 so a $10-$15-$20 tip should have been awesome for them. It made no difference at all. The food was not very good either. The Tokyo restaurant was sweltering hot and the food was pretty salty, the Roma restaurant was our favorite, the fried eggplant was delicious and we ended up making reservations twice there. Do NOT eat at the Conuco restaurant. It is terrible and we ended up taking one bite of our entree' and leaving and going to the buffet. The one and only Mexican restaurant was closed and under construction (as were many things). The beach and water were both exquisite. The downside is that there isn't any type of refreshment area, you have to walk back up to the resort (which isn't far) to get water or anything to drink. The worse part is that there is always a line to stand in, a long line at that, and typically only 2 bartenders in a bar area that's about 100 ft long, go figure. The entertainment was entertaining and enjoyable. The floor, both inside and out was extremely slippery. We witnessed many people who fell and several who were injured rather severely from it, so be careful. Also, there is construction in progress at the resort, they don't tell you that. Many people complained because even at 8:30 in the evening the hammering and drilling was going on. It did not affect the manager at all, apparently they work on up into the night. So be sure your room is away from the construction area. The rooms were ok, nothing to write home about. At least the a/c worked. We will not go back to this resort.

When we arrived we were seen too at reception very quickly, we ended up with one of the old rooms which was below average in the sense it smelt musty, the air con was sub standard, there was a leak in the bathroom ceiling and the hairdryer didn't work. I complained and the hairdryer was fixed but because the room wasn't cold enought the mosquitos were quite happy in there. We put up with this room for 6 days after which time we decided on upgrading to a renovated room, it cost us for 8 nights about \u00a3180 but it was money well spent, there was a celing fan above the bed the air con woked and it was very well decorated with a sea and pool view, it felt like we had moved from 3star to 5 star.", "title": "Watch your valuables!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "st_toronto", "date": "September 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 20290235, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 waiters", "disliked": "\u2014 Theives"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Generally the hotel was nice, especially the pool areas, one of which is very entertainment orientated with a swim up bar, the other was quieter with sun loungers built into the pool and a jacuzzi area in the middle.
