Maria and Giacomo were very hospitable and really tried to make our stay memorable (which it was). We loved the location right on the water and being able to leave the window open at night to listen to the waves. Had no trouble booking direct by email and just had to ring ahead a day or two to notify arrival time by train so that Giacomo could meet us. The room was clean and special touches like fresh flowers are noticed and appreciated. There were also several restaurants within no more than a 2-3 minute walk. For us the village of Vernazza was the perfect location - the first day we walked from Vernazza to Corniglia to Manarola to Riomaggiore, which took us about 4.5 hours (we weren't hurrying, but enjoying the walk, views and interesting villages along the way). We then caught the ferry back from Riomaggiore to Vernazza (25 mins). On our second day we did the more challenging walk from Vernazza to Monterosso which took us about 1.5 hours, and caught the train back to Vernazza. Unfortunately our stay coincided with Liberation Day (a public holiday) which meant plenty of day trippers along the Cinque Terre and it was very, very busy on the tracks and in the villages. Would definitely stay in Vernazza again and at Maria and Giacomo's.
