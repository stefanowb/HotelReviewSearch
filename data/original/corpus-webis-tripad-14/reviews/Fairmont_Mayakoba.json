Our time there was wonderful! The rooms are huge -- especially the beautiful bathrooms which have a double sink, seperate lavatory room, a soaking tub and an enormous shower. We were in the 500 section which is approximately in the middle of the resort near the main pool area. I've read some of the other reviews about waiting 30 minutes for a golf cart (why would you do that when it doesn't take more than 15 minutes to walk anywhere) to pick you up and have to say we did not experience that. The carts ran constantly We actually walked most of the time both to the beach and to the lobby/convention center area. The resort also has mountain bikes available at all tram stops which can be used for free to get around and a boat system. The staff are very polite and eager to be of service. The grounds are beautiful. We loved the infinity edge pool by the ocean. The gym at the spa has high end workout equipment and was usually almost empty when I went. Only downsides were about half of the people in our party came down with the stomach flu although I'm sure it happened off the resort. The food was just OK. The breakfast buffet's could have been better. Drinks were very high priced. The beach was also really windy - think sandblasting. I have never been to Cancun before so I'm not sure if that's common or not. Despite a few minor shortcomings I would strongly recommend this resort!", "title": "First Class Operation!

Walking around the property takes a while since it is so spread out. They do offer trolley service around the property as well as water shuttles to select places and one can use the hotel's bikes to get around, although the walkways are not super wide and can to treacherous to negotiate. The rooms are very new, modern, and clean. Our suite had a living room with patio overlooking the waterway and a distant ocean view, the bedroom had a king bed with additional seating, and there were two full bathrooms in our room. The spa is really spectacular with separate men's and women's sauna, outdoor whirlpool, and steam rooms. The lobby restaurant was pricey and good, but since the food in Playa is so good in general, we felt it was much better to eat in town. The beach is very large, though there were lots of rocks in the ocean so remember to bring your aquasocks. There are several pools--one at the beach and the main one in the middle of the property, which is really a series of smaller pools linked together. Plenty of chairs and towels at both locations.
