Being so central, we were able to come back by around lunch time for the kid's nap and some play time. The hotel housekeeping staff cleaned our room so well that I felt absolutely comfortable with letting our toddler crawl around and play. We also took advantage of the kitchenette and cooked our kid's meals, since he had special dietary restrictions. A nearby supermarket let us purchase our produce at the beginning of our stay and we stored it in the room's minifridge. An international ATM across the street at the 7Eleven convenience store made it easy to take out money. The hotel had a breakfast that left much to be desired, but for the price of around 6 USD, we couldn't complain. Other hotels charge you around 30 USD for breakfast.

The double bed room with the sliding door is ideal for a little toddler and a portable crib, which you could rent from the hotel for around 25 USD a night.
