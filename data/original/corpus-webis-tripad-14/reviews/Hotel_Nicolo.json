We liked the location. Passy was quiet in August and had some very nice shops, but as has been said already wasn't very lively at night so we travelled further afield. This meant a bit of journey home in the late evening but the metro is only 5 minutes walk and the area felt very safe. Breakfast (included in the price) was very good too.
