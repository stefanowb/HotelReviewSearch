This property is not up to the usual Sheraton standard. We booked a suite and 2 other standard rooms as a break with family. There wasn't anything special about the suite which was way over priced. It's a glorified family room without the extra bedding as all we saw that was different was the square footage and a couch for seating. The decor of the room is nothing exceptional and the couch has a used 70's feeling about it - cheap effort at a retro I guess. The main lobby area is grotty and needs a good clean up. The seating area is not effective with couches on top of each other with coffee tables that weigh a ton which have to be shifted back and forth to access the space which doesn't provide enough leg room.
