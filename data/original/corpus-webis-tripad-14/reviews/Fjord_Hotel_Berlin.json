A very peaceful road very close to Potsdamer Platz , with a bus station right in the next corner!!The rooms are no luxurious but very spacious and very very clean.Breakfast was adequate enough(they even baked bread right in front of you),just what you need gain streangth!! The staff were very kind and helpful.They gave us maps of the city and information and even sell tickets for the means of transport. TIP: you don't have to use the metro since the bus routes of the city and the location of the hotel is so close to every major sight e.g.Potsdamer platz, Reihstag, Bradeburg tor , parizen platz, unter der linden,the spree river and so many more are 10 minutes on foot from the hotel.If you want to explore the city from the east to the west use the doubledeck buses 100 and 200 they practicaly take you everywhere!!And after a long day when you return to the hotel try the hotel's pub that offers you a very cosy enviroment.Berlin is such a wonderful city and when i go back I WILL DEFINATELY STAY AT HOTEL FJORD AGAIN!!!!", "title": "Lovely Hotel In The Middle Of Berlin", "helpfulness": 27, "user": "evemauve", "date": "August 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8460616, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Location , The Staff,The Price", "disliked": "\u2014 The Bees On The Terrace Where The Breakfast Floor Was"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "Very cheap (quarduple room for about \u00a360 per night).

Everything is lovely and clean and the staff are very friendly. If you are returning after 11pm in the evening you can let yourself in with the same key as your room key no problem at all. Breakfast is lovely and is served on the 7th floor with an inside area and a terrace which was great as we were lucky to have very sunny weather.

We were initially a little confused about finding the hotel, as the street was not on the map of Berlin in our guidebook, but it is right off Potsdamerstrasse just south of the Potsdamer Bridge. The M48 drops you half a block away or you can take the 200 bus [which connects with the airport bus at the Zoo] to Philharmonie and walk 10 minutes. The only concern I had is that if I were returning late at night by myself, the hotel's street is a quiet, not very well lit residential one and I might be a little nervous as a woman walking alone the few hundred meters off a major thouroughfare to a hotel where you need to fumble with your key to get in after 11PM.", "title": "Excellent value hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "alan1952", "date": "March 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 14519338, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Otherwise, I can think of no drawbacks to staying here, given the price that for 3 people was more like hostel rates than a hotel tariff.", "title": "does what it says on the box", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CITYBREAKERSCAMBS", "date": "October 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 10369291, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 A bit tired"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Together with friends, my wife and I stayed at the Lindemann Hotel Fjord for three nights over the Easter weekend. We did get a bit lost when we arrived at the Mendelssohn-Bartholdy Park Underground Station, but soon discovered the next morning that it was only about 400 metres from our hotel and fairly central for touring around Berlin. The hotel was very clean and reasonably priced but be careful if you have a drink in the bar as we thought that the bar prices were quite high (6 euros for a standard Gin and Tonic). A good choice of buffet breakfast in a very nice and airy roof restaurant for 11 euros. All in all a very good and reasonably priced hotel that served as a very good base for touring Berlin.
