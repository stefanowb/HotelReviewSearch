The next day as we started our sightseeing I realized just how central our hotel was and we could walk to just about everything from there. The included breakfast was clutch in the mornings and the great pizza place across the street saved us when we were too lazy to do anything but crawl into our beds after walking all day. Front desk staff were extremely helpful with directions, setting up tours and flamengo shows. I would definately stay there again - the only drawback is the carpeting they put a light colored carpet in a high traffic area and it now has a worn look to it. Other than that it is an excellent hotel.", "title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "user": "Elleboogie", "date": "August 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116754507}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed twice ( 5 days + 3 days) - the hotel is modern, rooms are rather small but well equiped, breakfest was very good.
