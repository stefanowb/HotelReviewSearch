However, when we checked in, I was immediately impressed with the cleanliness of the lobby. I don't think I've ever stayed at a hotel where the rooms were so clean and fresh smelling. The beds were comfortable, and the air conditioner kept the room comfortably cool without being noisy. Even though our room faced the freeway, it was one of the quietest hotel rooms we've ever stayed at. Never heard people in other rooms--even showering, walking in the halls, etc. Free continental breakfast each morning - large selection of donuts, bagels, croissants, pastries, orange juice and coffee. Within easy walking distance of the Metro (blue/yellow lines) and two shopping areas with food courts. Only paid $79 per night for a double which included free parking--$90 cheaper than one of the least expensive chain hotels in the same general area.

It's inexpensive and very clean. I needed to stay in the DC area on short notice for two nights in March, so I went with the Americana. Yes, it's inexpensive and clean. But the furnishing are really old. The phone looked like it was 20 years old and the sound on it kept going in and out. But the real dealbreaker was the door lock. Someone could easily break into your room. The hotel is not in a bad part of town by any means, but I noticed some homeless people out and about at night. My wife was thinking of staying here in a few months on her next trip to DC, and there's no way I would feel comfortable with her here given my concerns about safety.

Frustrated and about to cancel the trip, my husband found the Americana. I was skeptical at first due to references to the decor and the lack of some contemporary services.
