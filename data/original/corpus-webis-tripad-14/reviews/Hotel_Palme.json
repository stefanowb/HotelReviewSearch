Things to know, the train literally arrives in the center of town upstairs from the center of the beach. This means you are no more than 5 minutes in either direction from either end of town. Pack light, forget the taxi and walk to your hotel. The Palme is at the end of town and slightly up the street. The Hotel exterior seems newly renovated as do the rooms we occupied.
