First, if going anywhere in French Polynesia, bring a big wallet. We ferried over to Moorea in the morning and arrived at the hotel around 9am. Even though the hotel was nowhere near capacity, they told us and 2 other couples they would not check us in until 2pm. Thought this was kind of stingy. Hotel is isolated from everything else and no bus service to speak of on island. You can either taxi around (expensive) or walk (we did and regretted it), and we rented a car one day (freedom!). Hotel does rent bikes which we tried, but got rained out so returned them. The Sofitel is on a great beach (especially compared with other properties on island) with view of Tahiti. The pool was small and we spent our time on the beach. No drink/food service, but there is a snack hut that is open sometimes. Snorkeling equipment is included - we did that once and I didn't see much, though my husband did see a manta ray. Hotel breakfast buffet was $38 per person, so we passed on that. Dinner buffet was $75 per person!, so we passed on that as well. If that's a good price to you, then go for it, enjoy, but we couldn't pay that and still sleep at night. We did get some groceries at the only supermarket on island when we had the car, and had lunch (reasonable by French Poly standards) at the resort. Fridge in room barely kept foods cool. We kept filling our bath sink with ice to cool down drinks. Shower is open style (no curtain/door), which was OK with us - very honeymoony. Maids never brought us a new soap bar - finally had to call and ask, then they brought it promptly. Didn't find staff rude whatsoever, just kind of indifferent. Hotel offers Internet cards which can be used at computers on property. This was a convenient option and I'd recommend it (though I wasted many minutes trying to figure out French keyboard). Would be nice if hotel offered shuttle service to ferry area or town, but they don't even though they are close by car. If you want to be isolated and mostly stay on the resort and eat expensive meals, this is your place - it IS beautiful!", "title": "Beautiful resort with great beach", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "steptravel", "date": "December 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 51282030}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Returned this morning from the Sofitel, Wow! great for honeymooners!

Impeccable grounds and very friendly staff. This resort is so charming and landscaped, it almost feels like it's not real! The private and adjacent public beach is the prettiest beach we've seen in the world. There is not even a close second in our opinion. Why this beach never made a Travel Channel 'World's Top 10 Beaches\u2019 show is beyond us. Very thin white strip of sand next to the hotel with a beautiful, huge lagoon with a soft clay/sand bottom. When the sun is out, you'll see 10 different shades of blue. Great for kite surfing or windsurfing/sailboarding, swimming, kayaks, whatever you want to do in the water. We stayed in OWB 119, luckily the best one in the entire resort, at the end of the pier, with a great view of Tahiti (all the web site shots were taken from this OWB). OWB's 119 and 121 are the best in our opinion. Some of the OWB's that are closer to shore seemed a bit too crowded for our tastes; the beachfront suites and garden suites are adorable and very well landscaped with sufficient room between each other. We\u2019d opt for one of these rather than the OWB\u2019s that are closest to the shore, but that\u2019s just our opinion. The interior of our OWB was superb. Beautiful. The water off of our OWB was beautiful and clear. About 5 feet deep, too shallow to dive off into, but good snorkeling all around. Awesome snorkeling if you swim a bit to the right of the OWB's as you face the ocean. I was quite surprised, and I know others mention the Hilton as having the best snorkeling, and if it is in fact better than Sofitel, it must be other-worldly. Water was cool when you got into it, but after a minute it was fine. Note: There can be a strong current sweeping right across the OWB's from the NE, in fact almost too strong for those with little aquatic experience to swim against. In any event, worst case is you'd be washed up on the shore down the lagoon a bit, not out to sea. At other times, the lagoon was calm as a lake. Very, very pretty when the sun is out. Our weather was sunny for two days, then very, very windy and cloudy/rainy for three days :(. We made the best of it and took an ATV tour one day, organized through the hotel. It was spectacular in that it was very educational (from a geological and farming point of view.) It was not the ATV type tour that terrorized small animals, rather very challenging at times and with a tour of the inside of the crater, the Moorea agricultural park (they grow everything) and then a stop at a juice place where they'll make you any kind of juice you want from uber-fresh pineapples, bananas, mango's papaya's, pamplemousse (our favorite, a sweet green grapefruit) and many others. Topped off the ATV tour with a jaunt up Witch Mountain, with a very panoramic view over cook's bay and the Hilton-side of the island. Tour was about $300USD for two. Snorkeling tour was about $60USD pp. They have Jet Ski island tours, dolphin park ( made us sad, we hate those things) and great diving trips; by the way anything outside the reef anywhere in Tahiti is spectacular as far as diving. All kinds of activities at the nautical center. Snorkel gear is free but don't lose it, else you'll be walloped with a $300USD fee. The Tahitian staff was 110% friendly, genuine and accommodating. Breakfast buffet was very good, our rate included breakfast and dinner, both of which are buffet style. Food was good (high-end cafeteria good) with a great selection of mostly French wines (including St Joseph, the best value French Bordeaux available.) Without the meal plan (or with maybe - we didn't keep track) you're looking at $250-300USD for dinner and a good bottle of wine. Be careful when you order wine; when you do the conversion and forget a \u20180\u2019 you could buy a $1,000USD bottle of wine instead of a $100 bottle. We tipped when the service warranted it. Service at times was a bit slower than in the States or Europe, but nothing to get upset about; just relax and enjoy. The wait staff, at all occasions, was very friendly. There is a gourmet restaurant; too, that is not cafeteria style and very, very romantic in kind of a candlelit, tropical way. Little bit more expensive but beautiful. Little gas station a 5 minute walk from hotel to pick up water, snacks, etc, that is much less than minibar. Our OWB had an espresso machine (free). I can't say a bad thing about this place. Beautiful and of course expensive ($15 USD for a bottle of Gillette foam shaving cream should you forget that as we did, and $20USD for a Cocktail at the lagoon bar. Cocktails are great, though, as is the lagoon bar (very cute) with sweeping views. Makes you feel like Ernest Hemingway. And, for the love of sun, don't forget dental floss (as we did) since you can't find it in Tahiti. Pictures from the web site don't do this place justice. All transfers were prompt and on time. This place is a class act. Place was 100% booked, compared to our 3rd leg, at St Regis in Bora Bora, which was a ghost town. At the Sofitel Moorea the guests were 94% French, 3% American, 2% Italian, 1% Spain. Trying to speak a bit of French will I think get you better service, although everyone spoke English. In fact, many Tahitians speak multiple languages due to the tourism. TIPS: Don\u2019t forget toothpaste, deodorant, etc. This will cost you bookoo bucks. Bring bug spray, aloe and plenty of SPF 80 if you have it. Take a walk to the gas station and buy water there as opposed to the hotel. Water from the tap seemed fine, too. Beware, massages in the spa are over $200USD/hour.", "title": "Beautiful hotel, excellent location!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "WrldTrvlr37", "date": "September 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 45520955}], "location": {"country": "French Polynesia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 34, "average": 99, "very good": 313, "terrible": 17, "excellent": 673}, "aka": "Sofitel Moorea Ia Ora Beach Hotel Maharepa", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Sofitel Moorea Ia Ora Beach Resort is settled on the edge of a magnificent lagoon, with views over the island of Tahiti.
