As it would fit my client's budget, I opted for the higher priced room and was very glad I did. I arrived at 2 p.m. and was told at the reception that no rooms were available. When I asked them to pre-check me in as I had to be at a meeting at 3, the staff member noticed the deluxe reservation and I was immediately taken to the 14th floor business lounge for check-in. My room, 1302, was spotless, a plate of fruit waiting my arrival, and full of amenities (controlling the a/c from bedside, e.g.). The television options were mind-boggling compared to other CCS hotels--I had 89 channels ranging from CNN to AlJezeera to Iran National TV to CCTV and all the Venezuelan channels (with many more in-between).", "title": "Horrible Staff at the Gran Melia Caracas", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "Mlogs", "date": "December 10, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6359344}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "I ordered room service for dinner and was very satisfied.
