The choice was very limited and the vegetables in particular were cooked to little more than mush and were inedible.

The bed was a little uncomfortable for a young couple, as it was two singles pushed together but the sheets were clean and changed during the week twice. The towels were also changed and the maids did an excellent job of cleaning our apartment- which was at best, an absolute state! I agree the hotel is extremely outdated, broken tiles litter the floor, and a good lick of paint wouldnt hurt, but the general look of the building is fine for a cheap and cheerful holiday.
