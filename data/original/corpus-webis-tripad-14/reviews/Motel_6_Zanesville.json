The Ramada was just what we were hoping for. Clean, comfortable, and cheap accomodations that were close to the highway. We got a nice low AAA rate, and the price certainly met the comfort level. The room was nothing special, just a clean and decent size room wtih double beds. Bathroom had plenty of room with the seperate outside vanity, which is always good when you are traveling with another person. The only down sides I can think of is that it was very hot when we got into the room, and it took about a half hour to cool down. But since we were so exhausted we didnt have much trouble falling asleep anyway.From what I heard they had a decent pool and breakfast, but we were out of there so early that we never got to use any of the ammenities.", "title": "Good value...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "icem2829", "date": "June 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 16820146, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Price, size of room.", "disliked": "\u2014 Very hot at first..."}}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Needs Renovation", "text": "I would advise anyone looking for a just a simple, and affordable hotel near i-70 to stay here.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "thefbi", "date": "May 24, 2008", "id": 16365889}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a very old property.
