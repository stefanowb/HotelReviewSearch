These are not bad, on the face of it - half a mile from the main building are 40 suites (5 blocks of 8) with a private reception, check-in, (small) pool and bar, all overlooking the lake and golf course. You can order a big room service breakfast and sit on your terrace overlooking the lake. The suites are large but not huge (70 sq m?) and are too cramped - there is proper bar in the room, for a start, which wastes space.

Despite Ernst & Young seemingly block-booking the place, the majority of the shops and restaurants were closed and a lot of constuction was going on. There was literally nowhere open to buy coffee and a snack - only the formal restaurants - and no shop of any sort (there are about 10 but all were closed, possibly Ramadan or possibly just not high season). Staff regularly chat to themselves and ignore you. The best thing on offer is the ludicrously huge pool complex which I pretty much had to myself. Pool service is non-existant, though - forget being served drinks or snacks. There aren't even any convenient showers, since non-suite guests can easily pop into their rooms. I don't play golf so can't comment on the course.

Why go to a conference hotel where 95% of the guests know each other and eat / drink en masse, leaving you feeling out of it? Service standards are geared to the conference market - lets say no more. The villa suites are not bad, and if you really wanted to be on the golf course then take one of these - at least you're away from the main building.
