We noiticed this lodge on the internet, when searching for a place to stay on our trip to BC. They had a special rate on a \"guest\" room, so we decided to book there. We have never stayed at a ski resort before, so being off season, we thought we'd try it out. We had been driving most of the day, and it was getting to be after supper, when I realized on our reservation, it said that check-in was up to 6:00 and after that to call a phone #. I did that, and a cheery man answered and said not to worry, as he'd be there until 10:00, and to come to the Glacier Lodge to check in. We didn't know where the Glacier Lodge was on the property, so we drove around. We first found the Pallser where our room was. We stopped there, and walked in. It was dark, no one at the desk and no one around anywhere. Not the reception we are used to and it felt different, We knew we had to find the Glacier Lodge, but thought we'd take a look at the building we were going to stay at, and thought maybe there might be a map of the facilities there, but didn't see one. Then we drove further, after passing another building \"Mountaineer\", we came across the Glacier Lodge. My suggestion to the resort is to put up some signs pointing to each building so people like us, who drive in for the first time, know where to go. Another sign saying \"register at the Glacier Lodge\" or something would help. The man at reception at the Glacier was very friendly and gave us all info we needed to find our room. They do have a couple restaurants there, but since we were checking in late, only the saloon was open, until 10:00. We drove back to the Palliser, where they have underground parking which was nice, and would be great for a winter stay. Our room was nice and clean, with a king size bed, kichinette and balcony, We did notice that the sliding door to the balcony didn't lock, but we were on the the third floor, so didn't think of it as a problem. We then went to the saloon to eat, which was really nice. The waiter was great and attentive. Our stay in the room was comfortable, and it was really quiet there. In the morning we dropped off the key back at the Glacier Lodge, then drove around to see the new homes being built there, take some pics of the beautiful views of the mountains, and headed back down into Golden.", "title": "Beautiful Views, but note, it is 14km out of town", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "cherSK_Canada", "date": "July 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 169290932}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went to check into the Pallister Lodge after travelling for most of the day and just wanted to get into our room and shower and chill-out....

The rooms were just the right side and the beds felt more comfortable than my first visit. Like many other reviews have mentioned, the tv's could use an upgrade, it would make the units look more modern and enable them to get more space by removing the tv stand in the living room. We ate breakfast and lunch in our room and ate supper out. We would stay here again, although my wife was not a fan of how icy it was trying to ski in and walk out of the entrance/exit.

Everything seemed to be \"locking in\", we moved the rooms quickly, enjoyed our hot tub, only to find out the next day that it was broken!! We were told we have an option to move again and as much as it was inconvenient having to pack our luggage, we did it! We were assured that our new condo will be on the same floor as the original one bedroom, so we wouldn't have to use the elevator! The day before our departure my husband walked over to the reception at Glacier Lodge ( no reception at Palliser) to pick up the key to our original one bedroom condo so we could move, again!!! The speed of the reception employees and the way they operate the computer is worse then of a snail! After waiting for at least 15 min, he was told that our original condo is no longer available and we have to move to a different floor! After hearing the news I picked up the phone and demanded what we were promised and finally we were offered a condo on the same floor.
