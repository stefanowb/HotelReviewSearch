The rooms are set up with a divider between the \"living space\" and \"bedroom\". You can tell the hotel has been overhauled to this new set up but it's totally working. I thought the bed was super comfortable. I brought my own pillow so I can't say if the pillows were comfy or not. The room was super clean. The room was super quiet even though we were on the first floor facing the street (our window next to the bed looked out onto the street). I have to say the staff was soooo nice. I never expect nice staff at a hotel so I was shocked when every time we passed by or interacted with the front desk they were nice and helpful. I don't know if it's a Salt Lake City thing or if they just have incredible staff. There is a ten dollar a day charge for parking (you cannot enter the hotel parking lot unless you have a room key which is nice so you always have a parking spot). I don't remember seeing that when I made the reservation for the hotel so that was unexpected but not a huge problem. If you don't pay to park I have no idea where you would park otherwise.
