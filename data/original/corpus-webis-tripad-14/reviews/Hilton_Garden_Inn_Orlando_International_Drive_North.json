It is convienient if you have your own car. I dont know what if any shuttle services they have since we did not ask about it. I have to say check in was great the staff was nice and helpful. We asked for driving directions and they gave us a accurtate print out of driving directions to each major theme park and attraction. they had the rolling carts for your luggage and two elevators. Our rooms were very clean and had everything we needed. Fridge and Microwave and two double beds. A/C worked very well. We booked the bed and breakfast package and it was awesome. For breakfast they have bacon, sausage, fruits, bagels, toast, cereal, yogurt, different types of milk, fresh orange juice coffee, teas, they had fresh cooked to order french toast, omlets, waffle maker with fruit toppings, muffins, pastries, oatmeal, grits in all it was a complete breakfast with all you can think of. (I know how important that breakfast is when you are going to the park for the day and you want to eat well before you go) The lobby was decorated really nicely for the holidays. In all we definately recommend this hotel.", "title": "Quite possibly the best Hilton I've stayed at in a while", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "oo63", "date": "November 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10907500, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location, the friendly staff, the accommodations", "disliked": "\u2014 The pillows"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled on business", "text": "I've stayed at a couple of Hilton chain hotels in the past and none of them had really impress me.
