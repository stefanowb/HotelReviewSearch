Amboise itself is central to all of the sights and Le Manoir is the icing on the cake. The staff could not be more helpful in taking our luggage to serving our breakfast and best of all they make wonderful suggestions for dinner. We stayed in the yellow suite which overlooks the Loire River and the Amboise Chateau, it was very relaxing with a seperate living area,cable tv, mini bar and free internet available. My only thoughts would be to incorporate the breakfast into the overall room rate rather than having a seperate charge with greater variety. The recommended restaurants that we ate at were Le Lion d'Or, L'Epirerie and also La Scala, all three restaurants had wonderful food and great service, all in walking distance of the property. In all of my travels, this would be the best service I have had at a hotel, outstanding.
