Village Le Brasilia", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We chose La Brasilia because of its excellent reviews, its location and closeness to the beach and for the pools. The pools didn't disappoint, although they are very cold. the guards are on patrol the whole time and severely reprimanded a couple of lads for bombing down the slides, which nearly resulted in them being banned from the pool completely! they take their job very seriously, which is good I guess. To get a sunbed, you have to be there at 0945 and stampede with the serious sunworshippers when the gate opens at 10am! hilarious, although we only attempted it on one day. the rest of the fortnight we turned up when we felt like it and just put our towels out on the fake grass. There was always a spot somewhere. We stayed with Thomson Al Fresco and the pitch was a good size. The home was clean and well equiped although the staff, whilst very friendly, didn't seem to know much about the area and referred us to reception for most of our queries. There were plenty of parks around for our daughters to play in (age 7 and 5) and they loved the pools. There was a mini show every evening where the kids get up on stage and copy Barny, the entertainer. It was fun, although with the same hour of music every night at 8:20, it got a little tedious towards the end. The girls enjoyed it though, and we came home with the CD of the music! The beach is easily accessible from the site, although its not particularly child friendly, as it drops away after about 10ft from the edge, so you have to keep an eye on things at all times. We tended to go to the beach at Canet Plage, as this didn't drop away so quickly and you could go out further to paddle. The main downside to our holiday, was that the weather was quite windy (which I've been told is often the case in this area of france) and so the sand would blow up and whip your legs quite fiercly. it also made the pools seem colder when you got out of them. There was a water taxi over to Canet Plage, and also a road train but it worked out quite expensive if you had to do it every day (about 3 euro return). You really need a car, which we didn't get, opting for bikes instead. these were fun, although limiting with 2 young cyclists as to how far we could go.Good gym on site.all in all, would really recommend La Brasilia!! as long as you get the sun too.", "title": "Excellent Site - shame about the weather.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "NickyHoops", "date": "August 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 116853177}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We have travelled to this region for many years and used to stay south of Perpignan in Argeles.

It was spotlessly clean, spacious, not too big and beautifully landscaped. I loved the little village square with its tabac, fruit and vegetables - which are all grown on the site and are v e r y fresh - bakery, supermarket, butcher / deli, and not forgetting the wine shop! There was also a clothes shop and gift shop. The lauderette was excellent with good quality machines. I loved being able to walk to the beach. At weekends the part of the beach around the restaurant Le Swim and lifeguards station got incredibly busy from locals.
