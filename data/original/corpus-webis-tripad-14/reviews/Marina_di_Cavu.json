Beautiful setting a good wine list. I booked a massage in my room and the cost was $35 more than the advertised price, I discovered after the massage. No facilites available, we were unaware that even the pools were empty, overpriced and management was unhelpful, even a little rude", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "NZChef", "date": "March 18, 2007", "id": 7186273}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Incredible location ten minutes from the most wonderful city in Corsica - Bonifacio. Hidden in windswept maquis, completely private and isolated. Extremely romantic, minutes walk through the maquis and dunes to an isolated Mediterranean beach. Not a sound of civilization around - just the roar of the sea, crickets and multitude of stars as company. Maybe an occasional Corsican hunting boar. BUT, we stayed in one of the villas and it was absolutely overpriced for its quality. The villas are old, paint is peeling, walls are battered, etc. There are no mosquito nets and even with air conditioning, this is a must. Bring your own. Our terrace sliding door did not lock and the staff did absolutely nothing to try to fix it. Besides risking a robbery (however rare in Corsica), we also worried about our two toddlers opening the door in the night and wandering off. Staff is unenthusiastic, from the manager down to the cleaning ladies. Finally, the property is rectangular and if you stay in one of the villas at the far end close to the beach, it is a long walk to the pool and restaurant. Would we stay again? Despite its drawbacks, overall this property is nicer than most of the alternative hotel/motel/camping options and the location is fantastic, so yes. But we would not pay high season prices.", "title": "Incredible location/Poor value for money", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "NewYorkerInEurope", "date": "September 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5813437, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Value of villas for the price"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What a treat", "text": "I highly recomend this hotel for anyone that needs to get away from it all.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 16, 2006", "id": 5471058}], "location": {"country": "France", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 5, "very good": 11, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 18}, "aka": "Marina Di Cavu Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.791666666667}
