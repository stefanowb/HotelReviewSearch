Elevators were nowhere near as bad as I had read about - sure, they were slow sometimes, but nothing to really complain about. Room was newly renovated, clean, fresh towels, coffee and beds made daily. Kitchen was used frequently which helped us save alot of money on meals. Water pressure in shower left a bit to be desired, but we got used to it. Hotel itself very clean. Staff were, as often mentioned, disinterested - but at $99USD/night, I didn't expect a concierge or help getting around. We checked in, checked out and only other interaction with staff involved a polite good morning every day.
