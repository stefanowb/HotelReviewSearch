Just 10 minutes from the A6 it is ideally placed for people travelling to and from the South of France. The bedrooms have a real charm about them and are all very inkeeping with the age of the house. Unfortunately, the bathrooms in both of the rooms we booked were fairly modern, clean and fit for purpose but were totally out of keeping with the style of the house. It appeared as if very cheap bathrooms had been installed with absolutely no character at the least possible price. The toilet seats particularly were the flimsiest any of us had come across. An evening meal is provided at \u20ac20 per person which I would recommend - not necessarily for the cooking which is just about adequate but nothing special - but because you probably wouldn't want to get the car out to drive all the way into Tournus for a meal. The stay was very good value - the rooms, the evening meal and the drinks. Our host was very helpful and friendly but I have to say that personally I think the hostess does not enjoy running a bed and breakfast. She was very polite to us but she did moan a lot about the business and how dreadful some of their customers are. Overall we did enjoy it but with a little more thought and effort on the part of the owners, this could be a truly wonderful place to stay.", "title": "Could be wonderful", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "S_G_Taylor", "date": "September 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 19694509, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The bedrooms were charming.", "disliked": "\u2014 The bathrooms."}}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Burgundy", "continent": "Europe"}, "review_count": 1, "name": "La Montagne Gites & Chambres d'Hotes"}
