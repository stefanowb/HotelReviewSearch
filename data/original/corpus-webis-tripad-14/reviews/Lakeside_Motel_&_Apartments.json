It is a short 5 minute stroll into the town centre. The kitchen & bathroom are both clean, with the kitchen providing all items needed for a full working kitchen. We stayed both times on the top floor, so we had a rather nice view. The only small issue i would have it that the balcony is one long balcony, that all guests can walk the length of, instead of each room having its own privacy on the balcony.

Unfortunately the welcome was of the key and cow variety with no effort even to tell me where the room was situated until I asked. The person on reception was walking backwards through a connecting door as I asked this and some other basic questions. The accommodation is clean, comfortable but lacks any extra. If you read other posts on places like Central Gold (Cromwell), Centre Point on Columbo (Christchurch), The Palazzo (Nelson) and Taylor's (Ashburton) you will see what I mean by extra. I wouldn't rule out staying here again as there is nothing basically wrong with the place, just a feeling that they see you as \"a temporary resident unit\", but I would have a look at other motels, maybe a little bit closer to the shopping area.", "title": "Very good value, ok place to stay", "user": "Birdwatcher33", "date": "December 31, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 52249020}], "location": {"country": "New Zealand", "region": "South Island", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 15, "very good": 34, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 19}, "aka": "Lakeside Motel & Apartments Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.583333333333}
