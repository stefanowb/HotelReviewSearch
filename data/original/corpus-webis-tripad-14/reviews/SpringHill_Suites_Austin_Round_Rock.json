The bathroom is in the back by the beds. I wish it wasn't a studio, but the price was right and included a couch, chair, coffee table, kitchen table, small microwave, small refrig, and small sink. We only stayed one night in January 2006. We ordered food (free delivery) from a restaurant nearby. The bathroom toilet kept clogging every couple of uses, but the manager sent up a plunger when I called late at night. I was able to unclog it myself after quite a bit of plunging. The next morning it clogged again. The next day I asked for a 30% discount and they obliged plus offered an apology. The staff was pretty nice about it.", "title": "Worth it!", "user": "JoeSchlambe", "date": "September 11, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3895010}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Round Rock"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 5, "very good": 19, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 15}, "aka": "Springhill Suites Austin Round Rock Hotel Round Rock", "slim_ranking": 0.521739130435}
