We had an $80 room on the third floor walkup. The room could have used some love and care, but it was clean and quiet. The inn staff were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was somewhat nasty, but we were happy with the price we paid for the room, so were not to upset about the stale buffet eggs. The inn is located within a quick walk to all the great restaurants in town.

It looks good at first sight, but when you look closer you see very shoddy and worn woodwork and appointments that may well have come from the local dump or flea market. For us it started when I noticed a very rapid drip coming from the bathroom ceiling. The staff responded quickly (some staff work very hard to overcome the aging facilities with inferior maintenance equipment) and a repairman came in brandishing a hot glue gun which he apparently used to fix the leak upstairs. It was obvious that this problem had occurred before with lots of black mold and old repairs visible.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "kipowner", "date": "August 10, 2006", "id": 5594765}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 12, "average": 7, "very good": 4, "terrible": 32, "excellent": 6}, "aka": "Ledgelawn Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.973684210526}
