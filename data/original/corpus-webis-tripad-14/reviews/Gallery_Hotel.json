The Gallery Hotel was my first choice due to their website and at that time had no rooms available, so as adventurous as i usually i'm not, i figured since i was traveling alone i should just wing it and see what'll happen. so i was leaving from Bangkok that afternoon and called them one last time for a chance there was a cancellation and there was!, a deluxe room for about $180 including breakfast for only 2 nights, that's a bit steep for me but i figured i can splurge then find a cheap place for the last 2, staying for 4 nights. I arrived late and was given a smoking room eventhough i requested a nonsmoking but the receptionist called the hotel cleaning person to freshen up the room and i found it to not smell at all. the room was a great size with great design. it was stylish but still extremely functional. i did find it to be a bit damp but overall very comfortable. the breakfast was lovely and filling with a wide variety. the pool was also quite uniqe. Free internet! Well needless to say all of Singapore was booked i was not able to find another hotel and asked the Gallery Hotel's receptionist to please let me know if there's a cancellation and the morning of my check out day, i was told i can remain in my room for the last 2 nights for the same price. so i was saved from a possible nightmare of not having a place or staying at a seedy one. so thanks Gallery Hotel and your helpful staff.", "title": "gallery hotel to the rescue", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "nantendo", "date": "September 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8661561, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 building design", "disliked": "\u2014 price"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Overated and Over Priced Hotel", "text": "Have just returned from 3 day stay in Gallery Hotel in Singapore and would rate it as an experience to be avoided at all cost.It is a poor ,faded imitation of a quality hotel with smoke smelly floors and obvious attempts to be architecturally sharp without the core requirements of adequate space, good fittings and the usual services you expect from a complete hotel ( is everything outsourced in this hotel??).
