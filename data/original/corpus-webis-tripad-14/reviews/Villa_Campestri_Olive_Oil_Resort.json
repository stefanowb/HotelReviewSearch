Of five hotels we stayed at this was easily the best. The setting is beautiful, the rooms are very clean and spacious (although they are all not the same). The touches in the villa - tapestries, paintings, decor, books - give the impression the owners really care about appearance and restoring it to its original beauty but in a way that keeps it upto date as well. Food was excellent and service was very attentive. We also paid \u20ac50 pp to experience olive oil tasting with the owners' daughter, Gemma, who was incredibly knowledgable, having an agriculture degree and a Phd, and enjoyed answering our questions as well as showing us around the resort.

The pool overlooked the countryside, the view was especially awesome early in the morning when the mist is rising out of the valley. The room they gave us was lovely and spacious, we loved the skylights and the claw foot tub! Every piece of furniture and fixture in the room was carefully selected to not deviate from the character of the region, no detail was spared, from the bed linens to the telephone! At night we opened the windows to let the breeze in and amazingly enough there were no bugs or mosquitoes, not one! And we were only about a floor up.

The pool was difficult to get to for my mother-in-law down a long hill without useful stairs. We had dinner at the hotel and the food was good but very pricey. The rooms we had were dark and without air conditioning. My first night was horrible as the air was dead still in our dark room. The windows are without screens so opening them risks letting in any creature, bugs or critters of the night. Towels are available for the pool at 3 euros - ridiculous given the cost of the rooms. When I left early, I was hoping to get a partial refund for the prepaid second night but the staff was unwilling to refund a single cent, not the 18 euros for towels, the 200 euros for dinner or the 800 plus euros for the nights we didn't use.
