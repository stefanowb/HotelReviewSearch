My husband myself and our 15 year old son. We arrived at the hotel 5.30am and we're very tired we checked in and went up to our room 8th floor which we did request, we did request pool view which we did'nt get so my husband went back down and asked but the reception said we'd have to sort it out later. (we did'nt bother in the end) The room was very small it had two double beds, the sheets won't very clean on one of the beds. Our room was'nt cleaned very good the cleaner on a couple of occasions just throw the sheets back over the beds, did'nt leave toilet rolls, put towels in the room which had blood on them. There were 7 lifts and half the time you had to wait ages for the lifts cause kids we're playing around in them. The food was'nt very good and it felt like being in a cattle market racing to get to the restaurant you sat on top of the other tables they could'nt get enough tables in. We found the staff in the restaurant unfriendly never smiled even when collecting our plates. Litter everywhere, people being sick in the lobby. Our son is no angel but he certainly would'nt behave like some of the other kids and the parents just had no control over them they just let them run riot and please themselfs. 4.00am kids would be running up and down the corridors banging on doors and slamming them. There was a lobby bar and an outside bar but only the outside bar was in use even though there was always a long que. We had a early hour flight so we was advised that there was secure luggage room for us to keep our luggage in but when we collected it we found our son's psp and eyepod was stolen and when we reported this to the front desk they told us that the security key cards were kept on the front desk so anybody could pick one up. I would certainly not recommend this hotel to anyone. Although it is only a three star hotel you still expect a certain standard of service and quality of food. Although we booked all inclusive we had to buy bottled water, they did supply one filtered water tap on the outside bar which you had to que for to refill your empty bottles. So it was easier to buy new bottles out of the machine. The swimming pools were inadequate for the three hotels that were using them...", "title": "one week of hell", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "linphy", "date": "August 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5564255, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 everything"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "horrendous !", "text": "although the hotel was spotless and the gardens great, the whole complex is fully smoking exepting a very small lounge.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "wigillywogs", "date": "August 5, 2006", "id": 5557765}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled with family", "text": "I dont consider the hotel is safe for children, due to the high volume of smoking, it is a definate health risk, due to the very high level of smokining, especially the children who obvioulsly who have no choice as to were to go in the complex", "title": "Four hours were alll we could hack!!!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "KINA1", "date": "August 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5555121, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 no comment!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Remember a holiday is what u make it : Phil Russell", "text": "The food is OK. exept it is cold or at best luke warm. the noise is horrendous. there are no quite/piano bars just one smokey noisy bar in each hotel, with a very small N/S area, which is rearly enforced.
