Our son lives in Bucktown, which has little or no hotel rooms, so the train was our best option. For Chicago, the Hampton Inn Majestic is an excellent value. The cost was reasonable, a hot breakfast was included, the room was large and recently updated, the beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was large, and the employees were all very helpful and friendly. They do a great job of keeping their breakfast area stocked and keep it open longer than a lot of other hotels that will remain nameless. I want to emphasize the friendliness of their employees, too. Many Chicago hotels have workers that don't care and are just putting in their time. The Majestic's employees are very helpful and outgoing. They really want to make you feel welcome, and they take pride in their hotel.

There is no hotel bar, but a large(ish) lobby section where help yourself breakfast is served in the morning, together with a \"business area\" with wireless etc. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was because it was one of the very few I found in the USA that included breakfast in the price (what IS it with USA hotels that most of them don't!). On checking in, the receptionist told us our room was one of the smaller ones, so she would be moving us to a larger one - nice to hear. Our room was on the top floor (21st) and was very nice. The bed was enormous - could have fitted 3 people in it. I have a thing about double beds in hotels being too small (my husband and I simply cannot sleep in them) but you could have fitted 3 people in this one and it was SO comfortable. Nice big flat screen TV and all mod cons provided plus all the little niceties (flannels, shampoo, mouthwash, hairdryer etc). The other good thing about this hotel is the location - SO central.
