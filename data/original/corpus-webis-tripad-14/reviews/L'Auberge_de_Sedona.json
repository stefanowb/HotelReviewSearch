First, the rooms are old and tired, and the bed and pillows need to be changed. I opened the mini bar and it was empty.

We booked a creek side cottage and one previous review here indicated homes across the creek, and that is true. I was surprised to find the creek was only approx. 40' wide at the most, and right on the other side are private homes. During our stay from Thursday-Sunday there were large family groups with kids and dogs all having fun, which I'm not against, but I don't want to pay a bucket of money to share my space with the neighbors. All of the cottages look at each other in some way, so no matter what you book you will not have toatl privacy.
