Ultimately, we decided that the car had been a mistake, especially as there is such a good transport network in the city. Fisherman's Wharf was fun, and not as ghastly as a lot of people made out, plus, we had so many other sights to see, including the fab Golden gate Bridge and a trip on the outside of the famous cable car at Powell and Hyde (for which there was a considerable wait, so get there early). Fisherman's Wharf has some nice seafood restaurants, again pricey, and is all on the level, so walkign around is easy. I would certainyl recommend it for families, as there is Pier 39 with the sealions and the ferries for Alcatraz(a must) plus amusement arcade and lots of shops. Also go see Coit Tower - walk up Telegraph Hill if you have the energy(exhausting!) or drive up an then get the lift to the top for some great views. Chinatown a must also, we ate at the wonderful Emperess of China, which has views of Coit Tower and food authentic, decor beautiful and waiters very attentive (good value as well). Visit The Fort underneath the bridge, it's a big former miltary garrison that has been renovated and opened to the public, very inetersting for children and adults alike. Take a city tour early in your trip, it will give you a good account of what the city has to offer and then you can pick and choose where to return. Ate at the Cliff House on the promontary about 5-6 miles from SF, lovley food and superb Pacific coast/beach views. Wrap up warm - SF is very chilly in the morninngs and the fog invariably covers the bridge, although it usually clears by the afternoon - average temp when we were there was 65C (40 degress less than at our friend's house two hours inland!).
