We took our mum for her 80th birthday, she has Coeliac disease and finds it difficult to find many places that cater for a gluten free diet. Her sandwiches looked the same as ours and she even had little cakes, as a surprise for her birthday the staff brought out a little cake on a plate with happy 80th birthday written in chocolate on the plate. We all had a lovely afternoon with more sanwiches being brought out as soon as our plates emptied, this included gluten free and tea being poured for us as we emptied our cups. There's a wide selection of tea available and juice if tea isn't your choice of drink, all in all I would recommend Brown's to anyone looking for a treat or special occasion.

As I am vegetarian and gluten intolerant I researched widely to find the right place for afternoon tea. Brown's came highly recommended. I loved the atmosphere the music and how welcoming they were to my daughter. The table we were at was very small and so fitting the 2 cake stands necessary (1 gluten free 1 not) was quite hard. I loved the sandwiches I was given, the sweet treats and scones and it was lovely to know I wouldn't get ill. The other 3 people at my table had the same amount of food as me on my own and it wasn't made clear that they could have as much as they wanted so they initially felt a little put out. The tea had to go on a stand next to our table as the table was small and we felt unable to help ourselves to it. It was really hard to attract the attention of the waiter so we were left tealess for some time! We also did not get clean plates between sandwiches and scones which wasn't great as they became dirty.
