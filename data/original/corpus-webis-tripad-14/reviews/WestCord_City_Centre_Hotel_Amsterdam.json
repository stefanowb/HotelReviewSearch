I was very happy with my choice. The room was not that large but large enough. (My wife and I got the double bed we requested but were warned by the front desk that the rooms with two single beds are larger.) There was both a trouser press in our room and an ironing room on the floor (the 1st floor). The bed was comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. They offer a buffet breakfast for 10 Euros but I can't comment any further on it as my wife and I chose not to partake in it.", "title": "Would Stay Here Again", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "JamieNYC", "date": "February 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4499480}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006", "text": "My husband and two of our friends stayed at this hotel from the 5th till the 7th of Feb.", "title": "Lovely Hotel -", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Leanna1", "date": "February 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4448434}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006", "text": "I loved everything about it, ideal location and the staff was lovely and friendly.

I also wonderd about about the glaswall to the bathroom - a bit strange if your are traveling with friends!. The Star rooms are only at the 5. and 6 floor, the other floors look old and used. We booked our room incl. breakfirst, but when we arrived we where told that that breakfirst was \"french\" which means only coffe and a crossint. If we wanted normal breakfirst we had to pay 7,5 \u20ac each pr. day - which we then did and got a great breakfirst, but I think they could have informed os about the \"french\" breakfirst at booking it.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 23, 2006", "id": 4728023}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "OK to stay", "text": "Only at few minuts walk from the hotel are all the things you nead to se in Amsterdam.
