The cover on the bed was badly stained with cigerette burns in it. The carpet beside the bed was stained with ground in cigerette ash and the room smelled of smoke. We booked on line and couldn't find an option for non smoking room. The next morning there was no-one to be seen in the dining room for breakfast. We had asked for an early breakfast as we were taking someone to Heathrow the next morning and were told at reception that would be fine. In the end someone found us some cereal and the girl who came on to do reception made us some toast. Everything seems to be done as cheaply as possible in this hotel and we would definitely never stay there again.", "title": "Really bad", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lindarice48", "date": "August 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 136196116}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Absolute HOLE \u00a369 for a double mattress 4 inch thick floor stained bathroom cracked windows are the cheapest ive seen anywhere and dont fit noisy dirty hole", "title": "Deserves no stars", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "craig l", "date": "July 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 134803638}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012", "text": "AVOID it look good from the outside but dont be fooled i stay in hotels 3/4 days a week this is the worst ive stayed in apart from Toni and Marie's B&B in liverpool and that was a dosshouse for hookers and druggies", "title": "Its bad don't stay sleep in a skip its cleaner", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "darrylpaula", "date": "July 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 134654227}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled on business", "text": "But it was a close call", "title": "would I stay here again?", "user": "TynesideTraveller65", "date": "July 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 134498941}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Food was awful I ordered the steak with cherry tomatoes and oinons at \u00a313.95 and a pint of 1664 i couldn't see through the glass the beer was so cloudy", "title": "Depressing customer care", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lizzie071", "date": "July 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 134249688}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I personally found this to be a terrible hotel, really poor customer service and be prepared to be told anything over the phone to get the booking and then be told to take it or leave it when you get there.", "title": "A dodgy backroom type hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Bob S", "date": "July 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 133268711}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled on business", "text": "There were several skips dotted about the area, and what seemed to be abandoned building equipment.

On arrival there wasn't a twin bedded room available so we were taken by Alex to their sister hotel the Parkside International 1 minutes walk away. Reception lovely and clean and modern and the receptionist couldn't have been more polite and welcoming. The room we were shown to was of a good standard, modern, clean, quite large, equipped with kettle, hairdryer etc. Bathroom spotless and supplied with toiletries. White towels which seemed a bit thin but did a good job of drying! The view was over the car park but it didn't matter. The room was warm and despite being on a main road extremely quiet. The room was the quality of a Premier Inn. We didn't eat in the restaurant that evening but did greatly enjoy a freshly cooked full english breakfast the following morning again with excellent service from the staff. We only paid \u00a360 for the room which I realise was a bargain but I cannot fault the hotel at all. It was only a 20 minute walk from Reading town centre, there's a Beefeater restaurant 2 minutes walk away and plenty of public transport on the main road. There was ample free and safe car parking and also free WIFI. I have no idea why this hotel has received bad comments from other travellers.
