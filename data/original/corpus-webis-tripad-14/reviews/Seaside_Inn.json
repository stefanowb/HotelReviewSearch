You might want to check before booking. The beach area is really nice with people playing and walking dogs in the mornings. The rooms were adequate - nothing special. The upstairs rooms are the best - you can see the ocean. Breakfast was nice - heavy on bread and cereal. One thing that bothered me a bit was that the local newspapers were there, but there was a charge for them at the front desk. Seemed rather nickel and dime somehow. They did give us good directions to our next stop and told us of some good places to eat. The town of Kennebunkport is a great stop but budget at least a half day to drive around the area.

There are some existing houses being rebuilt near the Inn but no new development is allowed that would block the perfect ocean views that the guests at the Inn currently enjoy. I verfied this myself by talking to locals including the Kennebunk town manager. I wanted to include this point regarding the views because I noticed another reviewer was concerned that development was going to eventually block the ocean views. I can tell you that will NEVER be the case.
