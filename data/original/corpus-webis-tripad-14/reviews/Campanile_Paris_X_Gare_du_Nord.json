The last time I was in Paris was a couple of years ago with my wife and we stayed at the Keppler (which is a Tripadviser top hotel) but this time I was on my own on a \"jolly\" to see an aging French rock star so cut my cloth accordingly. The Louis Blanc area is not brilliant but the hotel is right opposite the Metro station on line 7. It is therefore really easy to get in and out of the centre of the city and to access main line stations. The hotel seemed fairly clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable. The bathroom was small. The George V it is not, but if you want somewhere simply to sleep that is not expensive (about \u00a365 per night), easy to get to and from and don't mind being in a more run down area of town then this hotel is not bad at all. I booked and paid months in advance through Expedia but when I went to check-out in the early morning the hotel claimed they had not received any payment. My rusty French and the need to catch a plane meant I had to pay and try to sort it out later. I contacted Expedia immediately upon my return (yesterday) and it looks like they have sorted things out and that the hotel will give me a refund, so full marks to them.", "title": "Good value if you don't get charged twice", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "BigMac58", "date": "February 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 124710210}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "I'd visited Campanile Gare Du Nord in September 2010 and I have to say that it's the best hotel I've ever been to, in Paris (I've been to around 4-5).
