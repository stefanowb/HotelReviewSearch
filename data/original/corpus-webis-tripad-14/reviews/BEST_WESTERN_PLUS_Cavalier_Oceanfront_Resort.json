Our room was immaculately clean and we were provided with a very nice selection of shower amenities. The hotel is located on a beautiful stretch of beach. In the evenings, the hotel staff stocks and lights 3 firepits located on the lawn overlooking the ocean. My friend and I sat there for a long time talking, enjoying the full moon and stars, keeping warm on a chilly night. The adjacent restaurant offered good quality food, and attentive service. I recommend this place for anyone looking to relax for a day or two. On our drive down the coast the next morning, we stopped in Cambria, CA what a wonderful town.

All other regular amenities were available...ironing board, hair dryer, safe, extra pillow/blanker/towels. The tub was huge (unlike most newer hotel) so I was able to sink into a nice hot bath after dinner. There was even a pair of binoculars in the room to gaze out in the distance with.
