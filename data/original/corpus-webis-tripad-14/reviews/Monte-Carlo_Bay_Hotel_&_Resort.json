At the reception desk the staff are very friendly and the concierge helps you in any way. The views are breathtaking, the facilities unmachted, the rooms large and very sunny and the food great. All this does, of course, have a price. Quite reasonable in March but I also made a booking for July and then it is double. Breakfast is not included and I find the price of EUR 30.- per person too expensive. Nevertheless, the overall value is good. We were a group of several people, all travelling individually, and we all had to pay about EUR 100.- for the taxi trip from Nice airport (one way).
