Every area of this hotel is very well maintained, very clean and bright. Every single staff person with whom we came into contact went above and beyond to answer our questions and make sure we were comfortable. The location is downtown and right near the train station and every business one would need during a stay in a big city. We had an excellent rate through Travelzoo that included free parking.

No, what turned us out on unfamiliar streets was the breath-taking SNOBBERY of the restaurant staff. The restaurant was open, but completely empty, and apparently they wanted to keep it that way!

We looked at the menu, ascertained that the restaurant was INDEED \"OPEN,\" so to speak, and finally left before our laughter overcame us. We were guessing they were 'WAY better than some middle-aged US woman with her grey hair in a bun! ! !

I did complain but I was told that that was what Expedia had put on the form to them. The breaksfast was very expensive for what you got (not that I had it). Everybody seems to eat in food courts in Vancouver and I must say you can get fed up of eating fast food. A lot of work is going on in preparation for the Winte Olympics in February 2010. I was shocked at the number of people who sleep on the streets and beg. The one thing I found was missing was the personal touch. Like all 4 and 5 star hotels, a service is provided in return for payment. Having stayed in 3 star hotels in San Francisco and Honolulu on the same holiday, the personal touch was very evident there but it was certainly lacking at this hotel. OF all three hotels, we enjoyed this the least. There was a lot of construction going on next door at their sister hotel but we were not advised of this until we found a letter in our room on arrival informing us of the fact and offering a simple apology. Do visit the Observatory and Stanley Park and the area around Canada Place. You can get by bus from the Airport for $14 each one way but I would recommend using the new Skytrain into the city for $3.75 each one way and it is much quicker by far.
