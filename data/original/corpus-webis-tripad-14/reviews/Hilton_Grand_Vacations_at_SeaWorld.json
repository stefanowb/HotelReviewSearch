The bathroom was a shower only no bathtub if you need one just hop in the jaccuzzi.

The pools were hug with about 3 jaccuzzi and 3 pools. One of the pools had a waterfall. Ajoing to the pool was a dock, which you could walkout on and look at the pond. One day we saw turtles and fish. This was a place you could go and relax. During the night you could also observe Sea World fireworks. Please buy your Universal tickets online. If you paid for two day you was awarded with three additional days free of charge. The ticket was only $99.00 for all five days. I think the hotel ticket booth was sealing the tickets for one day at this price. The shuttle system at this hotel was very accommodating. There was time that the night transportation was screwed up otherwise okay. I went on a timeshare presentation, which I enjoyed with the Hilton. Thinking about going back next year to buy some. Please go and visit this hotel you will enjoy yourself. They was very kid friendly my teenager son and his friend played pool everyday. There were also different activities for every age group throughout the day. One night that had a movie at the pool, which we didn\u2019t make. Several ping-pong tables were there as well. Bring you ping-pong balls with you or you can purchase one for 0.25. The Wal-Mart is right off international drive. If you take International drive like you going towards Wet-n-Wild you will make a right at the light near Popeye\u2019s chicken. Continue to go straight and over a bridge about \u00bd mile you will see Wal-Mart on left. This place saved me tons of money. Go and enjoy Florida!!! We did!!", "title": "No Better Place to stay!
