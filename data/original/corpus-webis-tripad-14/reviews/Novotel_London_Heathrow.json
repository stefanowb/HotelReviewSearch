I slept perfectly without hearing any outside noise (aircraft movement, traffic around the hotel). The fitness center is very small and the machines need replacing. The swimming pool on the other hand is bliss and spotlessly clean. WIFI is available but expensive whch is a bit of a shame considering that other Novotels offer this service free of charge.
