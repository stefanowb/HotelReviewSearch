Ok, I\u2019ll try to pop up there this evening to check\u201d. No apology was offered.

It\u2019s a Victorian hotel, but unlike many it\u2019s not showing its age having been cleaned and nicely decorated in the last 18 months by its new owners. The dining room is a particularly attractive space with a lovely view over the sea through a semi circular bay window. We ate there on two evenings and on both had enjoyable good value meals from an imaginative specials menu. Breakfast was also very good with a number of freshly cooked options and lots of different fresh fruits, cereals, and pastries. The hotel is in a very quiet position, convenient for the beach or old town, but free from any traffic noise. Our room was functional, probably the hotel\u2019s least attractive, but it was perfectly well appointed with a very comfortable bed, and we weren\u2019t expecting anything more as it was the last available on a special deal. The staff were helpful, friendly and competent. There were a couple of longish delays between courses being served, but these were recognised and apologised for, and a price worth paying for freshly and well prepared food. There\u2019s a pleasant garden and decking for sitting outside, and a cosy bar with a laptop available for the use of guests. If you want a hotel with a lot of public space and facilities this is not likely to be the choice for you, but for a comfortable, well positioned hotel that offers good value and the personal touch, and does all the basics very well indeed, we would strongly recommend it.

Unfortunately weather was not kind to us last week-end so we will be returning to this hotel next year and hope we can next time get better weather.
