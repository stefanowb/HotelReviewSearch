We spent our first night in the Anchor Hotel in Tarbert. We received a very warm welcome from Ashley and although our twin room was very small it was perfectly appointed! The hotel was very busy and even though they had a large corporate event going we certainly got plenty of attention from the staff. There were lots of locals in also and it made for a very fun environment. The food in the Seabed Restaurant was lovely as was breakfast the next day! If you are staying in Tarbert please make sure you visit the Loch Fyne Gallery as it is a fantastic shop with lots of excellent art, books, jewellery etc. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely return in the future!", "title": "Friendly and Fun", "user": "Donnasusanna", "date": "May 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130047942}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012", "text": "My wife and I stayed a night here and loved it.
