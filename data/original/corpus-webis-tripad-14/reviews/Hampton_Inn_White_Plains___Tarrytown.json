I have been to this hotel three times in the last 5 years and it keeps getting better and better. They have nothing but the care and concern of their customers in mind and they do EVERYTHING to accomodate you. Plenty of amenities, extra towels always at hand, microwaves and fridges available at no charge and the piece de resistence they wash all the blankets and duvet covers for every new guest. I cringe when I go to some hotels and think of the germs left on the spreads and comforters. My mind was at ease. Free breakfast was available from 6-10 AM with everything from Belgium waffles, yogurt, prepared oatmeal, cold cereal, fesh fruit, hard boiled eggs,etc. And there is a breakfast room attendant who walks around with mints and towelettes for the guests. they do not have their own restaurant but there are plenty in the immediate area and many who deliver to the hotel. It is not a huge hotel but they go all out to accomodate you whether you are there for business or pleasure. The accomodations are modern and the common areas are sleek, comfortable and clean. Shout out to Ms. Tracy Marchena who bent over backwards to make the stay of our group of 30 people for work a very pleasant experience. I would go to this hotel on my own if I was in the area and for those of you visiting New York City it is worth the drive after spending an expensive day in the city.
