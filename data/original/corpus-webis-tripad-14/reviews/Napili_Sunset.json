Very friendly staff showed us a couple different places before we fell in love with a second floor corner suite. Very clean with the most spectacular view. It has a slightly dated decore but the lanai and view more than made up for it. We spent our last few days in Maui doing some of the best snorkeling ever- turtles and colourful reefs.

The rooms are decorated in fairly tacky Hawaiian beach theme and they're all teal and pink, but the place is spotless and every day I was amazed at what a good job the cleaning staff did. Napili Sunset's rooms are nothing to write home about, but they're well laid out and they're spotless. Who cares what your room looks like when you're in Hawaii -- most of the time you'll want to be outside on the beach anyhow! Also, you can't beat the location! Napili Sunset is right smack in the middle of Napili beach -- one of the most beautiful beaches on Maui. The beach-front rooms are, quite literally, right on the beach and are fantastic. If you want to take advantage of the cheaper poolside rooms, though, you're also getting a bargain. Napili Sunset allows their guests who are staying in the poolside rooms (right across the road) to use the private lounge chairs that are in front of the beach-front units, so you've always got access to the private lawn that's right on the beach. Of course, sitting on the beach itself is also great, but it's kind of a treat to be able to lie on your own lounge chair a few steps away from the sand without having to compete for it with everyone else on the beach. Napili Sunset really is SO close to the beach! We stayed poolside and I don't regret it one bit -- it was lovely, quiet, and only $115 a night! Napili Sunset isn't for anyone who is too uptight about needing luxury accommodation, but if it's a relaxed, clean hotel with easy beach access that you want, this is the place to go.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cyndod", "date": "April 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 15029758}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I made my reservation to stay at Napili Sunset last fall, based on the recommendation of my travel agent.
