The beach was gorgeous but the waters were a bit rough and too dangerous for anything more than wading in the waves. It's a long ride into town and to and from the airport. The music in the main lobby area was too loud for my taste and I would have enjoyed a more local experience. Eating had many choices. My favorite was the Toro restaurant. There is a double jacuzzi in every room which is great for couples.
