The central courtyard is beautifully done and the rooms are splendidly decorated. Walking the very narrow medieval streets is a delight and a huge bonus if you are sightseeing in and around the cathedral and Alcazar.

(In many places you can touch opposite walls simultaneously in the alley where the entrance is.)The nearest car park is an expensive 20 euros per day and a goodly stretch to walk to and from with a heavy suitcase along cobbled streets and uneven flagstones.
