Specifically we stayed at #80 Waterkant Street and were exceptionally pleased with the accomodation and felt that the pictures and description online did not do it justice (I think they have since updated the website with more details and pictures). It is a multi level home with beautiful furnishings, comfortable bed, soft sheets, full kitchen, private courtyard with an outdoor shower and koi pond, huge bedside tub and a rooftop patio with great views! Although we arrived exhausted after almost 24 hours of travelling we had a ball discovering all the delights of this beautiful home. In planning our trip we had deliberated between staying at the Waterfront in a chain hotel recommended by other travellers or just staying away from the touristy areas and go with a B&B. Then we came across the website for DeWaterkant Cottages and although it's not really a B&B (but they do offer a breakfast option) we are so glad that we chose to stay there. It was close to everything and we could walk to numerous restaurants/shops in the area. The neighborhood is safe and charming and Tobin & Richard, the proprietors, were incredibly helpful in their recommendations on places to eat. We would highly recommend DeWaterkant Cottages as a place to stay in Cape Town whether you are there for 1 night or a week.....why stay at a hotel where all rooms look the same when you can stay in a place that has all the comforts of home and at a great price to boot!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 17, 2007", "id": 10097463}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled on business", "text": "A most memorable stay, Stunning cottage and a very good representation of the website.
