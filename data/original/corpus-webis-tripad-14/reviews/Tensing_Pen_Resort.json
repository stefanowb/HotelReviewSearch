But that's where the pretty stuff stops. The hotel has 3 large dogs which run around in the restaurant and beg for food at the table. I like dogs but not when I'm eating. A restaurant is no place for animals because they are big and quite intimidating. I asked the staff to keep them away and remove them from the area, they shooed them but they were a continued presence at my meals. My complaints of the dogs were seen by the owner, an English gentlemen who lives at the property but treats it like he's some lord of the manor and makes the setting quite uncomfortable. Your not staying in a hotel here your staying in some Toff's house with his dogs, it's most unpleasant. I asked for the service charge to be removed from my bill at the end of my stay because the service in the restaurant was awful. Nothing is served with a smile and everything you order service 10% is added. Paying $9 for 3 red stripes is taking the biscuit enough, seeing as they are brewed on the island and available for $1.25 across the road but to pay 10 % service to a guy that doesn't smile or say hello, no welcoming approach. It's embarrassing that you have to try and make the situation enjoyable. Quite often the waiters won't even tell the kitchen you have ordered food so you will wait a long time then when it gets to the point that you have to ask is your food coming your then told its being prepared at which point they will remember, tell the kitchen and your food will arrive in an additional 15 mins. This did not just happen to me but also two other guests in my 3 day stay. 45 mins for a salad and then no smile or apology for the delay when it is served. 10%, thank you very much. I like to tip extra when I deem I've had a nice time or looked after but this place is so poor at doing this I feel disgusted to pay the service charge, especially as I have worked over a decade in hospitality. The rooms are very adorable but the sheets have lots of stains and the dogs leave their mess on the grounds so you can be sitting in the morning enjoying the sunrise on your balcony with a rather nasty smell in the air which the gardener will have to locate and cover with dirt. The rooms have safes which is just as well because the locks on the front doors don an be easily picked with a fingernail and the maid will usually leave the door unlocked.", "title": "Bad service in a Toff's manor.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Joseph_Clarke88", "date": "October 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 182655906}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is in a beautiful location but that's not something they created and this location can be found at neighbouring properties so I would suggest you check others out.

There is really something for everyone and they all offer their own type of privacy. We stayed in south house this trip. The view from the building is quite honestly phenomenal. There is a completely unobstructed view of the ocean, both rooms have air conditioning, and you are at the end of the resort. All of the pro's for the room outweigh the minimal con's which are only noise. In the early evening/afternoon the road noise is pretty heavy, and the neighbor (a private residence, this is not under the control of the hotel) has four dogs. I am a dog lover, but there were a couple of times I went out and told those dogs to be quiet...

Tensing Pen is simply wonderful! It is a warm, intimate, refined rustic experience. The owners, the staff, the property, the food, the EVERYTHING is out of this world! We have stayed at 2 other places in Negril, one of the popular all-inclusives on the beach as well as another location on the cliffs and neither can even compare to the gem that is Tensing Pen! We were under one of those worst case scenario situations with having a wedding during extreme bad weather not only coming, while we were there but also trying to head home because the hurricane had made its way north and I am still in awe by the personal service, care and attention we received at TP.

That was the day we were supposed to arrive with our wedding to be on the 27th. 22 guests were to arrive on the 26th for a 3 night wedding weekend. Our flight was cancelled due to the hurricane. The remarkable staff including the extraordinary owners, the best wedding coordinator Shanique, and various staff members called numerous times the day before and day of the hurricane with words of encouragement and info. I was concerned about them, a hurricane was coming their way but they assured me they were ok and called happy to report the eye of the storm had passed and Negril was spared major damage. They arranged to have someone pick us up from airport the following day. I highly recommend using their drivers. When we arrived the water was choppy but nothing too alarming. The night was great, we had a warm welcome, had out 1st amazing dinner at the Lodge, and some drinks with the unforgettable bartender, Razor. As we headed back to our room the aftermath of the hurricane started to kick in bringing crazy wind and waves crashing up over the cliffs. This went on all night bringing water into our awesome Rock Cottage II. That following morning it continued to get worse and we had to move to another room. Getting even worse we were moved to a 3rd room. Our guests were to arrive that night and 1 by 1 their rooms were becoming unavailable. Evelyn, one of the incredible owners, met with us throughout the entire day to figure out the most accommodating and comfortable arrangements for our guests who were on their way. She is absolutely wonderful and worked with us to figure out the best situation for everyone. Our guests arrived to this unexpected situation and agreed to these new accommodations. Despite the situation and all the hard work they were doing around the entire property post hurricane and removal of furniture etc, the staff somehow managed to magically transform the lodge that night for our welcome dinner even adding a pretty fabric shield to block the wind. The staff is amazing! The wind and waves continued to crash the entire night and like a miracle the following morning, our wedding day, the sun was shining and it calmed down enough to have our wedding. It was magical and surpassed any expectation I had! The following morning we woke to find out that everyone\u2019s flights home were cancelled and they were to be stranded in paradise for 2 extra nights. The staff was quick to find new accommodations for everyone and we made it a group honeymoon! We had a pregnant guest who needed to leave before the airports closed within just hours and TP was awesome with trying to assist to make this happen and she was able to get the last 2 seats on the last flight out! TP had a driver ready to get her to the airport. We spent the unexpected group honeymooning jumping off the bridge, eating amazing food, exploring the neighborhood, relaxing, loving life, spending quality time\u2026not in any specific order. \uf04a It was surreal and just a dream! I was lucky enough to have Tensing, the very very lovable dog on premises be my angel the entire trip following me wherever I went. Love him!!!
