Also, we only received 3 towels, we are a 4 person family. When we asked Rob to please send some towels, they never arrived.

The pool was the cleanest hotel pool I've ever seen, and for the first time in many years I actually went for a swim in a hotel pool. The beach across the street was gorgeous, and we could see a bit of it from the room. The manager made several restaurant recommendations that turned out to be exactly what we were looking for. The walk downtown was longer than I thought it would be and too dark to do at night. When some loudmouths checked in and threatened to dominate the peace on our second day the manager was very tuned into it. Don't know exactly what happened but they were gone the next day. I don't think anyone even had a chance to complain! No telephones in the rooms, but I guess if you have a cell it doesn't matter. Have stayed in the Montauk Manor in the past, and while I love it for its elegance, we spent much more time at the beach this time because we were so close. Have also stayed at the Albatross and that experience has made me realize there are some very expensive dumps in Montauk and you have to be careful.
