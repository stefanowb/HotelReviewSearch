The hotel is well located, close to the central station (where the trains from Zurich airport arrive) and with easy access, via tram, to the rest of the city (the hotel gives a voucher for free public transportation during the stay). Rooms are ample (for European standards) and clean. As in every Ibis, they are not luxurious but you'll find everything you need for a good stay. Breakfast is ok, although, just out of curiosity, I preferred having my breakfast at one of the many places around the station. There's a supermarket nearby, and some fast food at the station, tho not many \"real\" restaurants at walking distance. I'd say there's a good chance I'll stay here again in my next business trip to Basel.", "user": "Danilo P", "date": "April 15, 2013", "id": 157825825}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Simple hotel.

( or again you can catch tram 16 from right outside). There are trams everywhere and it's an amazing transport system. We were given the mobility card from the hotel on arrival which allows you travel for free on the trams and buses etc for length of yr stay. Brilliant! we even used it to get from the airport and back again. So quick and efficient. Taxis are very very expensive so avoid unless you have to. we had to use a taxi for last part of our journey to Hochwald and it was literally a few miles up a mountain. It was almost 40 CHF and the return was the same! So 80CHF for a 6 mile journey.", "user": "Simon H", "date": "April 11, 2013", "id": 157405885}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent for the price", "text": "We didn't have breakfast in the hotel although relatives did and said it was nice.

The front of house staff were incredibly friendly and fluent in English. They immediately put me at my ease and checked me in with no fuss. Gold star. The room was clean, comfortable and everything I needed. The only issue I had was that my room faced the train station and occasionally you could hear the trains and announcements. Next door's tv was also audible to the syllable.

The location is excellent; 5 min walk from the train station. Take city/airport bus that drops you off at the main train station. Just walk to the other end of the station and turn right. Hotel very clean, very comfortable, all paper work was ready when I arrived; if want late snack they 24 hr. service, although better walk back to the train station and eat at Hallo restaurant next to train track #14. Ibis Hotel also gives to you free bus pass that you can use all day in city and to airport. Also CoOp very close if you wish to buy grocers, fruit, etc. I take with me a thermos bottle for tea during the day, and hotel staff were happy to prepare it for me. I had another hotel booked for end of trip but cancelled it and came back to the Ibis since so very close to the train station. Bed very comfortable.
