There were no signs indicating \"renovations underway\" so we could only assume that this was the best to be expected. The hotel lobby was bare (no decorations/paintings, etc) with only a few chairs and a couple of tables. The walls were in serious need of repainting and the carpeting looked worn and dirty. Even the bar area had A/C vent fans just above head level that were clearly rusted for some period of time. There were wires dangling from the television and a huge cracked mirror on the wall. The cost of a regular cup of coffee was $3.75 and the service was slow. The positive points we found were clean restrooms, free parking and that the front desk personnel were friendly and helpful. Although we were not staying at the hotel, based on the lobby appearance itself, we would have done an about-face if we were considering staying there.

In addition, the breakfast offered for this deal was simply the continental type, which does not serve my needs at all.
