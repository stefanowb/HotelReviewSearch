We spent three days with amazing Game Drives with faboulus guiding from Nicloas and Peter in Masai Mara Reserve and got to see the Big Five in addition to all kind of other African animals. We saw approxiamtely 1.8 mill wildbeests and 500 000 zebras in the Great Migration, and the start of the Big Crossing with lots of crocodilles in the rives. It cannot be described - it has to be seen. We also had our 15 years anniversary with a bush dinner - a spectacular dinner experience in the bush with Masai warriors as guards from the wild animals.

From the moment we arrives we were greeted with such hospitality and luxury. Our tent was beautifully furnished, comfortable,and a welcome home in the bush. The staff was wonderful, the food was great, and the safari's were divine! Our guides Jackson and Branice were fabulous, and tailored our safari experience to our preferences.We took a hot air balloon ride followed by a champagne brunch that was truly memorable. We also enjoyed a evening dinner in the bush complete with light lanterns, a fire and traditional Kenyan bbq. My husband and I have traveled all over the world and this was one of the best trips we had ever taken. We saw elephant carvans, lions, the great migration, cheetah's with cubs, and every animal in the Mara. Within 30 minutes of arriving in camp we saw an elephant come to the river. The hippo family that lives there was enjoyable to watch. We selected this camp because of their ecofriendly approach to tourism, including solar showers, cooking and computer classes for staff and Masai. We planted trees on our last day and visited the gardens, garage, laundry and kitchens. We didn't want to leave, but certainly would recommend this camp to anyone who is looking for a wonderful safari experience that mixes wildlife, luxury, adventure, ecotourism, gourmet meals, great spa services into a single experience. While this safari was expensive, it was worth every penny...I'd do it all over again!

We visited 5 different park areas, with the Masai Mara/ Mara North Conservancy as our final park. Our 3 night stay here at KBC was the perfect \"crown jewel\" in our safari experience. We were greeted by Martin, the camp's wonderful Danish co-owner (opened in 2007) and equally friendly & gracious asst. manager, Sharon. The camp evokes peace and casual elegance with its beautiful setting on the Mara River, complete with a resident pod of hippos, and lovely public areas (dining room, lounge and bar). My large \"tented camp\" room was heavenly - with a spacious wooden deck with river views, nice furniture, a large bathroom and \"open air\" shower. The whole camp evoked a feeling of \"Out of Africa\" which was clearly their intent and I loved their \"true\" eco-responsible focus (both in how they built the camp, such as using only solar power and how they work with and employ the local Masai villagers). The food was gourmet and all of the camp staff were great. KBC's safari jeeps (6 passenger) and driver guides were excellent. Our group enjoyed a sunrise balloon ride over the Masai Mara (wonderful, including the post-ride champagne breakfast) and some people made a visit to a local Masai village to experience the Masai's very different and fascinating culture.

This is a critical distinction that must be understood. At Karen Blixen, one is housed in tent cabins that are the size of small house, well-furnished and decorated, with an outside shower area the size of a typical American bedroom. Even with all the physical comforts, its the service that creates the 5-star experience, from the cabin steward who takes care of your cabin from morning to evening turndown, to the dining room staff who are gracious and solicitous, to the reception staff who provide suggestions to make your stay a true adventure, to the fully trained guides who are fully knowledgable concerning the Maasai Mara wildlife - all of these people are what makes Karen Blixen an \"Exquisite Experience.\" Others have written of the animals around the Camp grounds, but a must-do is the Game Walk offered for only $30. This walk consists of being driven to a an area of the Mara where a guest can walk the Land among whatever animals are nearby, but not the Big 5 which could be dangerous. I was accompanied by a guide, a guard, plus a driver who waits in the distance just in I became tired. I walked near groups of giraffes, antelope, wart hog, hyena, zebra. And, when a report of a cheetah kill was received by the driver, he picked us all up and took us to the kill, and then through a herd of elephant and pride of lion. The guide educated me about animal tracks and scat during the walk and was fully versed in both scientific and anecdotal information about both the animal and plant life of the Mara. I stayed an KBC through a tour, so I don't know how much it cost, but it certainly was an experience of a lifetime.", "title": "Exquisite Experience", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Hikergrl2010", "date": "July 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133956383}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled solo", "text": "before i'll gone to mara i'll search on net lot about mara i found karen blixen through one agent with 3 night offer with balloon ride.(off course charge will be in 3 days rate included but name as free ) but friend i advice you in africa never go anything for free or complimentary it will never you get . i am from india and i am strictly veg so very particular about choice .when i gone so it's long rain season so in front of breakfast table you can see hippo 24 X7 sometime impala you can see but as my knowledge more animal you can see in month jan - feb because animal must came for water . as every review said about camp is true . not to worries about comfort and food is stunning chef makes as per your need also for comfort and food & safari you find royal treatment .one thing i notice is in mara north conservancy and main mara has some issued so they cancelled my balloon ride some rules are also changed .every day we are going same area for hunt big five expect rhino( very rarely rhino found on mara north con so select proper location ) we seen every other animals . about staff is friendly our safari guide denial And tony has good knowledge about animal i want to see lion more closer he find take to as per mara rules kept distance but we are lucky lion came closer to us .if any indian wants to go then it's life time experience for camp choose proper season to go", "title": "first time in mara with eco camp lot of experience in mara", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ddtravellerr", "date": "June 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 132136881}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012", "text": "A wonderful place; the tents are spread out by the Mara River.", "title": "Close encounter", "user": "Maaamo", "date": "June 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 132051696}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Sitting having breakfast by the hippo-pool when we suddenly see a large hippo right across the river.", "title": "A Wonderful Camp in The Mara", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Melanie B", "date": "June 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131199668}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012", "text": "In fact; we did see a lot og animals from the dining area, and from the large terrace in front of our tent.", "title": "Eco camp with high comfort", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Lauritsjr", "date": "March 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 125464598}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I booked this camp through Real Africa, their service (Paul Hickey-Fry) was faultless.
