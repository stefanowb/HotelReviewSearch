We were shown where to go but on entering the changing roms, we were a bit disappointed as it was just one small communal changing area and no individual changing room. We ended up taking our turn in changing in the toilet for privacy which wasn't ideal as the floor was soaking ant the toilet wasn't flushing very well. I appreciate we are all ladies together but my friend and I prefer a bit privacy when getting changed. We walked to the swimming pool which was lovely, not very big but it was lovely and warm, the sauna and steam room were lovely too. Only criticism would be that the people in the gym were overlooking us which was a bit off putting at times. We then decided to see if we could have our hair done but were told that we would have to book for another time as the hairdressers are mobile. We weren't told this so couldn't have our hair done which was disappointing. We then had a meal in the restaurant which was lovly but I had asked for my steak to be well done and it as a bit pink in the middle so I couldn't eat much of it and the mushroom was stone cold. We were wanting to have coffee and dessert but overheard the waitres say to some other people that they could'nt serve anymore food as there was a health scare in the kitchen !! needless to say we were a bit concerned. On the whole it was a nice day and we couldn't fault the staff, they were fabulous.
