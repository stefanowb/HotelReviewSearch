Best of all, they seemed to enjoy their jobs. I booked the least expensive room (Mountainview) for my family of four and we were upgraded to a room with a garden and partial ocean view room. It was perfectly roomy for 4 as was the marble bathroom. The balcony was also a good size. There were plenty of complimentary amenities and activiities - L'Occitane toiletries, bottled water, coffee and tea, computers, game room, dvd movies, excercise classes, snorkel equipment for one hour, hawaiian paddling. The restaurants served wonderful food and all served fixed price dinners which were embarassingly reasonable for the quality of the food and service. The beach in front of the hotel is one of the nicest on the entire island. As one previous reviewer stated, if you can at all swing the price, stay here. It is an experience you won't forget or regret. Kaanapali is a zoo, Kapalua is too remote with not much going on.

Oh yeah, it had a view of the ocean (you know the type....if you stand on the far edge of the room, tilt your head 45 degrees on your tippy toes, you can see a corner of the ocean). Breakfast was something like $40 per person, a pizza lunch for two came in around $70, and don't get me started about dinners here.

There is little doubt that this place is expensive but you get what you pay for and this was as close to a perfect vacation as one can get. Although I have stayed at other FS properties with my children before, I was a little nervous that we would be out of place and feel somewhat unwelcomed. This could not be further from the case. The hotel is the most kid-friendly hotel we have ever stayed at and I can highly recommend it to families with children of all ages. We stayed in a garden view executive suite which was huge. The room had a nice entrace foyer, a large living room with a dining area, pull out sofa, minibar, amoire with a TV/DVD/VCR in it and access to the lanai. The bedroom was separated from the living room by doors and had a king bed, chair, amoire with another TV and DVD player and access the the lanai. The bathroom was enormous--even by FS standards. The hotel was opened in 1990 and I do not think the rooms have been renovated since the opening. Notwithstanding this, we found the rooms to be tastefully decorated and in very good shape. The toiletries are L'Occitaine and are quite nice. We had the B&B package which meant that we had breakfast buffet included in the rate. The buffet is huge and offers just about anything one could want. The children ate free which was nice and the hotel provided plastic plates, bowls and cups, paper and crayons, and building toys. (The children also at free at night in the Pacific Terrace Restaurant since they were under 5 which was also a nice touch) The pool area, as mentioned by some, is small but we found it more than adequate--the kids pool is great--perfect for our aged of children. The poolside service is out of this world. Every morning we would hit the pool by 8:30, pick a cabana and it was set up with towels, chair covers, ice water and a crib for our baby. Last year we stayed at the Kea Lani and they charged for cabanas--it is nice that that the FS includes them at no cost as it allowed us to remain poolside all day. The beach is great--much better than Polo Beach--and the beach service is as good as the pool service--they even rake the beach every morning! The hotel provides water and beach toys as well so there is no need to bring them from home. The poolside staff are incredible and we really enjoyed the amenities they provided. They were, without exception, friendly and really made the trip enjoyable. Since our son is not yet 5, he could not attend the Kids For All Seasons programs without an adult but we were welcome to join them in all of their activities. Our son had a blast at all the activities we attended and did not want to the leave. The staff were, as with the rest of the hotel, excellent. The food at the hotel was quite good although the poolside menu gets a little old after 10 days. Ferraro's was o.k.-probably not worth it except for the views. Spago was excellent and the Pacific Terrace Restaurant was quite good. We had room service on one occassion and it was delivered in a timely manner and was quite good. The game room in the hotel is great with shuffleboard, pool tables, fooseball, ping pong and sony playstations and the cardio area is great. We really enjoyed the other guests and, with only a few exceptions, found them to be quite friendly and down to earth. We had some fun celebrity sights while we were there as Britney Spears, John Stamos and Mick Fleetwood were all staying at the resort at various times during our stay. The valets always had the car waiting for us and were quick to offer directions and bottled water. Having stayed at the Kea Lani, the Ritz Carlton and the Westin, there is little doubt in my mind that this is the best place to stay in Wailea, Kaanapali or Kapaula and, in the end, well worth it. One word of caution however, there is a lot of construction going on right across the street from the Grand Waliea (which is next door to the FS) and we could definitley hear the beeping from trucks backing up from our room (we were on the ground floor of the north tower). Although not terribly distracting as we were out of the room most of the day, I would suggest asking for a room in the south tower if avaialble and also avoid the mountainside rooms until the construction is complete--which, by the looks of things, could be quite a while. We did not notice the construction noise in any of the public areas of the hotel nor did we hear anyone complaining about it.", "title": "You Get What You Pay For", "helpfulness": 23, "user": "Bowdoin1", "date": "March 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4568205}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "okay, but not as great as everyone says it is", "text": "Ok, so its a nice hotel on a nice beach.

I have stayed in all types of hotels and vacation rentals over that time from private beach houses, condos and resorts on both sides of the island including the Hyatt (which I still like) Sheraton, Kei Lani, Grand Wailea (horrible and last choice) and the Four Seasons. While this was not our first time visiting the Four Seasons I would have to say that based on experience this really is the best choice available and while not cheap at close to $1,000 a night you really do get what you pay for here. We booked a partial ocean view room on the club level. What I liked about this room, it faces the outside of the Resort towards Makena. The prime ocean view rooms on the club level face towards the pool area and the Grand Wailea (disneyland) next door and you also see the rooms across the courtyard. I'm at the pool all day or on the beach and see that view, so it was nice to face towards the Molikini crater to get a different look so I would say a booking tip here is not to pay for the prime ocean view rooms. Another nice option about the Four Seasons is you can fax a shopping list and have your in room frig. stocked with the items you want. This is not as important if your on the club level as they have food service four times a day and an open bar at all times, no cost and if you need anything you can just take it to your room, for example bottled water, chips, sandwiches and so on. The club level food service had a continental breakfast in the morning that varies every day with a combination of the usual items and a few new ones like french toast, egg fritata, eggs florentine as a few examples, mid day or afternoon tea as they call it was a mix of sandwiches, quiche, cheese, deserts and other finger foods. The happy hour also had a mix of the same items everyday and a few new hot and cold appetizers. The fourth service was around 8:30pm to ? which was all deserts and really, really good. With food service like this every day you don't need to go down for breakfast in the morning at $35 a person. Other items included on the club level are your own private staff to arrange day trips, rest resv's free use of the internet and business center on that level, use of binoculars to view any whales going by and many other perks.", "title": "Best Resort/Hotel on Maui with one big flaw", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Hellooooooo", "date": "April 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 15165501, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Service and attention to detail", "disliked": "\u2014 fight for a cabana, nothing a good tip won't fix"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I would say that as with all resorts at this level budget and bring some $$$ for tips, they go a long way.
