The location is excellent. It is right on the beach in a very upscale neighborhood away from a lot of the noise and congestion that you often find at other places in the center of town. Just a short ride to the boardwalk and there is a trolley that stops right out front for $2 a person if you don't want to be bothered with driving or looking for parking when you're ready to go to the boardwalk. Two room types are available. Oceanfront motels rooms sleep either 2 in a king or 4 in two queens. Both have private balconies overlooking the pool, which is very nice, along with direct ocean front views. For families, there are ocean view rooms on the north and south side of the building which are two room efficiency units with complete kitchens. There is a queen sized sleeper sofa in the living room with either a king or a queen and a twin in the bedroom. No private balcony in these rooms but there are chairs outside on a common walkway for very nice views of the beach and ocean. Jamaica Me Hungry is the restaurant on the premises and serves a very good breakfast with many interesting choices including a lobster and asparagus benedict and banana pancakes. They have a convenient take out window which is great for packing lunches for the beach. Their fruit salad is large and delicious, a perfect lunch item. Ice Cream for the kids, too, burgers, hot dogs and a better than average lunch menu. The grilled chicken quesadilla and cuban sandwich were both outstanding. At nite, they serve seafood, chicken and ribs and some very good desserts. Everything here was truly outstanding and they accept credit cards too. This place has everything you need.

That being said, the bed was very comfortable and the front desk staff were friendly. When we go down n the summer, we will stay in one of the efficiencies. We did peek in several of the vacant rooms and they look very nice. I think we will give this place a try next summer. Hotel is within walking distance of local restaurant Crest Tavern, our favorite place. We were there for the Irish Festival that was going on in North Wildwood. Trolley shuttles were running back and forth. There are a lot of \"don't do's\". I thought it was comical that the contents of each room is listed ... Along with fines for missing items.
