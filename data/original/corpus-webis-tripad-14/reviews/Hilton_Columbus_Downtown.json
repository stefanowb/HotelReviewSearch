The bedroom was very comfortable and quiet and was tastefully decorated - great TV, small refrigerator, and great blackout drapes (would have been better without the bathroom night light) My only one complaint was that it is a shame that they cannot accommodate hilton gold members on their executive floor - only platinum.
