We arrived and though there were few patrons, it took a while to be seated. A waiter showed up and took coffee orders. He quickly retuned with coffee but not my requested milk. We gave him the order and he promised to return with milk. We did not see him again for almost 20 minutes and he brought the check. We told him we hadn't eaten yet. He mumbled and went off. He returned quickly with our breakfast. It had obviously been sitting somewhere since it was barely warm. He returned about 10 minutes later with the check again.

The customer service is top notch, the location is perfect, and the rooms are very comfortable. I'm normally a firm matress kind of guy, but I swear lying on that bed was like lying on a cloud. Very comfortable. I'm normally not a fan of having the bathroom sink outside of the bathroom, and not beyond a closed door, but the way they configured the room, you got the best of both worlds. Location-wise, this hotel is just a short walk to all of the attractions, and the monorail, which will get you over to the Space Needle and Experience Music Project area. Don't waste your money on a rental car if you're planning on staying in Seattle, because you won't need it. We didn't eat at the restaurant on the main floor, but it seemed to be busy at all the peak times, so I can only assume that means the food is decent.
