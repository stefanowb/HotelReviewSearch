This yr was our 40th anniversary so thought we would stay in a little swankier place. What a disappointment. Like all the bad things the other reviewers wrote Id have to double it. First we are smokers, ya I know, and had requested a smoking room, which we got if we would have arrived on Sunday as planned but due to flooding on the big island we went to waikiki on Friday and conviently they had no smoking rooms but we sure could upgrade and get one. ( other hotel reviews on here people write all the time about a free upgrade) for a price. Thought maybe since it was our 40th they would give us one HUH they sure did for $25 a night (5 nights) so we took it. Got to the room and as one reviewer on here said what a disappointment that isnt the word. For what you are paying the room wasnt as nice as the ohana west and for twice the price. The wallpaper was coming loose from the wall in many places, if you looked where the floor met the walls, there was dirt and waste and the bathroom tile floor was a mess, grout was all dirty and corners dirty, the toliet was sitting on the floor at a angle and when you sat on it you thought that you had to hold on so you didnt fall off, There are no dressers just a small set of drawers not enough for one person in the closet, also in the closet was 2 bottles of water with the ice bucket the bottles had a sign on them only $4.25 each comeon high priced room and you have to pay $4.25 for a dollar bottle of water?? Your morning coffee isnt free either in the room, our coffee maker was screwed up open the lid to pour the water in and the hinges were broke so you had the lid in your hand, after the coffee was made there was no way you could remove the pot without opening the filter basket and the same trying to put the pot away. The mattresses have seen there better day and thought that I was going to fall out of bed several times the center is higher then the sides,. Unfriendly very unfriendly staff EXCEPT for the maids and bells very nice people, we went back to the room one day to put some purchases away and the maid was in the room. We told her what we wanted to do and she stopped her work moved the vacuum out in the hallway asked for our room key and shut the door and then used our key to open it, you dont find that at many hotels!!!!! Maid was very security minded. Now the good parts Location Location Location and when we upgraded it was called a ocean view room which it kind of was, you could see the ocean if you stood at the lanai railing but not if you sat in the chairs and the sun set between two hotels and it was very nice. Every day between 2 and 3 they give away free slices of pineapple in the lobby and they have 5 computers with internet that you can use for free. Have to wait your turn and sometimes that was 30 or 40 minutes.

After our early morning flight there coming from the winter cold, we were expecting warm greetings when we arrived........ I mean, you would think the guest services could at least have a smile on their face when they say \"Aloha\"!? Instead, it almost seemed like we were just a complete hassle when we asked any form of question at all, nice, really nice:) So, we went about checking in and went up to our rooms to see how they were, and quite honestly it was a disappointment when we opened the door and realized we were paying a ridiculous amount for a VERY AVERAGE room:) Now, one thing I do have to admit, besides the awesome location, we did have an amazing view:) The next morning we thought it would be nice to attend the breakfast buffet in the Pikake Lounge, considering we had a bunch of family fly in to meet for a special occasion. After finding out it was $21.95 EACH, we decided to sit down anyways and enjoy the beautiful atmospshere (so we thought!) Not only were the servers painfully slow, they were among the RUDEST, CONDESCENDING INDIVIDUALS I have come across!!!!!!!!!!! After this experience left a bad taste in our mouth we almost didn 't want to return:) However, we thought we would give it another chance, once again, disappointment!!!!!!!! The only employees we want to give thanks to are the Bell Boys and the Housekeepers for actually smiling and acknowledging us on a daily basis:) We will return to Waikiki, just not to the Sheraton Princess:)", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "tink23Vancouver_BC", "date": "February 7, 2008", "id": 13369914}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with family", "text": "My husband and I and 2 kids 6 and 8 stayed here Jan. 2008.

The people at this hotel treated us like [...] the whole time we stayed here. We had a waitress who was extremely rude who told us they have a 1 drink minimum to sit in the bar area. 1 drink minimum?!?! Maybe it was the way we looked? This is a 2 star hotel at best, who charges a minimum drink order just to sit in the bar/lounge area. Ridiculous! Then, on our last night here, we woke up several times to the drunk guy in the next room pounding and kicking the walls and door. Security was called a couple times and they did come up, but it didn't really help. Then when we tried to get a late checkout because drunko next door kept us up all night, they have no record of it and are only willing to extend it 1 hour. I am very upset with the service we've received here and how this place has gone downhill. It needs a major upgrade and renovation, which probably hasn't been done since the Reagan administration.

I found my High Oceanview room excellent. The view was wonderful (facing Diamond Head and the ocean). The room was spotless with the standard furnishings, wonderful quiet A.C. and a lovely welcoming fruit basket delivered by a nice staff member. The concierge and front desk staff were very helpful. Every other day I'd planned a tour and the front entry man made sure he watched for my tour group / pick-up shuttle. He was awesome. When you arrive, they tag your bags with your room number and they deliver them so you don't have to juggle them during your check-in which was fast and easy. The hotel is a 2 minute walk to the main street and beach. There is an abundance of cafe's, snack bars, fast food places and a ABC variety store right across the street. The only negative's I experienced was the traffic flow inside the hotel and the very pricy buffet meals. They have a main aisle to the elevators (4) but you are \"herded\" into a narrow walk-through due to some of the buffet food tables being on both sides and local artisians with display tables in the same area. Makes it very crowded and frustrating to get through. The buffet meals are costly ($65+ per person for dinner) but the foods offered are really top-notch. It was way out of my price range so I ate out. A really neat thing they offer is an option to not have housekeeping for up to 2 days in a row. On the days I was out on tours, I had housekeeping but not on the days I was in the hotel. Each time I declined, I received a $5 certificate you can use in any place in the hotel. I saved mine and splurged on a room service breakfast on my last day. I understand the hotel was to be closed for reno's shortly after my stay.
