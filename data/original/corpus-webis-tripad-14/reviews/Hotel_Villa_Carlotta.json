We did not have the good fortune to sleep here but visited the property and enjoyed both a dinner and lunch on their roof terrace. The views are breathtaking and often distract you from the equally impressive cuisine and service. But what is impeccable about this place is the stylish elegance which the owners have managed to attribute to this jewel of a property. In true Sicilian fashion, they have been able to create a feast for the eyes, palate and scent, as well as, for the heart and soul. Just even relaxing in their sitting room in the tower, prior to dinner, I could sense the warmth and beauty that is so peculiar to Sicily.

As if it was not nice enough there all kinds of upgrades and improvements inside and out. But some things never change like the views of Giardini-Naxos, Mount Etna spewing her trail of smoke and the calmness of the Ionian Sea. The staff was once again very helpful in planning our day and what to do at night. The breakfasts are soooo good, from the beautifully prepared pastries, to the wide selection of meats, nuts, cheeses, eggs, breads, and of course complimentary Prosecco. Now what really made a difference was the dinners, they were as if they had come from the finest restaurants in Italy. The selection and the preparation was the best. We had only three nights but we will remember each one as a culinary delight. You can tell that Andrea and Rosaria the owners really care about you and your stay at Villa Carlotta. It is a great value considering the ambiance, the rooms and the friends you will make while you are there.

The street is a simple walk of about a kilometer to the main street in Taormina. The lobby is a small room in the central building with enough room for a couple to sit. The grounds in the back are nice and lead to a little pool all rather built into a small plot lot of land. The rooms are large compared to others and we had a mini-suite with a view of the grounds. Our friends had a view of the of the sea that was literally the exact same size as our room only a floor up. Price/cost on this was about 100 Euro. We had a little balcony that is a shared walkway among three rooms. I guess the table with a couple chairs means it is exclusively for us but it wasn't greatly useful.
