Beautiful courtyard grounds and pool, and fabulous bars and restaurants dotted all around. Fusion bar did amazing cocktails and the signature Nepali restaurant was an amazing experience. The spa was lovely and my husband and I both enjoyed the Himalayan Trekkers Massage (much needed!) The rooms were stunning - absolutely massive and so luxurious.

Opened over 50 years ago, when Dwarikas started a project to protect the heritage of the city and used reclaimed wooden beams, doors etc... to develop what is a truly unique hotel. You step away from the busy streets of the city and into the quiet, calm courtyard of the hotel. The friendly smiles and genuine helpful nature of everyone you encounter is wonderful. There is plenty of choice within the complex - from three excellent restaurants (the best Nepalese Restaurant in the country, offering a real gastronomic experience, Japanese and International), a Bar full of character, Library/Lounge, Outdoor Swimming Pool, Shops and of course, the lovely courtyard to relax in and enjoy drinks and dining. Bedrooms are spacious and have everything you want from a luxury hotel. A wonderful touch was the hot water bottle at turndown. Breakfast is excellent, with plenty of choice. There is plenty of information about the retoration and development project that the hotel grew from and they are even restoring a local temple. The hotel is a little away from the old city, but close to some of the key sights and attractions of Kathmandu (everywhere is a cheap taxi ride away). The airport is also easily reached (traffic can be terrible in Kathmandu, so this is handy). The owners are still very much involved (third generation) and this creates a lovely family feel to the experience.
