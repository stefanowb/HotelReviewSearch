Our bad experience began at the pool when the pool supervisor, Avi, insulted us by relentlessly calling us liars about how many people were in our room (my husband, me, & 10 year old child). When he wasn't haggling us, he was kissing on the Natives & flirting with the female teen girls. Housekeeping was very rude and upset when we needed an extra towel for 3 people to take showers (apparently each room is only allotted 2 bath towels). We requested and paid extra for a late Shabbat checkout (8pm). At 5pm, the front desk manager, Roger, called asking if we 'have a problem' because checkout is at noon. When we attempted to explain we had a late checkout, he demanded to know who we talked to and when we made this request because he didn't have it in his system, again inferring we were liars.
