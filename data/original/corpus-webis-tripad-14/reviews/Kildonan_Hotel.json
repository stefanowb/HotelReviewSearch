If you want anything other than orange juice you need to pay extra. You can't have both cereal and a cooked breakfast (where do you ever hear of that?), only 1 rasher of bacon & the lorne sausage was barely cooked, black pudding costs extra - everything else OK, not greasy at all. Service pretty slow (at dinner it was only the lady owner serving with the barmaid assisting with drinks), at breakfast I had tea, but the other 3 with me wanted coffee and small pot served - waited ages to attract attention and waited ages, we were about to leave when the girl eventually brought another pot of coffee.
