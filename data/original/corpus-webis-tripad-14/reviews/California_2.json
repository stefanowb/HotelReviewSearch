It's got so much character! Right on the river, within walking distance to the Royal Palace and Historical Museum, near all the shops. You definitely won't be bored easily. If you want to see the city, you can sit at the downstairs bar, have a Tiger beer, and watch all the locals and expats coming in and out of this place. Jim and Steve are fantastic. Steve gave us information on diving in Kampong Saom, and arranged Mekong boat tickets for our transport into Vietnam. The food at the restaurant is great. I tried a local dish and the fish tacos and both were excellent. I woke up in the morning, went out on the balcony and saw an ELEPHANT going for a morning stroll with its owner.
