I stayed here last night with my boyfriend and found everything about the stay great. Firstly the location is excellent, was very easy to find and it is a short walk to the town, a map is provided on check in along with recommendations for places to eat. We booked the deluxe spa room, the room was a good size and extremely clean,the bath was a jacuzzi spa and very big. The price for the night was very very fair and included a choice of a continental or cooked breakfast, we both opted for the cooked breakfast which was delivered to the room and was very nice. The hotel is family run and a great service is provided. If we ever find ourselves in Warrnambool again we will definitely be staying here and also recommending it to our friends.", "title": "Brilliant place to stay", "user": "trace12", "date": "July 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115711041}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Prior to coming to Warrnambool for a recent family celebration, I booked at the Atwood Motor Inn, and on arrival was greeted very warmly.Our overnight stay was very comfortable, the bed was one of the best I had slept in, the room was lovely and warm as the heater had been turned on for us.
