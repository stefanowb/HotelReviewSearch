I also needed help with airport transportation, the hotel does not ofer this as the airport is a considerable distance, but we're able to make the arrangements for me.

They claimed they are newly renovated but basically you can tell how badly worn it used to be. We stayed on 1st floor. Bad insulation and noisy neighbors from next door and upstairs. We asked to have a room in new wing and they said they are full, but right next to me, they offered an upgrade to a couple and asked them which floor they preferred. Lots of kids running around and took over both computers (kids under 16 supposed to be supervised by adults but no one reinforced). Pool is tiny, gym has only 4 machines. Beds were worn with badly washed down comforter (that explained the clumpy looks from other travelers' photos) Kitchenette looks old, cabinets has stained - not sure if they are old or just not cleaned thoroughly. Breakfast is a disaster - too little room for too many users. No one maintain during the breakfast hour so floors are full of scrap, all utensils handles are sticky, I felt like I am sitting in a badly managed fast food place. I picked this place because it is a BW plus and they claimed they are very close to Boeing, but Hilton Garden Inn is RIGHT NEXT to Boeing and appeared to be a lot newer.

The clock radio next to the bed accepted input from my MP-3 player, which was an unexpected and pleasant discovery. The bathroom was tiny, but nicely renovated. The toilet seemed to be jet-powered -- it flushed with a very loud whoosh, like a vacuum toilet in an airplane or cruise ship. We had some noise from the elevator adjacent to our room door -- it chimed when the elevator arrived, and buzzed when riders pressed buttons -- but it wasn't too intrusive. The room was spotless but it took until after 4:00 for the room to be tidied the next day, which was surprising. The breakfast offerings were impressive: fresh fruit, do-it-yourself waffles, oatmeal, boiled eggs, toast, juices, yogurt... and the breakfast room/lobby was modern and pleasant.
