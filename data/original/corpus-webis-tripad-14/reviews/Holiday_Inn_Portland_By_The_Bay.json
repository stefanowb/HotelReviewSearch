The pool was beautiful but cold we couldn't get in, and the sauna alas was in the bathrooms one in men and one in women so we didnt use it cause we were a mixed group and wanted to hang out together. We did get the bay view and as per the reviews I couldn't understand why people said not so great, this is the story: in the foreground is the hotel flat roof with large AC units, then small row houses, buildings, then the bay with scattered construction cranes and beyond the bay more land, not what we expected. But of course that's just ascetics, Portland is apparently an old town. The workers were all very friendly except for one girl who sassed me needlessly when I asked about the free coupon for coffee we were given. There are security guards who are very present and helpful. The restaurant Port of Call was pretty and the food was not super expensive but not cheap, baked lobster was ok a bit of dry topping but not bad. The drinks are awfully weak and we sent a lot of money on them. We went to cracker barrel for breakfast 9 mins away, didn't eat at hotel. If you forget any toiletries they will rush it upstairs to you and that was nice. My friends wanted me to give this hotel a bad review because they were disappointed with some aspects. We probably won't choose this one again if we came back to Portland, there are nice ones in the area, but dont hesitate if you are stopping by for a night or two not bad.", "title": "Was not what we expected but not bad", "user": "Myrts78", "date": "April 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127842219}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Lovely rooms, delightful staff - outstanding location.

Portland is allot nicer thn I thought, frankly and this property is in a very safe and secure area besides. Nice and plentiful underground parking. My space was steps from the elevator. Front desk staff very accommodating. This was a very short visit, into town at 8pm, out and back to Arizona the next day. The front desk kept an accurate wake up call and the room was convient for dressing in the morning and work at night. I asked for the Priority club upgrade and was issued a fine room with a commanding view of the harbor. Very comfortable. If you do not have a priority club membership, get one. Good prices and if there is a priority club upgrade available, and there always seems to be, you get the best room for the lowest price. There are points, but I don't pay attention to that-- I like the onside perks. At this one they had a goody bag with snacks and coupons for the bar and restaurant. A very very nice job.

The hotel offered free parking (which they let us park early-before check in, and stay in the garage the entire next day after checkout), discount drink tickets for the lounge, a shuttle service that would bring us not only to our desired location, but would also come pick us up (until 1am)!! The Holiday Inn couldn't be in a better spot- it was about a 15 minute walk down to Duck Fat (a most fantastic restaurant- that you MUST try), a 2 minute walk to the civic center (we caught a Pirates game), and a 5-10 minute walk from shopping, music venues, restaurants/bars etc. We are already planning a trip back for the summer and without question will re-book at the Holiday Inn- honestly, the hotel was spotless and recently updated, the staff was helpful and right on with their recommendations, and the pool was clean and refreshing.

Booked a King non-smoking with a bay view; stayed in room 906. If you are not from around here, let's just be clear, the view isn't that great. But, I guess it beats the other side of the hotel with a view of a street. The room wasn't overly large, but adequate for the two of us. The bathroom, however, was tight with very little counter space, especially with a coffee maker sitting there. Easy fix though\u2026moved the coffee maker. There was a fridge and microwave, as well as a flat screen TV with about 40 channels, free WiFi, a few toiletries, iron and ironing board. I have a Priority Card through Holiday Inn and received a coupon for a free beverage in the lounge as well as a coupon for 50% off another beverage. Also got a bag with bottled water, a Maine magazine, a couple of snacks and a coupon for free tea or coffee in the restaurant. Used the beverage coupons later that evening in the lounge when we came back from Old Port. Very nice vodka tonics! There is free parking on-site as well as a free shuttle that will drop off and pick up until 1am. This was convenient because we didn't walk to walk to/from Old Port in the cold. My only issue with the room\u2026no exhaust fan in the bathroom and no extra blankets. The following morning, we had the breakfast buffet for $11.99 pp. If I had just ordered an omelet and added on veggies, meat, fruit juice, etc., it probably would have been more that $11.99.
