There was a 'library' which was a relaxing setting looking out over the bushland with a warming fire; perfect to either relax with a book or join with friends for a convivial drink. The Wilderness Photographic Gallery attached was well worth a visit with an abolutely beautiful display. This cultural gem compelements the wilderness around it. The buffet dinner is best avoided if you are looking for a good food experience. It was the cheaper option but not worth the money and the service slow. The restaurant was a definite improvement and although expensive the food was quite good. However, it is not for the food that you come to this area but for the wilderness experience which is outstanding and well worth any little inconvenience. There is a taste of the wilderness right at the hotel doorstep. Step out of the library and you are in a delightful easy bushwalk complete with local flora and fauna.", "title": "Attractive setting and ideal for discovering the Dove Lake area.", "user": "Travel_addict13_10", "date": "November 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 86234432}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed two nights in a delux spa room, which was split level, room was very comfortable but very dated decor and looked tired.

The staff are very helpfull and friendly. Our favourite part was the reception are with its log fire and polished floor but its a shame the rooms were not of the same standard (but i suppose it was significantly cheaper than some of the neighbouring accomodation. The rooms were clean, well furnished and comfortable. We booked a deluxe spa room but it was the same as the other rooms that we saw except the bath had the ability to blow bubbles and prob not worth the extra cash. The rooms, especially the bathrooms need a bit of a refurb, however as i said they are clean and well furnished if a little dated. The room service menu was very reasonably priced but the restaurant a tad pricey.
