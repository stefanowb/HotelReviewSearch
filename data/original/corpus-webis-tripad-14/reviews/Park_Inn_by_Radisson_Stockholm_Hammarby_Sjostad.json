This was our first visit to Stockholm and I was happy with hotel choice for closeness to globe, but if you want to be right in the hustle and bustle of central stockholm this is not the perfect hotel as its a quiet area and everywhere is a pretty long walk - although the tram stop is just up the road and the tubes and trams are clean and safe, although a little pricey. We decided to walk everywhere and walked right into the north island, all around the old town it was great as we wanted to walk around and the weather was lovely - but we walked a pretty long way!. If you fly into Arlanda I recommend booking a taxi through the hotel as it is 450sek from airport to hotel - it costs virtually the same as the price for the Arlanda Express 250sek (my daughter is 11 and travelled free) and taxi from Gullmarsplan to Hotel 180sekl! So would work out much cheaper for a cab if there is a group of you.
