We actually stayed at Arenal Observatory Lodge about 15 minutes away so we could watch the volcano at night. However, the Tabacon Hot Springs was probably the highlight of our trip. It is well worth the price of admission. We decided to stay in La Fortuna overnight, which was a great decision. FYI, if you take an Areanl Volcano and Tabacon Springs full day tour that leaves from most places in Costa Rica, you will not get the whole experience nor be able to fully enjoy these natural wonders. We bought the $45 evening pass, which people have said daytime is better. I beg to differ- although daytime is probably still awesome (and you can take visible pictures of your experience), nighttime was just as awesome. Granted, it does get crowded around 6:00 and 7:00 PM, but rest assured, these tour groups leave by 8:00 PM and you have most of the springs to yourself until close (10:00 PM). I would advise people to bring water shoes if you want to climb through the springs. There are a lot of large rocks when you step in, and you may either hurt yourself or lose balance without the water shoes. Flip-flops won't work... there's too much current from the springs. Once you get in, there is so much to explore. There are numerous different springs throughout, different temperatures, all of them relaxing. The landscaping is awe-inspiring, and just gorgeous. The only drawback of this resort is they overcharge for everything. The drinks were definitely American prices. But I guess if you expect it and prepare yourself for it, you won't be disappointed. I didn't mind paying a little extra to have the experience of sitting in the warm pool swim up bar.

We were so glad to finally get there. It was a long trip from San Jose where we flew into. (about three hours of twisting roads). It made me happy to finally be there. Check in was easy, and we were greeted with a tropical drink. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We had a nice view of the volcano. The hot springs are a brisk walk down steps and a must do. We induldged in a tabacon massage ....I highly recommend a spa treatment. The hotel itself never seemed crowded; though, the hot springs themselves were crowded. You could find more secluded areas while walking around though. I guess it is just when you first walk in...it looks too crowded. They have a nice buffet style restaurant and a swim up bar for lite fare. We also ventured into the town of La Fortuna for souvenir shopping and dinner one night. There are other excursions available.

The hotel grounds and pools were amazing! We saw lots of wildlife and went to the hot springs several times. The room was spacious, clean, and looked beautiful. The location was close enough to drive to town, but far enough to feel like you're in the wilderness. The staff was very nice and everyone was friendly. To be nit picky, our air conditioner vent made a buzzing noise the whole time, our lights would sporadically turn off, and the bed was not very comfortable for a hotel of this stature. All of those things could have been easily ignored, however, we felt that for the price of almost $400 a night, things like that should not happen. It would be worth it to stay in the summer during the wet season, but not worth it for the price at peak season.

Nicest room of the 3 places we stayed with a full size jacuzzi in room. AC did make a rattling noise from time to time and turn down service failed to come once. Breakfast buffet was included and was very tasty and comprehensive. Had one dinner on site ($50pp) but worth doing at least once. Had a tandoori lunch once and the buffet dinner twice at the hot springs restaurant. We did the combination tour of the Hanging Bridges, La Fortuna waterfall, lunch in town, and the Arenal Hike. It rained all morning and our guide suggested we defer our Arenal hike to the following morning. Thank goodness we did since it cleared up and we were able to see most of the volcano. That afternoon we went back to the volcano for the Sky Trek zip-line. It's a MUST. Of course, the real MUST are the Hot Springs. We went 3 times.
