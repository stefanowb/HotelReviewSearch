I booked through their hotel website. They were very efficient in responding to my email and questions. The place is not far from the Hakone-Yumoto station, only ~20 minutes walk which we did after we checked out. However, we took the taxi to get there from the station because we had not idea where to go. By taxi, it costs 660 yen. We stayed in what they call the Type 2 room which had it's own hot spring bath with river view. It was very nice. We also booked the public batch which allowed the guests 30 minutes each time but this is not a long time becuase by the time you change and wash yourself before and after the bath, it only leaves you about 20-15 minutes. I'd recommended trying to get room with its own bath because that way, you have use of the hot spring as long as you want. Dinner was excellent! They feed you up really good. Breakfast is great but only if you like fish in the morning which was I was quite happy about. The staff is really friendly too. It was a great experience.
