My 2nd floor room was very clean and very comfortable. Sound-proofed windows opened with a view of the river. It's on the main road so there is some truck traffic. Lots of nice touches for the rate (bottled water, night light, robes) and staff was efficient and friendly. If you're bothered by foot traffic above your head, insist on a top floor room. The restaurant served a fast and fine breakfast.

We are a family of 6 and how refreshing it was not to have have interconnecting rooms and also not to be looked at funny when requiring bedding for 6. I booked this hotel sight unseen by phone in Australia prior to leaving as we spent Xmas Eve and Christmas Day there. Firstly we arrived earlier than check in time: \"No problem go straight to your room Sir\". Room was clean and extremely large. Hotel was well presented the staff could not do enough for you. Xmas day the restuarant was closed but the hotel had complemantary muffins, coffee, juice etc. Free internet access, for us to speak to relatives at home on Xmas day. Great location in the middle of town close to shops, restuarants and the Coor's brewery. The best thing about this hotel was it was also really cheap.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mrdigby", "date": "February 1, 2007", "id": 6726390}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled on business", "text": "I was in Golden the week of OCT.7th thru. the 10th. I have never stayed here before, so when I saw the dark colored awning in the front with the words \"GOLDEN HOTEL\" printed on it, I was sure this was going to be a nice hotel, but nothing extra ordinary. Well was I surprised! The whole feel of the hotel is very welcoming,the staff treated me like I owned the place. Everything inside looked new and clean,as if I were the first guest after the grand opening. Now for more good stuff...all of the amenities, like tissue,shampoo,soap,coffee,etc. were all first rate brand name items. My computer worked the first try on the high speed service in my room. I played my iPod thru my radio CD player in my room, I had a real big china coffee mug, my windows opened, my view of the river was wonderful, I could go on and on,but I think the only way you can get the feel of this fine hotel, is to make sure you stay here if you ever go to Golden CO. Oh yeah,I almost forgot, you can bring your pet cat or dog with you, as they are pet friendly.I travel a lot every year,And I have stayed in some really nice,and some really bad places,but the golden has that certain something that makes you want to come back,again,and again.

It treated us so well last year when my husband was hurt in a biking accident.

This year, I asked Crystal for directions to the Dinosaur Ridge Visitors Center near Morrison and the directions were perfect! I had no trouble getting there at all. Go to this hotel.

I think what a previous reviewer wrote about the attention to detail is very true. A nice bathroom right off of the fitness center so you don't have to go back to yor room, free bottled water in the rooms (not $5!!), chocolate brown microsuede duvet covers, free high speed internet access in the room, an MP3 player hook up on the clock radio, and a fireplace in a cozy lobby with leather furniture for lounging. Staff are very nice and hospitable. One of the managers even asked me as I was leaving the fitness center if I was enjoying my stay and if there was anything I needed. And the hotel is in an excellent location, right in historic downtown. I don't think that the hotel should be dinged entirely for a poor restaurant (see two reviews ago). I had an omlette at breakfast and thought it was fine. But I also tend to avoid hotel restaurants like the plague, unless it's one that has a particularly stellar reputation.
