The bed was comfy (although their pillows are a bit over stuffed, my neck was a little tweaked by it). The bathroom was a moderate size and was really clean. They have turn down service in the evenings with 2 free bottles of water and ice delivered to your room. We went to the bar area downstairs- the prices are comparable to the rest of the area. The service is fast and courteous. They make great mojitos! We had breakfast in the restaurant- it was good (we both had the buffet $17 pp). The omelet station was great, and the chef was really sweet. We also had room service for breakfast (used the cards placed in the room for early morning room service ordering). It came right on time- and was really good. The room service agent was great! The hotel is a little ways away from the metro station- but is in walkable distance to many restaurants, bars and shops. There is a CVS just across the circle if you forget to pack anything. Taxis are CHEAP in DC- we were amazed- it was $20 including tip from Washington Reagan Airport to the hotel. It was about $7 for a cab to the Holocaust Museum. We had an amazing time and would definitely stay here again. The only things that we saw that needed improving/upgrading is the drop ceiling above the front desk (maybe paint it or replace it) and the wall covering around the front desk and on back door needs replacing. The front desk is one of the first things guests see at the hotel- and should be 100%. The restaurant needs to be remodeled- but that inst such a big deal.

We did not eat at the hotel so we can't speak for the restaurant but it was a wonderful hotel and a perfect location if you are looking for a reasonable price for a great location to see all the DC sights. And one of the best features? Parking was only $25 for self-park and it included in/out for the 24 hours. That was the cheapest parking I could find in the area.

Parking available under the hotel-great value at $25 a night with plenty of availability and nice wide parking spaces! Could take car in and out for excursions with no hassle at all. Direct access also from parking area to hotel lifts. Lovely, spacious and clean rooms with a refrigerator which Ive noticed not all similar hotels provide. Staff couldn't be more helpful, nothing was too much for them. Swimming pool fantastic with hotel towels on hand.

Rooms were clean and of an excellent size especially given the great price we paid. Staff were friendly and helpful and overall the location is pretty good. It's not far to walk down to popular tourist spots. I recommend the hop on hop off bus in Washington as points of interest are well spread out. We ate at the hotel restaurant for dinner and found it quite good value. Room service the first day was excellent. For those who find breakfast more than what you need try the West Wing diagonally over the road excellent value.", "title": "Great place to stay!", "user": "RescueRider", "date": "September 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 175105166}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "Would highly recommend this hotel and if ever back in Washington would definitely stay here.", "title": "Surprising value", "user": "emorga", "date": "August 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 175037356}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Washington DC"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 52, "average": 144, "very good": 453, "terrible": 60, "excellent": 449}, "aka": "Washington Plaza Hotel Washington Dc", "slim_ranking": 0.248062015504, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}}
