Absolutely wonderful experience. Like all the other posters, the hotel is incredibly dark. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was a very small selection of high quality breads and pastries - no hot food. The location was perfect, right in the centre of Porto. It's a very unique experience and we got a fantastic rate of \u20ac80/night from octopustravel.", "title": "Cute Little Boutique Hotel", "user": "ymous", "date": "October 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 84327779}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010", "text": "I went to Porto with my husband and my son. Having read all the reviews, we were prepared for the unusual! The designer of this hotel took the theatrical theme to the very extreme. Even the carpets were printed with a curtain motif. It was like being in a theatre but the lights never came on! So we were permanently in subdued lighting - fun but tricky and sometimes a little frustrating. We were greeted with friendly and efficient staff who went out of there way to help us to enjoy our holiday. The restaurant was intimate and relaxing and the food and service very good. The location was brilliant, close to the river and yet near to the fantastic Majestik cafe and other sights and restaurants. The bedrooms were very relaxing, the beds comfortable and clean but there were surprises! The bathroom in our superior room had a glass wall looking directly onto the bath! By day two I had succeeded in not trying to walk through this wall and used the door instead. Again the lighting here was subdued and this would have been fine if only we had been able to increase the lighting when we needed it - for dressing, looking for socks etc. The gold sink was delightful to behold but not easy to wash your face in without moving away from the bowl slightly! So, some design flaws here but overall we had a lovely time and a memorable experience. Porto is a fascinating place, especially by the river. In the Majestik cafe we enjoyed the best service we have ever received (twice).", "title": "Memorable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MARYW1972", "date": "October 14, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 83444696}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was a bit unsure when booking this hotel with respect to the bathroom reviews but liked the look of it. Booked it and glad I did. The hotel is different to your normal run of the mill hotel. A bit dark which adds to the theatre feel. The furniture is unique in the public areas and the place is full of smoked glass. The staff were very good and knowledgable - nothing too much for them. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable and the shower room spacious. The area is very central - nearby metro station and a short taxi ride from the main train station.", "title": "Great location, helpful staff", "user": "Fio26", "date": "October 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 82467584}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "The hotel is a new design hotel in Porto. The hotel is nice and very centrally located but extremely dark, infact far too dark. When you walk in the corridors in the evenings you might as well switch your phone on just to make some light. The rooms are very dark despite the 6 lights available so not ideal for putting make up on or shaving. There is no privacy in the bedrooms with bath tub since all the walls are made by glass or mirrors so as much as it could be fun for a couple, if you are travelling with friends or even better colleagues it's definitely not a great idea as you can't have a shower without being seeing from the other person wherever in the room the other person might be and you can't even be in the loo without being seeing.", "title": "New, nice but too dark and not ideal for friends or family", "user": "Valentina_review", "date": "October 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 82433235}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Northern Portugal", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 12, "average": 55, "very good": 226, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 299}, "slim_ranking": 0.0777777777778, "description": "The Hotel Teatro arose from the spot where the Baquet Theatre was inaugurated in 1859. A hundred and fifty-one years later, the unique, refined and bohemian environment of the Theatre has been revived here in a hotel. The Reception represents a box office, where each guest receives a ticket to access their room. The Restaurant and Bar have become the new Palco and Plateia, offering creations for a discerning palate. The inner courtyard is a versatile garden or a quiet and secluded haven from the tumult of the city. The 74 comfortable rooms and suites are colored in gold and bronze, and the gym on the top floor transforms the Hotel into a true arena for action and relaxation."}
