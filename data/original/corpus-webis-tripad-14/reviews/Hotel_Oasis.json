We paid extra for a \"courtyard view\", room and found this dull. Reported this and asked for a change but \"no chance\" was the reply. No-one had complained about our room in the last 3 years!! Stayed 4 nights but could not recommend it. Bathroom smelled damp. Used all lights during the day in a bid to brighten bedroom up. Quite depressing in the afternoon. Part of a tree was cut down by the management in a bid to help but little difference. Wardrobe space very poor.

We had room 11 on the ground floor which smelt of damp (or something), had marked walls and was in need of decoration and refurbishment although the bathroom was in a reasonable state. As we walked past reception having deposited our luggage, the man behind the desk asked us if we liked our room and before we could answer he said 'because the hotel is full and I cannot change it.' Breakfast is completely self service, including make your own tea/coffee by boiling the kettle. On a positive note, the hotel is quite central for both the station and the beach and is also in a very quiet location. Our standards are high and we felt let down this year.
