You either need to take a taxi (more about that later) or a 30 minute walk through a dirty, iffy neighborhood to get to the tourist attractions. They seem to get a lot of tour buses and conventions at this hotel. Unlike most other hotels we stayed in Spain, the rooms are carpeted. The rooms were of an adequate size but the AC was not great. There is a pool and an antiquated gym. We did not eat at the Occidental so cannot comment on food except that they did bring up a complimentary little snack of sherry and cold salmon which was quite good.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "beekay458", "date": "July 11, 2007", "id": 8103618}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We had a very unpleasant incident with a cab driver who physically assaulted a member of our party by pushing him when we complained that he drove us all over the city to jack up the fare.
