The service on occasions was extremely poor. We arrived a little too early to check in so the receptionist promised to call my mobile when it was ready - three hours later still no call so we went back to reception to be told our room had been ready for two and a half hours! Not a good start. Twice we had to request laundry detergent for our room; on the second occasion I noticed a list of jobs requested by guests at reception, many with \"third request\" next to them - even things like \"toilet not working properly\".

We were very happy on the whole - the rooms may not be very big but they are very comfortable and nicely decorated - we were very happy. The bathroom was very nicely designed and the balcony with spa (ie jacuzzi bath) was huge. The lagoon pool was great -very important since it was jelly fish season so no sea swimming. Yes, there are quite a few kids but there is also another pool which is a bit quieter. The other pool was called the Tranquility or Serenity Pool but despite the name that doesn't mean that children aren't actually allowed, which is a shame. It might be a good idea to make that one child-free since the main pool is more geared towards families. The service was fine but our only complaint was the limited times for eating. The pool side menu was not available late afternoon and at that time it was too early for dinner. Dinner ends around 9.30 and we were caught out when we wanted to eat around 10.00. Most restaurants in Palm Cove were closing then and we had to order room service which was also operating on a very minimal menu after 10.00 pm. The four restaurants in front of the hotel are not actually part of the hotel, only one of them. Nunu was very good, as was Vivo (further down the main street). The restaurant at the Angsana is nice - the only one right on the beach as there is no road in between but the food is not quite as good as Nunu.", "title": "Loved it!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "traveller1968", "date": "February 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4454079}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "I would definitely recommend a stay at the Outrigger as it is a really good price for the quality you get.", "title": "From a Young Couple", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Sydneyite", "date": "February 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4417113}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "We stayed three nights in midMay at the Outrigger as part of our grand tour around eastern Australia.
