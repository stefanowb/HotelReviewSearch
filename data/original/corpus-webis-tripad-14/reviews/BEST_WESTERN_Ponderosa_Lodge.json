The rooms are very large and have a great view. The pool is nice but needed to be cleaned from pine needles. The hot tub is very large and wonderful. Breakfast included hard boiled eggs, Belgian waffles, and cereal. The hotel has a lot of land and is back in the pines with llamas right near the hotel. The mountains are close and the town is fun and friendly. My only downside to this visit was the Black Crater forest fire which was nearing town and making me a little nervous about possibly evacuating! But that was not the hotels fault. ....:) We did end up staying and still enjoyed our visit and are continuing on keeping updated on the fire and it's proximity to the town.

On the other side of the llama coral is the highway, which is far enough away it doesn't intrude, although it shows you Sisters biggest problem traffic.
