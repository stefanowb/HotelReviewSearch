All parts of the city are extremely accessible outside the hotel either by walking or by grabbing the tram which was incredibly easy. The concierge can sell you a day pass in the lobby for 7 euro along with passes to any museum or attraction you might want to see.

Luckily I had confirmation of my booking with me so after a short wait in reception we checked in to our room. They were busy renovating the hotel when we stayed and although we got a room that had not recently been refurbished it was still great. The room was large and clean, the bed was huge and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful and breakfast was great, plenty of choice and served hot. The hotel is in a great location and very close to the town centre. There is a pub located inside of the hotel which we had a few drinks in and we thought it had a very nice atmosphere. Overall had a great trip and I would definitely go back, 5 stars from me.", "title": "Absolutely amazing.", "user": "Capricorn23", "date": "October 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142207970}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012", "text": "Overall a great stay.
