The rooms are basic, but we've always found them to be clean. The bath has a nightlight, a nice touch. There is noise through the walls and from the hall, but no worse than most hotels.

As always, I was traveling with a dog, and the Comfort Inn Ocean's Edge is very pet friendly and has a great area to walk a dog, going right down to the water. No problem there. The room was clean, as usual, and the breakfast was great---the usual waffles, eggs, bagels. cereal, muffins, etc. However, I have smoke allergies, so must book a non smoking room. The plaque on the door SAID it was non smoking, but when I went in, I knew someone had been smoking there. It was very strong, as was the sickly sweet chemical smell they had used to try to mask it. Plus, there was a cig. burn on the rug---more evidence. But, it was late, I was tired, and the hotel had many guests, so I just opened up the window, put on the fan, and endured it. I woke up with itchy eyes and a sore throat. If I had been staying for more than one night I would have insisted on a room change, and if having a non smoking room is important to you, be sure to stress that when you check in.
