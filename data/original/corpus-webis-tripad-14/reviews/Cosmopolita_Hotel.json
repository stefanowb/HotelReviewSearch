No \"door hangers\" for fluffy robes and wet coats etc! odd.... but still a nice base and a lovely bar (the glass) to crash into at night when your are sight weary and in need of a good stiff drink! Walking distance to Trevi (10 minutes max), Vatican (35mins) Colosseum (15 mins max)....which give you an idea of its central location. It does not serve food in the evening at the moment so venture out and visit the local restaurants.......out of hotel, turn right, cross the road and head down the little side street opposite the hotels' corner and down a dingy street you will find restaurant abruzzo.... filled with noisy, singing joyous priests tucking into lots of vino tinto and excellent roast lamb and rosemary roasted potatoes! A sight to behold! Breakfasts are good with usual continental fayre..... don't use the coffee machine though..... ask the waitress for a capuccino / espresso and they are infinately better than the machine \"pods\"!
