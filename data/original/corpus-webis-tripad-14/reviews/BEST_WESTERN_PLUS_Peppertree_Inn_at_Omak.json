The inside furnishings were comparable to the Hilton we stayed at in Hawaii. A plasma screen TV, double bowl-sinks and sleek furniture completed the look. Very nice breakfast and pool also. Central Omak location, close to the Walmart. The staff seemed friendly and helped us get our wireless internet connection working. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay at the Omak Best Western Peppertree, and will be sure to return on our next visit.", "title": "Great Best Western", "user": "dogbone1002000", "date": "February 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 13478347, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Modern room furnishings, overall look of hotel", "disliked": "\u2014 The views outside are of a shopping complex"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Omak"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 10, "very good": 46, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 80}, "aka": "Best Western Omak", "slim_ranking": 0.25}
