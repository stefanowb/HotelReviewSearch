The room and the complex were very quiet. I got a walk in rate of around $45, which was better than anything else in the area for sure. They have free coffee and danishes for breakfast and free newspaper in the morning. I have rarely stayed at a hotel with as many free tv channels - HBO, Showtime, etc. - it surprised me. The service was extra friendly and helpful, and I got a LOT of airline miles with \"my\" airline for signing up for their program, which encouraged me to stay the next night at another RRI (but in Florida).", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "Muddoctor", "date": "February 22, 2005", "id": 3215272}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Miserable stay.", "text": "Cons: It is a motel, so all the doors face outside. I only had one bath towel - I could have asked for another I suppose but I didn't. They don't give free shampoo and they don't have hairdryers. (I wish I knew that in advance).
