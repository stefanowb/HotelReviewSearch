The self contained 2 bedroom apartment with two bathrooms we stayed in was well equipped, very clean and tastefully furnished.

Within walking was the Kawana Waters Shopping Centre with a large variety of outlets. The Managers were very pleasant and helpful with anything we asked of them. Undercover car parking was supplied with each apartment. As this was my second visit to Beachside Resort, I would recommend it to my friends.

He booked a one bedroom apartment which was roomy, located near a beach, surf club and major shopping centre, however the decore was very date and tired looking. Our major complaint with this place was there was no main bathroom available for our use, the door was locked. We did enquire why and were told we would have to pay more if we wanted to use the bath....so all we had was an ensuite with shower, pity as a couple of bubble baths together were high on our agenda. I found this to be totally 'out of the norm' from any other place we have stayed. I would say the main reason was possibly cost cutting with the cleaning. Pity we hadn't been told this prior to booking. As mentioned, the decor was really dated...probably early 80's, the sofa's, bedspread and pictures on the wall were all very aged. I'm sure it wouldn't cost a great deal to update them. The pillows were like rocks as well. I wouldn't go back here, or recommend it to couples wanting to snuggle up in nice surroundings.", "title": "Forget about a romantic bubble bath!", "user": "greigy", "date": "May 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 106920466}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We enjoyed our stay and did not want to leave.
