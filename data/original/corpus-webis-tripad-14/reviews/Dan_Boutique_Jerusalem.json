Breakfast is wonderful from the breads to fruits and salads (yes, there's fish, eggs, cheese, and dairy but we're vegetarian and vegan). Service is relaxed in a good way and friendly. I left my iPad at the bar and there were layers of security to retrieve it from security, including ID and paper signing - excellent system! Amit at the front desk, as well as the women training with him, are as good as it gets (I hope I correctly remember his name). The view from the suite rooms is beautiful and the windows open to enjoy August's cool night air (as well as street noise including the Ramadan call to prayer). We noticed many America guests among French, Mexican, and other nationalities. Jacof the taxi driver tries to be friendly; he drove us to the airport. The walk to the German Colony is a delight. King David Street past parks is always an easy walk. We stocked the refrigerator with fruit, water, and beer from the nearby store, and enjoyed drinks from the hotel bar as we used free Internet in the lobby.
