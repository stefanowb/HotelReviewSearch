I was travelling alone and the room was a bit small but it was perfect for me. It had all the amenities including a/c, iron with board, mini bar, tv etc..plus my room (#22) had a french balcony overlooking the street which was a nice touch. Bathroom was modern and everything was very clean and crisp. TV had about 20 channels everything from sports to movies to sit coms - but of course you're in paris so I don't know how much TV watching you should be doing. They also have a laundry service but there are dry cleaners in the neighbourhood. There is also a butcher, grocery store, bakery all within 5 minute walking distance of the hotel.

The reviews were just a little too glowing and the price was just a little too reasonable. Like they say, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Well not this time. It was that good, and then some. In fact, in all my forty-five years, I have never stayed at a hotel that cared more or tried harder than this hotel did, and I would be remiss not to share my experience with other Trip Advisor readers. I arrived for a two day stay in Paris with my wife, our three young children and our nanny. I had asked for two adjoining rooms, one with a king bed for me and my wife and the other with four single beds for the children and nanny. Not an entirely easy request, especially in Europe, but the Hotel Residence Foch understood the request perfectly and the rooms, which were beautifully appointed and well-decorated, were great, as was the staff. These people REALLY care. And not like in a super-expensive hotel where you\u2019re paying them to care. I mean, they truly want to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. They want you to be happy, they want you to feel comfortable, they are there for anything you need. But nowhere was this commitment to customer service tested as much as it was upon our departure for the Paris train station. We asked the front desk clerk, Isabelle, to call us a cab for six people (again, not an easy task, especially in Paris) and she was told it would be five minutes. But when ten minutes passed with no cab she called again and was told another four minutes. Then another ten. Then we were faced with the awful realization that we had surely missed our train. Around this time, the hotel owner, Nelly, showed up and was greeted by this frantic American husband and father at his wits end. But instead of shrugging her shoulders and letting the cab company take all the blame (as any other hotel owner would, especially after the bill had been paid!) Nelly immediately sprung into action and went above and beyond to an extent that fully explains why this hotel stands head and shoulders above the rest. Despite the fact that she was on her way home, and that she had a husband and two young children waiting for her there, this amazing woman escorted me to a nearby train office to try to exchange my tickets, assured me free rooms for the night if we were unable to do so, and, ultimately, paid for new train tickets for me and my family when all else proved futile. I realize my story is unique and I hope that nobody else has this same experience, but I cannot stress enough how much this hotel cares about its customers and it is reflected in every single aspect of their day to day operations \u2013 from the wonderful recommendations they give, to the lovely breakfast they serve, to the beautifully tasteful d\u00e9cor you see throughout the hotel. Words like \u201cgem\u201d and \u201cfind\u201d are thrown around far too often in our society, but nowhere does it hold more truth than it does here.

Several excellent non-touristy restaurants/bars can be found nearby and both metro stations provide excellent links to the city. The hotel offers 2 types of room (standard and deluxe). However, if you check their website the deluxe rooms range from those which are slightly larger than the standard to those with balconies, Eiffel Tower views and even one with a huge terrace. Perhaps it\u2019s obvious but if you pay for a deluxe room I\u2019d advise to e-mail in advance and request the best room to avoid disappointment. The basic deluxe room was absolutely lovely and I have no complaints but it\u2019s difficult not to feel a bit cheated when you know there are some amazing rooms for the same price!

It has been 7 years since I last visited Paris and to tell you the truth I had very mixed feelings when my husband told me that he had organized a week-end in Paris for my Birthday, I thought that I would much prefer a trip to Barcelona, but how wrong was I. We flew from Shannon to Paris with Ryanair and what was suppose to be 1h30min flight became 1h10min thanks to great flying conditions. From Beauvais airport there is a bus to Port Maillot and from there it is a very short walk to the Hotel. From the minute you step out from the bus and take first breath of Paris air you know that you are somewhere different and magical :)Although it was nearly 11pm by the time we made it to the hotel we were greated by a very nice receptionist, check in was very fast and smooth. We were given our key and shown to the elevator as our room was on the 4th floor. Hotel itself is very small, with narrow staircase and tiny elevator, but myself and 6'3 husband and suitcase didn't have any problem to fit in:) As my husband told me that he got exellent price from hotel's web site I didn't expect much from it, but I was wrong again:)Yes, room is on the small side but it has everything you need and bathroom is quiet big. In the room there are huge windows so you can open them in the morning and smell fresh bread and croissants:), there is flat screen TV, air conditioner and ironing board and what I liked the most - room has Paris character, you know straight away that this room could be only in Paris and nowhere else in the world. In the morning we had breakfast in the dinning room downstairs, it is continental but we definitely didn't leave the room hungry:) What I liked the most about this hotel - it's location, it is close enough to all tourist sites, only 2 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe, but far enough to be able to blend in with locals and it is located in a very quiet district as well. Also there are alot of great restaurants near by, the best we tried was a sea food restaurant (sorry can't remember the name) at the end of rue de Malakoff, 2 min walk from hotel towards Port Maillot with a great price of \u20ac37 for 5 course set menu (including oysters and foie-gras!!!) Staying in this hotel gave us such a great energy every morning and high spirit to go out and enjoy every minute of our trip and coming back in the evening felt like coming home:) It's been nearly 3 weeks since we came back but myself and my husband still raving about it and I am sure all our friends are tired to listen about it :) and we plan to come back in a very near future. When visiting Paris again we will only stay in this hotel, unless we won a lotto and could afford to stay in George V, I would love to try it out:) My only advise to anyone visiting Paris - take it easy, start your exploring of the city by just sitting outside one of numerous cafes with a cup of coffee or a beer, breathing Paris air and absorbing this fantastic atmosphere around you, watching people passing by and loving every minute that you spend in this fabulous city.", "title": "Perfect Location, great experience!!!", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "nadiasmyth", "date": "August 19, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8451612, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, quietness", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed in Residence Foch for valentines day in Feb 07 - location was perfect, staff were great.

We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready. The staff allowed us to leave all our bags (there were a lot of them) at the hotel until the room was ready. The room was small (it is Paris), but was extremely clean and comfortable. The staff were excellent in advising how to get around and where to go. It is close to the Metro, and close to the shuttle to the airport but not the closest to the main attractions of the city - if you are planning to walk. A good 20-30 minute walk (though it was a great way to end the day for us) back to the hotel. It is on a side street so it is quiet at night - though at the same time if you are alone could be a little eery. Morning breakfast buffet was great.
