Great if you need just a place to sleep before or after flights but there is no place to go otherwise. Inside it's a nice looking hotel and the rooms also look upgraded. Beds were comfortable. They seem to be having a little problem with maintenence. We stayed twice (once coming once going) and both times the toilet malfunctioned. Some of the lights flickered - not sure why, the coffee maker was non-functional, and it was a very long wait for hot water to come out of the shower.

I understand that accidents happen, but I would expect that the hotel would address the problem, instead of refusing to talk to me about it. DO NOT TRUST THESE GUYS WITH YOUR CAR!

However, every time someone used the toilet, my husband had to lift the tank lid and stop it from running. Secondly, the air conditioning didn't work well and when it did turn on, it made an immense amount of noise. (When we mentioned this, we were told that the air conditioner had to \"reset\" once in a while.) Nonetheless, we got a few hours sleep.

This problem apparently occurred when the car was moved on the night we stayed at the hotel. However, we were NEVER notified that there was a problem with the car. Even if we had already left, a courtesy call would have been in order as the hotel had our cell phone number and could have easily reached us. So, we drove the 90 minutes home in the rain. When asked about the problem with the window, the night manager simply offered a perplexed look. Obviously, the window malfunction was not their fault but a call to us was certainly in order.
