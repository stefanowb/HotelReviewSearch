The owner, Tom, is a very nice man who tries to be helpful and, in fact, did help us out repeatedly by making site-seeing suggestions, providing a discount card for museum entry (and saving a couple of Euros matters for us Americans these days)i, helping us out when our cell phone charger didn't work, calling us a taxi, etc. etc. He's a fan of Marvin Gaye -- who lived in the nearby coastal town of Ostende towards the end of his life (who knew?) -- and there was a special Marvin Gaye menu posted in the restaurant. that looked like fun.

In the end I went behind the bar with the receptionist, who did everything it seemed, and chose some bottled beer myself. This hotel was very well situated, as others have said but is let down by staff lacking in professionalism together with an owner who is somewhat Basil Fawlty like (he spent 10 long mins the next morning explaining that he was unable to open the bar because he couldn't get the staff, given their holiday requirements) On another occasion all might have gone perfectly well but in my experience this is a hotel to avoid.", "title": "Good location but poor service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Reverberation", "date": "September 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 39704435}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Really enjoyed our stay.
