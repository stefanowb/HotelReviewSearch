After traveling extensively through Bali and the southern tip of the island I was very shocked to see the prices of food, WIFI, laundry, gifts, tours, and even ice cream at this hotel. The prices are almost the exact same if not MORE than what I would pay on the US, Europe, or in Australia at a resort there. I could easily leave the resort and get an American breakfast or a filling, beautifully cooked Balinese meal for $3.00 usd which would literally cost FOUR TIMES that much in the Holiday Inn. I'm sure the Holiday Inn says it is only for guest convenience however I have had my fare share of eating in Balinese hotel restaurants and they are drastically cheaper than at this place. Even at swanky upscale restaurants on Legian Street and in Ubud I did not pay near as much for the one meal I had here. Even two bintang beers at the hotel bar \"Evny\" cost $9.00 usd when you could get two at the mini-mart down the street for a little more than 2 bucks and crack them open on the beach for a better experience, nothing I can \"envy\" about that. Heck, we went to Starbucks and got two iced mochas for only 7usd. The only reason why we got beers at the bar is because they don't serve mixed drinks past 10 or 11.
