In addition to my very large, excellent lamb shank, my companions enjoyed a marvelous fish dinner and a large, varied ploughman's platter.

Sadly we were rather disappointed - a smallish Greek salad for over \u00a36 doesn't even come accompanied with a morsel of bread, and the pies & chips my parents ordered were soggy and the meat felt very low in quality. I would expect this standard of food from a motorway service cafe or similar, and at half the price.", "user": "Lakesman95", "date": "January 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 148516751}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 1, "very good": 4, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 5}}
