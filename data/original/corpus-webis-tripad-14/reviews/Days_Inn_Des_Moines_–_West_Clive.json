Fridge made horrible noise. Floor by bed had sinkhole. Shower floor felt like it would cave in. No guide for tv. Most channels said unavailable. Wifi connection horrible. Pool full of leaves and water very murky. Leaves not netted the 2 days we were there. Arrived back in the room from our evening out and the air condition unit had died. Called front desk, answered by a rude man telling me I should have called earlier and there was nothing he could do. I exp. we were out all evening and it WAS working. Hot, sweaty non night sleep!
