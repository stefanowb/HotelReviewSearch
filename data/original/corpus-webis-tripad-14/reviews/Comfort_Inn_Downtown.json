The room was really large with a very comfortable bed, lots of floor space, walk-in closet area and a fridge. The AAA rate, booked through the hotel was $108 each weekend night but this included breakfast. Breakfast was awesome - biscuits and gravy, waffles, and boiled eggs, along with the usual continental breakfast fare. Attendants kept it well-stocked and clean, even though there was a high school band staying there one day (and teens can eat!!). Parking is $6 daily in a lot under the hotel. Just a couple blocks from the trolley, but you can walk downtown (though even on Saturday night it was a bit isolated, which made me nervous).

National Civil Rights Museum, Sun Studio (a great tour), a ride in a Cinderella carriage, and a Mojo Music Bus Tour were also on our agenda, along with sampling soul food at Fourway and ribs at Rendezvous. I would do all of them again. We are not blues fans, and knew very little of the music or musicians Memphis is famous for, but this was a great orientation.
