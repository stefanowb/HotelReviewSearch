The inside accomodations had a modern, European feel. The room and bathroom were very clean as were all the lines and towels. The bed was extremely comfortable. I had a wonderful night's sleep. The area surrounding the facility was quiet and peaceful and I could not hear any of the other guests. The artwork in the room appeared to be that of a younger child/teen and while good, did not quite fit with the \"vibe\" of the decor. A t.v., refrigerator, hair dryer and ample lighting were all present and working well. The bathroom was large in size and did not leave me feeling cramped as I usually do when staying at an accomodation outside my home. The vent in the bathroom was somewhat noisy but not too much of a bother. There were no tissues in the room but plenty of toilet paper. The Greenporter is a \"green\" hotel. The fact that they're environmentally aware is another plus for this place. The front-desk staff was helpful in directing me to some local beaches. They provided a beach pass after collecting a reasonable deposit which was returned upon my bringing the pass back. The Greenporter's proximity to the downtown area in Greenport is within reasonable walking distance. The continental breakfast found next door in Cuvee's Restaurant was simple but nice and tasty and provided for during resonable morning hours. The front-desk staff and others working at the Greenporter were pleasant and helpful. They helped contribute to making my time out east relaxing and stress-free.", "title": "Enjoyable, relaxing overnight getaway!", "user": "A B", "date": "September 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117607224}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We randomly found this place on our impromptu trip to Greenport.

It is certainly convenient to North Fork at the end of your day, and in great walking distance to a ton of great spots in Greenport. The check in was lovely and the overall amenities in terms of restaurant, breakfast, etc were great. The rooms are dated and therefore dirty. The tile was grungy and the bath towels pretty thin. The carpeting was stained in some areas. The positive is the lovely pool area and new flatscreen tv's. Additionally there is a/c and it's extremely strong. This could be good or bad depending on your preference. The best analogy I can come up with is that if Ikea were to have built a hotel 10 years ago - this is it with new tv's.
