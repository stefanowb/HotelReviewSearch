At first look it appears to be an upscale hotel but there were so many things wrong I would have rather stayed at a Super 8. The bed was so uncomfortable I couldn't even sleep. The view was of a dirty roof. When we stay at a hotel we love to get breakfast in bed. We ordered our room service and the food was so disgusting we couldn't even eat and they over charged us. To top off the worst experience ever, my fianc\u00e9 left his wallet in the room. When we called we were told it wasn't in there. The guy who stayed in the a week later found it and facebooked him that he left it at the front counter for him. When we called to ask again they said no one had turned it in. A couple weeks later we got a letter from the post office that he had a package that was cod. It was his wallet that they had just dropped in a mail box. So not only did they lie to us, they compromised his personal info. So we over paid for horrible food, paid for overnight parking, and had to pay to get his wallet back.
