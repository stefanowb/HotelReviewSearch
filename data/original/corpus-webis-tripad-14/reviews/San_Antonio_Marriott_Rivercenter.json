It does have a 9-screen multiplex movie theater and an IMAX theater, as well as a food court and its own comedy club. The Riverwalk, San Antonio's biggest attraction after the Alamo, is just steps from the hotel entrance -- and the Alamo is one long and one short block away. The hotel itself is large and modern, with a Starbucks in the lobby. Staff were universally courteous and helpful. The exercise room is fairly well equipped, and has a large whirlpool and indoor-outdoor pool. My room, with a king size bed, was not especially large but big enough; the bathroom was modern, and the bed very comfortable. My only complaint was the presence of a few small ants that occasionally could be found creeping along the night tables. The hotel has its own restaurant on the second floor, and a cafe by the pool, but I did not eat at either one and so cannot comment.", "title": "Convenient, comfortable hotel in San Antonio", "user": "Dragonminder", "date": "September 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139398645}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled on business", "text": "As with other reviewers, I appreciated the helpful staff from the front desk to housekeeping.

We had breaks and one lunch (the grilled chicken was excellent) provided by the hotel catering service, and a step was not missed with such a large crowd. The room was nicely appointed, and the free wi-fi access in the lobby was handy (extra cost in the room). Recommend the Maria Mia restaurant (exit hotel at riverwalk, down the steps and you're there) for anyone, and their takeout meals are just as delicious, enough for two, and reasonably priced. The mall with it's Food Court is available, and you can even catch a visit to the Alamo after meetings are concluded. Recommend a boat ride which was fun and cheap, but ask for discounts such as military and senior citizen's. Appreciate the hotel providing taxi estimatefor trip from airport on its website. My cab driver quoted more, but when I told him that wasn't the estimate I got, he took me the most expedient route, and it was right in the range of the estimate, rather than 8-10 dollars more as he had quoted.
