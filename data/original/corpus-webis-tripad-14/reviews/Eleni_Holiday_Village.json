We came across Eleni Village and got advised that it was a brilliant hotel. However, some reviews stated it was not so great, I disagree! In 2009 the hotel shut down for a year to be completely refurbished and you really can see this now as everything is looking so clean and fresh. The reception area is welcoming and well air conditioned, which is much needed in 45 degrees heat!", "title": "Amazing Hotel", "user": "Oxley16", "date": "July 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 72081020}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The rooms are of a good size and has a nice kitchen area. The rooms are cleaned every day except Sundays and are given clean towels as well as bad changing three times a week. The balcony was very spacious and had a nice table and chairs on it too looking out to the pool. The pool was brilliant, and suitable for all although it was like a bath in the heat! There was also no rush for loungers in the morning like most hotels. We were all inclusive and the food was outstanding. Breakfast was ok and basic, nothing to great. However, the lunch pool bar menu is suitable for everyone with fresh hot food. The evening meals again were great, but not a lot of selection for fussy eaters.
