I had requested this room on-line from the Buena Vista Palace Hotel and Spa web-site. When my boyfriend and I arrived at our room, we found what was included in our \"water view\". We were on the first floor viewing the \"No Glass Allowed\" sign for the pools. We did not even have a view of the water. The room had an unpleasant smell (mouldy), many cigarette burns were found on all of the outdoor furniture, and the air conditioning unit was so loud that we had to raise our voices to understand one another. The balconies by the way, are not private. The pictures on their website present them as private, but they're not. When we called the front desk, we asked to speak to a manager about moving to a different room. We were originally told that there were no other Island Water View Suites available. When we asked about an Island View Suite with a resort view, we were also told there were none available. We then asked if it would be possible to move to a down-graded room within the main building. We were told to come to the front desk. When we arrived at the front desk, and spoke with the front desk clerk, we were then offered 2 different island view suites with resort views. We found this interesting, considering we had just been told that none were available. When we asked the desk clerk why we were told originally that no other Island View Suites were available, she apologetically said she was not sure why. We accepted one of the rooms. When we arrived at this new room, the walls had dirty hand-prints on the light switches and the couches. The balcony was covered in bird droppings, and cigarette butts were found on the floor of the balcony as well as on the chairs. Again, the room had a (mouldy) odor. Although the bed was made and new toilet paper was placed on the handle next to the toilet, it appeared that the room had not been cleaned to most other LXR hotel standards. Being that we had just seen another room and we were disappointed, we decided to speak with the manager again. When we presented our complaint we were told that we had already paid for the room and it was not refundable. She did not seem to care about the cleanliness of both rooms that we had viewed, and we were not offered other accommodations.", "title": "Island View Suite - false advertisement", "user": "BabyKatcher", "date": "October 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 45882851}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We travel quite often, and have stayed in many Orlando hotels within the Walt Disney area.

The outside bar was nice and served food, beer, cocktails, etc. Thankfully there were many other young adults and the crowd wasn't either just young families or senior citizens. We hung out at the pool late night two nights and had a blast. A lot of people were swimming very late which was a nice option considering the lights are on all night. Snacks and drinks from the hotel pantry shop were a bit expensive. $3 for a vitamin water is not cheap. We also ate and hung out at Kooks Sports Bar. The first night was fine. However, the second time we had terrible service. We were a party of 3 and even though we were seated with our orders taken two larger parties that came in after us received their food first. One of those parties was even gone long before we got our food. Our waitress was not very friendly. Food was ok. Finally, when we asked the bartender to put a specific sporting event on a tv, he gave us some attitude and catered to some people that came in long after us.
