If you want 5 stars with starched linen napkins in a sterile environment where no one knows your name - stay elsewhere. However, If you want a small resort in a beautiful setting that is very very clean with the most friendly staff where nothing is a hassle please go to Sunset Bungalows. You will not regret it. The managers, Roland and Jenny are lovely and all the staff are fabulous including Ruben the security man who will walk you across the road at night to hail the bus as there is no street lighting. Ruben even chased a bus as I left my glasses on the seat and even managed to stop it and retrieve my glasses. Gee he can run!! Thanks Ruben. Thanks to Annie and Madeline and Roy everyone was great. Being a smaller resort you will meet and become friends with other guests to share your experiences and gather knowledge to make your stay even more enjoyable. There is nothing like meeting new friends by the pool for drinks before heading off to dinner in a group. I read reviews that were not very pleasing and now I know how picky people can be!! What busy road? Mozzies?? if there were mozzies, and we all get them in Australia, use Rid like you do over here!! The resort does have it on hand - just ask. If you do have a complaint, (over what I'll never know) just see Roland or Jenny or the staff and they will take care of it - don't come back and complain. We had an upstairs room which was fantastic, however I have a knee problem and was moved after a few days to a bungalow which was equally fantastic. For those of you who want to know, the difference in the rooms was that we had a very large corner bath and a separate toilet in the bungalow. However bungalows do vary as some do not have the corner bath others have a little kitchenette. The food at the resort is well priced compared to the Waterfront and the Moorings (Moo's) in Port Vila in fact we ended up staying at Sunset for most of our dinners. However both of these eateries were very good, I personally favoured the Moorings over Waterfront as I loved the bar at the Moorings. The seafood basket and burgers at Sunset are great and you can order them for dinner as well if you wish. Everything on the dinner menu seemed great especially the steaks, fish and curry. Breakfast was a good selection from sausages - just ask for them as they are not on the menu, bacon and eggs, omelette which was huge, bircher muesli, and heaps more - the servings were large. Ask for the late its really good and of course you get juice.", "title": "Wonderful!", "user": "rosie1990", "date": "November 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 21962834, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Staff and the rooms.", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing comes to mind. prehaps not so many young people around."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our son and fiance (who stayed elsewhere) decided to have their wedding in Vanuatu at Sunset Bungalows and what a fantastic day it was for all. Jenny did a great job and organised everything. We highly recommend Jenny take care of all the arrangements as you will not be disappointed. The bouquet, floral decorations, local band, lovely cake and wine and dinner and all the little things she did was faultless. Sunset was the most romantic place to marry and for photos. It was totally stress free. I have since told our other 2 sons, when the time arrives, they are also marrying at Sunset! Snorkeling was great in Vanuatu - just like in Nemo the movie. Take bread to feed the fish. The day trip on the Congoola (may have spelt that wrong) is well worth it - approx $110 each including a very good steak and salad BBQ lunch. Great snorkeling. The snorkeling trips by the dive shop at the far end of the water front (next to helicopter flights) was also a great half day tour departing at 1pm. I think it was the best coral reef and fish we experienced - it blew me away and I have snorkeled the at the Great Barrier Reef. It was a quick speed boat trip out to the reef, a guide stayed with you at all times in the water and also pointed out many interesting things that you would never see without being shown by a local. Cost approx $35 and worth every cent. The masks and snorkel are high quality. If you are not confident in the water they supply a floatation to hold on to. I'm not sure of the name of the company, but I think it was Blue ...?? something. Book everything via Annie at the resort. Other guests raved about the half day cultural tour. We went to the Le Meridian for the traditional meal and show which was also very good - held every Thursday night approx $50 each including the show and a cocktail in a coconut which was good value. Vanuatu is not cheap, about the same as Aussie for meals so be prepared. Small items can be quite expensive. You can buy local and imported beers and cold meat etc at the supermarket if you wish. Go the to fruit market on the waterfront as the pineapple, mango and bananas are very sweet and tasty.", "title": "I'm sorry but...", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "xscarletx", "date": "November 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 21687614, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing.."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Intimate, seculded boutique bungalows.
