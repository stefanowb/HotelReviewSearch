As previous reviewers have noted, it is a restored 16th century monastery. The chapel is more than worthy of a view as are some of the many common areas. The hotel sits in a great location in Trestevere, just a short walk to restaurants, shopping, the Tiber and the bridges over the Tiber. The staff is pleasant and accommodating. I stayed in room 123 which was large. It featured both a huge bathtub and separate shower (although I could not get hot water in the shower). There is individual hv/ac in each room which was preset for two of the three days at 23.5 the third day it was turned down to 21 and try as I might, I could never get it to change. These glitches in amenities were not enough for me to reach staff about, I just moved on. The breakfast, included in the cost of the room, was a great way to start the day. The hotel has free wifi in the lobby.", "title": "An Oasis in Rome", "user": "sbenjamen", "date": "December 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188115967}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here for 2 nights while in Rome for business and thought it was a terrific hotel.

The hotel is located in the Trastevere neighborhood which is across the Tiber river. You can walk out of the hotel and down a street with tons of low key wine bars, restaurants and shops, but this isn't central Rome. This worked for me and I appreciated being a bit off the tourist beaten path but wouldn't be ideal if you expect to walk out of your room and see the Colosseum.", "title": "Great place to stay", "user": "DGowzer", "date": "November 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185763948}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lovely hotel and wonderful staff", "text": "Overall a lovely and unique hotel that's well worth the price.", "user": "George R", "date": "November 18, 2013", "id": 185126818}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Absolutely loved this place.
