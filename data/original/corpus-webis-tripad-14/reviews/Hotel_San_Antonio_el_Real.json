This was my second stay here. A major appeal for this property is the easy parking. The tradeoff is that you must walk 10-15 minutes to reach the town center. Or you could use a taxi. Anyway, driving in the center of Segovia is only for locals or the fool hearty. Our beds were comfy and the breakfast was very good. We could have use better lighting for reading and the room temperature adjustments were a bit finicky but the service was terrific.
