The first shock was the loud techno muic playing in the reception area. Now I am in my 50s so this could just be me being older and not expecting this. The receptionist was very \"come day go day\" and not really interested in the fact that the first room we were offered was on the first floor above a cafe and the music was very loud even with the windows closed. We were eventually upgraded to a suite also on the first floor, as this was the only room available. This room was extremely dark with low level lighting and no chance of getting any increase in lighting. The safe was not attached to anything and could be lifted and taken out of the room with no effort. The hotel is on the junction of 3 very busy roads, opposite the bus station and has the local tram system going both ways. There is a huge amount of constant traffic rumbling past and the double glazing system does not work so you can only plug your ears to block out the sound. Unfortunately, I had left mine at home but I did have some cotton wool and this provided some relief. Things are not helped by the Traffic Police who turn up about 07:00 and start blowing their whistles in the middle of the traffic in an effort to maintain some sanity. The buffet meals are adequate and the staff in the dining room are plesant. There is free wi-fi but it very slow and I think the free intermational calls are so can ring home and ask someone to get you out of there!", "user": "Shazmar", "date": "October 19, 2011", "id": 119487738}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Avoid.

As a female solo traveller I would expect that having pre-paid for my room I would be guaranteed a room on arrival. Silly me. On arrival the receptionist casually informed me that the hotel was full and that they were sending me by taxi to their \"nearby\" sister hotel. The taxi was at my expense and was actually a 25 minute journey - right out of town. I had picked the hotel for its central location. This sister hotel was miles away, bleak, gloomy, empty, dark and smoky. All in all a miserable, unsettling experience.

The hotel is only 200m from the Train Station with the only downside being about a 15-20 minute walk to get to the town centre which is a bit arduous in parts as is generally uphill. Doesn't mean the hotel feels 'out of the way' though and is brilliantly located for Belgrades many bars and nightclubs (8 minute walk to the Port Side which seems to be the place for the trendiest Serbs to hang out).

I stayed in Design Mr President for buisness 9-13 April. Having stayed in over 200 hotels while on buisness over the last 10 years I never came across such a gem as Mr. President. This place rocks and is..well.......not boring like most hotels! I was bit shocked when I arrived because the hotel does not look very \"Design\" from the outside. Once you enter you know you are in a stylish place - sculptures and all else. I was first given the room on the first floor (cannot remember President's name over the bed but he was not Jelzin!) overlooking the backyard and somewhat noisy, so asked to be relocated. Staff at the reception was professional beyond any world standards. They very promptly relocated me to the 6th floor (with President Roosevelt, I think it was room 601). Massive apartment, not the room in fact. Amazingly comfortable bed, bathroom very large and cleaner than you can imagine. Bathrobe, slippers (in pink and white for her and him!), coffee, tea, minibar, free international calls (not within Serbia though, not sure why?), free internet and buffet breakfast and supper. I do agree with someone commenting here that free supper is the same every night which for business traveller staying there for a week is bit repetitive. After walking up the hill last Sunday in a heat (not snow, not sure which is worse!) I worked out the quickest way to the Old Town is tram number 2 which stops just outside the hotel and takes you to Kalemegdan Park.

The rooms were nice and comfortable, though a bit nosy because of the traffic outside. In the bathroom the soap bottle was empty, and not refilled during my two days. It's a very good hotel, but the price is also higher. One negative thing was that when I checked out, someone else had put a bill from the restaurant on my room, but when I explained it wasn't mine and I asked them to compare the signature on the receipt with the one in my passport, it was all ok, but I think they should have better control of putting bills on the rooms.
