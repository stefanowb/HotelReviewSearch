Cab drivers cannot enter unless they have been summoned by a hotel patron. When you leave, they take your room number. In a way I guess it\u2019s invasive, but it\u2019s a safety measure for sure.

The answer is yes- the electricity is exactly the same as you will find in the US- you can plug in your cell phone or whatever other electronics you use.
