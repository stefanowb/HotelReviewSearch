To top off our visit we were welcomed into the new year with a delicious breakfast of scrambled eggs with lobster and fresh tyhme. (people asked why the eggs were so yellow and our hosts said they come fresh each day from across the street) The breakfast was started with small pancakes that were mixed with ricotta cheese for a light texture and a fresh, warm fruit compote.

However, I take an annual class at La Conner Art Workshops and the house I normally rent is just too big for me, so I decided to give the Queen a try for five nights in July. Shelly, the innkeeper, is a delight and her breakfasts are fabulous. She buys everything from nearby farms, so it is all fresh, organic and seasonal. Fresh berries, peaches, and to die for waffles. I stayed in the spacious Hong Kong room, with a nice view of nearby farms, fields and sunrises. HUGE private bathroom with a comfy big old tub made my end of the day painting aches and pains float away. Decor is ecletic with great antiques and touches of gold throughout. Wonderful fireplace; can only imagine it in the winter.
