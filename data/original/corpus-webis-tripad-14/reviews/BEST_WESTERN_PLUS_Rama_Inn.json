When we walked in to register we must have looked a bit windswept because the lady at the front desk took 2 steps back like we frightened her, she quickly gave us our room key and never mentioned they served breakfast each morning. The breakfast has muffins, fruit, cereal, eggs and bisquits w/gravy. There was no bacon, sausage available. We found out about breakfast when we went downstairs later and we asked the gentleman behind the desk for the evening shift about it. The man who works the desk on the evening shift wasn't properly dressed all 3 days we were there, wore the same shirt and it was not ironed, very wrinkled so I'm surprised he wasn't sent home and asked to change into proper attire. As the evening progressed I came downstairs several times to find him smoking cigarettes out in the front of the hotel, not real professional for a Best Western in my opinion. We stayed for 3 nights, hotel was full but very quiet. The room is a bit dated, decor doesn't match well but is comfortable. Another thing that stood out regarding this hotel not being up to BW standards is the front of the hotel hasn't been maintained well. There are 2 bowed benches in front for customers to sit on and they are about to fall apart, the trash can wasn't emptied the whole time we stayed there and it was filled to the top, garbage overflowing and was attracting bees and flies. The hotel keeps the front door wide open and I noticed a bee flying around the lobby. There were some flowers in several pots but they hadn't been manicured or watered for a very long time, the dirt was cracked it was so dry. When we returned to the hotel each day I noticed the bath tub had not been washed out nor had an empty bottle of shampoo been removed from the tub caddy. We also found a empty tampon wrapper in the bathroom trash can on the day we checked in. I think they can do much better than this, we stay at BW a lot and this one is below standard.", "title": "Not up to Best Western standards", "user": "fromthemomma", "date": "September 10, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 117908806}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "We chose this hotel for the pool and because it had a good rating on Tripadvisor.
