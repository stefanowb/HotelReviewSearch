The views are great (Not at all dominated by the airport as others have said) and the seafront area is fabulous to walk along, there was even a mainly sandy beach part in front of the hotel. We enjoyed watching the wind surfers taking off into the air and never saw a cloud in all 4 days while it was snowing back in Cheshire! The pools weren't open because of the time of year. Rooms very clean and spacious with separate toilet to the bathroom which is useful as a family. One room had a view of the mountains and town and the other of the sea and the hotel gardens.

It was good value, friendly and tasty. Our 14year old loves mussels so we went to the far end of the port and had an excellent meal in Le bar a Moules great value at 10 euro for a huge bowl of moules and frites. We didnt eat breakfast in the hotel- at 18 euros it seemed steep for 4 of us!

There is a very good local transport network to all the famous places along the Riviera. Traffic can be immense, but local road manners are very good.

Rooms are among the best equipped I have come across - clever suitcase storage, free safe, minibar, tea & coffee maker, hair dryer, plasma tv, radio alarm, corkscrew etc. Everything seems to be very new and in perfect working order.
