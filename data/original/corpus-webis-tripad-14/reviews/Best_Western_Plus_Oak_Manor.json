When calling the front desk to explain what happened, the clerk said it was probably just maintenance. So I began to explain that no one knocked or announced that they were coming in. Well Sabrina (the clerk) said that they have had complaints before that employees have walked into rooms without knocking or announcing themselves. That didn't make me feel at ease. I asked Sabrina if she had children and she said, \"She did and if that happened to her she would be packing her bags and leaving.\" Needless to say that's exactly what I did! Well the story I got a before checking out was that the man was a guest and went to the wrong door, and he told them my door was open. Tomfoolery!!! Not only was my door closed, but the security latch was on. Unfortunately my words fell on deaf ears when letting the staff know that I ABSOLUTELY had the door closed and the security latch on. The staff attempted to try to pacify me by saying that they have forgotten their door open with the latch on and blah blah blah. Tell it to someone who is crazy and deranged because I'm not that person. Maybe the clerk typed in my room number into his key, I don't know.
