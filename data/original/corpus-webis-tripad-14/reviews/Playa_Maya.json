It is a great little hotel, the staff are very courteous and helpful. The rooms are lovely, basic but kept incredibly clean with a fridge for your beer, flatscreen tv for when its raining (only rained for one day!) and good aircon. The balcony was fantastic to sit out on in the evening and watch the sea, definitely worth paying extra for an unobstructed ocean view. I loved the fact that you could only reach the hotel via the beach, it makes it very quiet in the evenings, especially considering you are only 2 minutes off the main street of playa. Breakfast on the beach was wonderful and they do great lunch food too. The hotel wasn't full when we stayed which we liked as it made the beach in front of the hotel more peaceful. Plenty of staff on the beachfront so felt safe and easy to get frozen margaritas. Playa del carmen itself is a lovely resort, perfect location to take trips to the mayan ruins (go to the ruins at Coba, fantastic!) and to go snorkelling and diving in the reef and caves. I can imagine that Playa del Carmen gets very busy at peak season and we were surprised by the prices in some of the restaurants, you do get much better deals if you venture off 5th avenue, I would highly recommend Oasis for awesome seafood at very good prices. 100% natural is also a great restaurant for us veggies!", "title": "Lovely independent hotel in a great location", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "GGLondon", "date": "July 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 18148941, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Great Location on beach and walking distances to downtown playa del carmen.", "title": "Sweet Little Place !", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "venturarose", "date": "July 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17711867, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 on the beach and town walking distance", "disliked": "\u2014 no microwave in room"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Easy online reservation process -even after we made changes and added another member to our party.", "title": "Great Beachfront Stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Pointmmmb", "date": "July 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 17614338, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 None"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed in the eco. suite - two conntecting large rooms with a table & chairs in one room and a futon /couch in another.
