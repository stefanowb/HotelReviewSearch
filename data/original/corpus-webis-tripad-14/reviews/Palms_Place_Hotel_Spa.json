Palms Place is one of my new favorites. Our room was incredible, like an apartment. Very trendy and comfortable, like a W with a little kitchen, bar area, big comfy bed, seating area , two plasma tvs, awesome bathroom and shower and a great balcony and view. Loved the pool area and spa/gym. Kind of bummed we were charged $30 a day to use gym but we made good use of gym and spa. Loved taking the skywalk right into the Palms and had a great time hanging out at The Palms. I really liked not having to walk through a casino to get to and from our room. Would totally recommend for younger people, singles and couples. It was a $10 cab ride to anywhere on the Strip. We actually enjoyed not being on the Strip and were happy with everything offered between the Palms and Palms Place.

After a week traveling the Southwest we finished our stay here the evening before our flight left. The hotel is set apart from the Casino complex (though connected by a moving walkway), and immediately upon entering we fell into an oasis of calm. We were quickly checked into a 1 bedroom suite on the 11th floor. Pictures are posted from other reviewers, but it really doesn't do the room justice. I love the prior comment about it being a \"Lad's Pad\", which is maybe why I loved it so much! We're talking a super comfy king bed, two huge flat screens (one with a DVD player), One and a half bathrooms, one decked out in white marble with a huge shower with rainwater and dual showerheads, a fireplace, a full kitchen, and an oversized spa tub set out right in the bedroom. And the VIEW- two balconies showcase the strip and the red rocks of Vegas. I We immediately began to chill in the room, then set out to use the spa, which was fairly basic with the exception of the Hamman (kind of like a steam room, but not as hot and with great smells). We had dinner at Nove Italiano at the Palms, where I had honestly the best steak in my life. The location is off strip, but for me this just adds to its appeal. If you want to visit the Vegas everyone else is at, just drive and park at Ceasars Palace or grab a cab; it's less than a mile away. To finish it all off, every employee we encountered was cheerful and friendly, and we did not at all feel out of place (we are about as far away from Hollywood A-list as you can get!). At 309/night, it's certainly a bit of a splurge, especially for a multi night stay, but this place rules!!
