Everything about my stay was great. I didn't make it to check into the hotel until 1:30 am. Even though it was that late, they were still expecting me. The young lady was very courteous at check in, and even managed a nice conversation even though it was very late. I was given an ocean view room (which is what my reservation was for) on the 5th floor (top floor). The room was very large, complete with a kitchen, couch, chair, dining table, and a separate bedroom. The room as well as the bathroom was very clean. The bed was comfortable. The view from the room was outstanding; less than 20 yards to the water.

From the beginning, when you come into to the hotel things look ok but once you hit the room there goes everything. For starters I was with a party of four reservations and every single room had something wrong with it. One the fridge did not work and leaked all the time, another room one of the stoves did not work and part of the frame for the sliding window was falling apart. The third one being a suite the pull out sofa was damage, and was very hard to pull out. The fourth one, water was coming in since one of the days it rained with wind. All of the rooms we were told that had queens for beds, which when you came into the room you noticed that these beds were a little small to be a queen. And make sure you don\u2019t make a person taller than 5,6 sleep in the pull out bed because he wont fit in it. All furniture in the rooms are outdated and lack the charisma of Hilton hotels. These rooms need a lot of maintance, all of the rooms that I saw needed to be painted or had some wall damage. The suite are not that big of a deal since the only thing they have extra is a stove, fridge and a wall to separate the room from the pull out sofa. We had a one room suite which we had to change on the last day because of severe water flooding from our room to the one below, and then to the extend they give us a smoking 2 bedroom suite. Wow, a 2 bedroom suite but im a non-smoker and I have asthma so Imagine what happened that last day. Pool is nice and the area in the back is relaxing and by the way there is no beach in this hotel only a sea wall with a ladder leading to the sea, with rocks, big rocks. Some of the staffs were of great help, but not all of them. I had planned for a couple of days of relaxation but did not get at all.
