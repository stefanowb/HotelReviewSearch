Their checkout time of 11am is stricly enforced even with empty rooms they would not allow me a senior citizen to remain in my room for 2 additional hours something most hotels of this type gladly grant. I made a big mistake staying there dining room is overpriced and no continental breakfast is included in rate.My advice to anyone visiting natchez is stay at the casino hotel down the hill for half the price and they provide free jitney service to town and the bus terminal", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 21, 2004", "id": 2312263}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great lobby and restaurant, room average", "text": "We stayed at the Natchez Eola in June 2003 (room 213). The lobby and restaurant are amazing. The room on the other hand was VERY average (reminded me of any regular motel room). Basically, you're paying for the ambience (which is limited to the lobby/restaurant), so you might as well pay a little more and get a room at a plantation to have that same ambience in the room you're staying in as well, and not restricted to the downstairs area. My two complaints would be that the sink fawcett in our room was completely loose (it had come out of its fitting) and that I called the reception numerous times to have our phone line connected, but the line was constantly busy (for over two hours....). I don't think I would stay here again, simply because it's not really worth the amount we paid (I'd rather pay a little more and stay at a plantation). Nonetheless, it was clean and generally ok.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "dc_shuggah", "date": "January 12, 2004", "id": 1546974}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Hotel for the price", "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Eola for 3 nights. Trust me when I say that when you reserve a room, write down not only the confirmation number but the person you spoke with and the date and time. The hotel \"lost\" our reservation even though my boyfriend called that very morning to confirm our room! Anyway, after alot of back and forth with the front desk, our reservation was finally found (not surprisingly). The hotel was almost full as there were 2 weddings that weekend so the manager pulled some strings (if you want to call it that) and got us a room with a view of the Mississippi (what we originally requested when we booked the room 2 weeks prior). The room itself was nice, kind of small, but had a nice 4 poster king bed, a skylight, and the baloncey had a beautiful view of the River. So, despite the front desk mix-up, I was pleased with what we got. The staff was nice and courteous and the restaurant-I think it was called The Julep-had decent food. Be aware that the breakfast buffet closes precisely at 10 am-it wont tell you that on the menu.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "Rosalinda L", "date": "June 11, 2003", "id": 1076922}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "loved the atmosphere and charm", "text": "This is an excellent hotel with olde worlde charm that will be difficult to emulate in many towns or cities in the Deep South.
