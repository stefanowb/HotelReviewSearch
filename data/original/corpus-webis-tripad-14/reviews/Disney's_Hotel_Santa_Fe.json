In fact, we would go back again tomorrow! We were made to feel extremely welcome, given we speak only a little French, and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We booked a double room with an ensuite, but upon arrival we were checked into 2 adjoining double rooms for no extra cost (given our children are 11yo & 14yo staff thought that woiuld be better). Our son was able to adjust the TV so it was in English, the rooms were clean, spacious, with extremely comfortable beds, and a terrific place to sleep after a HUGE day exploring Paris & Disneyland. We saw no mice or rats, and yes, breakfast was very busy, but what do you expect with 5,000 guests?? As you have probably read, breakfast is plentiful and we were able to leave each morning with croissants & rolls for lunch, which truthfully saved us about 400 Euros for the week (as food is very expensive). The walk to Disneyland/the train station was a leisurely 10-15 minutes which we all loved, and the 8-10am early access was brilliant. The bar in the main reception area was lovely at night, and gave us a place to relax & unwind whilst being close to our room. Honestly, if you are looking for an affordable hotel that gives you everything you need, look no further than Santa Fe. Go in with no expectations, and you will come out with memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you for a wonderful stay from our Aussie family of 4 :)", "title": "What a wonderful stay!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Denise S", "date": "December 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121845374}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011", "text": "I stayed at this hotel nearly 10 years ago which was great, then returned recently to find this hotel appears it has never been decorated or updated in the past 10 years. Arrived expecting a comfortable, although basic room (all that's required as not in room much) but I however found a basic, run down, very cold and damp room. You could smell the damp, along with dirt marks up the wall we could not sleep in the room, after speaking with reception who offered no apologies or alternatives. I requested a move either to another room or hotel this was granted we decided to move hotels and to pay the extra 130 euros... We then left the Santa Fe and moved to hotel Cheynne and wow what a difference it was everything and more what we hoped for. Warm, comfortable, great western theme, clean and much much more. So alls well that ends well.

We stayed this time from the 5th till the 10th Dec. I find this hotel to be good for the price you pay. Don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed. Our room was cleaned everyday to a good standard and we have no complaints with the room we were given on either of our visits. This time we stayed in a corner room which seems to be a little smaller than the room we had before but still okay for the time we spent in them. The carpets looked very tired and drab and out of our 5 days we only ate in the restaurant once for breakfast as it was like a cattle market with children AND adults sneezing and coughing all over the food without thinking to cover their mouths ... Of course this is not the hotels fault but they do sometimes seem to let too many people in at one time and its a real struggle to find a table to sit at. I would strongly advise going to breakfast before 7.30 as when we left just before 8am the que to get in was right up the corridor and most people looked fed up of waiting. The hotel is close enough to the park for you to walk in under 15 minutes. It took us around 20 minutes and we have a 2 and a 6 year old walking with us.
