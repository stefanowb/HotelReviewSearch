The grounds are gorgeous, the rooms are nice and they have all the best finishing touches and offerings one could ask for! They have done an excellent job. The facility has a flow to it so that everything somehow feels central. Love how they have a shop, restuarants, indoor pool, outdoor pools and all are right on site and accesible right from within the facility. They have speakers throughout playing a light classical music (great touch!!!! Loved it!) and it is decorated quite elegantly. It reminded me of being in a Disney resort! The indoor wave pool was better than I expected and with that and two water slides (plus hot tub for the adults) the indoor pool was a blast! Love the building it was in with all the lovely glass doors around it - makes it look spectacular! The outdoor pool was equally excellent and fun. The hot tub was great! The pool set up and added features make it absolutely appealing and stand out from other places I have been. We seemed to be amongst other happy families and great groups of people - an absolute pleasure just to be there. We ate lunch and the Hearth and Kettle and thoroughly enjoyed our service and food. We had dinner at the Grand Cru Wine Bar and Grill which we LOVED - excellent food, I highly recommend it! And at night we went to the camp fire and toatsed marshmallows, watched a bit of the live band and part of the movie being played outdoors! Spectacular entertainment - it was a short stay at the end of a trip but we never even left the hotel! The spa sounded awesome and had a lot of great selections, had our stay been longer, I absolutely would have gone there. It was such a great visit and we had the best time.

We rent a house every summer for one week in August and this year we wanted to extend our vacation for one more day and have the kids try this resort. The rooms were clean but a little outdated. The main attraction is their indoor wave pool and water slides. It is not an indoor water park. The kids had a lot of fun there and the lines were very short to get on the slides. The wave pool and water slides are not an all day activity. There were other things for the kids to do. They had face painting and crafts at an outside play area. They do movies outside each night for the kids. They also have a fire pit where the kids can make s'mores. The outdoor salt water pool was very nice. It was a good time but I don't think I would want to stay here for more than a day or two.

That may be the whole problem, I am not sure if it is a real resort or spa at best maybe an average hotel for kids and families. Next the food...way over priced and poor to average in terms of quality, They can't seem to produce anything that was regional or didn't come from a freezer. It seem that they should be able to master great seafood considering the location, but no it was horrible over complicated and packaged... even the soups and chowders.
