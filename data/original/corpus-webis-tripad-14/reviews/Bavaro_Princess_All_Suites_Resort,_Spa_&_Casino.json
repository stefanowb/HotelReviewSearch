The people that run the activites are energetic and made sure everyone had a great time.

I was a little apprehensive after reading all the bad reviews, and I am posting this review to tell anyone thinking of staying here not to worry-this place is beautiful! We loved the winding, scenic trails throughout the property, and our room was a minute's walk from the beach and pool, an ideal location. If you don't like to walk a lot, there are trams that run every 5 minutes to take you around. The beach is breathtaking, and the weather was great. The food was really good, especially at Sakura and El Gaucho. We did not get sick, and we ate everything...just remember, alcohol and fruit drinks mess with your stomach too, so it's not always the food that makes people sick. Also, if you travel with Apple Vacations, I would definitely recommend going to their evening beach party-it was delicious! Everything was clean, and unlike some negative reviews, we did not see a single bug anywhere in our room. Tip the maids and the bartenders and they will take great care of you. The people who said the service was bad probably didn't tip and would complain about every little thing anyway. The employees work really hard to serve you, and if you have to wait a little while for service, well, you're on vacation! One thing-plan on being ready to check out at least 15 minutes earlier than what the hotel tells you, because the check-out line was huge and we almost missed our transfer to the airport.

The beach here is fantastic, with a nice pool and lovely grounds. The renovated room was clean and easily accommodated three. This is a large resort that requires lots of walking to get to the beach or lobby bar/restaurant. Jordan and the animation team were great and always invited children and adults to participate in organized activities such as beach soccer, darts. etc. Activities were not focused on drinking games as at some other resorts. One day there was a class on beach landscape painting that was particularly unique and interesting. They also worked hard to create things to do in the lobby area on rainy days. A talented band played live music on certain nights, but some of the evening \"shows\" were cheesy. Food was fair and often over cook. The buffet by the beach was best for breakfast and lunch, but service to get a needed drink, fork or napkin was absent. Poke around and you can find something decent to eat--made to order grilled steaks, pork chops or dorado at most meals. Most of the ingredients used at the resort were frozen or canned products. There were special lunches prepared outside some days by the beach--paella or barbequed chicken and ribs. For dinner, Chopin was a lesser version of the main buffet. The \"specialty\" restaurants were nice to look at or to enjoy sit down service, but universally bad with only a handful of decent dishes at each if you order things with basic proteins such as fish, steaks and chops. I cannot understand why any one would go to the Caribbean to eat truly bad and inauthentic Asian, Mexican or Italian food at a buffet or restaurant that is far worse than what you can find in any local place in Philly, NY, Chicago, Boston, etc. Tip graciously and form a relationship with a waiter/waitress or two at the main buffet for breakfast and dinner and they will take good care of you throughout your stay.

I LOVE the Dominican people, they were extremely friendly to us. In Chicago, no one says hello to you on the street unless they want something, I felt like these people were genuinely nice. I speak very little Spanish and could still communicate pretty well. One man climbed a tree and cut a coconut down for me to drink out of! It was really neat! Our room was clean and spacious. We weren't really concerned with the room, since we were outside almost all day. One morning I left a note asking for more towels and an extra pillow and by the time we came back that afternoon, it was all there. One good tip that I got from this site was to arrive with a few phrases already written out in Spanish (very helpful when I asked for the towels and pillow!) Our fridge was refilled everyday with more Coke, Sprite, and beer so there was no problem there. I didn't think the walking was that bad at all? I actually enjoyed it! The scenery was beautiful! We spent a lot of time on the beach and at the pool bar. The beach is absolutely gorgeous. We didn't have any problems getting drinks, we had more than enough!! We ate at the buffets quite a bit and always left full. I consider myself a picky eater and I always found plenty to eat. We only made reservations on two nights. We ate at El Guacho one night and had a great steak dinner. We also ate at Chopin one night and it was a lovely atmosphere. Neither one of us were sick while we were there, even though we came with lots of pepto and immodium just in case! We were very careful not to use any of the tap water. They give you plenty of bottled water so you can brush your teeth with that and not worry. We went on two excursions, the speed boat tour and the Saona Island trip. At first I wasn't all that excited with the speed boat idea, but my boyfriend really wanted to do that. It turned out to be such a fun day! You get to drive the 2 person speed boat for a while and then a bigger boat picks you up and takes you to a snorkeling site. It was awesome snorkeling! I have never seen such a beautiful coral reef and all the tropical fish were unbelievable! The Saono Island was a lot of fun too. First, you are taken out on a speed boat to a natural swimming pool in the middle of the ocean where you can see huge starfish. Then they take you to the island and you have a couple of hours to shop and eat lunch. They prepare an island bbq for you and it was really good. They also had some dancers and a couple of bars (this is all still included in your package, I couldn't believe it.) Then it's basically a booze cruise back. They play music and there is drinking and dancing. I felt like the excursion were a really good way to meet other people from the different resorts. The speed boat tour was about $60/person and the Saona was about $80/person. I felt like both were worth the money. I tipped the housekeeping staff with cash and souviners from Chicago and they seemed very gracious. I also brought little things for kids like school supplies and hair bows. If you go on the excursions you really see how poor the country is. We tipped the bartenders every few drinks and thought that it was fine. Be careful with the mamajuana! Although, try a shot of it with coffee, it was pretty tasty, I would have never guessed! Overall, we just had a great time!

We got there on July 30 through August 4th I hated every day and couldn't wait to come home. Our trip started out bad and kept getting worse. We got into the Dominican Republic airport 2 1/2 hours late after sitting at the PHL airport for way too long. We meet our transportation which was this mini van who took us to the hotel with only us in the vehicle and a spanish speaking driver. The worse thing about this hotel is that ever one speaks spanish and very little English. The entertainment is all in spanish the music is in spanish. The service is terrible and trying to communicate with anybody is impossible. We purchased a honeymoon suite w/jaccuzzi. Arriving to the hotel they stated that they have no suites with jaccuzzi and gave us a room near the beach. I could care less that I was near the beach. I absolutly hated this resort I am so disappointed in my travel agencies and the VIP services who did absolutely nothing for us while we were there.", "user": "Kgreen28", "date": "August 15, 2007", "id": 8431075}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "never again", "text": "My husband and I just came back from Bavaro Princess last Saturday. It was all we could do to get out of that hotel. We even paid extra just to get home early. This vacation was one of the biggest disappointments ever. I wish I had read the postings on this website before we booked our vacation. Although from the appearance of our room it looked liked it was very nice. Just wait until the middle of the night when the cockroaches come out. It got to the point where I made my husband go on bug duty before I could even use the bathroom. We saw several roaches scurrying for cover when we turned on the lights in the bathroom in the evenings. Some mornings we would even find dead roaches lying on the floor in the main room....YUCK! Both of us would wake in the morning with bites on our legs, backs, and sides we're sure there must have been bed bugs. Service at this hotel is almost non-existent. Although we were only the 4th couple in line we waited over an hour to check in. While dining in the restaurants we were lucky if we could even get our water glasses filled. The food in the restaurants was mediocre at best. Not sure if I got a touch of a bug from the food or just an upset stomach. The Japanese restaurant however, was VERY good. The beach was beautiful. Be warned though...if you are sitting under a palm tree or a tiki hut you will most likely encounter spiders crawling on you while you rest. This would probably happen at any beach though. The non-motorized water activity stand that was supposed to be included required a deposit for any equipment you wanted to use. Sure it was only a deposit but the whole point of the all-inclusive is that you don't need to carry any money with you. Also fellow guests were VERY rude at the beach. The days we went to the beach we arrived between 8:30 Am and 9:00 Am the beach itself was practically empty however people had come by and placed their belongings on the prime real estate lounge chairs then don't come back until 11 or 12. This is not fair to the people like us who are there at the beach to actually use the chairs. Although hotel policy states that unattended belongings left on chairs for more than 30 minutes will be removed this does not happen and we had even gotten into an argument with a couple after we had been accused of stealing their chairs although we had been sitting in them for 90 minutes already. The pool seems to have the same situation regarding chairs although we did not spend much time at the pool. One evening as we left the seafood restaurant we looked at the empty pool floating in one end was vomit, noodles actually floating in the water. The pool was already closed for the evening at this point and maintenance crews were adding the chemicals. Why they weren't removing the vomit I don't know. Also, on Tuesday a baby snake had fallen from the grass roof above the swim up bar into the pool. I hate snakes. These two incidents were enough to keep us out of the pool. Finally, the worst part of our vacation. My husband developed a large red spot on his forehead during our second full day. We initially thought this was some sort of spider bite as we had fallen asleep on the beach. As the days passed it grew larger and larger finally on Thursday night we decided we needed to get home so he could have it looked at by a doctor back in the US. We messed around with the apple reps for so long on Friday morning that we weren't able to make any of the flights out that day. We finally said fine put us on the first flight back to the US on Saturday morning, we don't care what city it flies into we'll figure out how to get home from there on our own. We were told that flight had 3 seats available. We said great we'll take that flight only to be told we could not be guaranteed this flight we would have to go stand-by! In the end it worked out and we did get on the first flight out Saturday morning. After a long day of traveling on Saturday my husband decided to take some Benedryl for the \"bite\" on his head Saturday night and get to the ER first thing Sunday morning. Sunday morning the swelling on his forehead had spread and he could barely open his right eye. When he got to the ER the doctor told him that it was not a bite after all, instead he had contracted some sort of infection. We still don't know what it is whether it is viral or bacterial he is on antibiotics for both for the next 7 days. We are uncertain for sure on how this infection was contracted but we do have a guess. When we were at the beach on Monday, our first full day we were approached by the hotel photographers to have our picture taken with their monkey. We thought it would be a cute picture. It was a cute picture we actually bought a copy from the hotel that evening. However, it seems very likely that as the monkey moved from sitting on my husbands shoulder up to sit on the top of his head the monkey may have inadvertently scratched him on the forehead thus contracting the infection. Be warned to stay away from any animals while in a foreign country you never know how well they are taken care of in terms of illnesses.", "user": "j_williams77", "date": "August 14, 2007", "id": 8423398}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Good to Bad to HORRIBLE..

Prior to going I have been reading all the good and bad reviews and I felt like I kinda new what to expect. So getting to PUJ airport was kind of a breeze. We didnt have to wait very long, we just stood in line paid the 10$ went to find our luggage and found our tour Bus which was VIP tours the guys in the yellow shirts. When we were dropped off at our hotel a man told us to go check in and he would meet us later at our room but we couldnt take our luggage. SO i was a little uspet that I was leaving all my belongings in the hands of this guy. So we took a tram to our room, 277, and went in and liked what we saw. The room felt pretty cool and seemed to be decently cleaned. Our luggage took about 20 min to get to us, we unpacked, and went to the lobby to get some food from the buffet. The food was not so bad to me the first day. Then we got some drinks at the lobby bar and sat outside where the fountain was, sipping our Mai Tais and feeling the cool breeze. First day was great. Second and Third day werent bad either we went to the beach where they play music and got everyone up and dancing, then the pool where we enjoyed the pool bar (it does take a while to get a drink) ,we drank alot of drinks ( my favorite was the icee and blue coraco called a Blue Jay), and ate at the buffet and Mc Princess where the have burgers, hotdogs, and french fries. The fries were good but the burgers were blah. The buffet started to get worst for us though. It became harder to find foods that I thought were good to eat and safe to eat. The pizza is not good, burgers no, the fruit is gross, meat is sketchy. Some good food was the Fried Chix and the potatoes and rice. The second night they had dancing in the lobby with their house band and third night they had the beach party.It was fun but after that there wasnt much to do.

The Italians restaurant was good also! We also ate the nightly buffets if we did not have reservations anywhere else - it was fine!

Just go and see for yourself. My girlfriend and I just recently came back from the Dominican Republic last wednesday from a 7 night stay, and we had a great time. The resort itself was very beautiful. We got the platinum upgrade, which by the way is well worth the extra money, made our trip even better. It felt good to go up any bar in the resort and ask for any drink on the shelf and walk away, while everyone else has to pay, and room serves was 24 hours every day. The room that we stayed in was about one minute walking distance from the beach. So we got to see three different weddings while we were there. The resort does have a bit of an insect problem, but not that bad. You have to remember that there are lakes and ponds all over the grounds with over 700 rooms, bugs have to vacation too. We had to change rooms due to little flying bugs, and ants. But once the manager way informed of the problem, we were moved within minutes. The venders on the beach and in the main lobby were a little bit of a problem too, but you have remember that you are on vacation. It doesn't matter where u go, as far as thr islands, there will be someone trying to sell you or get you to sign up for something. Just do the samething you would do at home, tell them you are not interested before they even get started and you will be left alone. We went on three tours, the outback safari (highly recommend), the marinarium, and dolphin island. All of the tour guides were very nice, but the trip to dolphlin island was a little short due to a late bus driver. The beach and the pool had to be the best part of the trip. Oh and by the way, the beach is top less for people with children. We met and had fun with some may people. All different races and shades which is always good. The white sand and very blue water looked like a postcard. Very very clean! And the pool was the same way. Dont forget to participate in the activites at the pool, very fun to do. Everyone that my girlfriend and I walked pass greeted us with a smile and a hola. All of the food was very good, except the eggs. Stay away from the eggs, not very tasty. As far as the train car. They can every 5 to 10 minutes. The only time the train car was full was around dinner time, because most people who made reservation (between 9 and 10 oclock at night). Any other time if one train car was full, the next one was empty. We had to walk back to the room once on the last day of the trip, due to us missing the last train car, which is 12 o clock. It turned out to be very nice , because we got to take a walk alone with each other. The entertainment at the main lobby was well planned and also funny. Nice dancing and funny comedy. The only cons we had besides the bugs in the room, were the groups of drunkin teens. They were loud and ignorant at times. Other then that a very very beautiful place to stay.

In comparison with Grand Palladium Palace hotel and Punta Cana Princes, the room at Bavaro Princess was very cold and very spacious. You don't need to use the room key to have the a.c. running. We spent most of our mornings at the swimming pool. We noticed that even at 12 pm there were beach chairs available in the shade. My son loved the beach but especially the swimming pool. The resort was not crowded at all during our stay. The food at this hotel was the best we've experienced so far at Punta Cana. The waiters are very nice and they do their best to keep you happy. If you go to La Hyspanola, look for Jose. He speaks English and he is very friendly. My son liked him very much, and so did we. My husband tipped all the staff who was catering to us. We even gave money to the gardeners. We felt sorry for these poor hard working people who are earning only a few hundred dollars a month. The animation team was very nice. My son was selected to play in their Lion King show as Baby Simba. After that night he became very popular and everyone was calling him Baby Simba. Every night at 8pm the resort has mini disco for children. My son had a lot of fun there. He learned new dance moves. Germania, the animation girl who looks after the children at the kids club and at mini disco is very nice. Overall, the whole family had fun and we were able to relax and enjoy this vacation.

The grounds of this resort was absolutely gorgeous- and spotless! Everywhere you looked you could see someone sweeping, washing windows, or tending to the gardens. Lots of peacocks, chickens, and flamingos just wandering about. It took about 5-10 minutes to get to our room by trolley, but it was such a beautiful ride. Transportation around the resort is great-always a trolley coming by (wherever you are) every 5 minutes or so. During the ride to our room we did encounter an odor while driving through the mangrove. We were told by staffers that this was not sewage (as we thought) but the odor was caused by rotted mangos that had fallen from the trees. The smell isn't that bad and it passes quickly as you pass through- also there are no rooms in that area. The rooms are much nicer in person than in pictures. I would assume most rooms are the same- just be sure not to book in the junior suites, as they are in a complex near the lobby. They didn't look as nice as the bungalows. The patio in the suites was spacious and relaxing. The room did have a little musty odor, but that is to be expected in this type of climate. We brought glade plug-ins and spray which did come in handy. AC worked great- we had to keep it on low as it got too chilly otherwise. Plenty of scorching hot water and the shower pressure was GREAT too. Massaging shower heads- it was better than home! At night you couldn't hear a pin drop it was so peaceful sitting out on our patio. We saw absolutely NOT ONE BUG in our entire stay! The people who posted pictures of roaches really perturbs me. I can't even begin to describe how spotless this entire resort was!! As for mosquitoes, there were a few. It is to be expected. So be sure to bring some bug spray, it does help. The suite had marble floors throughout and sometimes they did get a little griddy when coming in & out from the beach. But when we returned later in the day, the maid did a wonderful job mopping and tidying up. We left her a $3 tip (and a gift) everyday before heading to the beach. However, next time I will forgo the gift idea. I saw many maids leaving the rooms with huge bags filled with stuff. We were stunned to see how much stuff they get in one day.

However, if you wanted one of the grass umbrellas you did have to get up the crack of dawn to reserve one- but that did have it's perks. Every morning I would walk down the beach before the sun came up and got to watch to most breathtaking sunrise. The sky glowed all colors and I took lots of pictures. The beach was clean and the sand was literally like flour. Soft & white. Not even the smallest rock or shell to be found. The water was a sparkling aqua blue- it was even bluer than the pool water!! The waves were awesome- but sometimes they were big enough to knock you off your feet. The beach shack offered free boggy boards which were great to ride the waves into shore. They also offered free non-motorized sports equipment but we just wanted to relax. There was para sailing right in the front of the resort. The BP had so much going on all day. Thumping music, dancing, aerobics, tug or war, volleyball, all kind of funny games going on. Even if you didn't want to participate it was fun to watch. There were two cozy beach bars right on the beach in the sand with plenty of available table & chairs to enjoy your lunch. The one in the front of the resort offered hamburgers, hot dogs & fries- but with a huge buffet inside at ElGoucho with plenty of variety, we didn't eat at the grill at all. My boyfriend and I took many walks up the beach and discovered that of all the dozens of resorts the Bavaro Princess had the most beautiful beach front of all. It was extremely wide and spacious. We noticed that as you ventured up the beach, it narrowed quite drastically. It's no wonder the other resorts have such a shortage of beach chairs. Also we found that there was not much going on for activities on the beach at other resorts. No music or anything and most people at other resorts looked mildly bored. At the BP beach there were lots of venders walking around trying to sell excursions or jewelry. They were only allowed on the beach. The security guards maintained a strict boundary into the resort itself. I have to say that it was sometimes frustrating trying to read a book when they approached us every 5 minutes. It was annoying, but eventually I figured if you pretended you were sleeping (or were topless) they would leave you alone. ;-) Yes there are topless women here. But far & few in between. After your first day you don't even notice them (and sometimes lose your inhibitions!) One day we walked to the left up the beach and found no venders. The next day we walked to the right (about 15-20 minutes) and there were venders galore! Unprepared, we brought no money. As we approached the market they began cat-calling us, some even running up to us and grabbing our arms trying to get us into their shops. 'Cheapy cheapy' they'd say. When we tried to tell them we had no money they say 'Looky looky' and still try to pull us into their shops. At first it was kind of funny, but then it became annoying, sometimes even scary. They really mean no harm though. The venders actually compete with each other for your business. If they weren't so pushy we would've gone back, but decided not to.

I have to say that I had one experience with theft there. Early in the morning I had reserved two chairs by the beach and another two chairs by the pool. Since I used both our towels to reserve the beach chairs, on my way back to our room I reserved the chairs by the pool with my sweatshirt. Later in the afternoon when we went to the chairs we reserved by the pool, my sweatshirt was gone and there was a family sitting in the spot I reserved.

I got on travel advisors and there was enough pictures and negative things that I wish I had listened to them but I was stupid and listened to those that would say the oppisite and convince me that the people writting were just negative people...They weren't, believe me I've went to Punta Cana 6 times and always stayed in a 5 or 6 Apple Resort and I know the difference..Bavaro Princess should be rated no more than a 3.. My friend and I arrived there May the 12th and the Bell Boys took our luggage and showed us where to catch the tram and we waited and waited just like people had said we would..We finally walked to our room which hadn't been cleaned, I turned the tv on to see if we got any Latin music because I love it and the tv wasn't working.. the maid reported it,,then after she left we was looking the room over,,sure enough like we had been advised,,there was bugs, mildew on the walls, and the light in the bathroom wouldn't work..I called to report that and then we got ready to go eat..We went out to the tram stop and waited again for 10 minutes and finally the tram came,,,FULL,,we finally walked and it was a long walk, believe me,,I was told about the sewage smell but again didn't believe it,,I do now,,it was terrible..dinner was good until later when I was running to the bathroom often, it was too dark in the main lobby and we went to the show which was a magic show, very boring. Well we decided to go in, get some sleep and start over tomorrow..no tv and no light in the bathroom,,luckily I took a flashlight. The next morning I was so sick I couldn't eat breakfast and soon after breakfast my friend was sick..We went to Apple and ask to be moved..After checking around, they found us a great resort and we moved..Please if you're thinking about going look some more..I'm really upset that Apple would rate this place a 5 as bad as it was...I'm sure if these people that give great reviews had been to any other resorts they'd realize that Bavaro Princess has a lot of problems..Our vacation was ruined from getting an enzyme or poisoned the first day..I go to enjoy everything,,always look foward to the food, drinks, entertainment,,I missed all of that and was moved to a fabulous resort but was too sick.

Our ages ranged from 22 years old to 53 years old. Although this was our first experience with an all-inclusive vacation, we are not novices when it comes to travel. We recently were in Vegas and have been on several cruises (NCL, RCI & Costa) in the Caribbean. We booked thru Susan Judd at Berwick Travel. She was very helpful (responsive) and took care of all our travel needs. Berwick Travel, Cinnaminson, NJ, offered the best package price for this vacation. I researched this vacation on the internet for 4 months. We stayed in 3 Platinum suites (793, 795 & 796). We were approximately 50 feet from the Platinum Lounge and 200 yards from beach. I would highly recommend the upgrade to Platinum Club. It was an additional $165 per person for our stay. Just the use of the Platinum Lounge and its\u2019 wonderful staff was worth the extra money. Margarita, Anna and Juan were great to deal with. When we arrived at the Resort, via included transfer from airport, we were immediately put on a jitney to the Platinum Lounge for a no-wait private check-in. We availed ourselves to the service of having the Platinum Lounge staff book all our dinner reservations. They could not have been more accommodating. On Sunday night we booked the entire week for the time we wanted each night. We ate at Licey (no charge, included with Platinum upgrade), Tanuki, Chopin and Bella Pasta. The food and service was great. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. We also ate at the buffet(s) in the main lobby area and the beach area. Food selection was very good with both buffets had chefs preparing fresh food (to your order) in addition to all the staged buffet food. We even tried McPrincess (on beach) once for hot dogs, hamburgers and fries. It was good. Drinks, hors d\u2019oeuvres and specialty coffees at the Platinum Lounge were consumed daily. Free use of internet access was valuable to us. Two of us took advantage of the included 20 minute pool-side massage. It was very relaxing. The free cigars were good, too. The no-charge stocked mini-bar & liquor in the room was a nice convenience. Lehandro, our VIP representative, included thru Berwick Travel, was onsite and very knowledgeable. I believe he was responsible for making a few phone calls to Delta to get my lost luggage that went from BWI to SFO to JFK to PUJ, instead of BWI to PUJ. It was delivered to my suite within 24 hours of my arrival. He also took care of scheduling our transfers back to the airport. We booked a 4-wheeler excursion with him. We all had a great time 4-wheeling in the country-side. The weather was great. We had about 15 seconds of rain (light shower) the whole week. It was overcast about 4 hours spread out over 2 days. The ocean and beach were awesome (no words could describe, you must see). The pool and swim-up bar was very nice. Lot\u2019s of activities, only if you wanted to join in. Overall, I would highly recommend Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort, Spa & Casino for your choice of a Dominican all-inclusive vacation.

The only time anyone gets sick is when my friend gets sick as she does every year we go away (she also gets sick at home when she eats rich foods...) The a la carte restaurants are good, generally speaking. The food was fine, although we had issues with service at a couple: Bella Pasta staff were, I think, trying to be formal, but came across as standoffish. As soon as we started trying to make the champagne pouring napkin- and the staff started laughing and coming to help us- then they were warm and pleasant. On our second visit, they remembered us and were relaxed and friendly. ElGaucho was similar. Sakura had a new manager and the service was very slow. I mean, below BP's standard for sure. In fact. my husband actually spoke to the manager about the need to get the kitchen on line (waiters were great, very attentive, but main course took 1 hr 25 min to appear). What we loved was: Tanuki, the new tappanyaki restaurant - so much fun! great staff - and Chopin, again, great staff, Jose, the head chef was visible and very personable. El pescador and Licey were both very good, with good service and food. The buffet was consistently good.
