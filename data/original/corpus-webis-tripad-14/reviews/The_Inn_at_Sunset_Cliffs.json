The well-documented views lived up to their reputation, and the Inn is in a nice, quieter, more residential spot than many other area hotels (yet still close to gaslamp, etc). The Inn provides very comfy louge chairs from which to contemplate the waves, and the feeling of peace and serenity that overcomes you is great. King Studio has a lovely view but is a bit small. Staff is nice but not so hot on restaurant recommendations and not great at giving directions--do your homework in advance.", "title": "Peaceful and Serene", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "linda528", "date": "May 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5042701}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 10, "very good": 38, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 145}, "aka": "The Inn At Sunset Cliffs Hotel San Diego", "slim_ranking": 0.0851851851852, "description": "Welcome to the Inn at Sunset Cliffs located in historical Point Loma, California.
