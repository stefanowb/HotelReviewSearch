The hotel has some great features - we loved the weather forecast and the chocolates on our bed every night, as well as the free welcome drink on arrival. The room has a lot of good extras - e.g. bathrobes, slippers, toothbrushes, even perfume. This was in the standard room. The hotel has 2 swimming pools but we found that it was hard to get a sunbed at times (we stayed in August and it was warm enough to sunbathe). The breakfast was amazing - they had everything you could wish for. We didn't eat in the restuarant in the evening(it was always empty) but there are plenty of great places to eat either on the beachfront or in town. The nearest tube station (Cuitadella Vila Olimpica) was less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel and we often caught the train a couple of stops to get nearer to the centre. However, you could also walk to the Harbour in 10-15 mins and the Rambles was about a 20-30 min walk. The hotel staff was friendly and spoke good English. All in all, a very nice hotel and we would recommend this to friends and family.", "title": "Great Hotel for a Barcelona Break", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TaraRice", "date": "August 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8517199, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Extras in the room!", "disliked": "\u2014 Wasn't always cleaned to the best standard"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Spent 5 days here in August.", "title": "Excellent stay !", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Decky67", "date": "August 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8505172, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our room was ultra modern with lcd tv, mini bar, balcony overlooking pool & sea, loewe bathroom products, rainforest shower, evening turndown.", "title": "Great Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Bolli102", "date": "August 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8462814, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The very large bath", "disliked": "\u2014 only one sweet each left when they turned down the beds"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A perfect birthday surprise", "text": "Breakfast well worth including in the price - offers both continental & various cooked options.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "TannerLondon", "date": "August 8, 2007", "id": 8372173}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Rooftop pool - fantastic !
