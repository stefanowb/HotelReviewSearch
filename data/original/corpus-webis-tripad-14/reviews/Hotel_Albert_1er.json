{"user_rating": 3.0, "review_count": 276, "name": "Hotel Albert 1er", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Don't be put off by the faded decor and knocked-about furniture and fittings: this hotel is a no-frills gem! It's perfectly positioned, just off the beach and the promenade, next to the main square, and very near the pedestrianised area where you'll find a huge choice of restaurants. The marina is a brisk walk around the headland. Several large, expensive (23.50 euros/day) underground car parks are nearby, but buses to/from the airport (which is inaudible, yet only 4 miles away) pass right by the hotel anyway. Some rooms look across the lush gardens with views of the sea between the palm trees. The rooms are well cleaned, equipped to 3-star standard and everything works, especially the all-important power-showers. The towels and bed linen are of good quality and the lack of drinks facilities in the rooms is made up for by the chilled vending machines in the lounge. Double glazing, shutters and heavy (though dingy) curtains keep the noise of traffic out at night (and also the sound of occasional open-air concerts in the park, if those aren't your thing), while air-conditioning keeps the temperature manageable. However, you'll want to keep the windows open to enjoy all the hustle & bustle of the city, even in the afternoon when the sun beats into the rooms from the west. Best of all are the staff, however, who are friendly, hard working and good at their jobs. The hot & cold buffet breakfast, served from 7am until a lazy 10.30am in the quaint little lounge on the first floor, is worth the 11 euros, but you'll have to do everything for yourself at busy times. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will not hesitate to stay at the Albert 1er again. Those who expect more, in this location and at these prices, are barking up the wrong tree. It must be the best value-for-money in Nice.", "title": "A No-Frills Gem!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "StuFife", "date": "August 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8373637, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and price", "disliked": "\u2014 Worn and faded decor"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled solo", "text": "I was completely surprised at how much I liked this hotel after reading some of the old reviews.

He told us casually that if we got a signed police declaration we would get our money back and be able to pay for our planned trip to Monte Carlo. So off we trekked in the 30 degree sunshine to the other side of town (45minute walk either way), got said declaration, came back and were told that we'd get it back in a couple of weeks! Still not got it incidentally! And wasted practically a whole day of our one week holiday for nothing! Not even so much as an apology from the manager or any indication that he or his colleagues actually cared that their staff had stolen their guests' money (which had been hidden in a wallet amongst my clothes in a drawer, how intrusive as well!).
