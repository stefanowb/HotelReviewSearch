Now I have stayed at great places all over the county and a few in other countries, but this is by far the best of everything. No expense was spared in turning this oceanfront oasis into a luxury destination with the highest quality everything! Large LED televisions 3 total, gas range and high end appliances in the kitchen. The bathroom has a rain shower and totally clean. The carpets are so clean that you can walk barefoot without any concern. The turndown service includes free Eclipse chocolate bars that sell for $4 a piece and are the best chocolates you have ever had. My kids wanted extra bars and they were given them, they were so happy with that. The breakfast had quality food, almond milk, fruit, organic coffee and tea, the best muffins and pastries you could imagine as well as bagels and cream cheese. The staff is what sets this place over the edge, you feel important here, and they go out of their way to make you feel important. This was paradise, stay here, spend he extra money you will be glad you did! The beds are so wonderful, feels like your sleeping on air. This is what every hotel should be like.

I found the Pantai Inn here on tripadvisor, saw the reviews but was more impressed by the staffs responses to the reviews. I am all about guest service and usually ask a lot out of the staff where ever i stay. Right after booking, i sent an email to the hotel to find out what they could offer for a one year anniversary and was very impressed by the quick response. Ryan, the gentleman that responded, was one of the best I have encountered with regards to guest service. He handled everything promptly and professionally. He told me about the romance package which included flowers, a bottle of wine, candles, and chocolates. I set that up with him but push the boundaries by asking him for a wine that the hotel does not usually use. He responded quickly by saying that not only would he have someone get that for me but that he would have it all in the room prior to our arrival. At other hotels I have ordered similar packages and paid twice as much but did not get an option of wine. I have also gotten use to having to check in before a concierge could go in and set up a room, Ryan and the staff at Pantai Inn went beyond my expectations.

There was no bathtub and every time we took a shower, the water leaked all over the floor because there is no shower pan and the floor is not slanted. The bathroom fixtures were very nice, especially the multiple showerheads. My other complaint would be that there is no \"do not disturb\" sign.
