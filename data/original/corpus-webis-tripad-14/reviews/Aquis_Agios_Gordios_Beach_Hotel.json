The week didn't start well as we had rain and then thunder and lightning for the first 3 days and maybe that made us more critical but from our arrival the staff on reception were surly. To get to our room from reception we had to go up 6 stairs to a very small lift, which took 1 person and 1 suitcase. We were on the 3rd floor of the furthest away block at the end of the corridor. We arrived just after 12 noon but had to wait until 2 pm to get to our room. The room was very nice, no problem there, although the towels in the bathroom were very thin. Use once and they were wet (not damp, wet). The food in the restaurant was very good with plenty of choice at all meals and if you didn't want a full lunch you could have sandwiches from the pool bar, which were very tasty. The service in the restaurant could be a bit 'hitty missy' depending on where you were sitting, but overall it was good. The Greek night and the Italian night in the restaurant were excellent. The restaurant was down stairs again and to get to the pool and pool bar it was down stairs and more stairs. The beach was down a long slope and then down 82 steps. To get pool towels you had to pay 20 euros at reception, receive a card, take that to the pool bar and receive 2 towels which had to last 2 days. On one of the days we had to change the towels we were given 2 towels that had had the tops torn off! On the last day you do the whole process in reverse - towels to bar, card returned, back to reception to get your 20 euros back (which in our case was 'plonked' on the counter 3 feet from where we were standing!) The drinks, what can I say, the lager was refreshing, but weak and the spirits at nightime varied so much that we wondered some evenings just what we were drinking! The entertainment was something else - 1 night we had a quiz, another night we played bingo, we had 2 nights of a man playing the piano, but half the time we couldn't make out what he was playing, 1 night of 3 singers singing like Il Divo (this was EXCELLENT), 1 night of Greek dancers (this was OK) and 1 night of a guy playing a guitar and singing along to very loud music, however he had a good beat and plenty people were up dancing! The beach was lovely, plenty of beds and umbrellas and the sea water was warm and crystal clear. There were quite a few wasps, but the bar man who was well surrounded by them said they were not aggressive! I only got bitten 3 times by mozzies but some people were covered in bites so take plenty of sprays with you if you are going to this hotel/area. Overall we just felt that the hotel had too many people for the facilities that it had. One thing they did forget to mention in the brochure was that you had to wait until 11 am for the sun to get to the beach due to the beautiful hilly scenery behind the hotel, but when it did come out it was lovely and hot! We did not feel that this hotel was up to Platinum standard (or what we expected for Platinum standard) and we will not be returning for another holiday, but some people we spoke to had been to that hotel 4 times which just proves that old saying 'You can't please all of the people all of the time'!", "title": "Platinum this was not!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Susan T", "date": "October 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 143282079}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is not for the disabled.It is a very nice hotel beautiful scenery,most of the staff friendly and helpful but there's always one an i found him good thing i did not understand greek.", "title": "Disabled in Corfu", "user": "janicejobson", "date": "October 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 143188164}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Travel agent was told i am disabled but can manage a few steps recommended a bungalow in the grounds of hotel,do not think they are like english ones that was my mistake,paid extra for the privilege of what turned out to be a bottom flat with 3 flights of stairs to negotiate and no lift.", "title": "Don't believe the bad reviews", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "k19edd", "date": "October 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143104736}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "There is a lift in main complex but limited does not go to roof terrace or the pool.", "title": "Fantastic Hotel", "user": "Frances2355", "date": "October 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 143104253}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012", "text": "Pool reached by 2 flights of steps.", "title": "Great beach front hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "buryplayer", "date": "October 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 143044172}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our stay at the adult only Aquis Agios Gordios Beach Hotel in Agios Gordios, Corfu tel +30 26611 80000 was from 14th to 21st October 2012 and after booking we realised that this time of the year you should expect some rain.
