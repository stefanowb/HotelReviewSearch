One puzzlement, however, was an added local phone call charge on our bill. In this day of cell phone we had never once picked up the room telephone.

Boy what a craphole that place was -- and it was under construction -- a fact they failed to share at the time of our booking. After getting rude attitude from the front desk clerk, we left and got on the phone with Travelocity. About 10 minutes later we drove over to the Marriott to check things out. We were pleasantly surprised at the clean pool and fitness center, the attractive lounge and lobby, and the friendliness of the front desk staff. We gave them the okay to transfer us to the Marriott, and there was no upcharge, even though the Marriott is far superior to the seedy Red Lion. The front desk clerk graciously allowed us an early check in and handed us $20 in food vouchers for our inconvenience -- inconvenience that had nothing to do with Marriott. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and clean bathroom; the view too was better than we had anticipated. We were within walking distance of Red Robin, Wendy's, the Lloyd Center (mall) and even a funky part of town where we had a delicious Italian dinner (at the Pastini Pastaria). The next day as we were beginning to get ready for the graduation, we discovered the water had been shut off. Calamity! So we called down to discover they'd experienced a leak and had to do an emergency shut off. Although it was inconvenient at best, it was not anyone's fault, and the manager quickly had the shuttle driver drop us off at the nearby Marirott Residence Inn to take showers. We experienced hardly any delay at all and made it back in plenty of time to get our clothes on and make it to the commencement ceremony smelling and looking good. When we returned, the manager gave us $30 more in vouchers, which we later used in the lounge.
