Then we arrived. We had 3 night vouchers from Ideeli that clearly stated that we will get a 'sagamore suite' or higher room. The guy at front desk informs us that all their rooms are booked and they will give me a 'studio' instead. Studio is a downgrade and he PRETENDED like that is what my voucher says I am eligible for. So we fought back and forth on that and I underlined again and again on the voucher that it says 'sagamore suite or an upgrade if available'. He went inside the office to talk to his manager (I guess) and says oh there's a sagamore suite now available but it has two double beds. I had booked a King bed and I had email confirmation for it. But we had nowhere else to go after this so we accepted. He agreed to move to another room on next night.", "title": "One word for staff - CHEATERS.
