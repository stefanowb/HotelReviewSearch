The boys each had their own single bed, and my wife and I were able to share a real queen bed (not two singles pushed together). The air conditioner worked well. The small balcony looked out onto a small street and allowed for great people watching, and we enjoyed listening to the locals going about their business. Staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke English well (although we prefer to speak Italian). Breakfast was an upscale version of the typical Italian fare, with the exception that we were served freshly baked cake. The restaurants and shops are a 2 minute walk.
