The lobby and public areas are worth a look even if you don't stay there. The location is in the financial district, directly across the street from the train station. Close to many attractions, though not much going on in the evening. Lots of restaurants as well as the underground shopping are within walking distance. As the hotel is old, the rooms are small - especially the bathroom (compared to other Fairmont hotels I've visited). A very small, old TV was the only bad part of the stay.

The first day I was charmed by the old architecture and history...after that, it's just another big hotel. First disappointment was finding out I paid $229 per night and a colleague there for the same conference paid $159. Other hotels in the city were offering conference-goers 50% off food vouchers and free breakfasts, but the Fairmont offered nothing. Guess they figure they are so old, they don't need to. I had a plain room with no view at the back of the hotel overlooking an alley and office building next door. Room was small, but adequate for one person. Bed was comfortable, but the thin walls made sleeping a challenge with noisy neighbors. Bathroom was tiny and the addition of a granite countertop made sitting on the toilet a real challenge. I am a large man and was literally wedged in and couldn't move. Some hand grips in the shower would have been nice. Toiletries were nice, as others have commented, but be prepared to make the sliver of soap last 7 days as it was never replaced. The snack basket was overpriced...$4 for a small bag of M&M's! Surcharges for EVERY phone call $1.61 per local call and $23 for a 7 minute call back to the States. Free in-room coffee, but I had to request creamer from the housekeeper and she had the kitchen send some up. The free newspaper was absent one day. My perception was they were short-staffed as my room didn't get refreshed until after 6 pm one day. The hotel is convenient to downtown and connected by the underground PATH to Union Station and the subway. All in all, a nice, old property, but be prepared to pay top dollar for everything and shop around for the best rates, as they apparently vary widely.", "title": "Feel cheated...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Eagle70VirginiaBeach", "date": "June 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 31669917}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled on business", "text": "We (a small group attending an event in town) booked four rooms for one night: one king and three doubles.

Also, our coffee machine in the room did not work the first morning, and so we told the concierge who said that it would be fixed or replaced, and then later in the day he said it was replaced. So the next morning, we try to use the coffee machine and it didn't work and we're standing there trying to figure out how this didn't work until we embarrassingly call room service to say that we can't figure out how to work the coffee machine, and then they said they never replaced it in the first place.

I was booked into the same style single King Bed NS suite in which I stayed a couple of years ago and was pleasantly suprised to see some overall improvements in the room and hotel since my last stay. The curbside staff were very helpful and checked my baggage upon exiting my taxi. The front desk staff were very courteous and helpful at check-in and my bags were in my room by the time I returned from a short walk to the store. The room itself appeared brighter and more updated since my last stay. The bathroom, though not large, was thoroughly adequate and the addition of a glass shelf above the sink/counter was a helpful touch. Like many older hotels there was no bathroom fan, however. There was not a full thermostat in the room, just settings for cool/hot and hi/med/low fan speeds but it seemed perfectly adequate for climate control. Decent mini-bar and snacks, but no Splenda or natural Stevia sweetner for coffee - only the dubious aspartame or cyclamate sweetners. Although every hotel with Lodgenet or similar entertainment options doesn't go out of their way to provide a full selection of basic cable channels, the selection at the Royal York wasn't bad - although I don't understand why they didn't have the cooking channel or food channel as these might likely increase traffic at the onsite restaurants and/or room service:) The hotel connects to the underground PATH walkway that connects most of the major downtown building and shopping centres, but be warned that the financial district in which the Royal York is situated is pretty dead on the weekends. Also, getting through Union Station and finding your way back onto the PATH system is rather confusing - even the polite lady Transit Officer I asked for directions could not clearly indicate how to get through Union Station. Nonetheless, the hotel has some great amenities nearby - 2 blocks over you will find a Longo's megastore complex that includes a boutique wine store, an LCBO, a wine tasting bar, and a Starbucks. If you're looking for organic, though, be advised that although Longo's is akin to Whole Foods, the organic selection of fresh produce is limited to a rather small section along a back wall - ask for specifics when you get there. The Royal York fitness facilities are pretty decent with a good sized pool and good selection of cardio and weights. The Concierge was very helpful and the Business Centre is well-equipped with helpful staff, but don't expect late night hours as noted by another reviewer. That being said, I had an early morning (4AM) check-out and the front desk and curbside were both well staffed and very helpful.

Plenty of nice restaurants within a 10-15 minute walk. Dhaba on King St has the best Indian food I have ever eaten. I hope to get back to Toronto but next time will probably stay in a hotel 6-8 blocks north as our interests revolve more around museums, etc than CN Tower, entertainment district, etc. Great city and very easy to navigate (and I get lost EVERYWHERE).", "title": "Nice for 1st Visit to Toronto", "user": "Westshore", "date": "July 6, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 34063742}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled solo", "text": "I've been traveling to downtown Toronto from NYC since I was 14 (and that was a verry long time ago!)
