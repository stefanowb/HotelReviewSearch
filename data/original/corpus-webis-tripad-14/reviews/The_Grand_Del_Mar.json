Quite simply, if u didn't rate it 5/5 after staying there - your either incredibly fussy or extreamly hard to please. All the staff were courteous and polite - although we are not millionaires we were treated like guests and did not feel out of our league or our depth. Being from Australia, we wanted to see as much of the area as we could - and everything was top class. The golf course was magnificent to play, and all the added extras that the hotel provided - from chilled water on the course, to biscuits and cool lemonade in the foyer made the trip even more special. What really surprised my wife and I was every member of staff there called us by name, which was a lovely touch, and knowing we were on our honeymoon, when we checked out the front desk had organized a wedding gift for us. Now, back in beige, boring sydney whenever we light the beautiful sented candles we recieved I think of the wonderful time we had at the Grand Del Mar. I tell all my friends of it and we are saving to fly back to America just to have a week there again. Thank you Grand Del Mar, you made a newlywed couple feel incredibly special!!!!

I wouldn't describe it that way. Prior to this we stayed at Miami's brand new St Regis in Bal Harbour followed by the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA. The Grand Del Mar is streets ahead of both. I would describe this hotel as actually being one of the best hotels in the USA. I gather it is privately owned. All I can say is that the owners clearly know exactly what they want and how to get it. Their hotel is extraordinary. We are on day 2 of a 4 night visit staying on the first floor. My family love this hotel. I particularly appreciate the exceptional attention to detail. Restaurant Amaya food is the best we've had in the last 20 days during which we've been in the USA. We wished we had stuck to Amaya instead of going to Prada tonight, which looked good with ok service but food awful. In particular, I highly appreciate the oversized and very well spaced out dining tables at Amaya.....as well as the service. Also, the concierge team are co-ordinated exceptionally well. Everything is perfection. Quite honestly, I'm stunned. I try to discover hotels of this quality but rarely manage it as so few exist. The property is exquisite and brilliantly managed......with many exceptional staff all over the place. For instance bar manager Humberto is an absolute gem. Housekeeping is nothing short of best ever. This hotel is up there with hotels such as Sandy Lane in Barbados and Coworth Park in Ascot (the UK's best country house hotel).

The spa was fine, but I've definitely seen bigger and better appointed ones - my deep tissue massage was wonderful. The pool was wonderful and my nieces appreciated having it practically to themselves, something I understand is very unusual as this hotel is normally at capacity. The grounds are spectacular and well appointed, I highly recommend the trail ride which provides a unique view of the property ($130 for 1 hour). The kids loved playing tennis, and rackets were provided free of charge. Everyone went out of their way to be helpful, often anticipating needs before we even thought of them - they've definitely been trained in the Apple school of thought and it shows. The food was very underwhelming - a lack of any quality ingredients (nothing local or organic). Addison had a few quality ingredients, but for the price I expected a lot more. Amara was adequate but nothing was particularly impressive. Room service was late both mornings and practically inedible - total waste of money.
