As far as accoutrements it had everything I anticipated. Most hotels/motels charge for Wi-Fi, doesn't matter if they are $900 a night rooms. The staff was friendly & attentive. This is an OLD building but has been RECENTLY redone, if you want a new hotel feel opt for elsewhere. Old hotels are NOTORIOUSLY smaller than their newer counterparts; that being said I found the room comfortable and the infrastructure more than satisfactory. As far as location, make sure that you examine what you want to do in Portland before you book ANY hotel room. I found this hotel close enough to everything without being in and amongst the hullabaloo/traffic. I found it very accessible, please keep in mind Portland is a city meant to be WALKED not driven.

The service especially stands out. From the moment we arrived the valet attendees were incredibly nice and also when we left offered us cold bottles of water for the road. The room was larger than expected and had soothing music playing when we entered. Additionally, not only was there a \"Pillow menu\" but also an \"Ipod menu\" which we had never seen before (if you forgot/don't have one they will deliver one to your room with arranged playlists).
