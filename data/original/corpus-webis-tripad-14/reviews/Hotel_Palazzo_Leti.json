The museum ticket did not get us into every museum, and earthquake repairs (from the 1997 earthquake) meant that other museums had restricted access. The included two \"best\" dinners were wonderful, although one of them kept us to a \"set menu\". The other one \"Il tempio del Gusto\" was just magnificent!!
