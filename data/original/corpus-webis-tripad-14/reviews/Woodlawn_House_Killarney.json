This is such a lovely place. It is very home like. Traveling with two other friends and we all had a beautiful stay at this B&B. The rooms were clean, nicely decorated...and very comfortable. Amenities are available.....including a spa services. The hostess was very helpful and friendly....and quite the cook. The breakfast in the morning was remarkable. It is centrally located. The view from our bay window was awesome...and we sat in the window drinking tea on one rainy afternoon and still felt like we were doing something special. I felt so much at home here that when I return to Ireland with my family, we will stay here.

Unfortunately for us, I don't think it lived up to it's reputation. The good: Rooms were large and clean. Shower pressure was better than I have at home. Location is about a 10-15 minute walk into town or to Killarney National Park. Lots of parking and breakfast was also good, when we had the opportunity to have it.....The \"Not So Good\": I found the hostess to be less than welcoming (but I am not even sure this was Ciara, because she never introduced herself). Upon arrival we asked if there were any restaurants open for Good Friday. She was not sure, but gave us a few names of places that were possibilities. Unfortunately, we had never been to Killarney and had no idea where these places were without a map or directions. No big deal though, as we like to explore. Next morning...breakfast is served 8-10. We arrived downstairs at 9:20 only to learn that the clock in our room was wrong and it was 10:20 and breakfast was over. Coming off our transatlantic flight we hadn't set one of our own alarms, which I know is our mistake, but I thought some cereal or a muffin would at least be offered, but no. She named some places again in town, but we still have no idea where they were. That night our sleep was terrible. We didn't notice the first night how uncomfortable the bed was in Room 19 because we were so tired, but the second night we had our worst night sleep of the whole trip. The bed couldn't have been more uncomfortable. Upon check out though, I think our hostess tried to redeem herself a bit. She actually gave us a map and some advice on which roads to take for our drive through the Dingle Peninsula. Maybe she was having a bad couple days, but I will say that there are 20+ B&B's on Muckross Rd on the way into town that would have had more comfort and service for the same cost.", "title": "I don't know if it should be rated #2 in Killarney...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jcro17", "date": "April 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 62026306}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Ciara Roche and her staff made our stay comfortable from the moment we made our reservations.
