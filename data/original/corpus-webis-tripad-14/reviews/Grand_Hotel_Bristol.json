On to our room; the view was amazing, right down the full length of Lake Maggiore, and we had a lovely balcony where we had breakfast on several mornings. However, behind the veneer the hotel is clinging to faded glories. Little things were not quite right. Although our room was adequate, the furniture was antequated, the air conditioning only went so low and then no futher, and although we had a shower fitment we had no shower screen! So we showered very carefully so as not to soak the whole bathroom! The staff were really helpfull and friendly but, appart from breakfast, we only ate in the restaurant once, for dinner. The food was OK but no more. We enjoyed our stay, but we left feeling that with a good bit of refurbishment this hotel could pass from being OK to being truly wonderful.

We had no problems. The hotel is well staffed, comfortable and ideally located being only a slow 10 mins walk from the town centre.The staff were very professional and smartly dressed in the hotel uniforms and I can see that some people may perceive this as cold or unfriendly as mentioned in some previous reviews but despite this, we found all the staff treated us as special quests and in particularly the restaurant staff who treated us as individuals had a laugh with us, were friendly and gave excellent service throughout making our stay and holiday more special. Breakfast and evening meals was always something to look forward to each day. We stayed half board but there are plenty of excellent places to eat in town. The hotel food was very good indeed and all appeared to be fresh and cooked excellently. The weather was hot and sunny during our stay, so we ate outside on the large terrace for Breakfast and Dinner with a lake view; wonderful but you can eat inside if you prefer as the dining rooms were very large and had plenty of tables and space. Breakfast was buffet style, plentiful and a lots of variety with the usual hot and cold items, juices; tea and coffee served at your table. The evening meal was always a four courses, H'orderves (buffet, help yourself), four choices from the menu for your next two courses (served) followed by dessert again from the buffet and help yourself. All the food was good and always had a choice of fish, meat and a veg option. The wine was good and reasonably priced. We always went for 1/2 a bottle of house red/white at 11 Euro's which was adequate. A full bottle was 19 euro's which you could make last over two nights as the staff will keep it chilled for you for the next meal. You can ask for a jug of ordinary tap water with ice without any additional charge or the usual push to purchase bottled water at some extortionate price as is often the case with some hotels. However, if you prefer bottled water at a charge that is also available. Sorry, I don't know the price. The room we had (232) was spacious and well equipped with a safe, TV with the usual, Sky, CNN, BBC World, True Entertainment and assorted channels, extra pillows and blankets.We had two balconies, a double and single with three tables and six chairs to ourselves as the room was at the end on the corner of the hotel with one balcony looking over the hotel grounds and outdoor pool and the other with a lake view, brilliant. The bathroom was good with a bath/shower, bidet, sink toilet with hairdryer and shaver socket, etc. The room was clean and cleaned daily with fresh sheets, etc.All the pool and spa facilities and gardens were immaculate and clean.

Soooo, outside noise (road traffic, boat/launch engines and very slightly in the distance the trains) can be expected during the day but quietens down at night and is hardly noticeable if all the windows are shut as it is all double glazed. We didn't find the noise intrusive at all after the first night and I'm a light sleeper. However, as mentioned by other reviewers, if it is unbearably hot at night as it can be in Italy and your air-con doesn't work properly or is switched off and you need to sleep with the windows open, then it could be an issue but I have stayed in worse in the past where the noise as been very penetrating and a problem with sleepless nights; so I wouldn't bother too much about it.

The Bus Stop/Terminus is where the (Dotto Train tours pick-up) easy to find and use for just 3,05 Euro's single; 38 Euro's each using the Holiday company mmmmmmmm!!!. Orta is a small beautiful town by the lake (3 hours to do the lot) and the Tour company can't do anything more by coach than the public bus does and they want 38 Euro's. The public S A F bus leaves Stresa at 10 am ( it seems very reliable as others from the hotel had discovered this little gem of a service) takes an hour over the top of mountain and drops down on the other side; lovely little trip and leaves Orta at 15.00pm or 18.00pm, please yourself for 6,10 Euro's and a spot of lunch.

The indoor pool area (which is reached by the most bizarre side-ways moving elevator I've ever come across) was rather shabby with mould on parts of the wall and ceiling.
