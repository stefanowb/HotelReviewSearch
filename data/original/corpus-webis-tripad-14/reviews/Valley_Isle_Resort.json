We were able to compare it to other units (Royal Kahana, next door, The Whaler, and yes, even the Grand Wailean-which I didn't find so grand) because my sister had her wedding on Maui (hence the Grand Wailian comparision). This unit was by far the best value for the money. All the other units had what was descibed as an ocean view room, but really as best as I can describe it, they were side ocean view. That is, if you stood looking streight out their windows, you were looking at another building, not so at Valley Isle, it's windows look straight out at the ocean, as wells as Molokai, absolutly beutifull view, and because the building faces this way, it catches all the wind, you do not need air conditioning (which this condo does not have). The unit we stayed at also had everything you needed except cloths and food, everything-washer/drier, dish washer, snorkeling gear, soap for washing-dishes, body, cloths, all cleaning gear, a whole bunch of travel guides- including 2 road to hana guides. The only thing we didn't like about it was the lack of air conditioning (which really wasn't needed), and the building is not a \"secure\" building, that is you can walk anywhere in the buiding without a key (except into your room, of course). My parents stayed at the Whaler, which was twice as much, and their room was really similier to our room, which really made me feel quite good! The beach is better at the Whaler, but for the price you will probably have a really hard time beating Valley Isle.", "title": "Very, Very Nice at half the price!", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "tnti15", "date": "June 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5343097}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was our first stop on our honeymoon in Hawaii and we were pleasantly surprised by the Ocean Front accomodations. We stayed in room 707 and booked directly through the owners who were very helpful and gave us great directions and suggestions on \"what to do\" on the island. We got pretty spoiled listening to the surf every night since this was on the only ocean front room we had on our vacation. Our room was also stocked w/ a lot of \"extras\" like a cooler, boogie board, and lots of supplies in the kitchen (although we didn't use the kitchen at all!). The building is on the older side (probably 60's or 70's) but for the price we paid (about 1/3 of the other places were were looking at and those weren't even ocen front), I'm not going to complain. Oh, it should be noted that there really isn't a \"beach\" out front... you can walk up and down the beach but it's too small (as in too close to the water) to lay out or hang out but we found a bunch of different beaches close to the area.
