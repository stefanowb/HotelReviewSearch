The staff were helpful and friendly. The resort is fairly new and the rooms are clean and comfortable, A car is needed as the hotel is located a distance from everywhere else. Once on the property it is a 10 minute drive to the hotel. The Shor restaurant was delicious. We did not like the Medi for dinner. The breakfast buffet is worth it. They will even give you a to go bag. Every morning we packed a picnic lunch free for the day and the staff was eager to help us. There is a pizza place that serves sandwiches and pizza.It was yummy and a nice break from eating expensive.

We were able to get a second room for our kids at half-price by calling Hyatt to reserve, which significantly enhanced our relaxation quotient. This is a perfectly executed 4-star resort - the layout feels like a 5 star but they make appropriate cut-backs that you don't really notice to keep prices down. We spent 4 days here and that was enough - by check-out we had eaten everywhere, played everywhere and generally absorbed the full vibe - if we had stayed longer I think we would have gotten bored because the hotel is very far from everything (45 minutes from the airport and 20 minutes to town so unless you rent a car you are kind of trapped).", "title": "A perfect 4 star calibre beach vacation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ChiquiMonster", "date": "November 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146388703}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012", "text": "The beach was lovely - nice soft sand, big, not crowded, plenty of chairs and shade under beautiful trees, our kids spent hours seated in the shallow, calm water building sand castles.

Nothing novel or gourmet, but good. Rooms and bathrooms were clean, new, nice and spacious. We had a \"premier water view\" on the 4th floor which is probably ideal - you have a nice view of the beach and waterway - I think these views are actually better than views of the ocean and the rocky landscape below. We didn't really use our balcony much, but they all have 2 chairs, a table and a ceiling fan.
