Questionable clientele with beer bottles eveywhere. its such a shame that the beach was a giant ashtray, cigarette butts everywhere! Same for the pool area. WHY???

Our two-year old had a blast playing on the beach and there was enough room that he was able to run around without us having to be right behind him all of the time. They had a snack bar right by the beach that made it convenient to get a quick breakfast or lunch. The rooms are very much Adirondack motel-ish and were very clean and comfortable.

This place is great for families with children ages approx 16 and under. Yes this place is dated and could use a facelift, but then you would be paying a whole lot more. Positives: It's close to the center of town (10 min walk) Every room has a lake view from their porch. It has a large lake front with beautiful views(Much better then all the other motels I looked at) The kids loved the pool which has a 3ft section and an 8ft section( Bring your rafts and beach balls, nobody bothers you about it, which is nice). It has the cheapest rates around. The rooms were clean. It has a boat launch which one of the guests told me was cheap. An arcade adjacent to the bar( so you can keep the kids occupied while enjoying a cold beverage while watching a sporting event) I found the staff very friendly. The rates are fairly cheap compared to other motels on the lake. They have a playground which the kids loved. The bar has a pool table and an electronic dart board. The bartender was nice and friendly. They sell discounted tickets to Great Adventure and Water Slide World. Small refrigerator in every room. World. Negatives: The rooms are older with wood paneling and blue carpeting. There is a slight musty smell in some of the rooms but not too bad. Their beach could use a raking in some parts .(my son loved making sand castles). No coffee pots in the room. The bar is only open Thursday, Friday and Saturday 4pm to approx 11pm. The bar didn't have many people so i can understand the hours. The beer and drink prices were pretty good. $3 dollars for a bottle of Budweiser. The clam infestation the previous post talked about pertains to all of lake George and not just Scotty's. The lake is safe to swim. We observed many people in the lake. The Bottom Line: If your looking to have a great time with your family without having to spend a lot of money and if your looking for a nice pool and being close to town; this place is for you. If your a picky person seeking a modern room with modern amenities and money is no object; You should try somewhere else.", "title": "Great for Families", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JimboF", "date": "August 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 138593276}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "This motel is the worst place that I ever stayed in. No wonder why they don't show what the rooms look like on their website because they are horrific. I should have known better to stay at a place where they don't show what the rooms look like. When we arrived at the motel the people were not friendly at all. When we arrived at our room we were mortified.It was tiny and it smelled like mildew. I wish we could have went somewhere else. But I told my kids and myself that it's just for the night that I we wont be in here long. Well when we got back to the motel, after a long day of fun activities, all we wanted to do was to sleep. But when we lifted the sheets there was a spider in one of the beds. I was so grossed out but there was no one else in town that had vacancies. we were kind of stuck here. Good thing we brought blankets from home. We wrapped in the blankets afraid of what else might be under there. After a horrible nights sleep we woke up to take showers. The bath room is small for 6 people. The nozzle to the zink sprayed all over the place so we had to keep it on a little stream. The shower was the same. There was no shower head just a pipe hanging out of the wall. and the water coming out, came out in spurts. and then soaked the floor because the nasty showers liner was to short. After the struggle of trying to shower 4 kids and 2 adults we were ready to leave. We checked over the room and made sure the kids had all their stuff. When looking on the floor we noticed that under and near the beds were crumbs and other nasty things left behind by previous people who rented there. Apparently they don't vacuum, dust or clean that place for cobwebs. My son found a worm in his room. Yes a worm. By that time I just wanted to get out of that place. I told the lady at the desk and all she said was I will let housekeeping know. Really. Never would I recommend this place and if you are smart rent somewhere else.", "title": "Dirtiest motel ever!!!!

Unfortunately, my in-laws loved this place and I had the misfortune of staying here for weekend visits over three summers. It is located in the village, but you must walk up a very steep hill in the parking lot that we refer to as \"the hill of death.\" It's not so bad on your own, but pushing a stroller and toting a toddler make it unbearable. The hotel rooms are musty and dirty. They often have ant problems. They don't give you enough towels or TP. The showers are terrible. One year in the extreme heat, the a/c even conked out. The pool is shabby. The playground is about the only redeeming thing about this dump of a hotel! The worst part is that the hotel is expensive! if for some reason you must stay here, choose the rooms closer to the lake towards the back of the hotel. They must have gone through a mini-renovation and are poor, not terrible! Also, the staff is not friendly. There was a bartender at the bar/concession stand who was confrontational for no reason.
