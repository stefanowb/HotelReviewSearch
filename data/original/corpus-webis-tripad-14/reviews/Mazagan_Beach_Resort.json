I then rang to book the hotel after getting the flight information in order first. The second call I was given completely different prices. My husband then called back again to clarify the situation to be given a third price which was fine. We booked the hoilday and we all were very excited as we have always wanted to visit Morocco. When the e-mail confirmation came through the prices were vastly more expensive per day than what was quoted over the phone.

The pool has sufficient chaises-longues (lounges chairs) and attendants are very courteous and responsive (bring towels, open umbrellas). I did think though that people should not be allowed to 'reserve' their place by leaving a book and then go off to breakfast. The hotel also has a gorgeous private beach (also with nice chaises-longue and attendants) and a kids pool. Although we did not use the baby club we did visit and it looked very professional. The food is a bit average but this is often the case in resorts. We wanted a resort holiday and it was the perfect one. The hotel is expensive but its ammenities live up to the price and make you just want to stay there. If sightseeing is the goal, I would not book the Mazagan but for restful holiday- recommended!
