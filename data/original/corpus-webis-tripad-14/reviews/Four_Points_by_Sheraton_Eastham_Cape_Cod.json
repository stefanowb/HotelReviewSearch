At first I was skeptical because some of the previous reviewers complained about the odor of chlorine & my husband has asthma & I was concerned. I called the hotel, as reviewers advised, & requested an upstairs room (the hotel has 2 floors). We did not smell any chlorine at all. The only down side to the 2nd floor is that there is no elevator. That was not a problem for us, but if you are unable to climb approximately 10 stairs & carry your luggage up (although the front desk said they would assist us with the luggage, we didn't need the help) I would not advise the 2nd floor. I asked my husband if he noticed anyone in the rooms next door. He said he had. The reason I asked is that I heard no noise whatsoever. The room appears to be soundproof! My husband used the fiitness center & was very pleased. The only problem (& it wasn't that big of a deal) is that some of the machines had TV's & if you didn't have head sets you could not hear. So please bring headsets if you plan on working out. The room was a very nice size and appointed quite well. We did not use the pool, but it was a beautiful looking area. My only complaint is the lack of ligthing on the balcony. The balcony overlooks the indoor pool & with the overhang it tend to be dark. I was able to read out there, but not easily.", "title": "A Pleasnt Stay", "user": "gayler104", "date": "July 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 17577581, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, room size", "disliked": "\u2014 For disabled travlers they would be unable to stay on the 2nd floor"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Ended up here with Priceline at an extremely reasonable rate.
