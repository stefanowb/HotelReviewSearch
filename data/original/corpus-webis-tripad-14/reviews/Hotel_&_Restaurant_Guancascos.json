For about $22 a night, we spent 2 nights in a tidy, attractively finished room on a hill slightly above Gracias tastefully enclosed by tropical gardens. The rooms were bright and stayed cool during the hot days, and it was nice to have a comfortable bathroom with hot water in the shower. The restaurant is a good place to run into other travelers and overlook the town, and the central location means there are enough restaurants, comedors, and basic needs nearby. Frony, the Dutch owner of the hotel, is a great resource too. She is fluent in English and Spanish (and I imagine Dutch, though I don't know what else!). She started a school in the area some years ago, and she knows everyone. She helped me and my wife arrange a two day trip in the middle of our stay to Celaque, providing a guide, transportation to and from, entrance fees, and the gear (tent, rain cover, sleeping bags, pot, utensils, butane stove) for a reasonable price. ($100 for everything / less per person if you have more people / a good deal when you consider all the costs for gear, entry, transportation, and the guide). Anyway, if you're going to Gracias, you're probably going to Celaque, which is a stunning, dramatic park of high peaks, varied forests (pine, liquid amber, cloud forest, scrub), strange vistas, waterfalls, and the like. Gauncascs makes an excellent stopping point for all of that.", "title": "Best choice in Gracias and for Celaque", "user": "Mayatan", "date": "November 29, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 88519039}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I have been to this hotel twice and I realised they are making a lot of improvements, They are trying to get a sustainable tourism certification, and rooms have been improved.
