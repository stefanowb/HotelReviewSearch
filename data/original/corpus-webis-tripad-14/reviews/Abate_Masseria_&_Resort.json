It is a perfect location for exploring the countryside. We had a Junior suite with it's charming bed under the conical roof of the trulli, a living room, bath and a second bedroom (which we used for our luggage). There was a table and 4 chairs outside in a private walled patio just steps from the very large and well maintained pool. The suite was charming, clean, and spacious. The shower was a little small, but not uncomfortable, and no smaller than many 4 star hotels in Italy. We only ate breakfast at the restaurant adjoining the hotel, so I can't comment on it's quality, other than breakfast was more than adequate. Proprietors are welcoming and helpful, grounds beautiful, location quiet and peaceful and a short drive into town.

The pool is incredibly large and beautiful. The seating (a mix of regular and lounge chairs) was plentiful and provided the option of either sunning or sitting in the shade of the beautiful trees surrounding it. The rooms were pristine- quiet and private. Some of us stayed in the trulli, others in the comfort rooms. Both types were incredibly charming and super clean. A lot of attention to detail was put into every inch. The restaurant served fabulous food. It is a little far to walk into town, but I wouldn't let that be a deterrent from staying here.

Great location to explore Puglia (I highly suggest you check out Alberobello, Locorotondo, Martina Franca, Lecce, Matera, the Castellana Grotto, Bari Vecchia). Trulli converted into comfortable, spacious, modern rooms, beautiful pool, gardens, fantastic breakfast buffet and restaurant.

So are the owners of the hotel. They make you feel at home in a non-intrusive way, but they are there when you need help or advise. When booking the hotel I first hesitated because it is located outside Noci (about 35 minutes walk to the town centre). But when calling them on the day of my arrival, they offered me immediately to collect me from the train station and they also gave me a lift back upon my departure. But once you are there you don't feel any urge to leave the place anyway. The rooms are large, well furnished and equipped and the trulli-rooms are very special and romantic. Every room has it's own forecourt with table and chairs, were they serve everything, if you ask them. Their restaurant is very good (listed in the Micheline Guide), not expensive and you can order only one dish, if you are not too hungry. On the only day the restaurant was closed Angelica took me with her own car to a good restaurant near Noci, and collected me after lunch to take me back to the hotel! What more can you ask for?
