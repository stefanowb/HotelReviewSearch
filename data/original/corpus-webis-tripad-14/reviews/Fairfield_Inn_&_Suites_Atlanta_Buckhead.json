We booked it because it had a great price for the weekend (~$110/night). This property is hands-down the most well-maintained Fairfield that I have ever stayed at (and I frequently stay at Marriott properties!). It sits near the corner of Piedmont & E Paces Ferry. Perfect location that is convenient to Lenox Mall, which is only about a 7 minute drive away. There are several nice cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The property itself has a HUGE parking lot. No scrambling to find a parking space before night falls. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. The lobby was small, but the furnishings were clean and comfortable. The breakfast area was large, and the morning offerings were plentiful. Waffles, danishes, biscuit sandwiches, fruit, cold cereal, yogurt, juices, coffee, etc. This Fairfield has 5 floors and 2 elevators. The rooms are small-ish, but the furnishings were immaculate. The bedding was comfortable, and the shower in the bath had excellent water pressure. The rooms do have long 'hallways' from the room door, so the bed isn't visible when the door is opened. This was kind of wasted space (imho), but only a minor downside to the excellent accommodations.
