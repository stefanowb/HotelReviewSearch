The Hilton doesn't look like much from the outside but definitely makes up in the interior what it lacks on the exterior.

The rooms had a smart design and great use of space with faux hardwood floors, sofa, cocktail table, utility desk and modern marble bathrooms.

The hotel has a really cool bar called Galaxy that offers balcony seating and a stunning view of the Acropolis especially at night when it is all lit up -even the locals hang out there. The drinks are overpriced (if you do the conversion from Euro to USD) but my advice is to always buy liquor when you land and there are several reasonably priced package stores in Omonia which is not too far away. The hotel is about 15 minutes walking distance from Syntagma square so we were able to walk just about everywhere. If you are not into walking much or visit in the summer when its just too hot, the Evangelismos station is only about five minutes walking distance away so the hotel is in a convenient location. In fact, we even took the metro system from Evangelismos station to the airport and it was about a 45-minute trip.
