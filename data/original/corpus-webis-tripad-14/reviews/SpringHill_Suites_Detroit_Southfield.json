The rooms were wonderful - very clean, very comfortable bed, mini fridge, microwave and a shower that actually had great water pressure!!! The morning breakfast (included with room rate) was very good - waffles, oatmeal, eggs, biscuits & gravy, bagels, muffins, cereal, fresh fruit etc. The quality & quantity of food was excellent! We played in the pool and it was very clean - the water was a little cold, but that is coming from someone who hesitates to go in their own pool at home unless the water is above 85 degrees!! Our 4 year old grandson didn't seem too bothered by the temperature! The check in and check out process was flawless and quick.
