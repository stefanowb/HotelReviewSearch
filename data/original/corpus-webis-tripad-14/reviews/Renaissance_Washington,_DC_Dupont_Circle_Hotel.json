Coffee pot made individual cups, very good but with Illy in the lobby we looked forward to that every morning. Beds were comfortable with extra down pillows immediately brought on request. Room temperature perfect. Staff were friendly yet respected privacy. Concierge was very helpful. The room had obviously been remodeled fairly recently and had a modern yet soothing decor. Finally, it was only 4-5 blocks from the blue line and 4-5 from the red line subways.
