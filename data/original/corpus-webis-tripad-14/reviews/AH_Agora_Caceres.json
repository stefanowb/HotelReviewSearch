Nobody mentioned the interesting parking lot which uses a car elevator: drive the car in, hit \"minus 2\", elevator descends to underground, door opens, drive out. You can even use rear hotel service elevator to bring your baggage to your car. This hotel is clean, modern and has a nice lobby with a big-screen tv. Breakfast was just so-so and could have been a bit fresher and better attended.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "beekay458", "date": "July 11, 2007", "id": 8103669}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "I loved watching the storks in Caceres.
