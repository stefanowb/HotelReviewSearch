Let me tell you what a beautiful facility it is! Yes, it is located next to the casino but there are no influences from the casino on the hotel (i.e. - no gaming machines in the common areas). The pictures of the suite we stayed in tell the whole story! Breakfast the following morning was fit for a king. You name it they have it! The other couple we were traveling with stayed in a standard room which was also well appointed and crisp with a very comfortable bed! Great place to stay!
