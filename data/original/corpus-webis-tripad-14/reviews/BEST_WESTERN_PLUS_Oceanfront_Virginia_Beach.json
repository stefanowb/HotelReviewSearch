We checked in with no problems, and had a room on the ground floor, which we absolutely LOVED. Yes, the hallways are warm, but they are filled with nothing but windows for your viewing pleasure, so which is it that people want? A warm hallway with a great view, or a cold, dark hallway? The room we had was not dirty, and the staff kept it stocked with towels and cleaned every single day we stayed. Parking was crazy, I can admit that, but if you look at the overall layout and structure of the beach front, the question is could they really get around it?? The answer is NO, because the ocean front property is littered with tons of buildings and hotels. So if you're going to stay here, just realize that this is in fact a VERY touristy area, so there are not a lot of spots for parking. Angelos on the Sea was very good to us, but every persons dining experience is different. They were extremely friendly, and very accomodating to us even when we came down right before closing, which is more than I can say for Catch 31, the restaurant in the Hilton. We enjoyed this hotel very much, especially the price for ocean front property, that could not be beat! That's the whole reason we wanted to stay here in the first place, so to us if they delivered on the beautiful view ... we were sold :)", "title": "Location Tops Stay!", "user": "Queenelizabeth79", "date": "October 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 45883015}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "this was a good motel but pool was across the street, and the maids stole from us two times the first time they stole my bathing suit, and the second time (this was after i reported them the first time) they stole my meds and I had to go and buy more. this was the only bad thing i can say about this motel though. also remember one thing...in june are the sand soccer championships and the beach was so crowded the day we got there it was horrible, we like to have never got into our room.

The young lady that was cleaning the rooms was very kind with a very good attitude and was helpful in every way. 804 was our room #. So if her boss so happen to read this then.... give her a raise!!

It was off-season and frigid but we had an amazing view of the ocean from our room. We could hear it, too, until the housecleaning staff decided to vacuum, clean and deodorize the chair cushions from our hall right in front of our room for the first 4 hours we were there! I called down to inquire when they would be done and was told \"shortly.\" After another hour, I asked the housecleaners when they thought they'd be done with another vague answer. No worries, we thought, we'll explore the beach, head out tomorrow after a nice hot breakfast, and check out the lighthouses and natural areas. The location of the hotel is perfect, the price was good, and the room was nice, even though I found a cigarette butt under the bed. We even went swimming--the pool is okay, not heated warm enough but there's a warmer section that's supposed to be like a hot tub. We were willing to overlook what had happened until they dropped the ball again the next morning. I called about breakfast at 9:47 and was told they closed it down at 10:00. I told the woman on the phone we'd be right down. We were all ready and headed down to find the door shut and locked! We asked the front desk about it and they said it was closed. We still had almost ten minutes! They knew how upset we were and would barely look at us. We went upstairs and I called the restaurant again until someone answered just to tell them that we had counted on the breakfast as a part of the hotel price . . . very convenient! As it was, we had to take our hungry toddler elsewhere . . . though we found a fantastic restaurant because of this incident. Basically, we know it was off-season. But every person we had contact with acted like we were imposing on them somehow, with surly attitudes to match. In all the places we've stayed, we've never been treated so poorly. What should have been a relaxing off-season exploration of Virginia Beach just left a bad taste in our mouths about this hotel and what they think of their guests. Not to worry, though, we won't trouble them ever again!", "title": "Won't impose on this hotel again!

The room was definitely not sound proof as I not only heard every sound coming from the drunks in the pool at 11pm but also the sensual sounds of the bed squeaking next door; loud and clear might I add! My girlfriend and I decided to drown out sound with louder sound so we just turned up our 2 TV's and finished watching Forrest Gump in 'ghetto' surround sound. Thankfully by 12:30 all sounds around us died out and I decided to finally get into the bed. My body still itches just thinking about how filthy that bed must have been. The moment I got into it, I was itching all over and thinking to myself, I should probably get tested for herpes after this, thankfully I was a little drunk from drinking earlier and ultimately fell asleep. I had to laugh at a sign that read \"if any items are missing from bathroom, it will go on your bill\"... i'm guessing their usual client\u00e8le steals all the towels. Overall, I did not feel I was staying at a Best Western, more like a really bad Motel 6. Only redeeming factor was that there was free Wi-Fi, that is why it gets one extra point on the rating! Not worth the low prices, I will learn my lesson and pay the extra $20 for a real hotel and not a re-badged motel.", "title": "It's never good when your 2nd floor room smells moldy and smokey...", "user": "Wombosi703", "date": "May 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 64769682}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I booked a room here based on the Best Western reputation, but the parking (or even standing) situation here was ridiculous.

The overflow parking garage across the street was equally jammed. The parking area itself was crowded with adults with kids milling around with no destination evident.

We also ate at breakfast at Pochantas Pancakes (35th st), good selection of food, and prices were resaonable as well, and did dine at Murphy's Irish Bar...we thought the place was just ok, but food was good. The weather was ok...it was overcast most of the time, but at least the rain held off at nite, and than cleared up, and than of course as we were leaving the sun came out...lol.

They didn't have balconies and NO ocean view at all, just a view of their little outdoor pool.). But we stayed in the ocean view rooms on the 7th floor. The only real complaints I had about this hotel was that the elevators needed servicing (4 elevators that were working when we got there on Monday, but only 2 were working when we left yesterday on Saturday when it was the busiest time). Parking right in front of the hotel is probably not going to happen but it takes only a minute to use the parking garage, and those slots at least are shaded! We saw one guy make his wife stand in a parking spot in front of the hotel for like 10 minutes while he was doing something with the car (we couldn't figure out what) and she actually stood there...guarding off people like they'd have to run her over to park there. Absurd really...it didn't take any time at all to walk across the street!
