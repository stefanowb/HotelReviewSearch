It was probably bigger than our house. There was a large kitchen/work area that had a kitchen table, a large desk, and a very large storage area behind frosted glass doors. Then there was a separate, very large living room with tv, then a separated bedroom with king size bed and large closet and tv. Then the bathroom which had a stand-alone tub, separate shower, 2 sinks and toilet with a door. The apartment was basically the entire side do the building. There were some basics to start you with in the kitchen like coffee, tea, and jam. There was supposed to be milk, bread, and butter but it wasn't there. When we asked the staff person apologized repeatedly and immediately ran out to get it for us. There was free parking right at the door. It was in a nice area. Interestingly we took a great tour of Warsaw (see my review for Get to Know Warsaw-totally awesome) and at one point we stopped right by the hotel to see places where bullet holes were still evident. There is a nice bakery right around the corner and a little market. This would be a great place to stay if you were going to be in Warsaw for a longer time. We stayed 3 nights and loved it. If you were staying longer I don't think you would want to leave!", "title": "A true home away from home, or better!", "user": "SJNK", "date": "August 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 172743688}], "location": {"country": "Poland", "region": "Central Poland", "continent": "Europe"}, "review_count": 1}
