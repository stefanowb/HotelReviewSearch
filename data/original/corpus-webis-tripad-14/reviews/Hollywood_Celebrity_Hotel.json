The location of this hotel is brilliant, withing walking distance of all the main attactions including the Hollywood Bowl. The hotel was decorated to a high standard and the celebrity themes in the rooms were fun. We were upgraded when we arrived to a suite with 2 large rooms and a great kitchenette, probably the best room we stayed in during our 11 hotel west coast tour. We would definutly revisit this hotel as it was a great base to explore Hollywood. Also there was free parking included.", "user": "happymeghappy", "date": "November 8, 2006", "id": 6085713}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Sparkling clean hotel", "text": "This is a wonderful hotel! I stayed here, with my girlfriend, for one night in the beginning of October and was very impressed with the location, service, and cleanliness of the hotel. It is small, charming, and has character. WiFi, parking, and a limited continental breakfast (juice, coffee, tea, and breakfast breads) are included in the room rate. I will definitely be back to this hotel in the future and am recommending it to all my friends, acquaintances, and co-workers.", "user": "rbeeson", "date": "October 23, 2006", "id": 5985405}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "good hotel but noisy", "text": "This is a good hotel, clean, big room, close to hollywood boulevard (1 mn walk ) and universal studios (5 mn with the subway), safe area, free parking, free breakfast (simple but with good muffins), nice restaurant nearby, almost perfect!

Great location, free parking available, though we didn't pick up our rental car til leaving LA.

In a quiet street just behind the Kodak theatre, Hollywood/Highland Mall and the metro station. Our room was an executive Queen and had plenty of room.

The rooms were huge (the bed was a kingsize!!) and had everything that we required \u2013 iron, hairdryers, fridge, plenty of towels, soap etc. The internet was free which was great as you could look up and book tours, attractions etc. The staff at the desk were lovely - cheerful, friendly and helpful. The breakfast every morning was great as was the constant supply of hot coffee. We had an issue with our toilet blocking and the staff were very apologetic about it and had maintenance there within 5 mins. The location couldn\u2019t be better \u2013 you are on a quiet side street but you walk 50mtres to the back entrance of the mall which is on Hollywood Boulevard and has Kodak theatre, Chinese theatre, tour buses and heaps of restaurants/food outlets. The metro stop is also under this mall. When we checked out we asked if they could store our bags for the day as we weren't flying out of LA until 9pm - no problem. When returned to pick up our bags on the way to the airport they were even happy for us to grab a quick shower in the fitness room. By far the best accommodation on our entire trip (france, Portugal, spain, Amsterdam).

I was told there was, I was refunded for the night at this hotel and charged for the night at the sister motel which was located at the end of the same block. The entire exchange took until 1am. Both clerks at both Hotels were friendly but neither offered more than verbal compensation for my displacement or troubles.

Granted he suggested we leave a window open, and even that we put a fan near the window. But if we had done so we may have gotten deathly ill or worse. What I do know of natural gas is from Avista. Avista (a power company in Washington state) has told its customers that if you smell natural gas, GET OUT! And stay out until their technicians can look at the problem. Not go inside your house and sleep on it until maintenance can look at it in the morning, oh and put a fan in the window.", "user": "Rocker_rep", "date": "August 22, 2006", "id": 5688184}], "location": {}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 31, "average": 154, "very good": 528, "terrible": 26, "excellent": 427}, "aka": "Hollywood Celebrity Los Angeles", "slim_ranking": 0.0865384615385, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "The Hollywood Celebrity Hotel is a superior tourist class hotel located in the heart of downtown Hollywood, the entertainment capital and theatre district.
