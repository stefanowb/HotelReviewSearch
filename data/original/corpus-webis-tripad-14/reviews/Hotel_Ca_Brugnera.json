While it shows four stars on its signage, it is much more a local old style hotel. Rooms are fully adequate and clean, bathrooms have all the needed amenities, including lots of hot water. Breakfast is very limited and space in the breakfast room does not encourage lingering over your cappacino. Staff is helpful, but instructions on how to operate the TV are inaccurate and it's just better to go down to the desk than attempt to call on the phone since there are no instructions on how to do that (no, you DON'T just dial \"O\").
