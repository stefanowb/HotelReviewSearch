The family suite works well for my family of five. We got a late start from Prescott and arrived about 10:30 pm to find out that our \"suite\" had been given away and we were given a smoking room with two double beds instead. We thought we might tolerate the room for one night, but we could barely breathe. Even though I am a HiltonHonors Silver member and had reserved my room with a HiltonHonors American Express card, they gave away my room to someone who had arrived earlier. Since no other rooms were available, we ended up relocating to another hotel at 11:30 pm.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "winsomeone", "date": "July 21, 2007", "id": 8213309}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We chose this hotel after reading reviews on this web site and because it's near the airport.
