The hotel is tucked away in a quiet residential part of the city - but just 15mins walk from the train station in the centre. The room was up some very narrow winding steps - and when we got to the top, not only was there a pretty lobby complete with teas, coffees and scrummy chocolates (pretty teacups and saucers) - and any additional toiletries and towels in a French-style cabinet - but an equally, creatively-designed double bedroom. The room was spacious, with a sofa and TV too. The bathroom large and again - pristine with all its decor carried out to the finest detail. Breakfast each morning was a real treat - complete with breads, muffins, pastries, eggs (how you like them), yoghurts, cheese, ham, cold rice puddings, fruit and freshly squeezed orange juice, incredibly good coffee, jams - and chocolate/coloured sprinkles (a Dutch trend for bread) . . the list goes on - as the mouth-watering breakfasts all varied each morning with at least four to five different things on the menu - AND by candlelight!

I highly recommend you purchase a Rotterdam Welcome Card to make it easier to get around. The bed & breakfast in itself is special. The colors and ambience of the place are wonderfully sweet & cozy. Our stay was made even more special by Johan's personal touch. A great guy, he made us feel as if we were visiting an old friend despite the fact that we had never met him until the day we arrived at his doorstep. The stairs are a bit steep but Johan was kind enough to help us with our luggage. The breakfast was delicious! He asked us what we wanted to eat, we said,just surprise us. And he did! Each day was different and delicious so we looked forward to coming down to breakfast each day. The rooms were rustic, cozy,and clean. Good wifi internet access.

We booked a couple of nights at het Hemelrijck on the strength of the previous reviews and were not disappointed. The B&B was immaculate, the room was extremely comfortable, and the breakfasts were freshly prepared and delicious. Everything was taken care of by our host Johan who was so friendly and made us feel really welcome. A lot of thought has obviously gone into the interior decor which is beautifully done and complements the house perfectly. The B&B is a traditional Dutch house so the stairs are typically steep, but that just adds to the charm and character of the place. The house is located on a quiet road, a short tram journey from the city centre and a short stroll from the local shops and cafes. There are two rooms, both on the top floor, one at the front of the house and one at the back. We had the room at the back and it was a real bonus to be woken in the morning by bird song instead of the traffic noise you might expect in a big city. This is a great B&B and it offers very good value for money.

We arrived late in the evening from 20C Athens to -5C snowy Rotterdam and immediately felt like home or even better. Johan is one of the nicest and most accommodating hosts out there and the B&B itself is one of those rare finds of an excellent stay at a great price. Rooms are done with exceptional taste and arranged with such care, you will feel like living in one of those places they show on design magazines and also be as comfortable and 'warm' as in your own place. If you like attention to the detail you will particularly appreciate it. Impeccably clean and quiet too, plenty of space and light in both rooms, you will want to spend time in your room just to relax and enjoy it even more. Large private bathrooms a huge plus. Breakfast is served in a beautiful kitchen that opens up on a balcony with garden views, we almost missed our whole morning there just because it was so relaxing, delicious stuff too. Location is great, very close to the tram stop, only a few stops away from Central Station and the city center. Neighborhood is also nice and quiet and there are two bikes available for guests.
