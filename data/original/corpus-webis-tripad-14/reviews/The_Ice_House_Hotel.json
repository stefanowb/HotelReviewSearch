I can honestly say that this was one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in, not just the fact that it is fabulously decorated, but that all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

From the moment we stepped into the Ice House we enjoyed an amazing stay. The service was perfect and all staff from the receptionist, bar staff and waiters were friendly but professional. We enjoyed a glass of bubbly on arrival as our bags were taken to our suite by the porter. As it was a sunny day we were then able to enjoy drinks on the terrace, the views are amazing and you really could be anywhere in the world. When we eventually got to our room we were completely blown away by the attention to detail and little luxuries. The Bartra suite has amazing views from numerous picture windows in the bedroom and separate sitting room. It is in the original building and retains its old world charm with antique furniture yet has all the modern facilities you would expect from such a top class hotel, the bathroom with its free standing wooden bath and luxury shower is filled with fabulous L'occitane products. We dressed for dinner and made our way to the bar where we enjoyed some wine while waiting for our table. The restaurant was fully booked yet the staff were efficient and friendly. The food was top class, I had heard that the portions are small but we did not find this. The homemade breads and sides with the mains meant that we were comfortably full after enjoying our four courses and still had room to enjoy some cocktails in the bar! The bed was total bliss and we enjoyed a delicious breakfast delivered to our room the next morning while lounging in the fluffy bathrobes that are provided. Overall it was 24 hours of pure heaven.
