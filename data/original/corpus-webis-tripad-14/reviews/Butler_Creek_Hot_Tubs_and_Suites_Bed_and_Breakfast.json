Linda is a wonderful host, and was very accommodating and knowledgable about the area, willing to go above and beyond for her guests. We stayed in the Carolina Suite and it was very spacious and comfortable, with its own separate sitting area and ensuite bath. Rooms were tidied everyday and breakfast was delicious: fresh fruit salad, yoghurt, granola, fresh baked fruit breads and a choice of breakfast entrees, incl. stuffed French toast, bacon & eggs, blueberry pancakes etc. The coffee was great too! We were there to cycle the area and tour the wineries...Linda checked in with us each morning to see what our plans were and offered us tasting vouchers for many wineries in the area. For a small $10 maintenance fee per person, you can borrow one of the B&B's 18 bikes (mountain and cruiser styles) for your stay. This is a huge cost savings compared to bike rentals in town.
