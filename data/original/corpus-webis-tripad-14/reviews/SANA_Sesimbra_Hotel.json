Our room was large enough and very comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. The internet worked great and breakfast was quite good as well. The hotel is not that hard to find, but parking is. So be prepared to use the hotel garage. We were lucky to be there on a not so busy evening. I suspect that during the busier times a spot in the garage might be an issue and street parking appeared to be hard to find. The seaside location is really convenient those \"beach walks\". The sound of the surf on the beach at night was quite nice, but, you can also get a fair amount of automobile noise and loud night owls returning to their homes or hotels. Thus keeping the doors closed keeps out that noise as well as the surf. There are a large number of good seafood restaurants near the hotel.
