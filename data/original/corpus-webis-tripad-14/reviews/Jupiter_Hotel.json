Located on a quiet street, it was within easy walking distance of Leidseplein (tram stop loaded with cafes, bars and restaurants), Vondelpark, and the museum square. My single room was quite small, but that's to be expected in a 2-star hotel in Europe. The bathroom was a good size with a great shower. As for the breakfast, there were boiled eggs, meats, cheeses, fruit, mini-croissants, cereal, and a few types of bread (including multi-grain) - hardly a disappointment in my opinion. I found the owners to be helpful and appreciated the internet access in the lobby. I would definitely consider Hotel Jupiter for a future trip to Amsterdam - had a wonderful time.", "title": "Perfect for my stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "galsolo", "date": "July 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5416716}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Rather expensive for poor standard", "text": "Pros:", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 17, 2006", "id": 5355698}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "-Great location near Leidseplein.

Walking into this place is cool -- it feels like you're going into someone's house.

I was excited about this because you can see people gardening, out on the deck, having dinner, like what regular Dutch people do. It was very serene and peaceful up there.

This hotel offers bed and breakfast, and is in the center of all attractions in Amsterdam. Yes, it is NOT in the HISTORICAL center of Amsterdam, but the major outgoing areas, the musea and concert hall, and all that I like a city for, are within walking distance. Despite of what I just read in another review, This hotel DOES have an elevator. I had a clean room, nice bed and a very complete European breakfast (buffet). Cerials, milk, oj, coffe, tea, 3 or 4 kinds of meat, cheese, sweet stuff, different kinds of bread, eggs etc.. Yep, NOT an American breakfast , but we're in this IS Europe. It is ran and owned by a family, and I really enjoyed their hospiltality and my stay. The stairs are steep, but that is normal in all original buildings in Amsterdam. And the rooms are not too big, but not too small eather. Good value for money. I do definetely recommend this.

I think that visitors have to go in knowing that this is a two-star hotel (i.e. no room service, etc. essentially a clean, comfortable place to stay) to be able to enjoy the amenities the hotel has to offer. The hotel is fairly small, and taken care of by an accordingly small though very kind and accomodating staff. Not sure how many floors there are in the place, maybe three or four including the ground floor, but there are about three rooms per floor. Our triple room was about 15-17 m2 containing two single beds and a queen, so it comfortably accomodated three people, and could do four if the queen is shared. The room had the essential private bathroom, television (which in Amsterdam means all kinds of international stations, though it might have been cable, I'm not sure...) closet, mirror, table and chairs, and a safe. Not the Ritz by far, but very comfortable, cozy, and clean. The bathroom is according fairly standard and small, equipped with complimentary soap and towels and things, and the shower (at least in our room) is very much integrated into the bathroom meaning that there is no curtain.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 19, 2004", "id": 1662095}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Ok at the Jupiter", "text": "Just have to make sure you don't point the removable showerhead everywhere in order to keep the rest of the bathroom dry. The stairs in the place are indeed very steep, though by what I could tell from the rest of Amsterdam, it's not all that rare and is a space-saving mechanism. So I would probably not advise this particular hotel to anyone who might have physical difficulties or disabilities, or who otherwise might have problems traversing steep stairs. A sit-down buffet breakfast is included in the room price, and again it's not a five-star meal, but it's complete and free! (well, included...)
