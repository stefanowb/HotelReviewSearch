Stella (former owner/present landlady in denise's temporary absence) welcomed us to the downstairs double, settled us in, and then suggested we visit Blind Jacks in the town centre. Great advice. We enjoyed geat beer and friendly company, and finished up with a special curry night at zolsha's in the main road. It's a lovely town, really worth a visit. Back at Newton House: the huge bed, beautiful throw, sparkly shower, tv, digital radio, hairdryer and soft towels were a real warm welcome. Breakfast was even better:: fruit, juices, cereals, hot plums, yoghurts, porridge with cream and whisky, smoked haddock, any sort of eggs, or full English. all with lashings of toast along with homemade marmalade and jam.. If there had been any stops, they'd been well pulled out for our visit! The hotel's recommended walks offered a chance to further enjoy the stuning scnery of yorkshire.

Arriving late and due to work commitments I had to get out by 0730. She rose early to make us breakfast and see us in our way. I stayed in many hotels during that 3 weeks in Harrogate and Knaresborough, as the Newton was sometimes booked, but whenever I came back to the NHH it felt like I was coming home. and the breakfasts... Homemade granola, stewed plums in cinnamon, and cooked treats such as eggs benedict, all cooked fresh... A real treat compared with the chain hotels that seem to serve en masse. And if you're worried that Knaresborough doesn't have much to offer, get down to the river and check out the beautiful viaduct/aquaduct (I never did find out)...and spend an afternoon otter spotting. And there's some great pubs. Favourites were Blind Jacks and the Mitre, but there's many to choose from. Knaresborough is charming.
