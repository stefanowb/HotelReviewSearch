The room was comfortable and clean although there was a strange tardas like unit in the bathroom which turned out to be a shower with the works - it was a shower, spa bath, steam room and radio all rolled into one. Hilarious and we enjoyed it but possibly not good for anyone who might struggle with climbing in and out of a large tub to have a shower. I thought the bed was a bit hard but my partner was really happy with it. We thought the breakfasts were reasonable, and there was a great deal of choice so even a picky eater would find something they liked.
