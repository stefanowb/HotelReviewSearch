Expectations (and price!) were for a 4 star hotel, but I would rate as a 2.5. The Good: Newly remodeled with great view if you pay for the HarborView rooms, which we did. The Bad: TV did not work, and once it was fixed, limited stations. Radio did not work. Iron was broken and made me late each day. Very poor housekeeping - shower was cleaned only 1 out of the 3 days and floor was not cleaned. Bedding was cleaned only 1 of the 3 days - found articles left in the bed after being made! Food at Bistro Cafe was poor and pricey. Coffee bar was not open as stated - closed when I went at 6:10 AM and at 5:30PM. Workout room was suppose to be open 24 hrs, but found it locked and was told it's closed Fri & Sat nights??? The visitor information they provided was wrong and ended up going to the Visitors Center across the street. Cost to use Internet, when I get it free at Hilton Garden Inn!

The staff were really very nice and I had great room service, not too pricey. I would recommend not staying on levels up to level 6 as there is a ceiling that traps all the noise in from the open plan hotel. The conference rooms were average and you could barely hear our speakers for the noise in the room next door. The business centre was incredibly expensive.
