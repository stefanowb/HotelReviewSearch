The service at Sandals was exactly as advertised; the employees were all friendly, courteous, and helpful. The property is well-maintained and very clean. We did have an issue with some ants in the bathroom of our suite, but when we brought it to the attention of the concierge, they began spraying daily (after offering us a different room, but the view was too fantastic to leave) and we did not see the ants again. The little black birds who frequent the breakfast buffet at Bayside were a little bit difficult to deal with, but we soon discovered that Mario's had the same breakfast options and was indoors. The highlight of our trip was definitely the work of the Entertainment Department. Emmanuel, Kevin, Shaunte, Shanice, MoJo, and Jacquay made our stay at Sandals so much fun! The daily activities like pool volleyball, movie trivia, flip cup, and beer pong helped us to meet other honeymoon couples who we later hung out with quite often. The nightly entertainment gave us something to do after dinner; my favorite was the movies by the fire pits on Friday nights!
