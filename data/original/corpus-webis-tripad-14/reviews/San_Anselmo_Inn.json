San Anselmo Inn was about the same price as the closest chain hotel but much better location and included breakfast. The rooms were no great shakes. But decent, relatively clean. The place could certainly use some rehab but all in all, I thought it was a good value. Plenty of restaurants and cafes in walking distance. Try Mi Pueblita a few blocks away for great Mexican food and stop and say hello to Ada at The Paper Pile behind the Inn.", "title": "Nice place, great location", "user": "lbmore", "date": "March 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 13992573}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Clean and cozy room", "text": "Thank you so much for having such a perfect room for me when I was there May 11-14!

The breakfast options were just right, especially those delicious raisin biscuits. I chatted with several girls in Housekeeping and they were friendly and polite. I could hear no outside noises in the room which was great.

The breakfast is the best! Alas, our children have moved from California, so we probably will not be back. But it was one of the best parts of our vacation. No old furniture and no bad odors.
