This time, despite the hotel not looking very busy, we were given a room overlooking the parking lot and major road so it was incredibly noisy. Several times we approached the front desk and no one was there. When we got to our room both keys were not operational. My husband had to conduct several conference calls in the morning so we asked that the room be made up after 12 noon. When we returned at 6pm the room was not made. We left again for the evening and when we returned at 11pm the room still was not made.. We tried to print our boarding passes and there was no paper in the printer and then, when we got the paper, the ink cartridge was empty. All small inconveniences that added up to a poor experience.", "title": "Will Try The Best Western Next Time", "user": "merjoe", "date": "December 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 189024621}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our 4th stay at this Fairfield Inn in Charlotte and it was as excellent as we expected. The entire staff including Jamie at the front desk, the breakfast room attendants and the housekeeping staff could not be more friendly or helpful. We were welcomed back as if we were family returning home, and that is exactly the feeling you get. The suite we stayed in was spotless and inviting with everything working properly. Every part of the hotel is exceptionally clean, well maintained and very welcoming.
