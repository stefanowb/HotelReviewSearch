First of all Gili Meno itself is heaven on earth- Just a tiny little island with some great beaches and a laid back vibe. we went over to Gili Trawangan for the day, an knew we had made the right choice to stay on Meno. The sunset Gecko is an eco-friendly place with outdoor showers that recycle the water- you're given natural soap on arrival. There is a snorkelling spot right out the front, and I spent many days simply floating along, following turtles and admiring the coral. The food served there is amazing, and we watched as fresh seafood was delivered, and we chose our meal for the night. The staff are amazingly friendly and became friends to us during our stay, some of us still keep in touch on facebook! I cannot say enough good things about this place- I absolutely loved it, and I know one day I will be going back!!!", "title": "The Highlight of one month in Bali and Lombok!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lovebeachtravel", "date": "December 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121474436}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Me and my partner stayed here for 5 nights in November, 2011 and had a wonderful time.

It's a little bit of a task to actually get to the place, but it's well worth it in my opinion. Everyone was so friendly and helpful, we really felt at home and were sad when it came time to leave. The airlines had lost one of our group member's luggage en route and we were really impressed by how helpful the staff was. They called the airline twice on our behalf and even called the boat my friend was out diving on when it arrived.

When I arrived at the place, I looked at the building with wonder. Oh beautiful, with a quit surrouding n private beach... But then when went to the room, the facts came. The actual building is a wooden building ... In the room for single they just put a thin cover on top of the floor with a mosquito net. That's all. In twin room they provide 2 wooden bed with thim matras. The bed linen was actually a rug, n during my three days stay, they haven't even changed it. The room floor is never wept. Dust everywhere. And you can see spidernet everywhere over the roof. The light is so low so you almost cannot read anything, the open window system (which are not easy to close) invited hundred mosquitos. The beach is ok... But there are many more beautiful side also in Gili Meno. The access is so difficult, the transport only a horse cart, and you can waiting for hours. The easiest access by walking takes around 45 minute to 1 hour to the more busy area. They do not have internet access.The food price also too high if you comparing to the same meal at the other restaurants at gili meno. And the room and meals are not including tax 10 percent, The room price is not including with breakfast also. And the worst things I found some cockroach and lices in my room. If you still insit to come, please check under the matrass, dust everywhere... For price 125.000 twins room, 150.000 for a-frame room, n 450.000 for a bigger room with the farthest distance, I do not recommend this place. The staffs even friendly, do not have any obligation to clean your room everyday and even changing the bedlinen... !!!
