I love quaint, independent hotels. The people generally treat you better and make you feel at home. That was not the problem here at all. First, I had paid for this room more than a month before our arrival and we did not get the room we were supposed to. Instead we had a very simple room with two beds, bathroom and fridge. I expected the larger room with the sofa/sitting area as was described when I booked it and a microwave. Not a huge deal, just a little disappointing. The beds were decent and the noise level was very low, which was good of course. Biggest problem was in the morning when we were greeted with very large bugs in the bathroom and vanity areas. We do not have these bugs where we live so I don't know if they were cockroaches or some strange very large beetle. They reminded me of a smaller version of the cockroaches I've seen in South Carolina, which are huge. These two that we flushed were about 1.5 inches. So, like my review started out, there's no way we would have stayed another night. We enjoyed the city of Santa Fe and the front desk people told us about a very good mexican food restaurant called Maria's.

At breakfast,as i was trying to carry food and drinks for two back to the room, a young server saw my plight and provided a tray. Then he asked if I would like a blueberry muffins. They had not been put out yet but he went out of his way to go to the kitchen and bring out muffins,butter etc. covered so I could carry them easily.

As others note, Cerillos Road is very busy, and the (first part of the) motel was built in 1936 along what was then the original Rte 66. However, with the use of courtyards and strategically places shubbery--the road noise is significantly dappened. The greenery is one reason why others have complained of \"dark\" rooms; my windows were surrounded by trees and bushes. My room was pretty small, but was decorated very nicely with wooden ceiling beams, nice lamps, and a floor to ceiling wooden clothing storage area. The TV screen was big, the bathroom fixtures were first rate, and the towels were luxury. There was a recycling bin in the room. Unfortunately, I could not get a WiFi signal in my room. The temp controlls worked well and the room was quiet. The surrounding grounds have very nice plants and they even have a greenhouse. There are nice picnic tables, a playground, and places to BBQ. The grounds are certified habitat, and I saw (and heard) lots of birds. The exercise room had one treadmill and one elipitical. Both worked well. There was a universal weight set wedged in a small area. There were no free weights (dumbells). The breakfast room is VERY nice. It is large and has a great sound system playing soothing music.
