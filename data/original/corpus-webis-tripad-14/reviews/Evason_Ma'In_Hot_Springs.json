We had the Mediterranean night buffet at dinner and it was somewhat mixed. Much of the food in fact is not Mediterranean at all (e.g Chinese fried rice, lamb kebabs, tiny burgers in a pasty brown gravy, and several other main items. There were some nice grilled chicken and succulent hammour fish on the buffet. What Med country services hot dog stir fry?. There was nothing on the dessert buffet that could be called Mediterranean with the possible exception of a well prepared cr\u00e8me brulee. A strawberry cheesecake type concoction was clearly made largely from packaged non-dairy whipped topping, whose primary ingredient is vegetable oil, mixed with a little gelatin---it bore no relation to cheesecake as we know it and left a nasty greasy aftertaste on the tongue. Some mini pate choux \u00e9clair were nicely done. The idea of these internationally themed evening buffets is good for family-style resorts such as those on the Dead Sea but seem out of synch with the Asian inspired minimalist design of the complex. And for JD 30++ per head the buffet needs to be truly special and was not. Others have commented to us about the ersatz Indian and Mexican themed buffets, and one can just imagine what they must be like -- the credibility of a hotel like this should be marked by authenticity and creative use of local ingredients. The bottom line is that you should offer what you can execute well. The breakfast was fine, nothing great, but adequate. We were impressed by the quality of the fresh fruit on the buffet, obviously these were all hand selected.", "title": "Lovely escape", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LindaNZ", "date": "July 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 166484302}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Refinement with mixed success", "text": "The spa facilities were OK.

The men's changing room was converted from a set of toilet stalls and like much of the resort, could benefit from much better maintenance - it does not take much effort to retile and paint the stalls so one does not feel like he is changing in an old toilet.
