{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 29, "name": "The Buck Inn", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The Buck inn is a traditional country pub & Inn that is set in the idyllic village of Thornton Watless. We stayed in the downstairs family room which was clean and spacious. The room has traditional country furniture (one double bed and two singles), it is very comfortable although the random 70's style chairs could go the distance, it also has an excellent hospitality tray with Fairtrade tea and coffee, hot chocolate and a range of biscuits (better than you get in many 4* hotels). The bathroom is large with a shower and bath, also you can tell the owners have thought about providing an excellent service by adding toiletries and handy little accessories such as sowing kits and shoe shine. The pub it self is full of character, and features a welcoming open fire. You can choose to have your meals in the dining room which is where a great English breakfast is served (love the fact they have bean to cup coffee) or for lunch dinner you can choose to sit in the bar, which I would recommend as it is full of fun with friendly locals on an evening. The owners and lady behind the bar could not be more friendly and welcoming, and if you have a child don't worry about them not being welcome in the bar area because this would be far from the truth, my five year old had a wonderful time. The Village it self is very quiet and the inn sits on one side of a cricket pitch which is at the centre of village life in the summer, there are no other services in the village however Bedale is about 2 miles away which has every service you need and is worth a visit to look around the shops. The only areas for improvement I would suggest are cosmetic, it would be good to give the room doors a lick of paint, and the exterior of the building - particularly the windows could do with some attention, however these were minor and would certainly not put me off recommending this inn to anyone who is looking for an excellent experience in a great English Inn.", "title": "Nice B&B - Fantastic Country Inn", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jb812", "date": "May 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129521633}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with family", "text": "This is a great Inn for a quiet drink or a great choice of bar meals.I was a guest at a family party and we had a great time.Brilliant entertainment and a well varied and substantial buffet.It has a welcoming Inn Keeper and attentive staff.This is a perfect venue for parties,get togethers and conferences.I recommend this Inn to all who are looking for quality and character,with good food.", "title": "A place with character and characters", "user": "samcatBedale", "date": "April 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 128036278}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have lived in the area for 11 years now and have struggled to find a country pub with restaurant rather than a restaurant with a bar within easy reach.

If you want a weekend away from it all where you can just stagger up to bed after a good meal and a pint or two this is the place. Oh and the breakfast hit the same high standards.
