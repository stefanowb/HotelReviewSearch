Hollywood Blvd is maybe another 100-150 feet or so, through the mall. Right next door to the mall, sort of part of it actually, is the Kodak and Chinese Theaters.

So location is just awesome. We parked our car on Saturday afternoon and didn't need it till we left the next afternoon. As for the hotel itself, it appears that it was possibly an apartment building way back in the day, probably the 60's? And at some point it was converted into a hotel. So the rooms are pretty old, sure. But everything we saw was very clean and well kept. We're fairly picky with that stuff (though willing to take chances) but we had no complaints at all.
