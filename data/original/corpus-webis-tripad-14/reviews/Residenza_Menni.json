But metro is very close so all the attractions are easy reachable (not in my case - managed to get there on the metro strike day...). It's located by the street with quite a heavy traffic, so noise is quite disturbing (especially at nighttime). Rooms are spacious enough, well equiped bathroom. Breakfast was nothing special, but not bad - some pastry, some cereals, but you can find some good restaurants on a nearby Viale Regina Margherita.
