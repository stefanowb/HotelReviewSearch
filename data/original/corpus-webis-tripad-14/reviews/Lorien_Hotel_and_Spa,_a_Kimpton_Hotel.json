Our stay began with a greeting from Shane our Valet. Shane parked our car and brought our bag up to our room so that we could begin our vacation. We checked in with a beautiful young women named Danielle. She greeted us with a lovely smile and after hearing we were there to celebrate our anniversary, upgraded our room. The room was clean, with an amazing view of the Masonic Temple. She recommended things for us to do. We walked down King Street with it's beautiful lights. Danielle suggested the Brabo restaurant and told us about the ice sculptures at Gaylord. The food was fantastic and the the ice sculptures were something we had never seen before. Shane our valet was there each time we left the hotel, very polite and charming. When we returned from our evening out chocolate covered strawberries and champagne awaited us in our room.

The location makes it easy to get into DC or to stroll King's Street to shop or have a meal at one of the great restaurants close by. The staff at the Lorien is second to none. They are friendly, competent and accommodating. When you walk in, you are always greeted by the great front desk personnel. The rooms are spotless and smell heavenly. Every room has a large flat screen television, a computer and a clock radio that can also serve as a docking station for your ipod. There are large comfy bathrobes in the closet and heavenly shower heads in the bathroom. The pillows and linens make the beds a dream to sleep in. If you really want to treat yourself, have a massage in the on site spa. The last massage I had there was great.
