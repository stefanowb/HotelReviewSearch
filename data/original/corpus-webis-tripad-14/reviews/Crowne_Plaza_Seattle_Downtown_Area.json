Club Level includes continental breakfast, which was a money and time-saver in the mornings. It was a good experience and the hotel experience is similar to other Crowne Plaza hotels. My one gripe: since I did not make the reservation directly with the hotel, I was told my stay was \"non-qualifying\" for Priority Club reward points. That is an annoying and silly rule, and will make me think twice about booking at this hotel group again. Crowne Plaza hotels (unlike Marriott hotels) still have smoking rooms available.

As a Priority Club member (which you can join at no charge on the web), you can ask for a room upgrade on check-in, which I did. We were upgraded to a city view room on the 30th floor with a king size bed, and with all the amenities described in previous reviews. All of the service staff were friendly and helpful; the concierge called shortly after our late afternoon check-in to ask if we needed any dinner reservations, recommendations, anything she could help with as she was finishing her workday at 6 pm. The valet parking is expensive, $27 for 24 hours, but you can come and go as many times as you like. Yes, you can find a cheaper day rate elsewhere, but we didn't see any lots in the area that charged less than $22 for 24 hours. There is so much to explore within walking distance from the Crowne Plaza, we just left the car with the valet all weekend. We ate breakfast in the hotel both mornings. The service was good but the food was mediocre. And given that Seattle is home to Starbucks and many other coffee suppliers, the coffee was dreadful. There are surprisingly few restaurants that serve breakfast close by that aren't in hotels, and at least by eating at ours it was convenient and fast. This hotel is very well located for exploring downtown-wonderful window and high end shopping, and bargain shopping at Nordstrums Rack and Ross. It only takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Centre where Experience Music Project, the Aquarium, and Science Centre are located. Exploring EMP can take an entire day, especially now that there is a new Science Fiction Museum there. One evening we went to Teatro Zinzanni, a circus/KitKat Club- style dinner theatre that was really entertaining. This tent theatre is also near the Space Needle, just a $5 cab ride from the hotel and a pleasant walk back. I would definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza again for location, good service and really comfy beds.", "title": "Seattle's Crowne Plaza- a great homebase for exploring downtown", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "PaulineJM", "date": "March 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4591556}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "The Crowne Plaza is an excellent hotel in downtown Seattle.

The elevators are fast and the restaurant in the hotel is good and affordable as well. The location is about four blocks from all the action but walking up Fifth or Sixth Avenue is no big deal and is a nice area of town. My wife and I felt totally safe walking late at night. We checked out a couple of other hotels that are similar like the Red Lion and the Westin and we like the Crowne Plaza better; it was also a better value. The Westin is old and while closer to everything, it feels like it is in a run-down area.

I couldn't see myslef paying $150 a night for this room, but through Hotwire, $73 was more than acceptable. The only negatives; I understand parking is ridiculous in downtown Seattle, but the $27 valet parking fee should be made clear when making the reservation. As for the requests we made; We wanted a non-smoking room but wound up with smoking. Not too bad though considering the smell was not very noticeable. Our friends who stayed in the inter-connecting room next door (our only request that was granted) were not as lucky. They are non-smokers as well, but the room they were in was definately not. My friend's girlfriend actually got a headache because the stench was so overpowering. (The hotel allowed them to switch to a non-smoking room for the second night of their stay.) The last request that was denied was not too big of a deal. My lady and I wanted one queen bed, but ended up in a room with two doubles. We remedied this by pushing both of them together. All in all I was happy with our stay at Crowne Plaza.
