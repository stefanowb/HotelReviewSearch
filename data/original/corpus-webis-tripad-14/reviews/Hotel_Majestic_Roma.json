They even organized a private tour of a winery just outside of Rome. Our room was excellent and well-appointed. We left to go to Venice for a couple days and they held some of our bags and made sure there were in our room upon our return. The room was nicely decorated; luxurious and just modern enough to be chic but not cold. The room in which we stayed is probably my wife's favorite ever. The location is also great.
