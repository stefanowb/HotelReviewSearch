When we first checked in we were in the original hotel. The balcony was kind of scary when you looked over but really not much to see. The other issue I had is the refrigerator in the room. You needed to place ice in it to make it cold. This was not going to work for me due to the fact I was breastfeeding and need a place to store my extra milk. My husband went to the front desk and they insisted that the fridge was going to get cold eventually. An hour later still warm like the outside air. So finally, my husband went back to the front desk and they moved us to the newly renovated side of the hotel. The room was nice and spacious compared to the older room. And yes the fridge worked. The breakfast there at the hotel was amazing. There are these \"Tres leche pancakes\" you have to try to them. The pools were very clean but did crowded after 1pm. Overall It was an \"OK\" stay.

Like the person from Fairhope, AL, I too checked in on the Fourth of July. I don't know about their check-in experience, but it was a ZOO. I waited in line for what seemed like an hour. However, I'm not taking a whole lot off for this given it was a holiday and it seemed like a lot of local folks were perhaps checking in just for the night. Once I got to the front desk, I was nicely greeted by Mia and she was very helpful. Next, the elevators were old and took forever to arrive and go anyplace. But, I went up to my room and was pleasantly surprised. The room was HUGE and right on a corner, in the old tower, and it had a great view of the intracoastal waterway, or whatever they call it. The bed itself was big and clean, but not entirely comfortable. It didn't have a comforter either, which I like, but just a blanket. The bathroom was recently remodeled, very lovely and HUGE. Double sinks and a HUGE soaker tub with the jets, and rainforest shower with a wand as well. The floor of the shower didn't seem that clean but the rest of the bathroom was spotless. The food at the main restaurant was delicious, I had a fish and it was awesome, as well as room service. However, service at the cabana bar was ATROCIOUS. Literally, the first time I went I waited a full hour for someone to take my order. The good news is that I was not in any hurry, but it was ridiculous. The second time I went we literally had to flag someone down at the bar, and there appeared to be about 50 bartenders roaming around doing nothing. Service was the worst ever. However, the spa there was amazing. Very relaxing. The staff there was great. I had an amazing massage there. I can't remember her name sadly. It sounded sort of Indian, I think. Everyone was very accommodating. The facial however left much to be desired. I was sunburnt so I had the Cool and Calm which they swore would cool the skin and prevent it from peeling. The technician, I think her name was Jasminia, however attempted to use a Clarisonic on my forehead which was so painful to my sunburnt skin I nearly flew out of the chair! She was so sweet...but, my forehead peeled horribly after that. And, to top it off, they automatically tack on the customary 18%. They pretty much tack 18% onto everything, which is ridiculous. I think it is also ridiculous to charge for beach chairs. I could understand umbrellas and the portable cabanas, but come on, beach chairs? Plus, the tack on an additional 18% service charge to that. This is particularly ridiculous when the staff seemed upset that I wanted to lay out near the water. They were trying to get me to take chairs in the back away from the water so they didn't have to drag additional chairs out. And, like the other reviewers indicated, on the morning of July 5th, the bulldozers and crew came out and they ended up plowing the beach for the next few days. The staff should have warned folks when they made their reservations, or at least when they checked in. They moved the chairs etc down a little further and I was able to ignore the noise. The weather and the water were delightful, although there was a bit of seaweed near the shore, etc., which is normal. And, everyone is correct, there were about 800 Brazilian teens that totally took over the hotel, running around and giggling, like teens do. I believe they were with some Disney high school group. The good news is that they were not running around on my floor at night. The group itself should have done a better job controlling those kids. I'm not sure what the hotel could do, other than talk to their chaperones, maybe. Anyway, I gave it four stars, primarily because of the room, the spa, and the food, and the fact that I did have a lovely stay, despite the \"cons.\" It should also be noted that my friend had a room in the new tower facing the beach and it was gorgeous. I feel like my room might have been bigger, but the layout and the view of his room was MUCH nicer, obviously.

The teens spent their nights running up and down the halls, blasting music, and slamming doors well past midnight - every night. Repeated complaints by myself and many of my colleagues were met with blank stares from the front desk and management, who could only promise that \"security\" was aware of the issues. There was a total lack of control over this large group of unruly guests demonstrated by the hotel staff and management. Additionally, bathrooms in the conference area were \"overworked\" and not kept \"fresh\". Lastly, guests needed their room keys to re-enter the hotel from the beach, but the device on the door was not operating and no one could re-enter with their key. At some point, someone had to prop the gate open with a chair - great security feature! On the plus side, the meeting rooms were comfortable and the food was very good.

Our expectations were low knowing it is an older hotel but we were pleasantly surprised with the renovated and spacious rooms. We were in the \"newer\" tower of the hotel and very pleased with the room and large balcony. The front desk and check in area is a bit frustrating. The long lines and lack of personnel servicing the desk,only two employees,was not a great first impression for guests checking in to the hotel. However, the staff was efficient and accomodating at check in once you made it thru the long line. Since we know Miami we did not have to rely on the concierge for help with dinner reservations. The valet service was terrific! Even though there was alot of hustle and bustle in the driveway of the hotel our car was always delivered timely and with friendly service. It did help that we would call from our room to request our car before we went down stairs. The pool area is nice,the beach is very small but the staff was very polite and set up beach chairs and umbrella's to make it comfortable. We loved having Starbuck's in the lobby of the hotel!

As I travel a lot, i get to experience how different hotels are run. Although I appreciate the independent operator, that can go two ways. Either you will get impeccable personalized service, or they just have no idea what they are doing. The hotel is the latter, with staff tripping over themselves trying to figure out heads or tails. Nobody knows anything about the hotel, how to get you anything or how to provide service to guests. Our check in took almost 3 hours, having to go back and forth with the online booking company. It seems that after a couple of hours of negotiation, the hotel admitted that the room type we PREPAID for was sold out. We were then graciously upgraded to a penthouse suite, but it was hell getting to that point. The bell desk near the front door, has a bunch of guys loudly complaining about experiences with guests for all to hear. if you were to dare call down for anything, say a rollaway, after umpteen phone calls, it could take over an hour.
