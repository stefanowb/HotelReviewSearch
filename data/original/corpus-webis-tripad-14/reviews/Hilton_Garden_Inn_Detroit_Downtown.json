The staff was friendly and nice. Because it's in the city, it was a little noisy, but they did a pretty good job of sound proofing, as it could have been worse. The pool is small and not heated, so we hardly swam, even though we planned to spend both evenings in the pool. The whirlpool was nice - not too hot and big enough for several of us to sit. The exercise room is right next door to the pool, with a glass wall separating the two. There is valet only parking but we could see our van and it did not take much time at all for them to bring it to us. The bed was comfortable, with a memory foam mattress. There is no free breakfast, which we usually look for in a hotel. However, with the in room fridge and microwave, we made our own breakfast. There are plenty of nearby restaurants, including one in the hotel. We were told that if we ask at the front desk, they would give us a free pass to the nearby YMCA, where we can use pool, gym, etc.", "user": "JuwelAnn", "date": "June 27, 2013", "id": 165497899}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Location and Service", "text": "We were in town over the weekend for a Tiger's game and chose this hotel based on distance to Comerica Park.

The reservation agent would not apply the negotiated group rate to a suite room, only to singles and doubles, and it took a few phone calls to the sales manager to finally resolve the issue. We had a one-bedroom suite for $169 night ( plus taxes and fees). The room was on the fourth floor on a corner. It was very spacious with plenty of room for my wife and I and our two daughters. The bathroom was a good size and the mini fridge and microwave would prove essential. The only complaint with the room was that the pullout sofa had a twin bed mattress. Having stayed at other Hilton properties with sofa beds, we knew this was unusual and it would not be enough room for our kids to sleep on comfortably for three nights. The front desk's initial response was that the sofa had a double bed size mattress and they had no other options other than to send a rollaway bed. We accepted the rollaway and found it amusing that it-the rollaway-mattress was wider than the \"double bed\" sofa mattress.", "user": "Lynn A", "date": "July 17, 2013", "id": 168004677}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "High price-poor quality", "text": "My wife had two interactions with the hotel manager during our stay and we were both very pleased with his responsiveness and efficiency.

The restaurant has some sort of number system that is used for ordering prepared items or buffet items and you are allowed to get some items ( fruits, cereal, toasts) but not others, though they are sitting at the buffet area ( eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc.).
