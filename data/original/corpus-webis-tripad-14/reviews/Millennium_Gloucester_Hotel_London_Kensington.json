There is an elevator (lift) at this station and just about ten stairs. ((Why can you go down a lift and up a down staircase?)). Also a direct line to the airport. Note; this review apparently was more about the underground station than the Hotel. Sorry. Hotel was very good. Not a Motel 6 by any means. The reception manager was more than excellent!

I disagree that this has 3 star rooms in a 4 star hotel. I was disappointed that we couldn't get a free upgrade but they had four conferences going on so it was expected. We booked our room on priceline for $100/night during Thanksgiving. Our room was very spacious - king size bed, mini bar and a huge tub with marble. The front desk was very accomodating with providing extra pillows and blankets. The concierge was great- we loved every restaurant that he recommended. The French restaurant Lou Pescadou is a must. I couldn't beleive the great location either with the price in London! Across the street from the underground and many cafes around to catch breakfast.
