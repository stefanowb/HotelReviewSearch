The cuisine was a combination of caribbean which we liked and of of course all the good american dishes. The beach was not the largest but perfect for this resorts size less than 200 cottage type suites all facing water!!! The weather was perfect so the activities were first rate. But the best was the friending staff at Verandah. very friendly and always offering a smile and assistance. Bought lots of special tees for the grandkids in their Mini market right there on property. Didn't play tennis but that too was brand new. All in all a wonderful experience and a real surprise that having been open only a few months they were very organized.
