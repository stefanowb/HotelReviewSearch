We had a wonderful vacation and the Hilton was good, but not great. The first impression of the resort when you are driving up to it is disappointing. It is a large cinderblock looking building that is not attractive to look at. The impression once you walk into the open air lobby is completely different. It is a beautiful open space. open on both sides, where you can see restaurants and a bar. The grounds are beautiful, well manicured, very clean and kept that way. The pool is beautiful, as are the beaches. My family preferred the beach all the way over to the left of the property. It was usually quieter, not that many people walked the 5 extra minutes to get there.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "janford", "date": "January 2, 2005", "id": 2970250}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A great 12 day stay", "text": "We always found chaisse lounges, but we would put our towels out before breakfast, as people did have trouble getting chairs later in the day.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "BidBristol_UK", "date": "November 20, 2004", "id": 2836347}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "You get what you pay for", "text": "Our first room was terrible.
