We were very well looked after by the staff, with one of the reception staff lending us her personal umbrella when we went out in a shower and another cancelling the cost of the packet of crisps we'd had from the mini-bar in our room because we said the crisps tasted horrible (which they did, we liked the way he accepted our view without question). The room was spacious and very well specified. I found it a little irritating that internet in the room is charged for and really think that hotels should offer free in-room internet these days, but on the other hand the parking was plentiful and free. Breakfast was very good - we went for the continental option so cannot comment on the hot food but there was certainly plenty of options available and of good quality.
