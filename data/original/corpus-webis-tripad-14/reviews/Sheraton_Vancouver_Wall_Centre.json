The room was furnished to a high standard in a modern contemporary style and had an incredible panaramic view from the curved glass window which constituted one wall of the room, the bed was possibly the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We ordered room service one evening which was prompt, delicious, good value and combined with the night time view of the city a memorable dining experience. If eating breakfast in the hotel instead of ordering a full breakfast have some eggs with a side order, exactly the same but cheaper. The hotel is in a good location and within easy walking distance of most attractions and shopping areas, some other cheaper hotels are in less salubrious areas.", "title": "Room with a view.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "AJBLONDON", "date": "May 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5204509}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Despite what the Vancouver authorities promote, Gas town is not the tourist heaven you would think, Grotty and derelict are two words that spring to mind, put aside a maximum of Five minutes to admire the 1970's built steam clock and then move on to Granville Island.

As noted with other reviews, I requested a room on the upper levels. This was done with my tour operator & also by email with the hotel. On arrival we were told that no upper rooms were available. A bit disappointing considering the amount of notice I'd given the hotel but once we were in our room we couldn't complain as the view was of downtown looking towards Stanley Park with the mountains in the background. The room itself was well finished with enough space for a family of four. The leisure club has a good size pool with a couple of hot tubs, steam room, sauna & fitness room. All the usual facilities like towels & lockers are supplied. The hotel is in a great central location in the heart of downtown within easy walking distance of Canada Place, Stanley Park, Granville Island & Kits Beach. It's a short walk to Robson Street with its shops & restaurants. The staff are very friendly & couldn't do enough for us, one of the bar staff was particularly friendly & gave us useful tips on places to visit & places to eat. Bar prices are what you'd expect from a city centre hotel, not bad though. We can't comment on the quality of restaurants apart from breakfast which we only had the once. This was perfectly fine & enjoyed what we had although a little pricey compared to local restaurants. If you're looking for good quality at reasonable prices I'd try out the White Spot, The Red Robin or Milestones, all within a 10 minute walk. Having the two towers is good as there's plenty of space but you feel that the restaurants are spread all over the place, as we didn't use them we can hardly complain. There's a Starbucks in the North Tower, lower level & a 7-11 round the corner. A great way to start your family holiday is to take a limo from the airport, Limo Jet Gold are outside the arrivals terminal & charge $41 to downtown hotels.", "title": "Summer vacation", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "SL.123", "date": "July 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5500408, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Not getting the room we had hoped for"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "A View of Business Buildings", "text": "My husband and I went to a BC Lions game and Canada Place and thought that the Sheraton Vancouver - Wall Centre was a perfect location.

The room was ok, not worth what we paid for it. We had no problems except when it came to our bill. there was an amount of $39.44 which is not ours and we are still waiting for it to be removed.
