We used Booking.com mobile app to find a place to stay and chose Villa Dalmatino based on its modern clean look and price. When we arrived in Brela we called the number on the sign outside the apartment and asked if they had any vacancies (we knew there was space via booking.com). The polite and helpful manager advised by phone that they didn't have any vacancies but when I mentioned booking.com he explained they couldn't sell us that room as it was exclusive to the reservation system. I suggested that perhaps I could I book it on my mobile and he agreed. It was a strange way to acquire a room but it worked!", "title": "Great little apartment a minute from the beach", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mmccormi", "date": "September 25, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118578574}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We booked a one bedroom apartment on the ground floor for $59 euros per night.
