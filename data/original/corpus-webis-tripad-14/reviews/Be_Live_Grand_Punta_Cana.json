There were alot of new additions to that area....the room that we check in has changed into more of a lobby area for block 7 guests....more chairs and tables have been added...snacks are out all the time, coffee is available there at all times, fully stocked bar and 4 computers. This was nice to have, we really had no need to visit the main lobby except to say hi to some of the employees we have met over the years. Also new to block 7 is a vip bar area on the beach....this was a great addition. At this bar we also had hotdogs, pizza and nachos always available so we really didnt have to go to far all day long....it was great with our girls if they were hungry to just go to this area for snacks....bottles of water and pop were always available aswell. Yonathan did an excellent job working this bar and on his days off Amelio took over and looked after us just aswell !

For breakfast everyday we headed over to Aqua...Hose was always around to take care of us, he is the best ! Antonio makes the best omelettes and after a few days he was cracking the eggs before we even said what we wanted !! Lunch was usually by our vip bar and if we did want fries, onion or tomatoe we went over to the beach grill and brought it back to add to our hotdogs and ate on our terrace. Dinners were good aswell.....Luisia, Crismilda, Jesus, Fernando and Argenis made all our dinner reservations for us...looked after ordering us the lobster dinner to have at any of the a la cartes which we did three times during our stay. Its a fee of 22 but well worth it, I couldnt eat a quarter of the lobster I was given each night. We enjoyed the sports bar a la carte restaurant....grilled chicken, wings, ribs and who could resist having Louie as your waiter....he made our day, he is the happiest guy on the resort !! The japenesse was very good too....the hostess which I think her name was Rosa or Rosie...was very upbeat and the service there was great. Food was amazing, fresh chicken, beef and shrimp. We ate there twice and on our second time there was a lady with an allergy at our table and he did her food first and then our shrimp so if you speak to the employees in a respectable manner it is possible to ask for things and get your point across. We also ate at the Italian which was good but a little chilly at night...so take a sweater ladies ! The other nights we went to the buffet and always found something to eat and I must admit that after two weeks the food was a little bland but that is not their fault, its just what we are used to. I am also a firm believer of raising an issue if there is a problem while there instead of coming on here and ranting and raving.....we noticed that the first two or three days the bacon at aqua each morning was hardly cooked....we were taking it over to the grill and having it cooked more so while talking to Victor one morning I mentioned it to him, he spoke to the food service manage and from then on our bacon was crispy !! I also introduced myself to the food service manager and thanked him, he was doing an excellent job and he was also seen at all the restaurants and bars throughout the day.

We had three separate pools and a bar in our section which was very private and quiet and about a 5 min. walk to the beach and main pool if you wanted more entertainment. The rooms were very clean and updated. There were never any concerns about getting a beach chair and there are so many bars/pools, the area never seemed crowded even though the resort was sold out. We tried the Mexican, Gourmet, Italian and Sports bar and enjoyed all of them and through out our entire stay none of us got sick. The beach is beautiful and swimming is good although if you walk a little down the beach, there is a gorgeous unspoiled beach that is awesome for swimming. It did get a little noisy at night with the festival and the roosters but not the hotel's fault. There are so many great tours like the Caribean Festival swimming with the stingrays and sharks and the Ziplining.

We were taken out snorkeling, a boat ride up to the other end (Bavaro Beach) where all the resorts are, then taken into a shallow cove to swim, and taken out to get a close look at the dolpins. We were not rushed at all through this excursion and where out for about 2 hours for $25.00 a person. Good deal!!!!! There are also shops outside the resort across the road.

Our flight down with Sunwing was great, nice and smooth and on time. We did a private transfer with Conexion Tours who met as at the airport and took us directly to the hotel in 20 mins. We arrived at Be Live to be greeted by Luisa who we met last year. By then Nicolas was there to take our bags to our room. We had 2 rooms in block 2 ground floor with oceanview, these rooms are new in the last 6 months. Blocks 2, 3 and 4 all have new additions to the front of them which give these blocks oceanview rooms now. The resort has had many changes and upgrades since we were there last Feb. and they are all very positive changes. Fernando, David and Nicolas looked after all our needs, they were never far away if we needed anything and it was always enjoyable to chat to them. In the block 7 lounge Esther and Desiree were there to make our dinner reservations and help out with the wifi cards. Santiago and Emilio worked the VIP bar at our pool which my husband and dad visited quite abit. The best part about going back to this resort is seeing all the workers that we have met in the past 8 years.....Jose, Orlando and Luis look after us at breakfast at the beach grill.....Delesio makes sure we have excellent dinners at the sports bar. Franci brought us room service for lunch, he was always around to give him our order and came back with it within the hour. Ana was our housekeeper, our room was always kept clean....she would bring back plenty of towels and did turn down service and leave hersey kisses on our pillow ! We would also trade her the diet coke and orange for all cokes which was quite the show of charades the first day we tried to do this but after that she knew what we wanted and just handed us more coke !! We dont have issues with the timeshare guys on the beach, we say we arent interested and that is it. My husband and daughter went parasailing and we did book it with our vendor friend Philip on the beach and everything was fine, my daughter and dad went again the next week and they loved it aswell. We know 90% of the vendors that walk the beach and there is never a dull moment, if they see us they chat but they never bug or harass us to buy what they are selling. Its part of sitting on the beach on an island, there are going to be guys trying to sell stuff, it is their way of life. We did notice that the grounds of the resort are much cleaner and tidy, shrubs are all trimmed...there were always guys raking the beach or cleaning the pools. Our fan did not work when we checked in and it was fixed that day, little things that I mentioned to Victor were looked after. I am happy to let everyone know that there are ladders in the lazy river pool now !! 8 years ago there were ladders at both ends and then the next year they were gone, probably broke and just never replaced. I know of people who dont go to this resort because they cant get into the pools...so now they can...very sturdy ladders have been added to both sets of steps of the lazy river, thank you Victor !! As far as food goes....the 6 of us never got sick, we ate at the beach grill everyday and they cooked us bacon, we just had to ask. Lunch was back at the beach grill or room service and suppers were at the buffet or a la cartes.....we went to the sports bar 4 times, italian once, japenese and gourmet. We did pay for lobster one night and it was well worth it. The VIP lounge had snacks out during the day and night so you never went hungry. The lobby bar is a nice addition to the hotel and Danni looks after you there. It was nice to sit in the lobby at night after dinner. The hotel had much better entertainment this year down by the pool bar at night....flame juggler, musicians, ice skating rink....every night was something different and fun to watch. The hotel photographers are now located above the pool bar which was nice and convient to check our pictures each night....Francesa was our photographer and took some great family pics of us. Well that pretty much sums up our 2 weeks at Be Live....rooms were excellent, food was great, staff was beyond friendly...we met some great people who we became friends with from all over the world, we made the best sand castles and had numerous people take pictures of them, relaxed and got a great tan ! We are already counting down until we return next year. Victor Pollantis is a great rooms division manager, he makes our stay so enjoyable because we never have to worry about a thing !! Our last day at the resort we went to check out at 11 and noticed a posting that our flight was delayed.....back to our rooms we went for the entire day, that is a bonus with this resort being so close to the airport, you get to stay there instead of sitting at the airport. We sat by the pool for the day and said our goodbyes again that night....then to the airport to find out we werent flying until 11pm...we all wished we were back at the resort !!!
