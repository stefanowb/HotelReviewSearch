Our 1 bedroom suite had a lovely NP view. The kitchen was well appointed and the bed and bath comfortable. For the price I would have liked a little more so space but it was sufficient. The spa was lovely, as was the breakfast (though the buffet quite pricey when it's not included in your package). We would have had more room service if the menu was more extensive as our small child meant dining out wasn't an option. The main pool was very nice though I was surprised by its small size.
