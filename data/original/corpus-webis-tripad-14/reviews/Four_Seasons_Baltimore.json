The hotel is beautiful - clean and modern and the staff was wonderful. They were always present and waiting to assist us in any way. The hotel is located in a great location, just a short walk to fells point or the Inner Harbor. The staff recommended several restaurants for us to try and we decided on one in Fells Point - it was delicious and exactly what we were looking for. Our room was on the top floor and faced the harbor so we had a beautiful view. The room was spacious and my husband loved the tv in the bathroom.
