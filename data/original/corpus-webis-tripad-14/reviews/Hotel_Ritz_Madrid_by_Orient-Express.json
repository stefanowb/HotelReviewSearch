I must that say that given the number of previous reviews I have read regarding standard of rooms - I was pleasantly surprised.

The room was bigger than I expected with built in wardrobes, the furniture was of a reasonable standard and in keeping with a traditional hotel. The bathroom was fine if not slightly small compared to the size of the room but no matter. The room had a TV/DVD - and (unlike any of the other hotels in Madrid it appears) with English speaking channels (BBC; Sky news; CNN this certainly made a difference) The hotel breakfast was perfectly adequate and the staff were attentive and polite at all times. We noticed a number of other residents walking around in jeans/t-shirts in the day but for dinner those dining in the restaurant the men did all have ties/jackets. We didn't eat at the hotel - the food was pricey and we prefered to head to the sol area which was only 10-15mins walk away. We did however do high tea at the Ritz (well you've got to haven't you) and had evening drinks in the lobby which was pleasant.

It is a true luxurious hotel & even though the colours on the carpets do look a bit faded what the heck, this is the mythical Ritz Hotel in Madrid after all. The hall, the restaurant and the staircase were much smaller than I thought but then perhaps it's better that way. The lounge is lovely and cosy for aperitifs, after dinner drinks (their Irish coffee is delicious, 16 euros) and for the scrumptious high tea (30 euros per person) , the only restaurant (used for breakfast too) is quite intimate, with silver cutlery. I would have liked the different cheeses to be named at the breakfast buffet to be able to buy the same back home. It\u2019s a shame that there are no Spanish specialities available, (for breakfast & dinner) just international type food. For breakfast we wanted Serrano ham and we were charged 40 euros for one serving. Wi-fi costs 10 euros per hour or 16 euros per day. Go along to the many internet cafes around the area, 1 euro for 15 minutes. A big bottle of whisky or wine at the El Corte Ingles supermarkets will cost the same as a mini bottle in the mini-bar. In fact everything there is very expensive, but then again, you do have the quality and the numerous personnel at your disposal, so you have to know what you really want to pay for. Okay, just to split hairs, I'd say that the brass handle on the toilet door that kept falling off had not been repaired before our arrival (and still kept falling off when we left) and my husband got fed up of seeing the shade on one of the wall lamps all lopsided and put it straight!
