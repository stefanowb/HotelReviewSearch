Into Master Bedroom, cupboard with safe and plenty of storage plus a hanging rail for your clothes, really wide but not long king\u2019ish size bed, bedside lights, nice pebbly floor that doesn\u2019t hurt your feet. Via two very small creaky twin doors into the bathroom \u2013 to the left a sink and toilet, to the right a sunken big bath with a shower above. Shower has new head and plenty of force behind it and placed so you do not soak the bathroom when you shower. Downside is there was no mirror in the bathroom and no-where to hang the towels. Upside is I asked for a mirror and within an hour a huge one was fitted above the sink \u2013 so folks, I think if you are unhappy here, just ask nicely and they sort it out. Ok, back to the room \u2013 via a single squeaky door to the 2nd bedroom, plenty of room here. Two single beds (also quite short, but let\u2019s be honest the locals are not exactly tall!), drawer unit and hanging rail for clothes. Only downside is no reading lights in this room. 2nd bedroom also has a door to the patio/stairs which we kept locked (but useful if your have teenagers coming in later/different times). No ventilation in the bathroom, but the aircon dealt with any odours. Coils left on patio but not good quality and did not stay alight \u2013 Circle K next door sold them for pennies, so not complaining. Sound proofing from the floor above/below is superb \u2013 can\u2019t hear a thing \u2013 we checked this out because downstairs had babies/little ones and we were concerned we may be disturbing them \u2013 not a hope.", "title": "Great hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "oswaldS", "date": "May 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130071242}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled solo", "text": "Breakfast \u2013 they need to produce a menu at this point.

Some days we were offered chicken rice but others only vegetarian rice suggested. The moral of the story is speak up, be very specific in what you want and you may be pleasantly surprised.
