The staff was very polite, helpful and friendly. We loved the elegant ambiance: marble floors, gilt mirrors, crown mouldings, etc. The kingsize bed was very comfortable with a thick mattress, lots of pillows and a nice plush comforter. We used the full kitchen and dining room quite a bit and saved a lot on meals. I was a little concerned that there was no a/c, but with windows that actually opened, high ceilings and a ceiling fan, none was needed. The location overlooking Balboa Park and about eight blocks from the Hillcrest shopping/dining area was very convenient. Everything was clean and the housekeeping service was very good. The bathroom was antiquated, but everything worked just fine. The huge bath towels and English toiletries provided were a nice surprise. There was a dressing area, vanity and walk-in closet with lots of space. This hotel gives a lot of value: Large comfortable suites, free parking, free wi-fi, and continental breakfast with a breathtaking view are all included in the rate which was very reasonable for the San Diego area. We'll certainly be staying there again on our next visit and will recommend it to friends and family.", "title": "Historic Ambiance - Modern Convenience", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Wishin2travel", "date": "November 30, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6310707, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Ambience and amenities", "disliked": "\u2014 Bathroom fixtures"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful", "text": "This hotel is like a step in the past.
