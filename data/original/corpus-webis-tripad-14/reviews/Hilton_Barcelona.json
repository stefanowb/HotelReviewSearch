The staff is extremely professional, courteous and knowledgeable. They helped us book a great tour to Girona and Figueres. Rooms are modern and well appointed. In fact, I don't think I've stayed in a cleaner, more spotless room! Breakfast in the executive lounge was amazing--delicious manchego cheese, jamon iberico and other Spanish delicacies. Be aware, though, that it's not located in a tourist area. It's more like a financial area, with modern buildings and a shopping center nearby. We were gone all day sightseeing, so we didn't mind. It just takes a few more stops on the metro to get there, and the metro stop is within walking distance. You can even get on the Bus Touristic within a couple of blocks. The lobby is expansive, beautiful and comfortable. Everything looks newly decorated with ultra modern furniture. We left our luggage with the concierge on our last day so we could finish sightseeing. I wouldn't hesitate to staying there again, even though you won't see it in most travel books.

The front desk check in was a little questionable with lots of new staff. But those who knew what they were doing were of great help and spoke multiple languages. The rooms are posh and extremely comfortable. I found all of the hotel services rather expensive including wifi. I would eat at the buffet once and eat out in the city otherwise. The buffet was delicious but again pretty pricey. The bathroom was by far my favorite thing about he hotel, nice big walk in shower with a detachable shower head available.

As for the hotel itself, it has a very modern lobby with nicely furnished rooms. The rooms are on the small side, but perhaps by European standards it's acceptable. The bathroom was quite large though, which was greatly appreciated. My only quibble is the lack of free wifi which, given that this hotel caters primarily to business persons, is disappointing. There is a business center on the first floor, but it still would have been nice to have free wifi in the room itself. Staff was super friendly and very helpful in answering my questions, even printing off a map to show me how to get to a nearby convenience store.

They all try hard to speak English and understand it, so it is easy to get information. The one thing that I believe is a problem is the internet service in the rooms. It is very expensive, 20 Euros per day, it is slow and takes forever to connect, and it is fairly difficult to use and as such, I suggest you use a different service, say Skype Wi-Fi, instead.
