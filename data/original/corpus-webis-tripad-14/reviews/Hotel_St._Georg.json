Both were very comfortable (fantastic comfortable beds) and a really good size.The bathrooms looked very new and the showers were very powerful (and yes ladies there is a hairdryer at the mirror and a plug for your straighteners!). The standard of cleanliness is fantastic and each day by the time we had returned from breakfast our rooms had been cleaned and were spotless.We arrived the day before the floods and landslides and the next day the main street outside was like a raging torrent so most people stayed in for the day. There was a lot of disruption locally with very bad landslides and one area close by was declared a disaster zone which was awful for the people living there. Some of the railway lines were washed away on the route to Salzburg and the line was closed while we were there.

Pleasant bar open from mid-day until midnight for apre ski or later evening relax & drink. From hotel a very easy short downhill stroll to main ski lift - the 'city express' - hotel has a mini bus as well but hardly worth getting it as so close ! Hotel has a ski & boot room that also gives late night access with your room key. If you hire skis from Intersport at the ski lift you can take advantage of free overnight ski storage to save you lugging them back to hotel. Walk into town downhill and again a very easy 5 minute stroll - good night life and bars all over the town - take your pick ! Local church of St. Hippolyte worth a visit and doesn't take much time.

There is also a nice bar to chill out in after a hard day on the slopes.(as if you go into town on eve can tend to be to rowdy if got kids, ideal if not) Kids loved the pool great place to relax with a book while they had a good swim. To be honest have not got anything bad to say about this hotel as you can see they try very hard to make your stay as pleasant as poosible. You also get a news letter every morning at breakfast letting you know whats going on that day which was an excellent idea. The hotel is in a great location to ski slopes 5 min walk and to town centre of Zell am see 10 mins. All staff are pleasant enough and was only to happy to give you information or help if needed.

We quite deliberately chose Austria and Zell Am See in particular for its picturesque location. The town and lake did not disappoint. The skiing is intermediate not advanced but with two families was perfect. The hotel was lovely, the family are very hands on and it made it a very relaxed homey environment. I often find with non-chain hotels there are extremes with the very good being outstanding and the poor, very poor. In fairness, there wasn't anything that was very poor but hopefully you understand the point I'm making, independent hotels often lack the consistency of large chains but delight in other ways. So, if you enjoy food this is a good hotel for you - it's traditional Austrian and you need to embrace that. There were choices of main course each evening over the 5 courses, a fantastic breakfast buffet and a slightly alternative afternoon food option, ranging from tradition tea and cake through to Austrian bolied sausages and rolls!!! Ambience of the hotel was lovely as well as the lovely restaurant there was an intimate lounge and bar area. The wine list is interesting with a number of Austrian wine options which the hotel were obviously proud of - my wife had a glass of white one evening and it was actually quite pleasant. The rooms were, just, ok, functional and given the cost of our holiday a little disappointing but only because the look and feel when we arrived at the hotel promised more.

Skiing in zell is good for a week or two, for the latter been to visit a friend. The hotel is so close to the city express gondola but the hotel gives a courtesy bus to the trassxpress every half hour. I would say the only problem I have found recently in Austria (not the hotel) is the influx of Russian tourists who believe they can not be heard!
