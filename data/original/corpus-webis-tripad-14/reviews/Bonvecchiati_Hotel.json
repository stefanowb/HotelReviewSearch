The Canal View was a minor canal but it was lovely to see the gondaliers going by, when we were in the room. The room was the size that they stated on their web site, so size was ok but Room 227 was worn and shabby. The writing table was badly chipped. However, we could not fault the Staff at the Reception and the Restaurant. We did not eat there too expensive but they provided us with hot water and milk every evening as my husband only drinks decaffeinated tea. Breakfast was very good and from another review I learnt to always order cappucinno from the waitress,as the coffee on the breakfast table was not nice. We travelled by a budget airline into Treviso Airport and there is a brilliant coach service to Venice Bus Station Pizzale Roma at a cost of 9 euros return and then we took the waterbus to Hotel. We would never use a water taxi they are too much money. If mobility is an issue then the waterbus tickets that can be purchased for longer times are very good. You can use them to other places including islands. Something that I wish had been on the site, near the Boat Stations at Pizzale Roma (No 42) is a Co-op. We collected our bottles of water when we were down there and got biscuits to take home as gifts. Buy pasta at Treviso Airport when leaving so much cheaper. We do not believe that this Hotel should have a 4Star rating. However, the maid and porter service was excellent.
