I searched forever to find a place with a reasonable price and I finally found it with the Sky Ranch Lodge. We only paid $85 a night for 2 Queen beds with private patio and garden view. Considering the Day's Inn's and Motel 8's were $105 a night, I thought this was a steal. Especially once we got there and saw the room, grounds and location. It was the largest room we had our entire trip. Nothing fancy, a little dated but it added to it's charm. We had 2 entrances to our room, 1 from the parking lot and 1 on the other side of the room leading to our private patio in the garden. The bathroom was clean and very large for a hotel. Our room had an entry, a nice size closet, dresser with tv, coffee maker, 2 queen beds, table and chairs and a large window looking out to the garden. Not to mention, free WiFi. The ceiling had wonderful beams on them, again added to the charm. Our patio was very cute with 2 chairs and a small table. Even though we technically had a garden view room, you could see the red rocks also. The gardens had wonderful walking paths and were beautiful. We saw a couple rabbit's and quail's running around. The heated pool and hot tub were nice. Again, a little dated but worked properly and they supplied towels. The pool was very nice to use after a long day of hiking and before dinner. The hot tub was awesome to hang out in to relax before bed. The front desk is not 24 hours but after a certain time if anything is needed you can call security. The best part about the Sky Ranch Lodge is the location. It is about a 5 minute drive from all the hustle and bustle of downtown Sedona. It looks down on Sedona so the views are spectacular and your not caught up in the mess and noise down below. Not to mention, the sunsets right from the resort is heavenly.
