They said they they were not ready and we'd have to check in at the normal time (3pm). OK. So we went to lunch and did a few things and arrived at 3:45pm to find that our rooms were STILL not ready - though they knew we had been waiting since 10:30am. So slightly disappointing that they couldn't even have the rooms ready when they KNEW we were waiting! But, they were great in getting us all on the same floor in the same section. The hotel was clean and the front desk was very polite and friendly. The rooms were a standard for a Fairfield but I have to admit CLEANER. It is strange, but I always like to look at the returns in the room and bathroom and shower to see how dusty they are for overall cleanliness - these were pristine!! Probably one of the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in!! I would stay there again based on the price point, cleanliness, staff energy etc. Just be prepared to wait when it comes to checking-in as they are very laid back attitude - think southern slow.", "title": "Nice overall experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "court10482", "date": "November 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 145277888}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel was clean and up to date.
