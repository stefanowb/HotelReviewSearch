We each showered off after the swim because the chlorine was pretty stinky. The next morning, I noticed small, red bumps all over my chest area. We flew home and the bumps got worse. I went to our doctor who told me it was phalicilitus (sp??) which is a bacterial rash caused from the pools not being properly balanced with chemicals so the bacteria does not die.

We asked the concierge about boat tours of the city and we were recommened to Wendella boat tours. We opt for 90mins river and lake tour, it was the highlight of our trip as we caught the last tour at 7pm and saw the city light up at dusk. We were also given free passes to a few bar/lounge by our concierge when we asked where were the nice night spots.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "kimmie4687", "date": "April 1, 2006", "id": 4827240}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006, traveled on business", "text": "The only cons I have to say about the hotel would be that the suite did not have a full length mirror anywhere in the room, and the only mirror was in the bathroom. Also, a couple of times we wanted to take a swim in the hotel pool but everytime we went it was crowded with people or kids, and since the pool and hot tub is kind of on the small side, it just seemed really cramped.

My family of 5 had two suites on the 18th floor that we booked through PriceLine at $100 per room. Those rooms go for $275 and up. It was my first experience with Priceline and my first stay at the Omni/Michigan Avenue. It's a great hotel. The employees were all very nice and very helpful. The rooms were big, clean and had all we needed. The bathrooms were fine. Not the Ritz, but clean, and fine. The beds were very comfortable. The health club and pool had been recently refurbished and were very nice. The restaurant was also very nice, but not cheap. A cup of coffee was $4.00, but the service was great. I can't understand the other reviews that were negative about this hotel.
