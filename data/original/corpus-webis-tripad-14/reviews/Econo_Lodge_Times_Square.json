We were charged upon check in even though the room was prepaid, so had to spend a lot of time correcting the error. There was no hot water for shower. Room really small and tight. Across street from fire and EMT station. Constant noise from emergency vehicles all night. Elevator was very slow. Breakfast that they use as a selling feature served on a counter in the check in area (very very small) where you sit on the ledge in the front window and hold food in your lap. People actually came in off the street to grab food. Neighborhood very shakey. Businesses and people we would not normally associate with. Oh, yes, and the bed was bottom of the line and very uncomfortable. Might have saved $20 but definitely not worth it.

After reading reviews for many hours I picked Econo Lodge. The location is great, the rooms are clean and the price couldn't be beat. I usually travel with friends or children and look for safety, cleanliness, comfy bed and decent location. Sure the room/bathroom is small, but how much are you really in the room and I have seen just as small of rooms in NYC for a lot more money. We sleep in it and get ready in it, so it was just what we were looking for. I have stayed in four star hotels in NYC, but wouldn't hesitate to stay in this two star again. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. We only took advantage of the breakfast once, it was small (grab and go), but a nice jump start to the day, and besides there aren't many hotels in NYC that have anything set out for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised by our entire experience at Econo Lodge. We are big walkers and we walked all over from this location at all hours and felt safe, and I was with my teenage daughter. I don't make a point of nit picking small things at the places I have stayed at, I find the same problems in high or low end hotels; I think it's all in what you are looking for.

The review were right. This is somewhat of a hidden gem. The value ($169.99) was very good. The locaiton is fantastic - within 1-2 blocks of most theaters, short walk to Times Square, and 1 \"long block\" to 9th Avenue where there are tons of restaurants (and more on 8th Avenue too). The room we had was exceptionally small -- really little more than a bed, desk and bathroom. There was literally one foot on one side of the bed and one foot space at the foot of the bed. Other than that, there was very little room to maneuver around. Yet the room was very clean and fresh. The place has clearly been renovated from top to bottom. There is a small chest/wardrobe, and I mean small. It has a safe in it and it's not much wider than the safe. The safe was nice to have but too small for my laptop. There is a small desk which is good but if the chair is used you can't walk past it. The bathroom is clean and small but usable. Essentially it's like being on a cruise ship where there is no a spare square foot around. But since we went sightseeing all day, came back to get changed, went to theater and then late dinner and did not get back until midnight, we basically only used it for the bathroom, changing and sleeping.
