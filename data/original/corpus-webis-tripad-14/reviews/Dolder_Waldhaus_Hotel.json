Yes. It is a little out of the way. You have to take tram #3 from Central Station just past the art museum and then a little mountain railroad up the hill, which is great fun, and yes, it is not impressive from the outside, sort of Soviet Bloc architecture ... but inside, mmmmm! Super service, lovely rooms, beautiful views over the lake and downtown Zurich from high above which makes it magical at night. I go back each year just to sit on the balcony (each room has a private one) and watch the sunset. It is the end of my yearly sojourn in Europe and calms me down for the flight home. I usually go down to the Museum if I want to do anything at all, which takes all of ten minutes from the hotel, and avoid downtown ... I just rest, enjoy the pool, the view, the food and being taken care of ... then it is back to reality ...

Very friendly staff, beautiful view over lake and mountains, the whole town lies at your feet. There is a free shuttle bus to the main railway station, but it does not run very frequently. I just love the breakfast. Large underground car park absolutely free. One minus point: The room furniture is hideous! But bed very comfortable and good lighting.
