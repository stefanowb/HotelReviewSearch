Our room was clean and nicely appointed. I cannot say enough about the Chophouse. We were always under the impression that the restaurant was expensive we were blown away by the amazing appetizers and the prices that were in the $6.00-$7.00 range. Try the Portobello French fries AMAZING. The pool area is indoor/outdoor swimming even in the winter excellent atmosphere. The gym area has a lot of really nice equipment and is well thought out.
