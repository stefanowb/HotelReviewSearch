I know, I know I should have paid more attention to the reviews on here, but for some reason my sensible head was having a day off. Right, we booked to stay at the Pina Colada Palace for one night before our return from Italy via Fiumicino airport. Here is a tip for all reading this, DONT DO THE SAME! Upon first entering the hotel it takes a while for the full horror of the situation to hit you, but you soon realise what the place reminds you of. If any of you were unlucky enough to be caught up in the great Costa Del Rubbish package tour boom of the 80s you will start to get a feeling of familiarity as the surroundings of the Pint Of Vomit Palace begin to assault your senses. If I am being completley honest the lobby and bar area of the hotel that you are first met with could be very nice if some money was spent on updating the decor and facilities. It is a nice size and is quite nice to sit in to relax, just close your eyes! Now I think about it, we should have stayed in the reception area, (with our eyes closed of course), and not ventured up to \"The Room\". I write it like that because it felt like we were in an 80s horror movie. And a note to make here is, who had the idea to put a strip of carpet halfway up the walls?? We entered the room and were met with worn out furniture, which looked like it was probably never nice in the first place. The walls were a lovely shade of peach, the bedding was white and blue and thinner than my hair and the bathroom was trying to burst out from its surroundings, not dirty, (which is a pet hate of mine), but not clean, especially the shower curtain. A nice touch in the bathroom was the way you had to slide yourself underneath the oversized sink to sit on the toilet which was actually underneath the sink.....madness! The wall behind the desk (or whatever it was supposed to be) had been dented and scraped with the desk like object but not repaired. The television looked it was also trying to escape but via a different method, it was trying to fly away, perhaps being near the airport had given it ideas. The balcony was smashing, at least as far as it was outside, although I cant help thinking that it was originally a feature of the bathroom that had actually managed to escape. I wish I had taken some pictures of the room so I could relay the full horror to you but I didnt want to damage the camera. Anyway, we managed to get back in to the centre of Rome that evening for dinner and decided to have too much to drink so we wouldnt notice the room when we got home. Breakfast at the Please Release Me Palace was at least in the morning, and that's the best thing I can say about it. The juice tasted of Tarmac, the other flavour of juice was actually orange squash, the croissants were once cardboard boxes and the cooked breakfast was cooked three weeks ago last Tuesday. Oh, I forgot about the lunch that we had the previous day from the bar. Breeze blocks with some (virtually tasteless) ham and cheese in the middle, delicious! But, even though the staff are at best, unsmiling and a bit grumpy (well wouldn't you be, working there?!) at least one receptionist was fluent in three languages at least so she should have no problems understanding your complaints.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "The_Penguins", "date": "August 23, 2006", "id": 5701010}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Far away from everything", "text": "Anyway, to sum up, this place is a waste of space, it needs to be demolished, it is beyond help, it is a blot on the landscape of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has no redeeming features, other than you can at least leave if you do find yourself there by mistake.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "HEATHROWHONEY", "date": "July 21, 2006", "id": 5494998}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007", "text": "I stayed here in May 2007, with a tour.
