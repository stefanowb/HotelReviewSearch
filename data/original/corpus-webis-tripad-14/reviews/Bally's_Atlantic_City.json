My room was in the Tower and as a comp room, I didn't expect much. The room was clean and comfortable. I immediately checked for bedbugs and found NOTHING. The bathroom was actually a pleasant surprise. Full marble floor, all in great shape. Bath and shower combination. Housekeeping was fine. There were plenty of towels and bath accessories. Try the Noodle House if you're hungry even up until midnight. The food is cooked right in front of you with decent portion size and excellent flavor.

But, we had a great time. Our rooms were adjacent to each other, which was great. The rooms were cleaned and the beds were very comfortable. No problem with housekeeping, or check in agents. Everyone treated us very well. The Spa was wonderful, even though extra charge was made to use the facilities. Our rooms were on the ground floor next near the casino, but we heard no noise, and it was very quite. We saw the Legends show, in which Bally's check in agents gave us a $10.00 discount coupon to use. The show was fantastic. The only complain would be outside the hotel. On the boardwalk, a few homeless people walking around, and also on the main streets when you walk towards the other hotels for site seeing. I suggest more security is needed.

I have one word for the room we were given, GROSS. We were given a room in the Claridge tower, which is a hike from the main lobby area to the battered elevators which take you up to the rooms. The shabby condition of the elevators and the disgustingly stained hallway carpet should have been a clue as to what we would find when we entered our room. I can honestly say that nothing in our room was clean. The room carpet was filthy and had remnants of trash, crumbs, open safety pins and hair ALL over the place (see photo). Did I mention hair? Yes, there was hair everywhere in this room, long hair, curly hair, short hair, hair in the bathroom sink, hair on the vanity, hair in the tub, hair on the toilet, hair on the bathroom floor, clumps of hair on the carpet. I've never seen anything like it. I don\u2019t think the room had been vacuumed or dusted in a very, very long time. I could write my name with my finger in the layer of dust on the bedside lamp. The closet\u2019s mirror doors had fingerprints and smudges all over it. The carpet in the closet had about a 1/2 inch of dust throughout.

I\u2019ve stayed at Hampton Inn\u2019s and Holiday Inn Express hotels and found them to be far superior to Bally\u2019s in every way, at half the price. I think management needs to seriously consider checking up on their housekeeping staff because they are obviously not doing their job, but given the fact that the room was so filthy, it\u2019s obvious that they just don\u2019t care about quality or cleanliness.
