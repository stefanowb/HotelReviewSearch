We were a bit skeptical at first (we had booked a room elsewhere, but were sent here because of the first hotel's error), but our fears were soon put to rest after encountering the warm and friendly staff. The room we had was not spectacular, but it was clean and inexpensive. The best part of this spot was the outdoor seating area. They have outdoor tables and chairs lined around the path to the rooms, which is surrounded by tropical flowers and plants (a teeny little paradise). Since we also had a refrigerator in the room, this helped to make our trip even more economical (by stocking up at the liquor store, having cold drinks and a nice place to enjoy them), which is very much appreciated in over-priced Miami. There is a gate that keeps out non-guests of the Riviere, which gave three girls traveling alone a sense of security. While they didn't have all the amenities that a hotel might have (no ice machine, no room service, no dry cleaning service, etc.), they really made up for it with their friendliness and helpfulness. The Riviere was within walking distance of the beach, great bars (Love/Hate was our favorite), and tons of restaurants(News Cafe was the best).
