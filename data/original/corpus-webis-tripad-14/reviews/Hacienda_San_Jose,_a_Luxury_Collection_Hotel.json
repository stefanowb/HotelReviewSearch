Ours were and this property and staff still exceeded them. We had reserved a Mayan Villa (MV) and upon check-in were informed that they were full and they were upgrading us to the \"Patron\" suite. This suite is huge and has its own private pool and very large patio. We liked it, but after staying there one night, we decided that we really did want the privacy and seclusion of the MV, so we ran into the manager (Bellen or Belen) and she said she would see what she could do (btw, she gave us a very informative tour of the grounds, too). We were called back in about an hour and we were moved to the MV later that day (as a funny aside, we were switched with a couple that indicated that they didn't really like the MV...we chatted with them later in the week, put 2 and 2 together and found they had switched us, and they LOVED the Patron suite). The MV was exactly what we wanted. Very private, very romantic. The positives are so numerous. First, the maid service is excellent, always perfect, always clean. The turndown service was such a nice touch...always a new trinket of some kind on the pillow, always flowers everywhere. The food at the restaurant was outstanding. We ate every dinner for 5 nights there and did not tire of it. The winelist is not huge, but it's got some decent selections on it. We also brought some wine and there was no corkage fee and certainly no hassles with them serving it to us. The prices are not cheap, but I thought the value was good. We had a dinner prepared for us on the grounds, which was also very nice. The thing that impresses me is that the service was outstanding, but not overly intrusive, which seems to be hard for most to replicate. All of the staff were able to pull this off. The grounds were, of course beautiful and the whole experience was just so laid back and relaxing.

My wife enjoyed their spa treatments and we both had a wonderful time in their beautiful pool. We had room service delivered to our very private patio, which was very romantic. The food at the hotel is perfect, both in presentation and taste. The small number of rooms, eleven I believe, adds to the quaintness of the resort.

Lavender blue colors are all around the corners of Hacienda San Jose. Its 15 rooms and suites, spread around a colonial patio with captivating ambience, will take you back in time to the past but with the amenities of this century. The former vegetables garden of the old residence is currently a site for a fantastic pool and Jacuzzi that, along with the surrounding Mayan palapas, present guests with a unique life experience."}
