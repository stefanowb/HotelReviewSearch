Rented 3 rooms, all on the same floor and right next to each other, though would have been nice to have some space between family!! What was odd, was that each room was so different and each room had very different comforts. We were on the 3rd floor facing the side street, which is much quieter than the main street. Rooms all clean, however you have to enter the bathroom, and step up a step to use the toliet and or tub. The tub is a jacuzzi tub, but when I used mine (room #344), the water ran out from under the tub onto the marble title floor, making it very slippery. It only leaked when the jets were on. The tub is also the shower, and stepping out of it, on to the first step is a bit scary. The breakfast served each morning was excellent, probably the best I have had in my many trips to Italy. The female staff, from the servers, bar maid, room cleaners, etc...were all very friendly and polite. The male staff was professional, but never overtly friendly. Location can't be beat, 5 blocks or so from the Vatican. Metro station is also about 5 blocks away. Would stay here again. P.S. take advantage of the 5th floor patio area. We would share a bottle of wine each night under the stars and the staff was always helpful with getting us glasses or ice when need free of charge.", "title": "Comfortable Hotel with professional Staff", "user": "Lawin4cr", "date": "October 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 83549905}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010", "text": "I have just completed my fourth visit to Rome and each time I have stayed at the Atlante Garden.

The continental style breakfast is more than adequate and the young ladies who take care of the breakfast room are friendly and helpful.

They had a driver pick us up from the airport (shuttle bus, minivan kind of thing) and took us directly to the hotel. Once we got there, they were kind enough to let us leave our luggage with them until check-in time so that we could walk around (we went to Castel San Angelo 3 blocks away and then to the Pantheon, about a 20 minute walk away). When we got back, our room was ready and they kindly showed us our way. The room was small, by US standards, but it was cozy and clean. It was prettier than I expected and had all the things that I needed. The only minor thing that I didn't like about this hotel was that it was not near central Rome. It is by the Vatican, on the left bank of the Tiber River. In order to get to ancient Rome, you'd either have to take a cab (about 7 euros) or walk (about 30 minutes) or take public transportation (we didn't do this so I can't tell you how it is). Also, it is much quieter on the left bank of the Tiber than it is on the right bank (perhaps more so than usual since we went in August). Almost all of the shopping, good dining, and the tourist attractions (except for the Vatican of course) is on the right bank of the Tiber, and pretty far from the hotel. Luckily for us, we booked all our tours with hotel pick-up so none of this was an issue. Don't let me scare you though, the location is not terrible. It's not in the middle of nowhere. It's 4 blocks from the river, so you can get to the right bank by foot with no problems, if that's what you want to do. Also, a 7 euro cab ride to the center of the city is not bad at all, and we did it quite a number of times.

We had a room for a family of 4. The room was very large. TV lacked some good English stations, but we were not in Rome for TV. Beds comfortable, AC worked fantastic, which is hard to find in Rome.

The shower flooded the floor after every use. We had to request extra towels and pillows, as they only provided 2 of each. These items were delivered promptly.
