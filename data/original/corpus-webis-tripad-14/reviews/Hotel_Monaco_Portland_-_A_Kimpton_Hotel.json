We had a rental car, but you really don't need one with the excellent public transportation; and if you like to walk, everything is close by.

We generally buy our own beverages and don't pay the high prices most hotels offer for theirs. The evening wine reception is a delight and reminiscent of a B & B gathering. It would be great if the hotel could add some cheese (Tillamook perhaps?) and crackers, since the push is on Oregon wines. I didn't expect a meal, but a tidbit would've been nice to go with the wine. There is an on-site business center, which we didn't use, but my husband did use the small workout facility and was pleased. All in all, we were delighted with this boutique style hotel.
