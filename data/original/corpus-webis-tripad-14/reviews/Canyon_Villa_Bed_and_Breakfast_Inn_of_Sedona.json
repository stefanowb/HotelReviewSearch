The food served at breakfast was fresh and original, and changed daily. There was always coffee, tea and ice water 24 hrs a day, unique appetizers every afternoon, and cookies and sweets at night.

It has a beatiful working fireplace with vaulted ceilings and attached library with a computer providing internet access for guests. The livingroom and dining area have an absolutely breathtaking view of Couthouse Butte and Bell Rock through huge floor to ceiling windows. The view is awe-inspiring...from the sunrises to the sunsets, it is always changing. I could sit by those windows all day mesmerized by the view. Upon entering our room I was thrilled to find that we had the same amazing view. The entire place was immaculate. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous.

After researching I contacted Canyon Villa. My husband and I were not disappointed! We stayed in 2 different rooms: Manzanita and Indian Paintbrush. I would recommend either room. Manzinata is upstairs w/balcony. Indian Paintbrush is on ground floor with door wall leading into patio/garden. You will find beautiful views and wonderful food at this B&B. We have stayed at many B&Bs, this is not our first experience. We would put this in our top 3 in the country.
