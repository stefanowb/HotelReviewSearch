This is the old Grayl's Hotel which was gutted and completely renovated. It's beautiful. Cost approx. $260 including tax plus $18 per night for valet parking. Over night self parking isn't much of an option in this area. Their primary focus is the bar/restaurant and wildly popular roof top lounge. We stay in St. Pete on a Sat night 4-5 times a year. I wouldn't rule out returning but there are some things they could do that would really improve the stay for me. Put a safe in the room. Put bath robes in the bathroom. Do something about the lighting in the bathroom--I had trouble seeing to shave and it's really dark in the shower. Bathroom is very nice in d\u00e9cor though--free standing tub and separate shower. There are only 18 rooms on 2 floors. Please put an ice machine on one of the floors. The front desk will get ice for you but they do double duty and aren't always there and with a total renovation an accessible machine should have been placed. Put a mini-fridge in the room--there is plenty of space. A ceiling fan over the bed would be nice. None of these are complete deal breakers but they would make a nice property really, really nice.", "title": "Nice, and could be a lot nicer", "user": "Westshore", "date": "October 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 181181108}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Celebrated my birthday at Birchwood and it was amazing . The rooftop lounge is beautiful and you can see the pier and part of downtown . Parking is a problem in downtown st pete so I parked at the pier and walk to Birchwood .

We had noticed it under construction when staying in the area earlier this year and I was surprised it was all finished and opened. It is a beautiful property, the management and employees were all extremely friendly and bent over backwards to make our stay pleasant and memorable. The room was gorgeous, the bedding very comfortable and plush. The bathroom was also gorgeous and everything was very clean. The complimentary breakfast was \"okay\" - some parts were excellent (fresh OJ, good \"home baked\" style bread for toast, really good coffee and marmalade) and then some not so much (scrambled eggs that looked like they had sat in the chafing dish for hours yet also looked like no one had touched them before us, and no butter to be found). The Canopy lounge is outstanding, the appetizers and drinks we had were top-shelf, the service was excellent. Only negatives for us were that we could not get our own ice (had to ask the front desk to bring a bucket to the room) and although the room ambiance was wonderful, once we really needed a light to see to fix the in-room coffee pot, we discovered the lightening was awful, without the curtains open and daylight, the few lights in the room were more for decor than to provide real light to see by. Also wished for some comfortable seating, only one small chair in the room that was also designed more to look good than to use for seating. Otherwise, it is a beautiful place and worth the splurge, we would stay there again (just would bring a flashlight!)", "title": "Nice Night at the Birchwood", "user": "LATTIGM", "date": "August 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174048983}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My partner and I stayed at Birchwood this past week and I must say that I am impressed.
