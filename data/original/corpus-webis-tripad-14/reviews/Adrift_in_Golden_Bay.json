My only suggestion: stay more than one night as all of the actitvities take half a day to complete.

Gordon, who owns Adrift with his wife, is a tremendous source of information and advice and is charming and genuine. Hikes both short and long begin nearby, including hikes in Abel Tasman national park and several other short hikes that are interesting because there is a destination, e.g., an old gold mine.
