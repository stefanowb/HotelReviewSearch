It has been recently renovated but it does still have the art deco feeling. The space is small, the elevator was tiny fitting about 2 average size people and their luggage (there is only 2 floors so taking the stairs was not an effort) but the rooms were fine. We found them clean, spacious and updated. The beds were comfortable, linins were of high quality, an alarm clock with IPOD attachment and nice flat screen TV! The bathroom was very small, no fan and didn\u2019t have a window that opened. There was a mirror in the bathroom and another full length mirror on the other side of the room but there was not an electrical outlet anywhere close to that mirror thus making hair drying difficult. [-] This is by far not a luxurious hotel but you get what you pay for and South Beach is an expensive destination. The location of the hotel couldn\u2019t of been better. It was right in the middle of the main strip that faces the ocean (Ocean Drive) Everything is walking distance and there are a plethora of bars, clubs and restaurants to by sampled while visiting. The beach is right across the street. Chairs and Umbrellas can be rented there for under $20 for the day. Upon check in you received coupons for free breakfast at Johnny Rockets right next door for each morning of your stay. As mentioned by other reviewers the hotel doesn\u2019t have parking but does offer Valet service which we found well worth it. The hotel staff couldn\u2019t of been more pleasant and accommodating. During our stay we were heading out for the night and as we passed the front desk to walk out the door it started down pouring. The front desk handed us a complimentary umbrella for our walk. Later that same evening while arriving home my friend had suffered a deep cut from attempting to pick up a broken glass. The font desk worker spayed antiseptic on my friends cut and bandaged her up all with a smile. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is there just to sleep and get ready. Again, the location is perfect, their prices are average, it\u2019s clean, exceptional service and comfy beds \u2013 it\u2019s not a hotel room you would want to hang out in.", "title": "Great Location!!!", "user": "MAgirl10", "date": "July 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 17647475, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 small"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the Beacon for the first two nights of our honeymoon and after getting home a week later, I was surprised to find a small charge of around $9.00 had been placed against the credit card that I used to pay for my stay. I had to place two phone calls before someone in the Beacon Hotel called me back and they claimed that the fee was for our use of item(s) in the mini bar in the room. Of course this wouldv'e made sense had we actually even opened the mini bar, but we hadn't and this shouldv'e been pretty obvious by the unbroken seal that was on the mini bar door.

There's a funky smell in the hotel. We finally get up to our room and it is tiny. They must have taken pictures with a panaromic lens or something! Floors are dirty, bathroom STINKS, and we asked for a oceanfront view which would be weird since the ocean apparently was across the street, but we faced another building anyway. So it was not great. The hotel staff was very polite. There is no place to park so you valet and they told us that it would take 20 minutes to get a car so we had to tell them in advance.
