I would not recommend this hotel. Upon entering the lobby, I noticed the strong smell of air freshener. It seemed to permeate the entire lobby. After a short line (that took a long time), we were on our way to our room. The view from the room was of the parking lot -- not exactly the view you would want when at the Red Sea. After upgrading for just a few dollars more, we were in a room with a balcony. I was relived that I no longer smelled the air freshener spray. The room and bathroom were adequate and clean. The bed was reasonably comfortable. We were there on a holiday week and there were many children some of whom were unruly and loud. Be sure to return your \"towel cards\" or you will be charged a $40 fee!! We didn't eat at the hotel but because we had an early trip to Petra, we were given box lunches to take along. Nice touch although not everything was edible. Internet was available for a fee -- there was not even free internet in the lobby. I was glad that there was an Aroma coffee shop at the front of the hotel so we could have reasonably priced and good food -- muesli, salads and coffee as well as free wi-fi. Good location across from Coral Beach -- great for snorkeling and scuba diving. Off the beaten hotel path of Eilat, but a 5 minute taxi ride away makes this not really an issue. Lobby furniture and decor were weathered (maybe because of the beach location). An OK hotel in an OK town. Reminded me of a cheaply built Las Vegas hotel minus the casinos. My husband and I tried our \"shooting\" skills at an on-site shooting range. Quite the experience! Great staff and instructors there. Don't miss Petra, though.

We came into a room with a broken air conditioner (later fixed), but one would assume they would have known this before we checked in (104 degrees outside). The staff was uniformly unhelpful, unfriendly and uninterested. They even argued that I had no reservation, even though I showed them the voucher (pre-paid) from their website. We only needed a one night stay before an early morning trip to Jordan, so this was an OK stay for the money. Note that everything was an additional charge. We ask how to get to the beach and were told \"just go straight across the street\". What they didn't say was they had a specific beach for guests and that lounges there were free. Also note that there is a \"rule\" that you have to use specific towel cards and if they are not returned (the cards!!) they charge you 40 NIS. Read the small print in the room card envelope!
