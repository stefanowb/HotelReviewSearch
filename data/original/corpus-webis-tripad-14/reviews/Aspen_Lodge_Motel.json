The location is perfect - central but quiet, only a few minutes walk to shops, restaurants and the Thermal Pools. We had a one bedroom apartment and it was very spacious - a TV and DVD player in in the lounge and another TV in the bedroom. Free hire of DVD's made our little boy very happy! The extra little touches really do make this place a treat - the cakes put in our room after housekeeping were a lovely and a nice surprise. Our only crticism was the lack of a bath, most families with a small children need this extra bonus.", "title": "stayed an extra night it was so nice!", "user": "travelkw", "date": "November 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120557019}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Warm comfortable room with excellent views (upstairs).

No questions were asked when Ali set up his DJ gear in the room for a low key practice (big gig was looming in CHC that weekend!). Overall we were very impressed and felt completely at ease staying at Aspen Lodge.
