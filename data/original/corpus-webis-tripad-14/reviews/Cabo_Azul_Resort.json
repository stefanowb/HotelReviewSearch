Our suite had a kithcen with everything you could possibly need - modern appliances, great plates, and the like. We cooked several of our dinners which I would highly recommend as the hotel restaurants and restauarants in San Jose were all equally expensive - along the lines of costlier bars/rests. in Los Angeles in NY.

There has been much said about the dark lighting in the second bedroom - I am not sure what the big deal is - open the door and walk into the main suite. Perhaps I am missing something - it really was not a bother. What was a bother was attempting to have our room made up - housekeeping forgot us every single day. We had to call and remind the front desk every afternoon. Do know that housekeeping is included - but you may have to ask for it. The only major pitfall of our stay was our experience with the front desk at checkout. Eduardo was extremely rude and condescending. I had several questions about my Amex receipt (they take a copy of your card when you check in for incidentals like many hotels). Rather than politely discussing how they address additional charges, Eduardo asked me if it was my first time in Mexico. While I replied that it was my first visit to the hotel, I was not born yesterday and did not appreciate his general tone. When I walked away, he made an equally snooty comment - not the best way to end a pleasant vacation.
