We stayed there two weeks and each day was fine. Rooms are comfortable. Plus they are new and clean. Very attentive personnel -- all requests were fulfiled fast and in full (flowers, car rental, reservations, etc.). Plage is good. Food and service in the Restaurant Le Cap is good. During week-ends plage restaurant was a bit overbooked, but the staff always found a place for us even if we did not have a reservation. Drinks on the beach were delivered within five minutes (no delays at all). I liked a pool zone. Very calm and relaxing. Les Pecheus is a remarkable place which attracts people from other towns on Cote d\"Azur. Good and worth each euro. The hotel itself is located in a very good place. On the one hand it's isolated from other plages on the other hand it takes 10 minute walk to get to the center of Juan les Pins with a very dynamic night life. Of course there are some minor flaws: gel and shampoo were not always replaced, taxi service to the hotel was quite expensive.", "title": "WE liked the place very much", "user": "Tourist_SVO", "date": "August 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 75999789}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "The rooms are very modern and completed very tastefully. They are looked after very well with only the small niggle that the bathroom amenities such as shampoo and shower gel were consistently not replaced. The reception and concierge were very helpful. The hotel is let down badly though by the abysmal food service (not in Les Pecheurs) but with the breakfast service and beach restaurant. Ordering simple items such as toast became a major exercise, and not just for our party. Another guest was so infuriated with the continuing slowness of the service, he chased the staff down the stairs and into the kitchen to demand breakfast for the rest of his family. The special lunch in the beach restaurant organised for our friend's birthday was a disaster with different orders turning up, and everyone getting their food at different times. It is clear the kitchen and the staff cannot cope with the numbers of guests. Couple this with one of the rudest beach managers ever, and you have a hotel of differing parts and varying quality. Complaints to the owner at the time were received well but little was done to alleviate the problems.", "title": "Lovely Hotel - Shame About the Beach and Food Service", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Perspective49", "date": "August 18, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 75792165}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled with family", "text": "A charming hotel with a breathtaking view over the water and it's private beach.

Service is dire though. Reception/concierge is awful, sending us on a wild goose chase to a glass factory they recommended that was shut, forgetful room service and not having our rooms made for almost 48 hours... For a new hotel, it was also falling apart - one of our bathrooms did not have a door. The spa is also a massive understatement, there were no spa facilities and the massages were very average. We had 4 rooms in this hotel (3 suites) and even though it was a boutique, we still felt like we were a number.
