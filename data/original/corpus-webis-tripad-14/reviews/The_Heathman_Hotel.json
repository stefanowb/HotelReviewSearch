My room was a king and as others have mentioned not large. The bathroom was in an interesting arrangement. On one side of the entry hall was a room with the toilet, sink, tub and shower, all nice size. On the other side of the entry was a narrow room with another sink and the closet. The room was comfortable and clean with great amenities. I loved the coffee service. I did get a chance to see my colleague's room. She had 2 double beds and the room was much larger with a sitting area. The bathroom was larger, as well. We went to the library for the wine tasting. It wasn't crowded, the host was very friendly and we sat for an hour or more. The was no stingyness on the wine - he kept our glasses full!

Desk and a nice view of trees etc. The only problem was that there was some problem with our bathroom - plugged drain or something - that made it smell awful. They couldn't move us out the first night, but moved us to the Andy Warhol suite the next night. It was quite the place - purple velour, leopard prints, green shag carpet, even a Warhol wig and feather boa to play dress-up with (oh my). Very flamboyant, but also very comfortable - the shag carpet was like having a constant foot massage, and the Tempur Pedic bed made for some great nights sleep. Partial view of Mt.
