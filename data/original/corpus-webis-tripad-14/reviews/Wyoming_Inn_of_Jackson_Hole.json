We were surprised at the level of service for the price. The free hotel shuttle picked us up within 1/2 hr of placing the pickup call to them at the airport, dropped our bags in the immaculate lobby and we were checked in within 5 minutes. Our 3rd floor (top floor) room facing the busy highway was quiet,clean,equippped with a gas fireplace,jacuzzi tub and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. Every morning they have some sort of FREE bagels,toast,coffee,tea,scrambled eggs,bacon or sometimes sausage, pancakes there for you on a simple buffet line. Joe the cook was a very friendly informative pleasant host every morning who we tipped well even though it was free. They even have free soup and or chili and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies every night at the buffet line when you come home at night. This hotel is service oriented and has an attentive friendly staff and is immaculately clean. The second floor features a loft with 2 computers and free internet access for guests. The only minus to the hotel is its on the outside edge of town too far away from the downtown Jackson square area to walk. The FREE city shuttle bus called the \"start bus\" has a convenient stop right behind the hotel near the Best Western Lodge at Jackson hole which will take you anywhere in town for FREE and runs basically every 30 mins or less. To go to the Teton Village ski area however the bus is $6 round trip. We loved this classy,clean small hotel and plan to be back in 2007. J.
