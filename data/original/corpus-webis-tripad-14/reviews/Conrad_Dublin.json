The view was terrible. It looked onto what looked like an office block behind. Nothing else was visible. Nice bathroom, and nice toiletries.

Nothing at all in the immediate area, but a pleasent 10 walk through St. Stephens Green to Grafton Street. O'Connell Street would be about 20 minutes walk without stopping.

The hotel was very clean and the location was such that we could easily walk around to some of the attractions we wanted to see. When we arrived via taxi, there was no doorman available to see that our luggage was taken care of so we lugged heavy suitcases to the front desk. No mention was made of my being a Hilton Honors member nor were we given any extra amenities such as complimentary bottled water, etc. We snacked in the \"pub\" and it was the worst food we had on our entire trip to Ireland and we were in some pretty remote areas.

I wanted a romantic weekend as a surprise birthday present for my husband. It was an easy trip from the airport catching the Aircoach Sandyford route. The bus stop was just around the corner from the hotel which was ideal. On arrival, check in was easy but there was nothing special for HHonours members. I had booked a deluxe room with breakfast included and had asked for a quiet room on a high floor so I was a bit disappointed to be given a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the National Concert Hall on the 3rd floor. However, it turned out to be a lovely bright, airey and quiet room, spotlessly clean with a very comfortable huge bed. The bathroom was very spacious although the shower was over the bath but ample Moulton Brown toiletries. The hotel offered a turn down service at night which was lovely to come into after a long tiring day. There were bathrobes and slippers to use so all in all the room was extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, the hotel itself lacked atmosphere, especially in the bar/lounge area. Even a bit of music might have helped - afterall it is Ireland. Breakfast was good and plentiful and certainly set us up for the day so I would recommend a package including breakfast as if bought separately it cost 24 euros per head. We didn't eat at the hotel as there are plenty of very good restaurants around, although quite expensive. Our favourite is Harrys Cafe on Dawson street, its quite small and cosy but the food is lovely and there is a lovely ambiance about the place. We did the usual tourist trip on the hop on, hop off bus and got off at the Jail for a look around. There was a free tour which was very moving and interesting - this was certainly worth the trip. We also caught the DART train from Pearce Street station down south along the coast, which was amazing. Overall we had a wonderful weekend and the hotel was really convenient.
