It is a very friendly, small city and one that you will want to go back to. The Fitzwilliam Hotel is situated in the centre of the city, 2 minutes walk from City Hall, and the attitude of the staff makes it a hotel you don't want to leave. The concierge Declan and his team were superb in arranging visits for us at shortish notice, and advising us where to go to hear traditional Irish music. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they had never heard the word 'no'. The rooms were extremely well appointed, the high end of luxury with a bath you needed a snorkel for; it was that deep. The bed was huge, I reckon it would suit 4 people, and it was so comfortable. The hotel is near a church centre with bells that ring on the 1/4 hours, but on the hour plays one of 28 different tunes, but don't worry it stops at 9pm. We ate in the hotel bar one night, and the food was Michelin star equivalent, excellent Irish food, and the breakfast in the restaurant was delicious too ( I recommend the Irish breakfast).", "title": "Comfortable and Really Clean :-)", "user": "KJS40", "date": "March 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 154069347}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Reception staff were friendly and fun to talk to, and again no request was too difficult for them, and it was a sad moment when we had to leave them. The concierge will arrange pick ups (at cost) from and to the airports, and will arrange for these to be added to your bill. They will also arrange a shuttle to take you to the start of the hop on hop off bus tour. I certainly want to go back to Belfast, and when I do, the Fitzwilliam is the only place I would stay.
