We wished we were going to be there longer. We were a little put off pulling into the resort as it was next to a very busy road and shared a driveway with a very busy Walgreens which is, literally, right next door. Our room was almost next to the busy road and we were worried the noise would be a problem with our sound-sensitive family, however, it was not an issue at all. The room was very quiet and we never noticed the Walgreens or Home Depot unless we left the resort. Pool areas were great, though we all thought the pool was too bright after dark (big spotlights on!) and closed about an hour too early. Landscaping is incredible! Wonderful walkways all through the resort. Very nice tiki bar that was an even nicer place to have breakfast. Highly recommend this resort!", "title": "Wonderful oasis!", "user": "Virginiagirl50", "date": "July 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115616371}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed 7 nights at Parrot Key Resort in Key West.

We got a 2 story condo room even though we didn't pay for that. There was an entire bedroom and bathroom upstairs that we didn't even use and a living room outside of our bedroom. The place was immaculate. Although the maids service could really be improved. They didn't come in during the day until around 5...which is exactly the time of day we are always back at our hotel relaxing and getting ready for dinner. Not to mention showering! They probably saw my husband naked at one point. When they would finally come in, they would often leave way too many regular towels but not give us our beach towels back.
