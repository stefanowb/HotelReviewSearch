I was upgraded to an Executive Deluxe Suite. My private living room was very spacious, and worked perfectly for all my bridesmaids, my mom, and I to get ready the morning of the wedding. The evening of our wedding, when my husband and i got back to the room, the hotel sent up a bottle of champagne and some scrumptious truffles. Then next day we relaxed at the pool, where i was again greeted with a glass of champagne. On Sunday afternoon, we had some relatives who were coming to our suite to watch us open wedding gifts (family tradition). I realized that with about 12 people coming, we didn't have enough seating. So I called the front desk, and they quickly sent up several banquet chairs, and the suite was so big that we were able to have a seat for everyone without feeling too crowded. All in all it was wonderful. Weddings can be so stressful, and it was such a comfort to know that at least something would go smoothly! The morning of my wedding, I was having some female problems. My matron of honor, quickly went down to the concierge and got medicine for me. It seemed that even when life was throwing us curve balls, the Four Seasons was there to bat them for us.

Given the hot, humid Houston climate I really enjoyed the outdoor pool and adjacent fitness center. The only less than \"four-star\" aspect of the hotel was the architecture - nice but not not noteworthy. The one major deficiency was the lack of quick coffee service in the lobby - a Starbucks stand at the entrance would have been nice; a complementary caraff of plain drip coffee (as the nearby Hilton offfers) would also have been appreciated. This is a great location if your trip is for a convention, otherwise downtown has little to offer. Shops close at 6PM. Some restaurants are closed for the weekend. Even the three local Starbucks were not available for a late afternoon pick-me-up.", "title": "Very Comfortable Stay - If Only They Could Change Houston's Weather", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Scottravels", "date": "July 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 17923053, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Staff friendliness, cleanliness, proximity to convention center", "disliked": "\u2014 Downtown folds up at 5PM"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Needs a facelift, but good service", "text": "I thought this hotel was fine.
