When the kids were very small we used the kids clubs which were excellent and they loved the kids activities during the day and in the evening. Now they are older we make lots of use of the football pitch, the tennis court and the long walks. The par 3 golf course is absolutely perfect for young players. Also cannot forget the new rope slide which the kids loved. The swimming pool has also been refurbed and is very good, our kids love to go swimming every day.
