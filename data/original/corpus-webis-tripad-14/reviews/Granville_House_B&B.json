The furnishings are nearly new and the hosts go out of their way to make you feel welcome and answer questions about Vancouver. We had the Master Suite (Cedar Room) which fronts on the very busy Granville Road. Despite our initial qualms about the traffic, that turned out to be a non-issue. Breakfasts are described as \"continental\" but were excellent including a delicious Quiche. The bed and bath are both state of the art and give an air of luxury. I had some issues connecting to the internet service, but they seem to be on top of that issue and I'm confident they will get it worked out. There is off-street parking and the electronic access system lets you come and go without a key.", "title": "This is a winner!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "willisjw", "date": "August 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8514768, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Excellent bed and bath and great hosts"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is also a great location for Vancouver.

Absolutely lovely with brand new, gorgeous linens, comfortable bed, very modern bathroom and everything was impeccably clean. We did have trouble checking in, because the electronic lock instructions went to our spam folder, but as long as you make sure you receive that email, it's fine. The owners are so nice and friendly and very knowledgeable about the area - they had great recommendations and we really enjoyed the restaurants they suggested (Vij's - great, interesting indian food, Chow - probably one of the best meals on the entire trip. superb) as well as the location near South Granville. The B&B is located on a busy street, but the interior is completely silent.
