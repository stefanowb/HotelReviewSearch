Sheraton, Westin, Marriott) that are spacious & have the amenities of four star hotels, you'll definitely like this place. There's no nickeling and diming you for internet service or parking. Wi-fi is available for free and voucher for a free drink per person at the bar (beer, wine or port). We stayed one night on May 30, 2010 since we were flying out the next day from Lisbon. We decided to stay near Sintra to visit the sites. The air is very fresh (a tad bit cooler) since you're in a \"higher\" elevation. The resort is very clean and of an excellent standard. Our room faced the golf-course and there were two? pools (very nice!). The hotel was not super busy so it was not noisy at all. I didn't try the spa but the price list was very reasonable. It is a very short drive to downtown historical area (5-10 minutes) so I definitely recommend staying here if you're planning on visiting Sintra.", "title": "Very nice hotel", "user": "wlslb", "date": "June 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 66237988}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very clean, modern and functional", "text": "rooms comfortable and clean, staff was very helpful, great breakfast", "user": "Jaque_bpc", "date": "October 25, 2009", "id": 47688512}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I actually own a flat in the close off district of Quinta da Beloura 1 but still decided to spend one night with my wife in the Pestana Hotel next door.

The hotel is modern, and was inaugurated in October 2006. It is clean and the rooms (we got two superior rooms) are large and well furnished.

The breakfast was pretty good, with a selection of hot and cold food, and a good variety of pastries. We only dined at the hotel twice, and on both nights they had a buffet, which in my view was overpriced and uninteresting \u2013 you\u2019re better off checking out some of the very unpretentious traditional restaurants in Sintra and neighbouring areas, as we did on the other nights, but with a small daughter the convenience of the hotel was didn\u2019t go out very night.
