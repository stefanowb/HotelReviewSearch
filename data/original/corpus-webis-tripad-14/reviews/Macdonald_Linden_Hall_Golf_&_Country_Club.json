This was the most disappointing spa I have ever been to, on entering the spa we both knew it was not what we had expected. We had to wait almost 15 minutes for a member of staff to appear at the spa reception and when someone eventually did appear this was one of the therapist who told us we would have to wait as she was busy! We had already waited more than 10 minutes. When someone did eventually come to see us we were given towels and a robe (no spa slippers) which we had not been informed that we would not be getting therefore we had no footwear, our robe and towels given were also not really what we desired to be wearing on a \"luxury spa day\" they were grubby and well worn in.", "title": "Disappointing dirty spa and staff", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Holshappening", "date": "October 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 143802060}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were shown around the pool area by a member of staff who ventured in with his shoes on.
