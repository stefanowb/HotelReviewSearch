Grounds were beautiful and the hospital staff were extremely nice. Loved the morning mimosas. I'm still raving about the private beach. Warm gulf waters. Absolutely amazing. They have an adult pool so that was a plus. Room was clean and very spacious. The bed was super comfy. The view wasn't too good because we were unable to open the sliding doors due to maintenance. Our room faced the hotel entrance. We did have a nice view of the bay. Ordered room service and the food was decent. Other than that we really didn't eat on premises.

With two kids and two adults, the spacious rooms are a nice bonus. We arrived at the hotel around 1 am but received service as if we were arriving at a peak hour. Kudos to Jarod who was friendly and responsive and to the bellman who had our bags inside our room before we even got there from the front desk. Unlike our last stay two years ago, the hotel was completely maxed out due to the Easter Weekend - but crowds got much better the following week. Kids love the pool and Camp Coconut. Kudos to Savannah for remembering us from our last stay and for making the kids' day a great one. They also loved the ping pong table, ice cream shop and free DVD rentals. It is really nice having that option rather than bringing movies with you or even worse, paying for in-room movies. Loved the fire pit at night and the seating areas outside Magnolia for when the adults want to have a cocktail at night without the kids.", "title": "Spring break vacation", "user": "JHR6829", "date": "April 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157514251}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled on business", "text": "We enjoyed the boat trip over to Hickory Island although we felt sorry for those who arrived on time but were not able to make the trip due to a lack of capacity on the shuttle boats.", "title": "Nice retreat", "user": "KS_Travelin_girl", "date": "April 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 157432672}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Weather was perfect, staff was great.

The Hyatt was recently built so everything was really clean and it had lots of amenities Huge lobby (that kind of reminded me of some of the Ritz Carlton and Four Season's properties we have stayed at). They had a lot of things to do ~ lots of pools (infinity edge pool for kids so our daughter could sit in the pool and splash). The boat ride to the beach was nice (takes 10 -15 min.) We stayed on the beach for about an hour collected seashells and headed back. Its a narrow beach but it was nice to be able to go to the beach and hear the waves. (Didn't see any bugs on our trip). They had a nice bar area with chess, checkers, etc for people to play. There was a small kids arcade and outside of it were some table tennis tables. They had a cute little ice cream shop that had tiny tables for kids. My husband and I rented a bucket of golf balls and tried to hit the pin in the middle of one of the lakes. They had bikes for rent. The spa was nice (nothing incredible but who would complain about a massage). I would definitely recommend renting a car ~ like some of the other reveiws have said the resort food is ok but not really worth what they charge. We had a great meal at nearby Roys. One more negative besides price ~ you don't see the beach from the rooms (you might actually see a swampy looking area from your room or the bay). It is an expensive hotel but they usually offer deals ~ we had a $ 50 resort credit every night. We also stocked up on water/drinks and other snack items from one of the many nearby grocery stores and each room at the Hyatt has an empty fridge in the room.

Lots of bogs and standing water. If you want scenic views from your hotel..do NOT go here! There are also several new high rise condos being built right next to the resort.
