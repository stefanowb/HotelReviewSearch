Aleli by the Sea is a great guest house for those looking for the perfect Condado location on a budget. We stayed in room #7 and were very satisfied. There is a view of the beach and you can open your window and listen to the surf all night long. It is not fancy and is a bit rough around the edges, but its perfectly adequate for those looking for a base from which to explore San Juan.

Well, if you\u2019re like me you want a clean room with a comfortable bed, an air-conditioner that works well, and a color TV with a remote. We cannot realistically expect to pay $69 - $109 a day and get accommodation equivalent to The Intercontinental or The El San Juan Hotel and Casino! My husband and I just got back from staying 9 days at the Aleli By the Sea Guesthouse. We got everything that we expected and more! This small guesthouse is the most affordable place on the beach. They have a few rooms that are oceanfront but even if you have one towards the back, the Aleli has a lovely deck facing the ocean, which is just a few feet away. It has a lovely sit-in kitchen, which is delightful if you want to stick to a tighter budget and cook a meal instead.
