We went with another couple to celebrate my husbands 40th Birthday. Our room 'Eden' was stunning, Lovely bath,bed and balcolny ( you get all the afternoon/evening sun!) We had to drag ourselves away to go and see the sights. The most impressive feature of the hotel however was the staff! nothing was to much trouble. Everyone was fun, helpful, kind, considerate and efficient. Well done to all of you! I would say that the hotel caters for all types of custom, Families with young and older children, groups of friends, couples and retired allsorts, execpt large hen or stag parties mostly due to the fact they can be a nuisance to other guests.
