The staff couldn't have been more helpful upon arrival, we checked to see if the room was available early and didn\u2019t get the usual rooms not available but a good response and a just short wait while they checked. The room soon became available and we got escorted to the room to ensure everything was ok for us. The room was of a good size with flat TV and decent shower/bath, the beds are comfy and the air con is easy to use. Plenty of towels for all the family, and hand wash/shower gel were supplied in large dispensers. The only letdown in any way was the noise from the roads; even with the windows closed you could hear the cars driving up and down all night. I think if we ever go to Swindon again I would ask for a room on the other side of the hotel away from the road. The breakfast was a little pricey \u00a38.50 but the choice was good and the staff wasn\u2019t strict on how much you had. \u00a35 for a days parking may seem a little expensive to some but I was told it was much more than that by other parents.
