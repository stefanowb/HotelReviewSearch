I was disappointed with our table considering we had booked a month early and then followed up when we arrived in Negril. Make sure you are specific when booking a table and request one of the more romantic settings overlooking the water. We enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service.

It is the staff and the food that totally make Ivan's, the atmosphere and the view are the best. The food for our reception was delicious and we also enjoyed meals there on 3 other nights. Our favorites are the Eye of the hurricane and the Jerk chicken penne pasta. The staff are so friendly and the bar staff have plenty of smiles, songs, and great drinks. I write a lot of reviews and I try to be as honest as I can good or bad. I don't prop places up that don't deserve it and I don't rate them down for spite. I'm giving it to you straight and the word on Ivan's is nothing but good! Get there early enjoy the sunset, losses up,with a drink at the bar, then have a great meal. Make sure to hit the bar again for lots of fun later. There is a reason this place is rated well consistently, a reason the local business men make it.
