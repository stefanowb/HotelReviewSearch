We tried 3 rooms but all of the doors and windows are old and have not been sealed so all the traffic noise from the corniche came straight in the room. It was like being on the road. The staff tried really hard to help but in the end their only solution was for us to put cotton wool in our ears - which we had to on the 1st night but it didn't make any difference. They really had very little understanding of the problem and seemed to feel that we weren't closing the windows properly.

We went up by train 1st class. The train was filthy, it could really do with a clean and this is first class and it took 3 hours. Next time I would pay the extra and go by car. Stayed at Windsor Palace Hotel. Looks like Metropole on the outside. Has a wonderful old lift and the rooms are like a palace, high ceilings. The room was basic and clean. The toilet took a while to fill up when flusing. The beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in a hotel and we didnt hear a single noise from other occupants. The food was good and cheap and it is the first mini bar that I have come across where the items are cheaper than buying it outside. Just a word of mention, at reception there is a note which says that foreigners are not allowed to pay with Egyptian pounds, they must pay with foreign currency?
