However, I found the staff at the hotel (except for the shuttle driver and one of the receptionists) to be rather abrupt and rude. We were told upon check in that coffee would be provided at all times in the lobby. When we went downstairs to get the coffee we were told that it wasn't for us but for the conference attendees (how would they know we weren't attendees?). The room was clean but showing signs of wear. The price was right ($92), the location a bit far from downtown but doable by bus.
