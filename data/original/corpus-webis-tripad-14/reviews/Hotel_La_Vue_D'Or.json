We were coming from Positano and it was just a short bus ride and walk downhill from the actual stop. The hotel is located in the hills of Sorrento and not actually in the city center. There is a free shuttle that leaves from the front of the hotel multiple times daily and although they tell you its a 20 minute walk down it took us about an hour and a half... we may have taken a wrong turn but Italy time is a little longer... The hotel was clean and the rooms have little balconys overlooking the pool and sorrentos hills which are beautiful. The staff spoke great english and we among some of the most interesting characters I have ever met. The hotel had a snack bar with drinks and gelato that was open late every night. The owners had their very tempermental dog Billy hanging around every day which was cute and the bus driver was very helpful and took great care of us. The bartenders were very comical and friendly as well. I would most defintely stay at this hotel again. If you are taking the late shuttle back be careful because it is not large and could not fit all of the people so multiple trips had to be taken. The towels in the bathroom were the thin Italian style that do not dry you well so if you have the room bring a towel of your own.Sorrento is a wonderful and magical place and I can not wait to go back", "title": "Interesting and fun hotel!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "brooke16", "date": "January 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12830116, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the staff and the views", "disliked": "\u2014 the thin towels"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Vue Dor is a lovely family run hotel with breathtaking views.
