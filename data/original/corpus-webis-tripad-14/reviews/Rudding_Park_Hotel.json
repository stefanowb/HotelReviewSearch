Our main problem with our stay was dining in the restaurant our main reason for staying here was to sample their fine dining a la carte menu so were surprised to be given a very basic 3 course set menu when I enquired to the person who appeared to be in charge I was told this was the only menu available and what sounded like a a lame excuse of been let down by suppliers!!!?? The restaurant is quite large and the place was packed must have been well over a 100 people dining so i would doubt they could provide fine dining for that many people either that or they didn't have enough chefs in as it was new years day. So had to make do with what seemed to be function food a pre done pate with a bit of salad a carvery main course and a crumble the food was ok but was the kind of food you get in a pub. This was extremely disappointing as we were celebrating a special occasion and totally spoiled the evening if they had told us at the time of booking or even explained at check in as they knew we were dining in the restaurant that evening at least we could have lowered our expectations or maybe dined elsewhere. Also the bar/restaurant wasn't what I was expecting in a country hotel it felt like I was in a city centre hotel as it was in the new wing and was very modern and a bit souless and doesn't seem to make the most of its location or the views although the conservatory seemed nicer.", "title": "Hotel ok but restaurant a let down", "user": "JOOLS11", "date": "January 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 94121510}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "So overall we won't be back and I wouldn't recommend, if you like fine dining in a stunning country hotel you'd be better off going to swinton park where we stayed the following day, which if you drop on a deal is a similar price to stay.", "title": "Amazing new rooms", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SueW35", "date": "January 22, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 94073331}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010", "text": "Also on check out we were charged \u00a38 for breakfast delivery to our room but on the breakfast form it states \u00a32.50 per person so should have been \u00a35 I tried to explain at check out but they basically wouldn't have it, so wasn't going to argue too much over \u00a3 3 but it's the principal.", "title": "Afternoon tea in the Clocktower", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "exploradoraUK", "date": "January 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 93896105}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Rudding Park is one of our all- time favourites.

First impressions were great with a very good check-in service and very friendly staff taking luggage to our rooms. Our room was well appointed, with a lovely comfortable bed and the room was very clean. However, for a hotel of this standard, certain things let it down. For a 4 Star hotel I would expect the bed linen to have a higher thread count. In addition, the tiles surrounding the bath had black bacteria on the grout and some rotten wood around the bath surround. However, the service we experienced was very good with room service happily bringing fresh milk for tea up to our room. Another small complaint is that we always had to phone to request more tea bags as these were not replenished at either turn down service or when servicing our room in the morning. The restaurant in the hotel was lovely, with friendly staff and atmosphere. We had to eat at 1900 as the restaurant was so busy. Don't quite know why as both my husband and I found the restaurant very disappointing. The menu is not particularly exciting (and there is a choice of 3 to choose from) and is over priced for the quality and standard of the food. I had the 'special, roast sirloin with Yorkshire pudding and winter veg. The winter veg consisted of small balls of potatoes that were undercooked. An additional bowl of veg came that consisted of carrots, again, undercooked, and more potatoes and parsnips. My 'sirloin, consisted of 2 slices of beef, wafer thin, with a hard, overcooked and very dry Yorkshire pudding. It is quite clear you are paying for your surroundings, not for the quality or the ingredients of the food. At \u00a319 for my main course, it is overpriced. And this was not just at dinner, breakfast too was over rated. Very few cereals to choose from, a small cold buffet, with emphasis on the cooked breakfasts. I had eggs Benedict. The holandaise was horrible, thick and more like scrambled eggs. On the second day I had haddock, nice, but with only a poached egg on the side, it wasn't special, it could have done with a sauce. I ordered wholemeal toast on both days and it did not appear. Bread is poor quality white and not very 'toasted, more like normal bread. Service at breakfast is poor and slow. Rudding Park is a lovely place to stay, but isn't cheap, so for the price I expect better service and better quality food.

I had the vegetarian millefeuille one night, and the pheasant the next, both of which were fantastic. One pudding didn't live up to its billing, so we sent it back, and it was immediately removed from our bill, no questions asked.

We booked for four people the previous day and the organiser was very helpful over the telephone, but when we eventually made it through to the party room itself some 48 hours or so later, there was no table set, no-one knew we were coming and we were once again left embarrassed at the bar whilst someone went in search of a table! When I explained what had happened, the party organiser did everything in her power to rectify matters (hence I haven\u2019t marked the hotel less the four blobs on this occasion so as not to spoil their unblemished Trip Advisor track record); she even gave us a free bottle of wine! But the fact is, the night had been spoiled at this point - and as if matters could not get any worse, word hadn\u2019t filtered through that we don\u2019t eat meat, so there was nothing to eat. Again, the party organiser did the best she could under the circumstances but nevertheless, this is a night we will remember for a very long time but for all the wrong reasons. Oh, and by way of explanation, this review is late because the party organiser promised feedback from Rudding management but nothing has been forthcoming. I expect however, they may reply here and try to defend these comments as they have done with other negative reviews, when in fact it would be much more laudable just to let any minor criticisms speak for themselves.", "user": "Shipscaptain", "date": "January 27, 2011", "id": 94608237}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "A thoroughly well run and friendly hotel within a rural location but yet near enough to hit the town for a change.
