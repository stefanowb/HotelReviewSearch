Etha, the owner, really created something special here, the house is very well decorated with super comfortable rooms, private verandas and the most breathtaking view ever. Etha, Putu and the rest of the team do everything to make their guests happy, and their personal approach made us really feel at home, we stayed one full week! Breakfast is served in the common area, also beautifully decorated with old wood and funky furniture, and is very tasty, with fresh fruits, organic jam and eggs upon request. We were allowed to use the kitchen, and Etha also cooked every now and then, a very nice Indonesian buffet with products from the vegetable garden. The hotel is located a bit outside Ubud (you will be surrounded by sounds of birds, frogs and the neigbour's roosters) but staff is very helpful in organizing transport, we rented a scooter most days and would do the same again.", "title": "Best stay in Bali!", "user": "MarNL", "date": "October 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141950476}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012", "text": "Go to Omah Apik if you want to enjoy the Balinese country side and rice paddies, if you want action you better stay somewhere else.
