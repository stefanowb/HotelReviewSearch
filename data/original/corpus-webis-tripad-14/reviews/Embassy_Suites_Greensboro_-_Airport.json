Minor gripe, that the HD TVs had no HD channels. (Embassy's like to give you 2 TVs - 1 per room - but has you pay a small fee for internet if you're not HH Gold/Diamond). Also, the hotel gets a B grade (passable) for noise insulation between rooms; it seems that newer hotels do a better job at this.
