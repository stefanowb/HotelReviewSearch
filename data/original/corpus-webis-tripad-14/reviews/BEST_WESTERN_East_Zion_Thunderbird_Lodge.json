The rooms were nice and clean - dated but clean. There was a small fridge and coffee maker. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We were scheduled to stay 5 days but moved on after two. No real restaurants in the town except the over-priced one @ the hotel and a Subway. We were really looking forward to using the pool and hot tub after hiking and horeback riding. The pool could definately use some work. The hot tub was NASTY! Full of mold and in need of a good scrubbing and some bleach/chlorine. The staff was very pleasant when we checked out and did not give us a hard time. If they fix the pool/hot tub we would probably return. Until then, there are other places that are much better.", "title": "Moved on early", "user": "FlTravel78", "date": "June 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 112092407}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "when checking in we asked if they serve breakfast as most best westerns do. they said yes BUT didn't mention only at their private resturant that is pricey and there is no free BW breakfast at all.", "title": "\"great location but..........", "user": "davida70", "date": "June 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 111356307}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Laso please note there is no cell reception in the rooms and very weak internet- even their own network.", "title": "Better than expected", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Raleighite13", "date": "June 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 111304244}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We chose this motel because of the location for visiting Bryce & Zion national parks.

It looks like the unit may have been recently updated. The room had a peaked ceiling, tile floors in the bathroom and sink areas, clean paint, western-style log headboards on the beds, free Wi-Fi and a small refrigerator/freezer (we were glad to have that). It was situated near the motel golf course and was very quiet. The room was quite large and very clean. Service was excellent. We were expecting a typical no frills \"boring\" motel, but it was not like that at all. The main building decor has a Western flavor including some massive gnarled tree trunks holding up the eaves that add to the ambiance. Staying in Mt. Carmel means a short drive to the east entrance to Zion National Park and another half hour or so if you want to go to the Visitor's Center and the park shuttle. Springdale is closer to that area, but the motels there are more expensive. That's the trade-off if you are only there for Zion.", "title": "Location, Location!!!
