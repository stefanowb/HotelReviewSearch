In fact, you\u2019re never more than 25 minutes away from most parts of the island, including the beautiful baroque capital of Valletta. Originally a traditional seafront townhouse, the hotel has been meticulously converted to provide 44 rooms, an intimate setting and very personalised service to its guests. Today it remains a family-run establishment, and we are committed to ensuring you feel at home and well looked after. Each hotel room offers excellent facilities, fresh Mediterranean decor and plenty of space. Many also boast unobstructed sea views, and you will be able to watch the colourful fishing boats bobbing on the water from the comfort of your balcony or the rooftop swimming pool. Meanwhile, as a cosmopolitan commercial and entertainment district, St Julian\u2019s surrounds you with many of the best restaurants, bars and shops that Malta has to offer."}
