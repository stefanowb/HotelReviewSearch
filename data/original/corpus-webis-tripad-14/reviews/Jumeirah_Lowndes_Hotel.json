The hotel is in a lovely area, Lowndes/Belgravia, easily reached from Knightsbridge tube station. It's in an unassuming building, a new build rather than the beautiful terraced property around Lowndes Square. I appreciate it's classed as a boutique hotel but I expected a high quality boutique service. The staff we encountered were very pleasant but some lacked the Jumeirah customer service skills. I booked an executive room as it was slightly larger than the deluxe rooms and had a balcony (which I thought would be nice to sit out on with a coffee and watch the world go by) We were both amazed by the size of the room. It was very small, with an even smaller bathroom and the balcony actually overlooked the rear air conditioning vents and some buidling work scafolding. Needless to say we didn't use it, so need not have paid the \u00a380 extra for the balcony. In fairness to the hotel, everything was very clean and smelt fresh and clean. We encountered another problem using the bathroom: The overhead shower is so near the ceiling, if you are tall you would have to use the hand held shower hose. There was no bath mat and the bath was so slippy you had to hold the rail with one hand whilst holding the shower hose with the other, not ideal! The Doorman was very helpful and Paolo in the bar made a delicious strawberry daquiri. As a silver sirius member you are entiltled to have continental breakfast free but after telling 2 waiters of this we were still charged for both breakfasts. My husband decided to have a full english and pay the difference. (\u00a330 for full english \u00a319.50 for continental) It was very poor for the money, he waited 30 mins for it and when it came it was luke warm, we told the waiter but he just said \"Oh Dear!!\" After telling reception again that I was a silver sirius they took the bfast charges off the bill. If you stay at the Lowndes you can use the facilities of the Carlton Tower. We may consider staying at the Carlton Tower next time but unfortunately wouldn't stay at the Lowndes again, mainly due to the cost and what you get for your money.", "title": "Not quite what we expected", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Anoif", "date": "November 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120202109}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in a jr suit that was big and nice.
