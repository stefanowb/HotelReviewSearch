The staff was polite but not friendly. Not one of the desk staff could even manage a smile during the entire 5 days I was there and they certainly had no interest in small-talk. I got the impression someone who worked there had passed away recently any time I spoke with them. I had initially chosen this hotel based on their claim of free Hi-Speed internet (I was in town for computer training and I am a working service tech so access to email was important) but the Hi-Speed internet would not work with my Apple G4 PowerBook. I was kindly allowed to troubleshoot this problem by plugging into an ethernet port in their \"Business Room\" but it still would not work even though their Windows-based computers seeemed to work fine with exactly the same settings. They must be running some weird non-standard router config (there's nothing different about an Apple laptop's network connections that could have prevented it from working and the laptop worked fine at the training facility) so Apple laptop owners beware. On the positive side the room was pleasant and comfortable, always cleaned immaculately and restocked each day, and the mini-fridge and microwave were nice to have for someone who had to stay in each night to study. If the Hi-Speed internet issue were fixed I would consider staying there again.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 7, 2004", "id": 2811068}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The best of the G.T.A", "text": "Stayed there for a week at a very good rate in the Exceutive Suite.

The restaurant at the hotel had excellent food and down the road were some wonderful restuarants like the Mandarian Buffet all you can eat oriental and american food, Swiss Chalet, Tomatto all you can eat Italian restaurant. The bed was extremely comfortable and room was a good size. The best part was on our last day we got one of the special suites which had a whirlpool tub french doors leading into the bedroom it was pretty romantic and great for a last day there. All the rooms have fridges, microwaves, and a coffemaker. There is also a free continental breakfast but if you want a warm breakfast its only 3 dollars to upgrade to one. The Zoo, Science Musem, Canada's Wonderland is only 20 minutes away and downtown Toronto is only 30 minutes away. And Wild water kingdom was about 30 Minutes away but worth checking out if you love water parks.
