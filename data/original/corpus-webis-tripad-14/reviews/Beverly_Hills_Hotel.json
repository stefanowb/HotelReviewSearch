I was greeted by name in reception, in the lounge , in the Sugar Club and at the pool. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet has the freshest seasonal fruit and juices. The buffet also has an abundance of cold meats and smoked salmon. The hot breakfast includes a variety of eggs, meats, fish and a range of vegetarian accompaniments. The food in the Sugar Club is absolutely fantastic. The staff, including the general manager, reception, concierge, dining areas, pool and housekeeping go oit of their way to make one stay absolutely enjoyable.", "title": "Fantastic view, service and cuisine - that's The Beverly Hills Hotel", "user": "Jonny6001", "date": "January 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 123124647}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Not wanting to burst some of the reviewers' lavish praise bubbles hovering over this hotel, I'd like to present perhaps a more realistic point of view, having stayed here many times. Firstly, the management has changed often over the last three years - not a good sign at all. Then, the rooms, specially the more expensive lower cabana's are in critical need of restoration. The airconditioning leaks badly. The patios are cracked and unsightly. The paint is peeling off and the minor furniture refurbishments are now well past their sell-by-date. And, there are glaring electrical problems. The rooms in the main building are small, but pleasant with dirty little balconies. Don't get coaxed into a room in the middle of the floor, because these are the smallest, with bathrooms that only slighlty outdo telephone booths for size. The upper cabana's are better designed with better bathrooms, but only offer queen beds except for cabana 10 [two bedrooms]. Afternoon tea was once an event at theis hotel, but is now simply pathetic. In this regard, the Oysterbox nextdoor puts The Beverly Hills to shame. However, the staff are pleasant, breakfast is good and the pool has been renovated about eighteen months ago. The bottom line is, what you're willing to pay. At a good rate, this hotel becomes acceptable. But too often, guests are extorted.", "title": "The truth about this hotel", "user": "allgone1234", "date": "January 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 123104145}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I know for a fact, that many of the hotels' regulars, have refused to come back here, despite the managements overcompensatory pleasantries.
