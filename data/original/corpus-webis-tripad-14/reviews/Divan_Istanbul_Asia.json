We moved here to be closer to SAW airport. It was nice and relaxing and this hotel had the nicest and largest room of our stay and if I remember was the least expensive. The room was on the 12th floor, thus a nice view. Not much to do in this area but we needed the rest after 5 days on the trot in Old Town, Sultanahmet. The Turkish bath was great and just a nice hotel, with a nice roof top restaurant. We had our first meal at the hotel by having dinner on Sat. It was really good \u2013 not cheap. Expect US prices. The 2 glasses of wine really took the bill over the top. Next day, it was Sunday and they had a Sunday brunch. Again not cheap but I think worth it. I did not even make it to the main dishes \u2013 just the salads, cheeses, sushi (rolls \u2013 so really Maki), olives, meats, smoked salmon and on and on. The setting is nice too up on the top floor looking over the sea (Marimas?). The previous night we sat outside but for lunch we sat inside next to a window. Part of my entertainment here was watching the traffic. The freeway right by the Hotel is slightly uphill and curves. So the drivers really cannot see the traffic till they get right there and for some reason it is always backed up right in front of the Hotel (maybe construction ahead). Cars, vans and trucks literally turned around and went the opposite direction while other just backed up. My guess is there must have been an exit behind them.
