It was not even close. The couple that stayed at Mario's had a good experience, a nice lobby, friendly staff and a good breakfast. None of those were true at the Hotel Mia Cara although their rate was somewhat less.

I mention this only for older travellers with bad circulation who may put a high value on central heating. Otherwise, put on a sweater, and enjoy this lovely hotel with a great location and inviting decor. The room was really comfortable, but only had one armoire. Again, not really a problem, it's just for your information in case potential guests in the triple room absolutely need to unpack their suitcases.
