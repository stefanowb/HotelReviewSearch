Our room was lovely and big and very clean and the hotel owners were really friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful and the coffee was excellent. The minor downside was that we didn't really have a terrace - just a window that opened up onto another building. However, there was a room located next to the breakfast room which had a huge terrace and looked amazing. I guess this was the suite so make sure you book this if you can!

It is on the top floor so be prepared to haul your cases up lots of stairs, or ask for assistance. It is very centrally located in town near the main piazza and a short walk to the bus/ferry terminals. It is rather well hidden, but the locals are very friendly and helpful.
