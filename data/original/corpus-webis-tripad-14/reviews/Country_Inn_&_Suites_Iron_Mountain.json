We checked in at 11:00pm and the front staff was as courteous as had we arrived mid day. They had fresh, warm chocolate chip cookies for us, as I had told them we would arrive late. This is an award winning touch of hospitality. The rooms are immaculate and spacious, the indoor pool/hot tub are excellent, and the breakfast is fantastic. All the staff at the hotel were extremely courteous and helpful with any assistance we required. The free wireless internet worked flawlessly...I have also stayed at this hotel previously for business and never have had any issues whatsoever with superb Internet access. This is truly the best hotel within 50 miles of Iron Mountain, and located right by shopping (Wal-Mart/Home Depot/K-Mart) and fine dining. I would highly recommend the Storheims restaurant directly across from the hotel...great breakfast/lunch/dinner and treats. Other fine restaurants are Fontanas, Romagnolis, and B's Country Cafe.", "title": "My favorite hotel in Iron Mountain", "user": "torotech", "date": "March 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25965541}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled solo", "text": "If you are traveling to the Upper Peninsula or northern Wisconsin, this is definitely the place to stay!!!", "title": "New hotel", "user": "late74C", "date": "August 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19382499, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 new hotel", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "My sister and I were on the road and needed somewhere to stay.
