Our room was very small - barely enough room to move, and the closet was tiny, as well. Some colleagues had a bigger room, so they do exist. Beds were twin but comfortable. Bathroom was also small and poorly equiped.....no place to put anything. I have never been in a hotel before that didn't supply guests with a box of tissues - if you stay, you need to bring your own! Also, I asked for skirt hangers (ones with clips)...when told they didn't have them, I asked, \"How do you hang your skirts?\" and the receptionist said, \"I don't have any. I only wear pants.\" \"OK then - no problem for you!\" said I.. The receptionists also wouldn't make change. The ironing board is shared by the floor and an iron is available from the front desk. Although fresh croissants and chocolate make up for a lot, the breakfast buffet was probably the equivalent of US Hampton Inns - again OK but choices quite limited. Free internet was a plus.

The Buffet breakfast was very good well above what we had expected also. The only slight downside was the parking, but the hotel provided a permit for us to use for the on street parking.
