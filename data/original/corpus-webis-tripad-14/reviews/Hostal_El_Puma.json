It's nothing to write home about. but the ratio price-quality is great (we paid about $13 for a private room with a shared bathroom). Our room was basic but clean, towels were provided for free. As it was on sunny side, we really needed just one out of 5 (!) warm blankets, forthoughtfully put on our bed. The window in our room was small, but it was facing the Main Square. The owner is super friendly and understanding. Oh and probably the most important thing: hot water is abundant and is gas-heated (which is a great advantage in comparison to electric showers). All in all, it's the place to stay if you are looking forward to a better out of cheaper accomodations.", "title": "Only good location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Dina A", "date": "September 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 118175727}], "location": {"country": "Peru", "region": "Cusco Region", "continent": "South America", "city": "Cusco"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 4, "very good": 7, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 3}, "slim_ranking": 0.515}
