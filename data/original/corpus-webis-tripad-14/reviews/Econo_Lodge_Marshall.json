It's older--our room clearly had some water and other assorted damage from the past, but oh well. It was relatively clean. The heating and AC worked--we used both due to time of year. There's some breakfast food--cereal, bagels, pastries. We drove around the I-20/59 area and checked with three hotels. This had the best price and looked pretty okay from the outside. It served our purposes well: as a jumping off point for visiting Caddo Lake and Jefferson. We didn't leave our valuables/important stuff--just in case. People who worked there were nice.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MaggieP6789", "date": "November 1, 2010", "id": 85644435}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good place to stay......but", "text": "Nice place to stay. Always had towels, but housekeeping needs help in making beds. Room was cleaned daily. The only problem, someone took a valuable necklace. Someone else other than us who had entry to our room took it.?? Housekeeping????? It was hidden to where the individual had to literally go through our stuff to find it.
