When we checked in they informed us that the kids had to sleep upstairs but that it was easy for them to go to our room downstairs. The rooms have a front door which we locked from the inside before going to bed. Since we have young children we left the individual rooms to our suites open. At 2.30am we heard somebody coming into the front door and stepping in. We got an enourmous fright and jumped out of bed to investigate, luckily we could not find anybody inside and our kids were save upstairs. When coming back in the hallway somebody knocked at our door, he said he was from room service to collect the breakfast orders. I could hardly believe that somebody just walks into a room which we locked from the inside, especially at 2.30am. I phoned reception and they were very passive, they reacted like \"oh is he doing it again at this time, we will inform security\". Apparently the gentleman was indeed working for the hotel. When we tested the front door it appeared that, although we thought it was locked, you could open it from the outside. We barricaded the door and tried to get some sleep, which was difficult . In the morning we contacted reception again, they promised to fix the front door. When I called again a couple of hours later they told me the front door could not be fixed. I found that hard to believe because it has a lock. The only thing they could do is to instruct room service not to just come into our room. Not satisfied with the situation we barricaded the door again for the second night. All in all a very disappointing experience. The rooms are clean but have cheap finishings. Ttv and the appliances are all of inferior brands, Service was poor because they are not well informed and did not follow up on our issue. This hotel does not deserve 5 stars!", "title": "woken up by room service at 2.30am", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "rinskestaal", "date": "July 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 34597977}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled on business", "text": "This is a hotel for golfers with great walking trails.

Staff are all very friendly and breakfast is magnificent (as my waistline will confirm). As for the golf, well the Gary Player-designed Links is truly astonishing (and astonishingly tough when played in high winds), although the Montague, while beautifully manicured, is probably a little overrated (once considered South Africa's premier course). I preferred Oubaai, an Ernie Els track a 20-minute drive away. George is a staggeringly scenic part of the world, although there isn't a tonne to do in the town itself. Not exactly a hotbed of action you might say, although there are some pretty decent restaurants. \"Unfortunately they closed the strip club,\" lamented one local chap I befriended in the hotel bar. (I should point out that \"they\" isn't Fancourt; the strip joint was in town somewhere). All in all a wonderful place to get away from it all (and play lots of golf).
