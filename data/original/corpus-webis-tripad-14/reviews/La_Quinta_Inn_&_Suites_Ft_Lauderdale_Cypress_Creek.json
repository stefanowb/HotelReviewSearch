I reported this to management on Tuesday, that most likely, the circuit breaker needed to be reset, and by Thursday, it was still not fixed. The continental breakfast was mediocre, and the location is not very accessible. The hotel is in a decent location, but due to the cheap prices of the rooms, the clientelle is not the best. Overall, the room was clean, neat, as were the restrooms. The room did smell of smoke, and even after it was reported, still smelled of smoke. (I asked for a non-smoking room.)

So when I purchased the room I called the hotel to request a room with two beds, and they were nice enough to give us one. The room was fairly spacious.

This is a newer hotel and the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The staff were friendly and courteous. The hotel has a more than adequate continental breakfast and even includes fresh waffles. Being on vacation, we would have liked to have seen the hours for the mid-week breakfasts extended. The place was very clean. It was more expensive and we received less for our money than in other areas of Florida, but we felt that the Ft. Lauderdale area as a whole is more expensive. The hotel is convenient to the Butterfly Gardens, which we enjoyed, and to the turnpike. The rooms could use a refrigerator. I enjoyed the outdoor jacuzzi pool, but I felt it could have been hotter.

Traveling with 4 pre-teens and wanted to give them their \"own\" room. On check in around 4pm was asked a strange Question, \"Will you be needing BOTH rooms now?\" \"Of course\" I said. Then I thought, were they thinking I wouldn't need it till midnight? It was pre-paid so check-in was quick. That's where \"quick\" ended. Come to find out La Quinta rooms DO NOT connect. was given 1 room on 1 end and 1 room on the other end. HMMMMM with pre-teen's at least wanted to be next door. If not for safety issues, for the fact to control any noise problems (pre-teens remember) that might distract other guests. Treck back down to try to get 2 rooms side-by-side. Was given a \"sigh\" from desk clerk. Guess I disrupted her smoking break. Was given 2 rooms next to each other. Only to discover someone already using in 1 of the rooms. 2nd treck back down to FD. told to go have dinner and it would be resolved by the time we returned. Returned back around 9pm and were given 2 rooms slightly closer together than the first set. Just left it and told then to behave and keep it down. There were no phone calls from the FD so I assume they listened to me. I just felt like since we weren't paying \"full-price\" we were treated as such. but honestly it wasn't worth the discounted price either.
