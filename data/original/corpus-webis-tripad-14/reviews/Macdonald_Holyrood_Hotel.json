Our room was at the side of the hotel, very quiet, beautifully maintained and extremely comfortable. We had two comfortable lounge chairs and a television.

Edinburgh Castle is right at the top of The Royal Mile and there are museums, bars and restaurants all the way from bottom to top. We were delighted to see a Taxi rank right across the road from the hotel, as well as an autoteller and a small Tesco store just 50 yards from the hotel. The hotel is approximately a 15 minute walk from Princes Street. The Consierge parked our car for us on Friday night and returned it to us when we left. There is a charge for parking so check before you go. Well worth it to avoid the stress of parking in a big city.
