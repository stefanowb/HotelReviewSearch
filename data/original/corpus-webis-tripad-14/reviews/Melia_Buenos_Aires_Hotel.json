At that point it was not made clear on their website that they will charge me for the whole amount 3 more than months in advance, which they unfortunately did charge! I phoned the hotel to say I wish to pay at check-out (=the norm) and challenge their unusual practice to charge so quickly, especially as they didn't warn about it in advance and, the next day, that charge disappeared from my account and my bank said the money had been refunded. Therefore I cancelled the entire reservation as I was unhappy with this hotel's operating manner. A few days later I had the unpleasant surprise to find that the money had, again, been taken from my account by Melia hotel and now they refused to let us stay at the hotel for those 3 nights, saying the reservation was cancelled. How convenient for them, to charge the money >3 months in advance but not provide us with any services. I repeatedly contacted boh Melia Buenos Aires hotel and the Melia hotel chain head office but received useless or indifferent replies. Luckily my wonderful bank refunded me the money for the ilegitimate transaction that Melia Buenos Aires hotel carried out against my good will.

As a female traveler I have never felt unsafe in the area even so (& even alone late at night) but I have had a prostitute steal my pizza outside! The rooms range from great to so-so. All of the views I've had are bad; my first room had a great bathroom, my latest (same room class) had a small bathroom and a cracked outside window. Room service was very poor and failed to clean the room several times. If the staff suspect that you speak English, even if your Spanish is fluent, they will speak to you in English. This is really inopportune, for example, the time that I sent a dress for dry-cleaning which had minor pilling on it (on the side where I carry my brief case); they kept the dress, though it should have been deliverd hours earlier, and left a note instead saying: \"We are sorry, your dress is threadbare.\" While it came back just as I had expected, it caused me a lot of stress in the FOUR HOURS they took to track it down. On my latest visit we were somehow not listed as having breakfast included on days 4 and 5 though 1,2 & 3 had been included...all on the same breakfast-included reservation. I got yelled at by the guy at reception as if I were a thief. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are a good size, but if you are looking for good service or any sort of personal touch go elsewhere. You can do a lot better for the price.
