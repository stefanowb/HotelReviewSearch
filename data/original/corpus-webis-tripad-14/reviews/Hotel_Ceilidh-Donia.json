The hotel, while not in the centre of the city, is conveniently located, about 10mins bus ride (or \u00a36ish taxi fare) to North Bridge/ 25 mins walk to Holyrood Park.

The owners Max and Annette are awesome. They are hands-on and very attentive. The rooms are super clean and up to date (all renovated within the last couple of years). Our bathroom was spotless. There is no elevator, so you will need to be able to navigate stairs. Note: There is a dog on the premises. I think there are only 12-18 rooms. There is wireless access, but the reception is not great. There is a free, public computer and printer. There is a restaurant on the ground floor for guests only. They are open for breakfast and dinner only. They have a VERY GOOD continental breakfast (pastries, yogurt, cold cereal, juices, fruit, etc) for free and full service (heavy breakfast) for charge if you prefer. The location is very quiet as they are in a residential neighborhood in south Edinburgh. The hotel is NOT walking distance to downtown, but it is 200 meters from the bus stop (super easy to use - 8 minute bus ride to the central district). They are within 500 meters of Prestonfield Golf Course. There is a nice little lounge where you can relax and talk to other guests. Parking and traffic is terrible in Edinburgh, and parking at the hotel is quite difficult as well (no off-street parking). Consider not renting a car and taking the Airlink bus to central Edinburgh (Waverly Station) and then cab or local bus (30, 33, 14) to the hotel. You can get everywhere in Edinburgh with public transportation and the city is small, so taxi cost is not crazy either.", "title": "Super small boutique hotel with easy access to downtown and great owners", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "chuckwagon1", "date": "May 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 108922056}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011", "text": "We booked a room with 2 twin beds.
