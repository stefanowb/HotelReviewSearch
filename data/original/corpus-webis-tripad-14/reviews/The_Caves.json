We were fortunate enough to stay @ The Caves Resort. There are 5 star hotels and then there is paradise, which is what we found @ The Caves, paradise. Very private and secluded, yet full of fun. Do go with a loved one for romance, or with friends for a chillin good time. My husband and I went for a nice romantic getaway and it succeeded our expectations by FAR! The scene and rooms were breath-taking, and I can be very hard to please. Food was gourmet great, and we found plenty to do without ever leaving. Swimming, jumping the cliffs, snorkeling, kyaking, chillin. Drinks (planters punch, my fav) were endless. WE WILL BE BACK next year FOR SURE! Be sure to book the jacuzzi @ sunset, get a massage, the best! Although, we also like to think of it as our paradise, our place. If you go, tell Brian hi for us, as he was VERY friendly and accomadating.

First off, the drive from Montego Bay takes about 1 1/2 and the scenery isn't too great just to be warned; very poor people living along side of the road....however, when you pull up to the Caves, you really only see a gate and my first thought was \"Oh my God, what did I get us into.\" (since I booked the trip)....when the gate opens, the staff comes to greet you and you basically sit inside this tiny lobby area and fill out paperwork; they ask you if you have any feed allergies, because there are no menus. Basically it's whatever they are serving that day for lunch and dinner. Lot's of seafood, so if you don't like seafood, tell them immediately. The food was indeed excellent; very fresh, very healthy....we stayed in the Moon Shadow room and my boyfriend and I were upstairs and my friends were downstairs; big setback.....we didn't realize there was NO AIR CONDITIONING in many of the suites including ours. July in Jamaica is really HOT, even at nightime...there was no breeze at night; the staff brought us some extra fans, but we were dying at night; we had an outdoor shower too which I didn't mind, but my girlfriend hated it....because of no air conditioning, we had to leave the windows open and every night after dinner, there was a cochroach waiting for us in the bathroom....besides these huge bugs, there were lots of mosquitos everywhere (bring OFF) and other types of dragonfly's etc. If you don't like bugs or need air conditioning; I would not recommend this room.", "title": "Amazing property, but there are some things you should know", "helpfulness": 38, "user": "AngelinaChicago", "date": "July 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5440129}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "There is also not much to do at the hotel activity wise; you can go on a day trip, which we didn't do, but at the hotel they could really use a small work out room or even a yoga studio; considering the whole theme is to relax your mind and your body.....", "title": "I feel really bad for people who have not stayed at the caves!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "gooddave", "date": "July 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5424178}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "overrated", "text": "The staff was very cool and very nice; whatever you needed, they were really willing to make you happy.....", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "RonsyRoo", "date": "July 3, 2006", "id": 5421361}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "The deep tissue massage was awesome!!

Although situated only a few miles away from the bustling town center, this private enclave is a world apart. Eleven handcrafted wood and stone thatched-roof cottages, plus a 4-bedroom fully self-contained luxury villa, are interwoven between ten acres of lush vegetation and naturally formed volcanic caves. Quaint stone pathways wind through the limestone cliffs dotted with palm, sea grape and dogwood trees overlooking the Caribbean Sea. An arrangement of coral stairs and walkways lead to sundecks with uninterrupted views of the sea and sky, and grottos with turquoise water pools and fossilized marine life. A tropical reef system comes right up to the edge of the cliff, perfect for snorkeling. Guests can climb down ladders into the sea or take a leap from several \u201cjump points,\u201d the highest of which is 30 feet! An intimate, private and unique resort, The Caves is perfect for romance and relaxation.The Caves generally does not accept children under 16 years old. Exceptions must be cleared with the hotel management."}
