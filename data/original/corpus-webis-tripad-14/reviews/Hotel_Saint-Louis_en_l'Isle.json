The one thing that was not really that good was that the bathroom was soooo small I had to sit sideways on the toilet in order to use it. I am a 5'10\" woman about 125lbs and there was a heater right infront of the toilet and it was impossible to sit on it properly. Now I have visited Europe about 8 times and I KNOW that European hotel rooms are not like North American ones so I am not one to constantly complain about the room size BUT the design of this bathroom was crazy - there was not one towel hook and most of our stuff had to be kept out on the desk. The bed was very good and the rest of the room was OK but they must have other complaints about the toilet in this room - if I was any taller or a larger person I probably would have had to ask for a different room because I would not have been able to use the toilet! Other than that I would recommend this lovely hotel and if I had a different room I would stay there again. The street it is on has lots of restaurants and little shops and lots of major sites and the metro are within easy walking distance. We used their shuttle service and the driver was very, very good and for what they charge the service is well worth it - I thought it was really reasonable and I am sure nobody wants to haul luggage through the metro after an 8 hour flight so this is an excellent alternative.", "title": "Location makes up for other things!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Melster", "date": "June 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131869839}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Came to Paris to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and this hotel was a perfect choice for us. The entire staff was unfailingly kind and helpful and we were made to feel extremely welcome during our entire stay. Although it turned chilly and damp during our visit, the AC continued to work so no problem there. Our room faced the street, yet the double glazing made everything very quiet. When we opened the windows in the morning, yes, you could hear the trash pickup but it was not at an early hour so I don't understand what the fuss is about. Even tho we had a deluxe room, it was small but we knew that going in, and it was delightful with an extremely comfortable bed, extra pillows and blankets, a well stocked mini-bar with reasonable prices and a wonderful tray with tea/coffee/chocolate and madeleines. How they manage to incorporate so many nice touches and such abundant storage in limited square footage, I have no idea! The bathroom had multiple under sink shelves and plenty of counter space. The fixtures were lovely and there was always lots of hot water and wonderful water pressure. An added bonus is that the mini fridge kept one closet warm so clothes dried quickly! Breakfast was abundant and filling; so much so that we often didn't eat again until dinner. My only regret is my lack of foresight in not planning a longer stay. Before we even left the hotel, we were already planning our next visit. I have traveled all over the world and stayed in some remarkable places, but this one is certainly in the top 3.", "title": "Perfect Choice!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Jeannine B", "date": "June 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131832332}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a superb small inn with just 12 rooms right in the middle of Paris. The \"I'Isle\" is just 6 blocks long by 3 blocks wide and is very residential-- one of the priciest addresses in the city. Really-- the local realtor office lists several apartments on the island over 2 million Euros! The Cathedral of Notre Dame is 4 blocks away and 2 metro stops are within 6 blocks. The staff all comfortably directed us in English on our travels. We recommend the hop-on-hop-off Batobus (boat bus) service as a fun way to get near everywhere we wanted to go-- museums, Eiffel, shopping. The hotel is not cheap, but what is cheap about staying in a perfect neighborhood in Paris? Our rate was 169 Euros a night-- seems to be their standard for summer travel. We used their in-house breakfast just once at 13 Euros each, but it was actually a pretty good deal if you want meat, cheese, fruit, variety of breads, juice and unlimited coffee. A petit dejuner at most bistros would be 8-10 Euros for one coffee, one juice and one croissant.
