The rooms are a bit of a mixed bag - - the Annex rooms feature private baths, but are in need of some decor updating. Not terrible, but just a little dated. The main inn rooms don't have private baths, and are very small. They have been updated somewhat. But we didn't spend much time in them, the lobby is the main attraction indoors, and the scenery is the main attraction outdoors. The food was good, a decent value considering the location.
