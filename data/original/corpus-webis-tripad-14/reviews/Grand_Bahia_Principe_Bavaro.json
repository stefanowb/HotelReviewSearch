We stayed there from 19dec till 26dec. We had very adventure trip, we flu with Skyservice, they have excelent service. We arrived to Punta Cana and weather was nice and worm, my son had runny nose and little bit of cough, we went to check in and yes it took around 30min to arrange everything and we had to wait in our friends room until they clean our room, but it was ok because we were tired from the flying, we were up from 3am because our flight was at 6.15am and you have to be at the airport at 4am. After we unpacked our suitcases we went to look around the resort, it was amazing, nice palm trees, ground was clean all the time, every day somebody was cutting grass or cleaning the grounds, first night our son got high fever, so my hubby went to the receptionist and ask them about the doctor, and he told us they have 24hrs medical service and that they know english and french, we run there, the doc was nice, she listned my son's chest and looked at his ear and sure enough he got ear infection on both ears and he was very mucusy so she prescribed him antibiotics and gave him injection for ear infection, we went back to our room around 5am, we slept till afternoon, and went we woke up, my son felt better, we went to see the beach, it was amazing, nice white sand beach, beautiful palm trees, beautiful tyrkys sea, it was breathtaking but we didnt stay long because it was windy so we took our son back to our room, and again in the evening he had fever, we gave him tylenol, next day we went to see the doc again, she saw my son in bad condition, he was vomiting because of mucus, and he was still touching his ears, so she sent us to the hospital, we were very concern, we didn't know in what condition they have hospitals, she called the taxi for us, and I asked her if she can call the hospital, if they know TIC insurance, she called and they said yes we know that insurance and we wont have to wait. Perfect. It took like 20min to get there, we went right to the emergency and I ask them where's pediatric section and they very nice and polite, some of the nurses didnt know englisth but then when pediatrician came she was fluent in english, she had report from our doc in the hotel so she already knew which antibiotics he had and it didnt help so she gave him some special puffer to clear his mucus and then she sent us for xray, in 30min they had result, BROMCHIDES and the pediatrician said be glad its not a PNEUMONIA we wouldn't let you go back to canada. omg, she prescribed another rapido antibiotics and sents us back to the hotel, and we were suppose to come back in two days for the follow up. WE WERE SO IMPRESSED WITH THE HEALTH CARE IN PUNTA CANA. Our son has lots of health problems so we always take insurance and would recommend it to everybody with small children. You never know. Next two days were fine but my son got diarhea from the antibiotics and he had very sore bum, even I had special cream AVENO from diaper rush but it didnt help, when my husband went back for follow up with my son, he told them about diarhea and they said its normal for kids to have diarhea from such a strong antibiotics, and if the child's immune system is low it can happen very easly, she gave him special cream for sore bum and some pills for diarhea, and she said he's much better, he's chest sounds much better so you can fly back to canada, we enjoyed last 3 days, finally we were all together and with our friends. We loved the resort, its huge, good for walking, but you have a little bus there which take you from one end to the other. food was very very nice, plenty to choos of, different variety, people who complain they probably eat just junk food. We didn't even have a problem with booking a la carte restaurants, you have to book it first day when you arrive, of course they didn't have too much choices left because of the Xmas but we were happy, we could arrange 4 a la cartes because of Xmas, we had French, Japanesse, Mexicano and Mediteriano. For us the best food was in Mediteriano, then French, Japannese. Some people say that Japanesse is best, but we had our booked at 9pm and it was too much food so we were feeling full even next morning.

Entertainment crew - they start at 10 am at the beach - stretching exercise, dancing lessons, games, aerobics on the beach until about 1 pm (they have 2 teams on in front of the beach bar on one in the middle of the beach). everybody on the team is great! Ricardo, Elvis, Randy, Emmanuel, just to name a few. If you speak any Spanish you will be great.

After 3 pm until 6 pm they start show at the main pool - again they have it in a few places - in front of the poll bar and at the other since of the main pool across from the restaurant. They also have same at the pool that is not by the beach. They do pool aerobics, games, dance lessons. and just generally have fun with people. There is a main show at the main theatre at 9:45 pm - lost of the pool crew are in the show. This show ends by 10:40 then there is another show at the plaza - they have stage outside with all the tables set in the plaza which is great. Show starts at 11 pm until 12 pm. House band is incredible!! and all the gays and girls from the entertainment crew (pool/beach and show) are dancing with people.

We booked the Gran Bahia based on reviews from friends and acquaintances. The resort greatly exceeded our expectations. The minute we arrived we were greeted by girls wearing traditional costumes, men playing the merengue and waiters bearing glasses of delicious fruit juice. What a way to start a vacation! Greetings of \"HOLA\" resonated throughout the spacious lobby putting all the travelers into an instant holiday mood which lasted the entire week. We upgraded to the Golden Club which allowed us to be checked in while we were enroute from the airport, so we were taken to our room immediately upon arrival. The rooms are gorgeous. They are neat and meticulously cleaned every day. The bathroom is spacious and very clean. We were nervous that there might be some insects in the rooms due to the country's location, but that was certainly not the case. Our mini-fridge was well stocked and became even more so after a tip to the maid of only $2. We usually left her $2 - $5 a day. We were very unsure as to the appropriate amount of money to tip, so we asked our tour guide and she assured us that we were being quite generous. Canadians are used to tipping 15% - 20%, so we thought $5 at the a la cartes was a little cheap, but she said it was quite the contrary. The wait staff at the restaurants were so very eager to please and accommodate. The people were always smiling and they tried their hardest to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Sometimes the language barrier was difficult, but since we were in their country and did not speak Spanish it would be very unfair to place the blame on them. We tried to learn a little Spanish, which was kind of fun, and after a few days we could communicate well enough with the locals. My wife is even considering taking Spanish lessons as she found the people so endearing and the language so lovely. The bar tenders on the beach and the entertainment staff by the pool/beach were quite entertaining. They would break into song, dance the merengue with whomever was close by and bring a smile to all those around them. The mood they created was quite infectious. The beach is gorgeous, lots of white sand and turquoise waters. It was easy to get chairs and talapas; we never had a problem and we did not get to the beach until around 11 a.m. It was easy to spend 5-6 hours at the beach/pool. The restaurant on the beach allowed you to take a \"break\" from all the lounging around and refuel for the next round. The nightly entertainment was fun and different every evening. Our villa was right on the oceanfront and the restaurants were close to the lobby at the far end of the resort. Most often we walked from our room to the restaurants, which took no more than 10 minutes. If we were too tired we took a shuttle bus. We had 5 a la carte dinners. We ate at the Garden Grill, the French, the Japanese, the Mediterrean, and the Italian restaurants. They were all great; my wife's favourite was the Japanese as you got to see the chef prepare your meal. We took a couple of day trips off the resort in order to see more of what the island has to offer. The Bavaro Runners was excellent. It is an outback safari trip throughout the Dominican Republic. It is an eye opener for those of us from developed countries...a definite must to help put things into perspective. We also took a marina tour which included snorkeling and swimming with stingrays (minus the stingers) and nurse sharks (herbivores). That was pretty exciting! There is not one thing my wife and I found lacking in our holiday. It was such a wonderful way to spend our 25th and will cherish those memories forever. For all of you planning a trip to Punta Cana you will greatly enjoy yourselves. For all of you planning on staying at the Gran Bahia Principe, please do not pay too much attention to anything negative you might read on other reviews.

But I guess these mosquitos did not fly around and bother you, they just feasted on your legs and you did not see any evidence of them until they were done. At any time, if there is one mosquito in the room, it is coming for me, and this trip did not let my family down. I am the fly paper for the group. And let me tell you I did suffer. The bites were evident on the trip, but aprox. 5 days later the itching started. And because I had so many I was in misery. Thankfully I was home by then. So if you typically get bitten by bugs, when you go out in the evening, just put the bug spray on. It may save you from someone snacking on you without knowing it.

The hotel has 2 sides which mirror one another with the same amenites and we were told they were both accessible reguardless which side you were in. We checked in at Bavaro and they did not have a reservation at that side and wheeled us in a tram over to the Punta Cana side. They put us in a room at the Bavaro side, but only were allowed to use Punta Cana amenties, bar,buffet,etc. Once in the room, housekeeping had to be called the first night because of hairballs on the floor, which had to be mopped and sanitized. Our sheets had to be replaced because of sour linens, our toilet overflowed, and at least twice we had no washcloths.

Also, being a huge animal lover, even harder were the stray dogs, on the beach, by the market and all over town. If you are not an animal lover you many not even notice them, but for me it was heartbreaking. There is one beautiful female dog, blind in one eye who visits the beach by the Bahia, if you see her...she really likes chicken and if very friendly, but wont let you touch her as she is somewhat timid and afraid, but will take food & water from you. If you walk down the beach to the right of the boat (in the water) about 30 minutes down is a local market, there are also quite a few dogs and puppies down that way, the locals dont really seem to acknowldge them, however i did notice that the tourists (some kind hearted one's anyways) do feed them scraps.", "title": "wonderful, dont bother with the rest", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "cathydee", "date": "November 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10733255, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 pleasant furnishings and very clean", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "It is a beautiful island... but for me the poor shacks and destitute looking stray animals in the reality outside of the resort, took most of that beauty away.

A lot of people dont realize for a few days that they are missing out on the best food. The main restuarant is fantastic but hardly anyone goes there for lunch as it's a walk - GET on the buggy, get out of the sun and enjoy!!!!

It wasnt great but it was light and ok...... not for a wine expert but definately the best i have tried at an all inclusive - I have done maybe 15 all inclusive and they have been great for kids. Personally, when my kids dont come with me anymore i will probably not bother about all inclusives as we arent big drinkers or eaters anymore so we propably dont get value for money, not like some people.

We were Gold Club Members and after a weeks stay i cant say it was worth the extra money; as far as i can tell the Gold Club Membership got you express check-in, fresh towels at night, free inter-net service in the Gold Club Lobby; (by the way, on-line service was sporadic at best), and 3 more ala cart meals then the rest of the guest...more on that issue. I have found that at resorts that have had different levels, they have had control over where the defferent levels were allowed to go. This resort...go anywhere do anything. 2)Food-It was pedastrian at best.The buffets-morning- lunch-dinner had little variation from day to day. I think what supprised me (and my companions) the most was the lack of Local Fare(Caribean Cuisine) and seafood.The a la cart restaurants are really average. We are persons that have experienced the Caribean for over 30 years. -Bio of myself and my travel companions ages 40 thru mid 60. Blue Collar workers who plan every year for an upscale vacation.

Considering if I wasn't there for my friends wedding, I would have left after day one. So lets start with check in. Do not bother arriving early to Punta Cana. Your room will not be ready, usually not before 3pm or in our case 4pm. You will enjoy the mid afternoon humidity in the main lobby. With only drinks to keep you busy for hours. Whats that you say, don't sound to bad. Ah until you get the pleasure of experiencing the worlds worst language barrier. It took me several attempts to order a Pina Colada with alcohol in it and I speak some ok spanish. Ok now for the fun stuff . We get to our room a quick change of clothes and off to the pool or beach. Nope every lounge chair pool side and beach front taken. The pool looked as if spring break was cancelled and rescheduled at this particular pool. Throw in 100 grumpy Canadians and 100 children for what was slowly becoming my worst nightmare. I then gave myself a mental coaching. Its not about me I am here for my friends wedding and hopefully for my much more easy going wife to enjoy time away. Alright two or three deep breaths later. My favorite time. Time to shower up from the beach which was beautiful, sand included and go to dinner. Here is the best part of my review the food was nothing short of well, how do I say this. Let me borrow an old saying \"gag me with a spoon\". It was really bad. With very few exceptions and I am speaking about the entire 7 days I was there. Maybe its just me so I surveyed the other 36 friends and family that also went to attend wedding. General consensus. On a scale of one through ten. About a 3. Ok some more cons before I reveal the few pros. The Resort is about the size of Texas give or take an acre. So pack your hiking shoes and patience. I needed both. There were two times I went back to my room from a sun filled day of beach and poolside drinking. Only to find out my magnetic key card no longer worked. Time for yet another chaffing mile hike to reactivate key card. Yes you can use a trolly but sometimes they are filled to max with Grumpy Canadians. How was the entertainment? Glad you asked. You have four options. First the Closet Casino. Small and they seem generally pissed if you win. At most times I felt security was waiting for a grand robbery to occur.They did some weird stuff here. You have to pay for drinks inside Casino and you can smoke but not cigars. Thank god we don't have access to really good cuban or dominican cigars! Spoiler Alert I'm being sarcastic .Second the Disco tech. Wow! The wonderful aroma of vomit and urine cut my visit to this bar down to about 15 minutes total for the entire trip. Third there is a Sports bar with Karaoke. Not too bad I enjoyed it. Only down fall, bar too small. Hard at times to get drinks. Last but not least the shows. I thought the Michael Jackson show was great. But unfortunatelly on most nights I did not have the hour lee way to reserve a seat for the other shows. Although my Friends told me they did catch one other show which was also good. Ok some other pros to my visit at Grand Bahia Principe Punta Cana. The staff where very nice and extremely hard workers. Although the language barrier was much harder then my visit to Mexico. The resort cleans From morning into late night. I even saw them sweeping the grass! Not kidding. They where painting and cleaning even in the dark. I was highly impressed with the attention to detail as far as cleanliness was concerned. Drinks where served promptly despite the million or so people that where at the resort. I also was relieved to see women removing the shackles that society tries to place on them. By forcing them to where tops at the pools and beaches in America. What a wonderful sight Boobies here, Boobies there, Boobies everywhere. To sum up the total experience The having to reserve a beach and or pool lounge chair at 7am coupled with the lack of night time activities and down right nasty food. Was too much to handle. I guess its true what they say misery likes company. If I didn't have other couples/friends there I would have had Apple Vaca switch my resorts or flown home. This was only my second all inclusive resort. It could not compare to Mexico. The food, entertainment , and general fun factor was way way below expectations when compared to Riviera Maya in Mexico. I also have done one cruise. Again this trip, not even close. Punta Cana was too disorganized and crowded.

Upon arrival at the hotel, we asked for a second or third floor room with hopes of steering clear of the mosquitos and since the hotel is so large and overwhelming, we thought we had a good deal with room 10308 on the third floor. When we finally arrived at our room at 4:30, (we had been at the hotel since 1pm) it was full of mosquitos. At this point, my boyfriend, who also works in the hospitality/hotel realm of business, called the front desk to request another room. We were told we could not switch rooms b/c there were no other units available and we would have to wait until morning. After a long day of traveling and waiting, i was annoyed and could not believe the hotel was completely full. After hours of being on hold, being transferred and actually going back to the lobby to speak with management, he was able to get us a new room. The catch was that it was an \"upgrade\" to the \"Club Golden\" rooms, which cost $20.00 more per day. Of course, we were upset to have to pay for the upgrade, as our room was unacceptable and it was not our fault that it was infested with mosquitos. In the end, it was worth it, yet the aggravation it caused that first afternoon was absolutely unnecessary. **A tip to any travelers reading this...upgrade to Club Golden before you leave...you get \"top shelf liquor\" (tanqueray, johnny walker, and smirnoff....which are better than the well stuff), a room closer to the beach/main pool, free internet access, towels in your room and 24hr room service.)", "title": "Nice trip!", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "zaika24", "date": "April 17, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3372214}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "Other than that, we had no other problems.

I think that is great because I paid extra $$$ for peace and quiet and got it. Don't be pissed off if you want to sneak in with out paying. There were a few rowdy Americans thinking the adult section was a Frat party so a few of us complainned at the front desk and they responded quickly in asking them to shut the hell up.

The only draw back is that the Ambar section is a little far removed from the evening entrtainment but a 10 minute walk or shuttle will get you there no problem.

That was great and we didn't have any problems. We flew from Birmingham, Alabama - Charlotte, NC then on to Punta Cana. We arranged for the roundtrip transfer and that worked out great as well. Check in went smoothly and we were in building 9000 and didn't upgrade to gold. We had no problems and had 3 ala carte dinners, which was more than enough. The room was nice and clean and had flowers. We brought an extra plastic little card to keep in the air conditioning going when we weren't there so we wouldn't have to leave the door key in there. I also suggest the safe in the room (about $26), it's worth it. Our fridge was stocked with water, beer (Bahamian), and sodas (Pepsi, 7Up, and Orange Fanta). We were on the 3rd floor and there are no elevators, but that wasn't a problems since the bellhop carried the bags up and we could use the exercise. Be sure to bring $1's for tips, it's not needed but appreciated. I also bought small gifts for housekeeping (makeup, hair accessories, etc) and left them with a tip. The grounds are gorgeous - flowers are wonderful and not a bit of trash anywhere. Even though there is a trolley that will take you back and forth to the lobby/buffet and pool, the walk isn't bad at all and we never rode the trolley. It was nice to take a stroll and good exercise. The pool area was nice, but we never used it. We stayed on the beach the entire time. We never had trouble getting chairs and it never seemed to crowded. There were good waves and it was very relaxing. The drinks were good (the Mama Juana, Bahia Prinicpe, and Pina Colada) and the food was good. The service was OUTSTANDING. Luisa in the lobby bar area was great. We ate breakfast a couple of morning at the main lobby buffet, and they had a great selection. The other days we ate at the buffet at the Pescador restaurant, which was convenient to going to the beach. Lunch we had at the Las Olas snack bar and the Piscis, and both had a good selection. For dinner, we ate at the lobby buffet 3 nights and the selection was very good. We could always find something we liked. We chosed the Garden Grill (steak), The Italian restaurant, and the Japanese for our ala carte meals. It was probably a tie between the Italian and Steak for the best food. Both were very, very good. The Japanese was good - it was they type like Benihana where they cook in front of you. All were good experiences. We spent a lot of time in the evening relaxing in the lobby having a couple of drinks and listening to music. The setting was perfect. We also took in 2 shows at the theater. They were very entertaining. It wasn't Vegas, but we weren't in Vegas. They tried very hard to entertain. We also took an excursion with Safari tours - it was an all day tour and it was great because it was only 5 couples, so we definitely got individual attention. We got to see the real Punta Cana and countryside. We stopped at an elementary school and they sang us a song (good idea to bring something for the kids - candy/school supplies like pencils, paper, etc. You can get at the dollar store). We stopped at some tourist stores, then on to a ranch. They had hammocks and our guide Julio explained some of the different fruits/plants. Then we went horseback riding. That was a little scary b/c I've never done it before, but it was fun. We then went further into the mountains and to a family's house. We saw how coffee was made and a cock fight. Then had a great lunch. We then went to Macaw (sp?) beach, which was very pretty. We purchased the video from the trip, which was great. It was sad to leave, but I would definitely come back. We had no trouble getting back to the airport, definitely allow enough time since they are very diligent about security and double and triple check your bags. It's also very hot in the airport since it's open air.

The head woman was on leave, and MARTIN, her replacement, would not help us. The woman returned on the fourth morning and immediately gave us a room near the beach. Mind you, by this time I had called my travel agent back in Halifax and she had worked hard to help. At least we got a third-floor room near the beach and not a second-floor room overlooking a construction site. Double beds and that weird couch, though. Before we left we collected e-mail addresses and phone numbers from everyone in any position to help with our next trip. Two discoveries: as a repeater we can book our trip and then e-mail the hotel directly to choose our room, which includes an add-on room in the price; there are extra rooms not numbered outside the villa which are kept for dissatisfied people.

This hotel is vast, some might say too big and is still expanding. The apartments are set out in attractive gardens giving the impression of a town rather then a hotel. Our apartment was about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the reception/bar areas. Cars pulling tailers ferry people to and from the reception area from other parts of the complex. Beware, if it rains during the evening you will get very wet when going to eat or drink. We found the food to be below the standard you would expect and the choice very limited. It was often served up cold. The snack bars around the beach area had a very limited menu and did not change thoughout our two week stay. The main buffets were situated on the other side of the complex in the reception, if you were on the beach this involved a lot of hassle so people mainly eat in the snack bars during the day. The room was ok but not as clean as we would expect, often when we returned in the late afternoon we found the towels had not been replaced we would then phone and wait anything up to an hour for clean ones. During the evenings entertainment consided of a singer/pianist in the lobby bars, again the same music every night. Each night they had a show in the theatre which ran for an hour. These were put on by the entertaiment team and consisted mainly of dance routines. The big downside for us was the seating. Most of the chairs were set out like a cinema, very few tables, the drinks were served in small plastic throw away cups. Not conducive to a social evening out. The beach is great,, flat white sand and very long. The European habit of saving sun beds with towels has caught on and if you arrive on the beach later then 8am you may have problems finding one.
