We had requested a river view room when booking several weeks before hand but were given a room at the side of the hotel with a partial view of the river. We were offered another room on the same floor with great views of the river but it absolutely stank of cigarette smoke. We were shown several others on different floors but all the river view ones seemed to be for smokers and smelt accordingly (I think they were the room numbers ending 07 and 08 on each floor). In the end we decided to stay in the allocated room which was a nice size with good en-suite. It was decorated in a pleasant minimalist style.
