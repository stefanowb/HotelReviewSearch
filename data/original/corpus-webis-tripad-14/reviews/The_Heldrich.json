Booked room off of hotels.com as their price was less than all other websites, plus a free split of champagne was included. Requested a King room. Arrived in New Brunswick and wasn\u2019t going to pay $32 for valet parking. A public parking garage is less than half a block away and it was $5 for the night. Problems started at check in. Front desk staff was nice enough, but I requested a King bed when I put in the reservation and was told that they are 100% booked and only had 2 doubles. This isn\u2019t very romantic but he said there is nothing he could do. You would figure that they would block off king rooms for a champagne \"special\". I stated that hotels.com shouldn\u2019t have said that there was king bed availability when there wasn\u2019t. He kept stating nothing he could do. Had to ask about when the champagne was going to be delivered, he said \"oh, Ill send it up in 5 or 10 minutes\". I would guarantee if I didn\u2019t say something it would have been forgotten. Room was very modern and clean. Well appointed with very comfortable beds and crisp linens, a small desk and sofa chair. Large armoire with ample hangers and drawers with a TV in the middle. Room overlooked the state theater entrance. Couldn\u2019t really hear traffic or street noise at all. Bathroom was decent with nice amenities and high shower head. The hotel is basically brand new (opened March 2007) and you could tell. They have a neat documentary on the building of the hotel on the hotel TV channel. Back to the champagne... 5 or 10 minutes turned into 30 minutes so I called down to the front desk and asked him where it was. They apologized and said it would be right up. About 5 minutes later it was, and it was tasty (Taittinger Brut, actually a decent Champagne).
