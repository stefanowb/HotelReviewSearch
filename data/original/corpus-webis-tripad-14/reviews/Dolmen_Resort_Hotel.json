Our unit faced the water so it was a very nice few. It was quite noisy since the Amazonia club is right across the street from us as well as the bus depot was nearby. The hotel is quite dated, some water stains, and our unit had some malfunctioning equipment i.e. toaster & cooktop but since this is a timeshare unit - somethings you just can't really expect. It was nice that the cleaning staff came daily to take out your garbage, mop the floors, do the bed and change your towels. The location of the hotel is also safe and convenient walking to St. Paul's Bay. The bus depot is two blocks away and is convenient to catch buses to go sightseeing. We took buses to visit Mdina, Valleta, Temples Mnajdra and Hagar Qim. We also took the very to visit Gozo -- the bus station had an information office to help clarify which bus to take since most guidebooks do not provide the latest information given that the buses are very new.

We arrived and the reception staff (particularly the two women who wore their hair in buns) were rude and miserable, I thought I had entered a funeral parlour not a hotel. I was given room 289 and my parents were given 296.. we walked through what looked like refurbished rooms as had nice doors and a carpet and then we kept on walking and saw mould on the walls and no carpet and what looked like a cheap B&B.. we got to my parents room first and were gobsmacked at how small the room was, it stank and had a sewage problem, the room was the smallest I had ever seen and I go on holiday at least two times a year. ME and my husband went to our room and we had NO BALCONY only a tiny window (which did not open) I was gagging at how bad the room smelt, seriously smelt like sewage aswell. The room was awful, I went on an 18-30's holiday at a 2 star ibiza hotel and that room was better than this. Needless to say me and my mother went to complain at reception, the reception staff said they are fully booked and we would have to stay in the rooms tonight, they admitted their was a sewage problem in that block but as fully booked nothing we can do. THEY WERE SO RUDE! My mother began to cry and the lady at reception started shouting at me \"You tell me what I can do\" I started shouting back and other guests were arriving. In the end the guest relations manager came out, half an hour of arguing that they could not locate us any other rooms and the manager said she would put us in the apartment near by and allocate us both different rooms in the morning. We had to live in our suitcases all day and were told by a male receptionist to come back at 10am the next morning. 10am we went to reception and the female said actually we need to come back at 2pm. I told her that we were told by her colleague to come back at 10am not 2pm! She said that was incorrect, no apology, nothing. So rude!! We finally at 2pm (after living out of suitcases further) were both located apparently the best rooms in the hotel. I would rate our new rooms, 511 and 507 as average and possibly at a push 3* rooms. Hair drier was broke, toilet didnt flush, but we got the toilet working from the maintence team. On a positive the swimming pools were lovely and the animation team were absoultely fantastic... they were way too good to be working in a hotel like the Dolmen! Fantastic animation team. They only did an evening show twice a week the rest of the week there was no entertainment which was a bit boring but the best thing about the hotel were the animation team and the pools. The beach pools were nice... Now the food. Awful.Boring....terrible!! Every evening was similar, harldy any salad and I love salad abroad.. their was meat in every single dish and if you are a vegetarian all you can eat is pasta... No english food to fall back on, no pizza, chips, no ice cream, no food for kids, no ice cream they put on a rum cake one night, dosed in alchol and were allowing kids to have it, I spoke to one lady who was hysterical as her daughter was 6 and on antibiotics and had the cake and was very poorly.. never found out what happened about it though.The restaurant staff would rather stand around talking than clean our plates, we ended up taking our plates to them every night. I thought for a 4* restaurant they could at least pour our drinks but they plonked them on the table. ALSO... they served gorgeous soup but only had 20 soup spoons for the whole hotel... we asked for soup spoons and were told they only had around 20 and we were given a large serving spoon. In the end we all ate our soup with a tea spoon every night. The Spa was fantastic I had massages every other day. Definately recommend that!! If you are put in the rooms which are as awful as ours were I seriously suggest you complain but I would not recommend this hotel based on the hassle we had with the rooms and the poor food.
