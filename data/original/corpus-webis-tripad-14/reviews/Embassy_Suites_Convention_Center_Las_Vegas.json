Because of our positive experiences with other Embassy Suites, we decided to stay here this time, and have decided this will be our first choice for future stays. We do not gamble, are both allergic to cigarette smoke, and don't care for the crowds/lights/hustlers/pace of the Strip. Las Vegas will never be a vacation destination for us. That said, for a business stay, the Embassy Suites Convention Center was perfect for our preferences. It is close to both Convention Centers (walking distance or short cab ride). It is quiet and smoke-free. The rooms are large, clean, and very comfortable, with plenty of counter space in the bathroom, a separate mini-bar with refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker, small sink, comfortable overstuffed chair and couch in the seating area, and a table large enough to spread out a laptop and files. We liked the quality pillows and very fluffy towels. The business center has two computers and a printer, plus a separate table with common office supplies. Complimentary breakfast, as others have noted, is generous. Service was consistently capable and friendly.
