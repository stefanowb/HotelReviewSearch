The location speaks for itself - British Museum, tube stops, rail stations, Oxford st - all in the proximity of the hotel and add to its draw. Our room was on the 2nd floor facing the side street - was very very quiet. A bit on the smaller side, but still good enough. The room was clean, bed comfortable and bath luxurious. We had the buffet breakfast, which was also excellent. The staff were courteous and very helpful to us (we were travelling with a baby). My only point of feedback is on the shower - the walls dont extend as much and if you are a big person (6 ft +), you may have water outside the stall - which can be mopped up. All in all, this was a great find. Thanks to previous TA reviewers. I give it a 5 star rating and would return in a heartbeat to this hotel or other Radisson Edwardian hotels.", "title": "All the reviews are true - this is a fantastic place to stay!!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "im666_1999", "date": "March 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126038302}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I got a great deal on this hotel via laterooms.com but would have happily paid more.
