Booked our room using Expedia & thought for the price we paid, we'd have a much better room than we did. Having read others' descriptions of their experience here and having seen the room next to ours, I have to conclude the rooms can be very different which would affect your experience. I booked a studio suite and didn't realize or perhaps didn't read the description carefully enough that they contain Murphy beds! So I was very surprised when I was told this at reception & that we would have to pull it out ourselves. This wasn't too difficult but it required 2 of us to do it. I don't know how 1 person would manage it unless you have very long arms to reach the breadth of a Queen bed. The picture on their website of a suite certainly wasn't of our room because when we pulled the bed out, there was barely any space between the end of the bed & the couch. Our room# was 2053. I just prayed I didn't have to get up during the night because I would have fallen over the couch, stubbed my toes on the Murphy frame and had a serious accident getting to the bathroom. We also had to move the bar chairs into the hallway at night so we would have more space around the bed. And our room overlooked the parking lot, not the river which was a drag. The space behind the bed had never been vacuumed (or at least not in years) because there was a lot of dirt there. The furniture & cupboards were tired and worn. The TV was small & looked like it was from the 1980's. Except for some very noisy guests in the parking lot & in the hallway at night, it was quiet so that was a plus.", "title": "Really depends on your room", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Luvtotravel7", "date": "January 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 151061877}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "The reception area was dark & smelled very strongly of something floral which made me sneeze each time I passed through it.
