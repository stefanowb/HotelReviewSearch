When you enter from the parking garage in the back, the stairwells are absolutely disgusting. Once you get into the regular hallways, though, they are not SO bad. Our room had one king bed and a bathroom. We were on the 6th floor so we had a good view of Wheeling (which is NOT much to look at, if you have been there). Our room was clean and seemed to be well maintained. The bed was nice but not overly comfortable. However, the second morning we were there, when housekeeping knocked on the door, I went out into the hall and told them directly that we did not want the room cleaned. I gave her our dirty towels and she gave us clean ones. We hung our 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door and left for the day. When we got back, our room had been cleaned, and things had even been moved. We had personal items and valuables in the room, and there was no safe, so I was extremely upset. I called the front desk, and was told by this person that they would contact housekeeping and return my call. Two hours later, I gave up waiting and we went out again. When we checked out the next morning, we brought the situation to the attention of someone at the front desk. This person wrote down our names and phone numbers and promised to have the hotel manager contact us. Not surprisingly, we never heard from them.
