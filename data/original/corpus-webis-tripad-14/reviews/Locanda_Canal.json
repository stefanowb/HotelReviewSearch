Venice is a maze of tiny alleyways and with luggage in tow it was a little frustrating. However once we found it it was a gem. It is decorated in an older Venetian style but that just added to the charm. We had read previous reviews about the bathroom/shower and they were not wrong, \"phonebooth\" is an apt description of the shower stall but the jacuzzi shower unit within made up for the lack of size! Breakfast was nice, there is a friendly, attentive lady who serves you and will heat up croissants and bring more coffee if you need. \"Jr Suite\" is definitely a bit misleading when our room turned out to be one room with a double bed, a single bed against the wall and a cot folded out in the middle of the available floor space. That said, all the beds were comfortable, the A/C worked fine and the location was right in the centre of town.
