For the price I paid ($60 a night on Expedia) I got a studio suite with kitchen, full breakfast, and free happy hour drinks! You can't beat that.

I normally don't mind a \"dated\" look, but this was a little too dated for me. The hotel and the furnishings are late-70s/early-80s style, and are really showing their age. The coffee table especially was scratched, scuffed and scarred through many years of use. The couch in the living room (just a couch, note, NOT a sofabed) had some stains. The carpet around the bedroom window was wet (though, given the storms passing through Wichita, this could have been a recent occurrence). The wiring in the lighting above the beds was odd... my mom's light turned off mine, but mine didn't turn off hers (and wouldn't stay on if hers was off). Worst of all, there was a pervasive sweaty/moldy smell in the room which was impossible to ignore.", "title": "I will never choose this hotel again.", "user": "kwar9802", "date": "March 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 14684012, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The rude staff."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Get Away weekend", "text": "On the positive side, the suite was very large--with a separate bedroom and living room--and the bathroom (though very plain with white tile and sink) was fresh and clean.
