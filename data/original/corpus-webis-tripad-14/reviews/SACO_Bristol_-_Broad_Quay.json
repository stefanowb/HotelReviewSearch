Central and yet quiet. Wonderful facilities - everything had been though of. Decor is modern, functional and yet warm and inviting. We wanted for nothing. We loved it so much, we are planning on staying in Saco apartments in Manchester and San Francisco and have already recommended it to friends who asked about a place to stay in Prague. Value for money, parking available and friendly, obliging, amazing staff. Couldn't recommend it more highly. PS - we just had a brilliant meal at a place just around the corner called \"Graze\" and it was delightful and I also highly recommend it. Great service, great food.
