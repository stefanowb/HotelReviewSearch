We had booked the hotel's 'meet & assist service 'and the staff member was outstanding in trying to resolve the baggage issue. When it was clear that BA did not have a clue ( and cared less) about the luggage, unknown to us, he contacted the hotel and upon arrival in our room we found a change of clothes and additional toiletries to enable us to settle in - whats more at no charge! Finally,3 days later when BA refused to hand over the luggage to anyone except me, the hotel provided a limo to and from the airport with full staff support to negotiate it thru'customs etc. I cannot recommend this service enough - you are met 'airside', all documentation is taking care of and you just walk thru' the queues to the car!", "title": "Fabulous Four Seasons", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Westsussextraveller1", "date": "February 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 13263939, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Quality", "disliked": "\u2014 N/A"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fabulous Hotel a real 5 star experience", "text": "We stayed for 10 days and the food and service were of the highest standard ( save the last night when the team lacked leadership- consequently, waiting times and service quality dropped off.
