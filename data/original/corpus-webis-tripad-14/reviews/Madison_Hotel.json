Valet parking outside was total confusion. Had to carry our luggage in. Room was not ready. We set in lobby untill 6:30 at which point I went up and asked about our room and was told \"oh yea it's ready\" I was given a key to room, we had to carry our own luggage up. When I opened the door there was already someone elses luggage in room. Had to go back down and was given a different room with no explanation. On day two we returned to our room around 5 to take a break before our dinner reservations to discover our room had still not been cleaned. They came around 5:30 and I was told that the Hotel management had not scheduled properly for the number of guest. The next day we came in late and the room had been done properly but the Toilet tissue had not been refilled so we had to call at 10pm for a refill and we were asked on the phone \"did you look for a spare roll?\". Working for a company with offices in Memphis they normally put people in the Peabody, I thought we would give what was supposed to be the \"other 4 star hotel\" a chance. I must say our first impression will probably be our last.", "title": "Nice but no 4 Star", "user": "Leroy C", "date": "February 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 125002656}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "usually stay at the Peabody but they were booked, refered to a sister property, The Madison.

I am not going to restate what everyone else has stated, except to strongly repeat how incredible their customer service was for my husband and me. The most specific example was when we returned to the hotel early evening on New Year's Eve with a few shopping bags from Kroger. We intended to have a romantic picnic-style dinner in our room with wine, cheese, crackers and fruit. One of the doormen inquired about the grocery bags. After we informed him of our intention to have a romantic dinner in our room, he proceeded to (without being asked) bring us an ice bucket for our wine, extra ice, wine glasses, etc. I was so impressed that he took the initiative to do all of this for us, without being asked!

Staff were friendly and everyone makes it a point to greet you when they pass you in the hall or on the elevator. A few minor flaws. When we arrived, we told the bellhop that all of the luggage from the car would be coming into the hotel. He told us to go ahead and he would bring it to the room. But he only brought a few things and still left some pieces of luggage in the car. So we had to go back out and get it ourselves. Also, we were told at check-in that the continental breakfast would be served on the mezzanine...but arrived to find it empty the next morning. After asking at the front desk, we were informed to go to the restaurant. The only issue with this is, it was sit-down service only. We particularly chose a hotel with continental breakfast buffet so we could grab a few things and go back to the room or head out around town. Also, only 3 small draws in the room. Had to leave most things in the suitcase. Small room, but very nice, spaceous bathroom. And the bed was very comfortable! Overall, a good experience.
