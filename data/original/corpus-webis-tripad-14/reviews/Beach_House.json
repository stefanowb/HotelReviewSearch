Sadly the bar was utterly dead which had the bonus of there being no late night noise. Pool area is very attractive although it's a pity the pool wasn't heated. The sea was actually warmer than the pool. I will also add that the beach in front of the hotel is surprisingly lovely with golden sand, palm trees and crystal clear turquoise sea.", "title": "Teething Problems.....
