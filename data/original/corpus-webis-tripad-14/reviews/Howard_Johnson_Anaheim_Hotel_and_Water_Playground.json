I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed. This hotel was ok, however the \"balcony with a disney view\" was VERY disappointing in that it was a view of a tree and a rooftop, I could not see the fireworks from my blacony as promised. I went down to the pool and was able to \"kind of\" see them between the trees and buildings, while sitting on a wet pool chaise and listening to kids scream in the pool. Oh well, live and learn. I would not book this hotel again on the basis of it's being near Disney as you really can't tell. As for the jacuzzi, I don't know if it was nice as whenever I had a chance to go in it, it was full. I did stick my feet in it for a few minutes one morning and it probably would have been heavenly had I had the chance! The \"gardens\" were little more than well landscaped walkways. As for the room, it was nice, the internet was free and the fridge worked well. I would have preferred having a microwave, but they are not available in the \"disney view\" rooms. I have to say I REALLY enjoyed the little cafe Mimi's on the corner and would definitely recommend making the time to eat ther. (reservations recommended), as they get busy, even on a monday at 10, I needed a reservation. Also if you want to eat outside on the patio, you need to request that too. I want to also add a \"plug\" for Eric the waiter at Mimi's- he was GREAT! Make sure you have a mimosa or hibiscus with your meal!! As far as the walk to Disney, it was easy, the walk to the convention center is a little longer, but not too bad, just wear comfortable shoes! Lots of nearby shops too.

They gave us a menu for a Chinese restaurant nearby and told us we could also go to Denny's & IHOP was 24/7. We ended up ordering from the Chinese place and I have to say it was surprisingly great. One never knows with Chinese but this shocked us it was so delish. We ordered ribs, hot & sour soup and a spicey beef dish. All were exceptional. If I lived here I would order from this place on a regular basis, it was that good.", "title": "Dependable", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "jj428", "date": "January 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6571200, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, comfort", "disliked": "\u2014 n/a"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled on business", "text": "Back to the hotel.

In fact, it exceeded our expectations and more. The front office staff were both friendly and helpful, the rooms were large and spacious and what I appreciated the most was the cleanliness of the rooms. The only complaint I could think of was the fact that Building 4 has no elevators; and as we were on the second floor, we had to drag our suitcases up and down which was mildly annoying (please note: hotel staff did offer to assist us with our luggage). Aside from that, my husband and I and our two children all found the pool facilities to be top-notch; my son especially enjoyed the pool and the hot tub. Although there were no restaurants within the hotel, we discovered a fabulous restaurant directly across the street from the hotel. Disneyland is a mere 10 minute walk which proved to be enjoyable each and every morning we were there. We will definitely book the Howard Johnson in Anaheim when we return. We are already highly recommending it to all of our friends who are planning a trip to Disneyland. Thank you to the hotel for making our first to Disneyland a memorable one.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 30, 2005", "id": 4072336}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "We stayed at the Howard Johnson from Oct. 15-18. We had a party of 7 and had booked 2 rooms each with the premium disney view. I had called and verified the booking 2 days prior to my stay because I had discovered that the hotel was sold out the 1st nt. of our stay and we were paying a considerably lower rate than current rates due to the advance booking we made. I was concerned that since the hotel was sold out and room rates had risen considerably since my booking that my rooms would be given to a higher paying guest. After spending 4 years in the hotel industry I was familiar with the fact the sometimes a guest will be bumped to a different room in order to accomodate a higher paying guest. I was advised during my conversation with the front desk that would not be the case and I did not have to worry. The front desk confirmed that we had booked the premium disney views and was told that at the very least we would see the disney fireworks from our balcony. We planned to spend our first evening of our vacation at the hotel watching the fireworks from our room. Upon arrival we went up to our rooms only to discover that we were looking directly at a brick wall. Not even a pool view. No view at all. Convinced this could be fixed I went to the front desk and explained I booked a premium disney view for both of my rooms and some mistake had been made. I was told I did not book premium disney view rooms and in fact I had booked standard rooms. A premium disney view room is called a \"NQQ1\" and a standard room is a \"NQQ3\". I explained again and they told me \"no you didn't book a premium disney view room.\" I had to run back to my room to get proof of my booking (thank goodness I brought my written confirmation with me) and indeed was able to show them that I had booked a premium disney view (NQQ1) for both rooms. I brought that written confirmation because I was afraid this exact situation would happen due to our room rate being so much lower than their current rates. The gentlemen at the desk looked confused and disappeared into the back to speak w/management. After a while he came out and apologized and said they had made an error however there wasn't anything he could do for the evening as the hotel was sold out. He said the most he could do was offer me the standard room rate as I was still being charged the disney view rate at that time and move me to my correct rooms the next day as the hotel would no longer be sold out. Seeing as how there was nothing else I could do I accepted his offer and we stayed the 1st nt. disappointed by our view of the brick wall. I would much rather have been given the room I orignally booked and pay my original room rate rather than settle for a standard room at the standard rate. We ended up watching fireworks from the pool deck, but not all of our party could do that as we were traveling w/toddlers who were very tired and could not stay up long enough to watch the fireworks therefore some of us stayed in the room while others headed out determined not to let this mix up ruin our evening. The reason I was so frustrated was because I passed up a suite at another hotel at a discount from friends in the hotel industry to have this premium disney view room. I found the hotel clean and the staff friendly. If we had not had a mix up with the rooms our stay would have been perfect. We did get the correct rooms the next day at a discount which was quite generous of the hotel. The distance from the park to the hotel was short and convenient. The premium disney view rooms are spacious and convenient with an extra sink outside the bathroom.
