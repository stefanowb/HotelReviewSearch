The location is good for getting to the movie studios. The room is gorgeous, clean. I've never had a problem with the service. My only complaint is their fitness centre, which is really just a tiny (like the size of a living room). I like to work out when I am travelling so this is important to me. Maybe the machines have been updated by now, but on all my previous visits they only had a handful of ancient cardio machines. The space is really small, so it's extremely hot and difficult to breath.
