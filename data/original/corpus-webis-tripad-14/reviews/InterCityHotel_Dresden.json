We stayed here in December 2010. This hotel is located directly across from the main train station and within walking distance of all the major sites. Unfortunately we were snowed under at the time but there was no better place to spend this time than at the Intercity. The room was very comfortable and spacious. We were at the front of the hotel but heard nothing. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful as were the bar and restaurant staff. Our only criticism was that the restaurant could have had more staff working as the poor waitress working on our first night was run off her feet. Food was a little bit more expensive than what we had bargained for but was tasty. A nice touch in this hotel is that they give you a day pass for the public transport system.

They work on what they offer, and do what they do well. It is simple, close to the train station (right across the street), and offered all the energy I needed for the day at breakfast. The bathroom was tiny, the bed comfortable, and a couple of the staff and I had difficulty with German/English conversations. Basic questions in English posed a challenge which surprised me, but I realize I am spoiled with how well-versed the world is with English (and how I am not with other languages). The one thing that really annoyed me was that the hotel said that it was sound-proof: well, I could hear the trains softly come in/out; however, the skate-boarders that make the outside cement area their skate-park at dusk to late at night can easily be heard so the windows are certainly not sound-proof.
