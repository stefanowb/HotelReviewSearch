My family (wife, two tweens, and mother) stayed at El Tovar for two nights in December 2008 (booked nearly a year ahead of time) near the beginning of a big winter road trip vacation swinging from the Southwest through the mid-West. I had done a lot of research before selecting our accommodations in Grand Canyon, and I was glad to see that the effort had paid off, as the visit to El Tovar was quite nice. We had the Manager's Suite (the existence of which was not apparent from the Xanterra website and which became known only with a call to Xanterra's reservations line) for what I thought was a pretty decent rate ($306/night, and right at the holiday, too), with two double beds in the bedroom and a double (or queen?) sleeper sofa and twin sleeper lounge chair in the other room. Unsurprisingly, all of the furniture, decorations, etc. were fairly dated, but everything was acceptably comfortable and clean and warm (though my wife thought the auxiliary heater in the bathroom wasn't working well enough, despite a visit from Maintenance asserting it was working as well as it always does), and the front desk and bell and restaurant staffs were pleasant enough, though the front desk staff were less knowledgeable than I would have expected about driving conditions on nearby roads during the snowy time we visited. Wi-Fi in the room would have been nice, but at least it was available (free) in the hotel's common areas. Except for one (decent) breakfast in the cafeteria of a nearby lodge, we had all of our meals in the hotel restaurant and found it no more or less pricey than I would have expected, with the quality of the food and service average to perhaps a bit better than average for what I expect from a hotel restaurant. Live piano music during afternoons and evenings in the mezzanine lounge was a nice touch. The only thing that could have been better was the view from the room; rather odd that, for a canyon rim hotel (and especially for a \"Manager's Suite\"), it wasn't built so that all of the rooms would have a canyon view. Still, once we got out onto Desert View Drive to the east and the hiking trails to the west of the hotel (hey, snow wasn't going to stop our once-in-a- lifetime touring of the sights!), the views of the canyon were simply spectacular (even more so once the sun broke out in the afternoon). It's one of those sights for which words and pictures (not even IMAX) will suffice. I can recommend El Tovar as long as you're not expecting better than 3- or 4-star accommodations; there simply is no 5-star property within at least a couple hundred miles, and the El Tovar is by far the best property in the area, from what I could see in our drives around the area.
