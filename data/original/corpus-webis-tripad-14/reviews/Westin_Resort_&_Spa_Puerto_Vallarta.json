It wasn\u2019t as bad as we thought it was going to be. Upon arrival to the airport they will let just about anyone into the country. Not hard at all to get past customs. We had carryon so we did breeze by and then right to a taxi cab driver that was very eager to get us in his car so that we could be hit with the 150.00 peso airport charge. You have to pay it so there is no way around this. We got to the hotel and then had to pay another 40.00 pesos to the cab driver. Everyone was very eager to help us upon entering, but then again we were the only ones that had arrived at that time. Are room was ready the only fault I could say about our room was the location because of the staff making noise. We were in room 1205 which is right next door to the Royal Beach Club on twelfth floor. So every morning we were awoken by loud laughter or just the rolling carts going by our room and the door slamming while the staff prepared the morning breakfast. At times this was very disturbing and we found the only time we did not awake was when we had too much tequila the night before. The benefit about being this close was that we felt like we were going to our kitchen for meals since it was right next door and closes to the elevator.

I also thought it was very interesting that you have to get your towel in the designated locations depending on whether you are at the hotel or resort. If we all share the same pool, then why not just have two locations to get towels and not frustrate your customers.
