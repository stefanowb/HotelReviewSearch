We arrived after a long day of travel and were pulled off to the side and told they had no rooms. So we put up a good fight and they kept denying us a room and I was done wasting more of my vacation time. They told me they'd put us up at The Sandos Caracol Beach & Spa for 1 night and also comped us a lobster & champagne and a Xel-ha/Tulum guided day trip. So they had me sign a form stating all of that and off we went to Sandos. Needless to say, we were not happy, but once we got to the sandos it was alright. We cleaned up and went swimming, got drinks and food. The hotel was nice, a little too big for our liking but nice enough. The next morning we chose to get a taxi and get back to the gran porto at 7AM. When we first arrived, they told us we were supposed to be their for two nights and we flipped. I then just kept going up to the front desk and hounding them about a room. In the meantime we ate and got chairs out by the ocean. One thing that helped I think is I walked through the halls of the hotel and saw which rooms were being turned over, not just cleaned. Then went and told the front desk the room numbers and said we would take any of those rooms. Anyway, by 11am we had a room and our vacation started, the rooms are great, very spacious and clean. We stayed in room 246 which was toward the far end of the hotel, facing the royal. The view of the ocean was great for a \" jr. oceanview suite\". The staff are very friendly and always help in any way they can. The beach is ok, it does have sandbags and a lot of coral/rock once in the ocean, I have been to better but is ok if you get out pretty far. The beach at the royal is much better and we went over there a few times to enjoy. The spa is great, we got massages and my girlfriend got her nails done. They gym is sufficient, could use another treadmill or so but are usually free on the odd hours. The food was good, breakfast was excellent and the reservation restaurants are nice. Our favorite thing is too just hang on the beach and get sun, so we did not do too much. I can't say I would go back unless the overbooking thing was fixed, even though it doesn't happen to everyone, its just not worth the stress and aggrivation. So all in all, its a very nice place and its proximity to 5th ave is awesome. Go there, its real fun!!", "title": "Nice hotel but overbooking is just not right", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "MA623", "date": "May 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7589046}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Gran Porto April 28th thru May 5th.
