We stayed there August 19-21 as part of a friend's wedding party. The location is great (Nice and secluded, quiet, but within 1 mile of restaurants, gas stations, coffee shops, and fast food establishments). The rooms are clean and well maintained. The staff members are courteous, and quick to respond to requests. Our room had a coffee maker (which is great for those travelers who like to make their own coffee in their rooms). The lobby has a complimentary coffee service from 6-10 AM as well (although the coffee served was weak and dilute). The only suggestion I have for this upscale hotel is that wireless internet access should be standard, not at-cost. Many other hotels lower in standards have complimentary wireless internet access. But other than that, this is a wonderful hotel and we recommend it for travellers on business, leisure, or part of a wedding party.", "title": "Nothing went right", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "ukscots", "date": "June 1, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3516904}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A lovely setting", "text": "Comfort: The previous reviews stating \"noisy air conditioner\" are all too", "helpfulness": 29, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 29, 2005", "id": 3507840}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2005", "text": "Stayed here just before flying out after a spring break vacation (March 2005). I loved the room... bright, clean, spacious. Hated the air conditioner. We finally turned it off so we could sleep. However, with the air conditioner, the room became hot. The pool was nice and the hot tub was actually hot as opposed to the lukewarm of many hot tubs. The staff was friendly. We enjoyed our dinner at the nearby Blue Gecko (driving distance). Left too early in the morning to experience the breakfast so I can't comment on that. They run a free airport shuttle every half hour which is useful.
