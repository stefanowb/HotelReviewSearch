There are no words to describe the pool. My kids would have been happy to have spent all 6 days poolside by the waterslide. The food was spendy but it is Hawaii. Meals were slightly cheaper down the path at the Whaler's village restaurants. At times, it was more convenient to just 'bite the bullet' and pay the $25 breakfast buffet at the westin. Kids under 5 do get their meal free per paying adult and kids under 12 pay half the adult price, so this does take the 'edge' off :) !!

A morning favorite was Starbucks coffee and a Maui Muffin from the Collonade Cafe (spellng). We ate several times at the Ono Grill and Bar, which had a great kids menu for my 3 year old son. He also loved feeding the Koi fish and chatting with the parrots in the Cafe sitting area. Pools were great and the beach access was even better.
