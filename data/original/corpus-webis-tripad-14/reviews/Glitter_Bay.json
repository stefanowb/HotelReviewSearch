It is beachfront and is separated from the ocean by a picturesque tree-lined retaining wall and a few rows of coral rocks. A walk down a 30 foot path puts you right on the beach where there are palm trees, umbrellas, beach chairs, and food and beverage service. To the front of the Beach House is a beautiful grassy yard and garden complete with a water lilly pond, palm trees, and stone gazebo (which is a little moss-covered and in slight disrepair, but makes for great pictures). You can park your car, if you have one, right beside the Beach House. The staff was wonderful and attentive, both at Glitter Bay and at the Royal Pavilion. Our rooms were well cleaned in the mornings and our beds were turned down in the evenings. There were plenty of towels in the room and on the beach at all times.", "title": "Loved Glitter Bay", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "JudyB35", "date": "January 27, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 1615604}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Glitter Bay Problems", "text": "The watersports (boat ride, snorkeling, catamaran, windsurfing) were a good plus.
