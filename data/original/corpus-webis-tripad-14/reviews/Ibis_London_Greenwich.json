We arrived and were checked in efficiently. On viewing the room it is what you expect from an Ibis hotel, rather like a travel inn. There is a large bed (which is pretty firm), flat screen TV, remote, small clothes hanging space, tea and coffee making facilities, desk, chair and Wifi access and keyboard if you needed it. The bathroom is sufficient with a shower over the bath and soaps provided (no fancy toiletries I'm afraid). There were only two pillows in the room, but as soon as I asked at reception extra ones were provided and so was a hairdryer - I was a bit surprised there wasn't a built in one in the bathroom, but it was fine by me to \"borrow\" one from reception. The staff working on reception were fine and efficient and pretty helpful. If you wanted an alcoholic drink or to hang out with visitors you would go next door to Cafe Rouge, where its pretty laid back, there is a covered, heated area outside on the balconies to eat and drink and the staff there were really friendly and attentive. The food there is also nice, and the continental breakfast (for which you need to collect a voucher from reception) is only \u00a34.75, and includes a large fresh orange, coffee, pan au chocolat, Bon Maman preserves and french bread. There are also ironing facilities if you need them. The hotel is really central for Greenwich nightlife, and only a 10 minute walk from the DLR. We would also recommend the Rivington Bar and Grill which is just around the corner from the hotel if you like fresh seafood and oysters. I can't complain at all about the hotel and if I stayed in Greenwich again I would stay there again. People may have been a bit upset about the increased prices the night before the marathon (approximately \u00a340 per room extra), but this happens at the majority of hotels around London on what they call an \"event weekend\". PS Another good point, I thought, was that the bedroom doors all closed really quietly, which is a bonus in the mornings if you want a bit of a lie in.", "title": "Booked for Easy Access to Start of London Marathon But Pleasantly Surprised!", "user": "sazzle24", "date": "April 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 29025371}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Dreadful hotel with miserable staff and very poor quality accommodation", "title": "Avoid", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ltfs", "date": "April 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 27871161}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Not even 1* the only good thing about this hotel is the location nightly stay very expensive dearer than quoted \u00a3113 for a night, staff very rude with very bad attitudes, bar in reception was appalling no tea, no wine, no gin, no beer, no ice and lemon for drinks if you were lucky enough to get one the person looking after the bar/coffee had no idea or motavation, no comfortable lounge for guest to sit in just the reception area which was cold, no towels or pillows in very small room had to ask for them, don't bring your cat as there is no room to swing it, and car parking was so painful I don't know where to start, so if you are planning on staying at this hotel don't forget to pack your sense of humor because you will need it.", "title": "3* Hotel with a 5* star price tag", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jvc12", "date": "March 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 27085516}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I have stayed here several times, and our only complaint is the silly and rather annoying extra charge for refills of coffee at breakfast (the breakfast in other Ibis hotels is much more generous, being self-service).
