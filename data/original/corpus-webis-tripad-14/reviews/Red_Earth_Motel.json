We had a studio apartment for $140 per night. This really felt like an apartment with a king size bed, walk-in robe and good bathroom up one end and a living, dining, kitchen area up the other end. The only thing that the kitchen didn\u2019t have was a stove, but with a fridge, microwave, toaster, kettle, coffee plunger and a full range of dishes and utensils, we had everything we needed (some of the other apartments do have stoves). There is also a large TV with lots of Pay channels and good wireless internet access. An easy walk to a few restaurants - the owners recommended The Astra to us which was indeed good.

It wasn't school holidays so we didn't book anything. We looked at a horrible musty smelly B&B full of old furniture and could not get out of there quickly enough. So I looked up tripadvisor and found the great reviews of Red Earth Motel. I rang, the person was incredibly helpful and offered to save the room for us, and let us have a look before committing. Well, it took only a quick glance to realise we had found an absolute gem. It is very new, apartment-style, with a shady swimming pool. Calling it a \"motel\" is doing it a disservice - this is probably one of the best apartment accommodation complexes I have ever seen. The smallest \"studio\" apartment was huge with an open plan living/dining/kitchenette (with full size fridge), plus a separate sleeping area with a king bed and a bathroom. The bed was quite simply the most comfortable I have ever slept on. I am a guidebook author on boutique accommodation around Australia so I have slept in more beds than most people! Red Earth Motel is one of those rare finds - I wish every country town had a \"motel\" like this one! I didn't see the larger apartments, but if the studio was anything to go by, they would also be sensational and perfect for longer stays, families or groups travelling together.", "title": "Probably the best accommodation in Broken Hill - we loved it!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jmlparis", "date": "September 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140139677}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012", "text": "From the first point of contact I was impressed and it only got better on arrival at Red Earth.", "title": "Immaculate in Every Aspect", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Kyzafletch", "date": "September 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 139980997}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The 2 Bedroom Apartment was perfect with everything you could want.
