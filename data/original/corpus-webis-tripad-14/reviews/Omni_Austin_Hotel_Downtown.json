Instead, she assured me that I was booked into a king room and I confirmed this with her before I ended the call. When I arrived, I was booked into a room with two double beds. The desk clerk, who was polite and helpful, got Matt, the assistant manager, who was anything but polite and helpful. He told me that I had booked through a third party and that room requests weren't guaranteed. I explained that I had spoken with someone at his hotel on Sunday who assured me otherwise and, in my opinion, had overridden any such policy. He suggested I had misunderstood and said they had tapes of calls (implying that I was wrong). I assured him I had not misuderstood and that I wanted him to review the calls and to contact me when he did so that I could listen with him. This never happened. In fact, after I said this, he backed off his original statement that the call had been preserved. He finally offered a king smoking room, which I declined. He did not apologize until the end of the conversation and it was not sincere. He didn't properly explain that the hotel was booked, he never acknowledged their mistake, and didn't offer to make any accomodations. Instead, he continued to imply that, as a Priceline customer, I was a second-class guest and not entitled regular treatment and that the mistake was mine. He finally offered to let me know if a king room came open. If did, two days later, by which time I had fully unpacked and had meetingss and did not have time to move. The hotel itself absolutely is not a four start hotel. It has not received the AAA 4-star diamond rating since 2006. The rooms are nothing special--mine was smll and cramped due to the 2 beds. It was quiet, however. Because I had joined the loyalty program, I got free wifi in the room and complimentary beverages. However, the first morning, nothing arrived and the order form was still on the door the next morning. The second morning the drinks arrived 45 minutes before requested. I gave up and didn't order again. The support staff is helpful and friendly but the management with whom I dealt was not.

I'd specifically requested a higher floor when, at check in, Murphy the desk clerk asked me if I was a light sleeper, and notified me that \"sometimes the rooms can get pretty noisy with street noise.\" I figured the hotel must take it's guests' needs for a quiet night's sleep seriously when, in addition to the desk clerk's noise warning, I passed curious signs at the elevator on my way up to the room that instructed \"NO UNAUTHORIZED GUESTS IN GUEST ROOMS\" and \"NO PARTIES IN GUEST ROOMS.\" Well, again I was wrong. I was placed on the 18th floor, but that made no difference. Not only was the street noise loud, but there were at least 5 or 6 people screaming and cheering in the room next to mine until well after midnight (when I finally had to call the front desk for help).", "title": "great stay, minor complaints", "user": "Biagi", "date": "March 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 102099061}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011", "text": "Not all elevators were functional during my 4 day stay, and one of the functioning elevators routinely malfunctioned (call buttons didn't work - didn't matter what floor you wanted or whether you needed to go up or down, it ignored all call requests and would not take passengers to the 1st floor lobby, causing us all to have to use the stairs).

It was extremely hot - well over 100 degrees - but the bed in the room was all I needed. The room was very comfortable. The lobby was also very nice. I enjoy big lobbies where you can sit and people watch if you'd like. They had a Salsa Dance competition going on so there was a lot to watch from the lobby view. And this dancing went on well into the morning. I could hear loud voices in the hallway around 4:00 AM. I could tell these people were being very thoughtless and noisy, but honestly, the sound was quite muffled from my room and it wasn't a big bother. I liked that ALOT!. Only one problem was the parking. A very large parking lot and yet, with this dance competition, there was no place to park except way in the back which bothered me a little - a long walk, but it was well lit so not too bad.

This room has a very, very nice view of the Atrium AND the State Capital which was a nice bonus. Room was excellent down to the bed, shower and pull out bed for our kids.

Let me touch on a few things that some neglect to mention or overlook..Valet and Door service. The guys who work this area at this hotel are AWESOME!!! It was busy all the time but these guys hustled their tails off to make sure people got in and out quickly but did it professionally and with a smile. We arrived back from a day trip but would be leaving again in 30 minutes for dinner so they held our car out front and already had the navigation set for our dinner destination..how cool is that!!! The Doormen did more then just greet you they would carry luggage and offer advice and on many occasions in the morning would offer guests water while they waited for their cars. Room Service totally blew us away, we used it for some dessert late at night and mostly for breakfast but calling them was easy and they were wonderful to speak with and NEVER messed up the order. Food was brought quickly. Let me tell you do not waste your time leaving the Omni for breakfast eat there. The breakfast choices are endless, portions are large and the food is excellent.

The bed was comfortable and the room was immaculate. We enjoyed the central location to all of the restaurants and nightlife.

The windows face the interior of the hotel. When you look out the window, you have a great view of the lobby, bar and restaurant area instead of the bright, loud downtown roads.

The girls began fighting in the hallway and making quite a bit of noise. Security and APD were VERY quick to respond to the situation. They were already on their way up to the floor when we tried to call. Hotel managers and staff were very apologetic and comped our room for the night. Quite a bit of excitement, but nothing the hotel can control, so no blame there. I do like the hotel's no noise, no tolerance policy to help control things like this. In my opinion, all the hotels in downtown Austin should have this policy, just because of the city.
