So i have been to CUBA before and yes the food is always a big part of the rating but as much as you here that the food is not great you will always find something to eat. At TRYP you will not find any service you can wait at the lobby bar and restaurant buffet for a very long time before you are asked if you would like something to DRINK than once ordered you will have to wait even longer to get it if in the end you do get it. We have sat through dinner with no drinks and I had to go to the bar to order and get our own drinks. Lets talk about the BUFFET and their DIRTY DISHES and not one you can take dish after dish and they would be all dirty. The service is EXTREMELY SLOWWWW and lacking in CUSTOMER SERVICE. II would not reccomend this Hotel at any COST and beleive me I would NEVER GO BACK. As far as ENTERTAINMENT there is no entertainment you get a half an hour show at night and at 10:30pm you'll call it a night. If you are looking for movement, service and a memberable time Iberostar is your BEST BET trust me. The grounds are kept clean and so are the rooms but for the rest of the RESORT 2 STAR AT ITS BEST.", "title": "WHERE'S THE SERVICE", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "HOtel_Gurl_11", "date": "January 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 123760788}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "It was our first vacation in Cuba.

I echo the comments of the persons below...good value, and good(for Cuba) food. A couple of minor areas could use improvement....at $10 per hour the internet was unbelievably slow....I have used the net from Afghanistan and it was a lot quicker. A la cartes were OK....the amount of salt used the first night in the Japanese one was too much, though it improved my second visit. And the Mexican one, excellent string music the first night...absent the second :(. And the desserts offered, do not take the fruit salad, it was canned complete with little red cherry like you used to eat as a kid. I doubt that is considered gourmet in Mexico either. You would think that with all the fruit available, and rum, they could do something up that was fresh and delish with little effort. Food generally OK, I prefered salad at lunch, and did not notice the lines being overly long. Michael the bartender in the island gazebo excellent...on his day off I did not appreciate being told to fetch my own beer by some replacement bar server, and then had to go through the hassle of explaining to the lobby bar staff I was not going to run off with their glassware out of the immediate area. Buying a visitors pass to the vip lounge in Varadero airport on departure was well worth the $23 IMHO, the departure area upstairs was a zoo, and you get priority through the exit payment area as well. I saw two skeeters in two weeks, and one big beetle crawling across my room floor as I had left the door open; he had expired on the dressing room floor by the next morning.

My brother and I's room had no problems at all, very clean and pretty big. The beds ok were a bit hard but that didn't bother us at all. My parent's room had some problems. Their t.v. didn't work at all so they called down to the front desk and they had a man come and fix it. They only waited like 10 minutes for someone to come and give them a new t.v. On the third day the safe wouldn't open. All of our money and passports were stuck in there so they called again and someone within 10-15 minutes came and solved the problem. Our maid was pretty good, we had to tip her to do a good job but I expect to tip. They only leave you one cola, one bottle of water and one beer per day so you might have to buy some more at the gift shop.
