Good sheets, plenty of pillows, big comforter. It was also very quiet and I don't know if there was anyone next to us, we didn't hear a thing. Lots of fluffly white towels and one of the only disappointments was the lack of fan in the bathroom. Why? After showering - we had to use the mirrored closet door to get ready - too steamy to see in the bathroom. Also, no place besides the closet to put clothing, not that we had a lot, but the bookcase used for the TV stand could use a few baskets or something to make it usable.", "title": "OK.", "user": "christmaskitty", "date": "July 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 133787912}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We lounged by the pool for a while.
