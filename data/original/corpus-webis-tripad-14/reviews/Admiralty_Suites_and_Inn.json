I live in the small town of Millington and had occasion to tour the Admiralty a while back. First I will state that I am not friends with anyone at Admiralty. My husband and I travel a lot and I compare. We usually stay at Hampton and Drury Inns. I can assure you that The Admiralty is just as nice as any motel we have stayed. I don't think anyone will be disappointed. The day I was there they had the Continental breakfast out and it looked delicious.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "R&MRich", "date": "June 14, 2004", "id": 2186813}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Local owner", "text": "We like staying with them.
