The hotel smelled like a mix between curry and vomit; the comforters looked as if they had just been bought from Goodwill. There were water stains all over the ceilings and mold - mold like you would see after your house was flooded with sewage - all over the shower on the third floor. I didn't want to take my shoes off. My husband was disgusted with the shower situation and requested another hotel room (which he never does, it was that bad) and they moved us down to the ground floor, which was marginally better - the bathroom smelled more of vomit and the pillowcases were stained with heavens knows what.", "title": "Terrible!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Alybyzrp", "date": "August 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 8360931, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 The physical hotel itself"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Would not go back and would not recommend this hotel to others - I'd rather stay in the hostel halfway down the block in a bunk bed with a bunch of random folks than come back here again.", "title": "Absolutely awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "user": "millie0", "date": "July 12, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "value": 1.0}, "id": 8105243, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything!dirty,broken and MOULD EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My aunt and her 2 daughters stayed here for 2 weeks and the hotel was awful!
