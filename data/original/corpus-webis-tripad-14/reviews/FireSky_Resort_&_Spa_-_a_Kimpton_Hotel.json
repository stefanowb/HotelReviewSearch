This is one of the most gorgeous Kimpton hotels I've visited. The grounds are breathtaking--meticulous landscaping, beautiful facade--and the rooms have been carefully remodeled yet preserve the old character of a previous property (Firesky occupies what used to be a motel/hotel on Scottsdale Rd.) The lobby area is spacious, providing more room for socializing than most Kimpton hotels. All rooms have either a balcony or small patio area. Bathrooms aren't glamorous but have been tastefully redone. Rooms are surprisingly large with comfortable beds, flatscreen LG tv, fully stocked honor bar. Some reviews mentioned noise, which gave me some pause when I considered staying here. We didn't here ANYTHING during our stay. Had two wonderful, quiet nights. We spent one afternoon at the pool--again, just beautiful, lush landscaping. The pool area had a very tropical feel with fruit trees and hummingbirds in abundance. The bartender in the lobby bar was OUTSTANDING. She was working solo and no one had to wait long for service. Early evening wine hour was great, as was the morning coffee/tea service. All of the staff were pleasant and more than willing to accommodate requests. We didn't use it, but Firesky offers complimentary shuttle service to anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel. This is a great perk for those who want to spend the evening in Old Town and don't want to hassle with parking (or risk driving after having some drinks).

Fire pits and social areas are nice as is the overall gardens / foliage. Food and sundries (other than room service or in house restaurant) are actually difficult to obtain as only other option on premise is the gift shop. The hours of the gift shop are hit and miss as the staff gets pulled off to fulfill other tasks and close the store until they return. While very conveniently located to old town and the mall (short walk, very easy) to run out to get snacks for the kids in the room was a task that required additional resources and actual planning. I had to catch a ride on the hotel shuttle vehicle (very nice service) to the nearest grocery store 1.5 miles away. Nothing within walking distance that sells convenience store type things.

It's a little oasis, walking distance to town. The rooms were very clean and modern. The pool area had a very tropical feel that was perfect for relaxation. Stayed here two nights, once on a Friday and then the following Monday, before we flew home. We didn't have a reservation, showed up on a very busy day and they accommodated us with a very nice room. I would definitely go back here and recommend to friends!", "title": "Trendy, Clean & Relaxing...", "user": "mainetoday", "date": "May 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159402468}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Our family had reservations at another hotel in Phoenix at the end of March and upon checking in...we quickly realized the hotel we had chosen was not for us. Luckily we were able to get out of our reservation and I looked at a \"last minute hotel\" website and discovered FireSky. I quickly called and was informed that they had one room left which was a huge relief because it was spring break and most hotels were full in Scottsdale. The person I spoke with was so kind and accommodating. He asked my children's age and gender because there would be special things waiting in the room for them. We arrived just in time to catch the tail end of the wine reception which the host every night from 5-6) in the lobby. We quickly each got a glass of wine and enjoyed the little oasis that surrounded us. When we got to our room there was a bucket of beers, snacks, cheetah robes for our kids and a pet goldfish! That night our 11-year-old son went to the front desk to ask to reserve a cabana for our anniversary the following day. The front desk was so kind to him but told him that they don't reserve cabanas at FireSky, that they are on a first come, first served basis. That evening, we enjoyed s'mores at the fire pit. FireSide provided little s'more baggies with everything one would need to make the treat. That was a great little perk! We enjoyed a wonderful day by the pool just relaxing and my husband and I also visited the fitness room which was small but had everything we would have wanted as far as fitness equipment. After housekeeping had cleaned the room, we discovered a little basket of chocolate eggs on our bed (it was right around Easter time). It seemed like every time we turned around, we were being given something! That afternoon around 4:00, there was a knock on our door and someone appeared with a bottle of champagne, beautiful chocolate covered strawberries and a hand written note from the front desk apologizing that they couldn't accommodate our son's request for a cabana but wishing us a happy anniversary on his behalf. The note was riddled with compliments about our son and how thoughtful it was of him to think of us! It was then that my husband and I decided that we will ALWAYS look for a Kimpton resort when we travel. We feel so lucky that we stumbled upon this little oasis in the desert. My husband and I plan to return for a warm weekend next February to escape our Minnesota winter. We have traveled extensively both in the United States and abroad and my husband and I both agreed that FireSky was by far THE BEST resort we have ever experienced. The staff truly does care about their visitors and like I said earlier...I will always look to book at a Kimpton resort wherever our travels take us!! Thank you, FireSky for an amazing few days! I forget to mention that the location is awesome and that there is a driver on staff just waiting to take you to many restaurants/shopping (within a three mile radius) with just a phone call.
