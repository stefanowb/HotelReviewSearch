There are no mini-fridges in the room and indeed no drinks of any sort (except the clear water provided) are even allowed in the rooms, even if you purchase them at the bar downstairs. (We felt like school kids sneaking our bottles of wine in in my purse.) There are only two places in the room to put non-hanging clothes, a single drawer in the bottom of the wardrobe and a small drawer in the writing desk. The giant bathroom which sports lovely hand-painted fixtures has no hooks to hang clothes on. Everything has been thought of and no expense spared to decorate the place, but no thought has been given to the comfort and convenience of the guests.

It retains the warmth of the past without giving up modern facilities in line with today standards. Its wonderful decoration offers diverse styles that evoke a sense of past times.Located in the town of Azofra, it has a strategic location in the heart of La Rioja Alta. The Rioja Region offers visitors a great many varied attractions and the region is of great cultural interest being the cradle of the Spanish language and traversed by Pilgrim\u2019s Way to Santiago. It offers a wealth of wines and gastronomy, ancestral feasts and traditions, and a wide range of natural landscapes where its peoples are hearty and sociable.The communal areas are divided into three zones, a Florentine-Style Lobby, a lounge zone and a library. All of them offer a relaxed family atmosphere. The main hall is an inviting room both in winter, with its welcoming fireplace, and in summer, with its delightful natural illumination. The bar and second hall are two places to enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon or an aperitif before supper. The original floorboards, large comfortable sofas, elegant antiques and the prevailing grey and reddish hues of the d\u00e9cor, invite one to read, rest or chat with friends after enjoying any of the numerous activities offered by La Rioja and its environments. In addition, you can connect to Internet by Wi-Fi access."}
