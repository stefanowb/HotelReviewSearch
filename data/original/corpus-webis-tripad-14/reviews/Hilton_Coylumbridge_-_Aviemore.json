We had dinner on first night which was ok ,decided to eat out for the remaining nights as the dinner prices were quite expensive, breakfast was really good with plenty of choice, drink prices were ok for a hotel, 3.20 for a bottle of beer, the foyer bar had a happy hour between 5-7, 2.40 for a pint 2.45 for a small glass of wine. The hotel is really child freindly, my son had a great time in the swimming pools, the kids club was also good, my only complaint was if you wanted to use facilities e.g tennis, golf and the funhouse outwith the kids club times there was a charge. The staff were very freindly and professional and nothing was too much trouble for them. So as i said earlier had a really great time and for what i paid 207.00 for 3 nights with dinner on the first night i would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to my family and freinds.", "title": "great time", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "redvanman", "date": "March 31, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7259422}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great facilities", "text": "Excellent location, amazing scerery around this area.
