As far as the resort goes, it was clean and well kept. The shower had decent pressure and was roomy. Though, if long, hot showers are important, I would look elsewhere. The in-room bathroom provided privacy. The bed was comfortable. A little more storage space would have been nice though. We had to keep most of our clothes in our bags as a result. If you are like me and apply make-up daily- the lighting in there was terrible. One side of the mirror was shadowed the whole time. The view from the balcony was partial ocean view. The central air worked well. There is a hot tub on grounds but it is a bit of a walk from the hotel. The map they provided wasn't very clear so we did a bit of exploring before finding it. Valet service was prompt and friendly. The pineapple infused water in the lobby is fantastic. The breakfast buffet had a great variety of fruits, pastries, meats, juices, and breads. The eggs were sub-par but everything else I had was great. The dining area is an open-air sort of thing and birds are constantly in and out. They will jump on your chairs, table, and even eat from your plate. Our first morning there, a bird defecated on our table. They are finch-type birds. The staff was so-so as far as friendliness goes. Some are nicer than others. We came to the conclusion that it was like that all over Maui. One gets the feeling the locals hate the tourists.", "title": "Well kept resort", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "queenofapology", "date": "February 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 152143190}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our first evening there we had the worst service in the restaurant.
