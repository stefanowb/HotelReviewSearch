When we first entered the room, a lady came in to spray the room with some air freshener, which we found a little odd. The rooms did have a weird smell to them. There were dark stains in the green carpets, pretty big holes in the ceiling of the bathrooms & the water pressure in the bath was really low in one of the rooms. Beside the Lobby, the hotel was a little eerie as well.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Sugahpie57", "date": "September 12, 2006", "id": 5794939}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "I've been to other Hotels in Bangkok, I wouldn't recommend this one.", "title": "Old hotel with small coachroaches", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "land_premier", "date": "March 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4734836}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 7, "very good": 5, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 0.74795640327}
