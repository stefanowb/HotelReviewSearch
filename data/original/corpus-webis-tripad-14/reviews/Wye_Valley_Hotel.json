The room was comfortable and had a fully equipped bathroom. The owners were very friendly and helpful. The family run restaurant serves excellent food and drink. Tintern is a lovely little town on the banks of the Wye with the Abbey as its showcase and many hiking trails in the area. I loved the town and the hotel. You can get a bus into Chepstow right across the street from the hotel. I highly recommend this the Wye Valley Hotel.", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "cassienacra", "date": "September 10, 2003", "id": 1278173}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 3, "very good": 22, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 45}, "aka": "Wye Valley Hotel Tintern, Wales", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333}
