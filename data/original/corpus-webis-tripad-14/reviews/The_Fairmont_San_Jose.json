The bathroom was large, with both a walk in shower, and a tub, and also had an adjacent make up area and a walk in closet. We had a great view, and even though we were right in the line of air traffic for the San Jose airport, and the planes came in very low above us, you could not hear them at all unless the window was open. My husband loved the large desk, off on its own, so that he could concentrate while working on line. I have no complaints, just 3 very minor things that would make the room absolutely more perfect. It would have been nice to have a mini bar fridge as the Starwood hotels have to keep water and soft drinks cold, for those times you don't feel like finding the vending machine. The shower was large but had virtually no place to put anything other than a bar of soap. A shelf for toiletries would be a great addition. The seated make up area was large, but poorly lit and the distance to the mirror was too far- an extended mirror that attaches to the wall and swings out at various angles (again like the Starwood-Sheraton hotels have) would have made it perfect. We loved the sunken bar area in the center of the lobby that had a live band playing every night. It was classy, and a lot of fun. The gift shop was well stocked with both necessities and souvenirs and gifts. The restaurants were excellent, both for brunch and for dinner.

The hotel is lovely and rooms are newly renovated. The beds are very comfortable and the baths are modern and clean. I enjoyed my stay very much but I did notice that the meeting rooms were absolutely freezing while it was difficult to get my hotel room to cool down enough for me (and I am usually cold). I was unimpressed with sushi bar on site but the main lobby has a wonderful array of wines and cocktails. The drink list is 60 pages! For such an upscale hotel with a price tag to go with it I was nonplused to find out that Internet in your hotel room was $14.00 for 24 hours! (yes, they charged me twice.) It seems that cost could be wrapped into the room cost so that it seems complimentary. That said, the hotel and staff are great and the art museum is steps away.

There is an European bakery attached to the hotel that is AMAZING and reasonably priced. Very close to restaurants and I felt safe walking around the area by myself. If I had to make one complaint, is that the sink in the bathroom was a little slow draining. And that's extremely minor b/c it didn't effect my stay at all.

Our room was very nice on the 12th floor main tower. 2 windows, one faced east - we could see San Jose State campus & hills beyond. The other faced south. Great city views at night. Super quiet. Super clean. Beds were fantastically comfortable. 2 doubles with 4 pillows on each. Spacious room, nice bathroom with separate shower and bath. Love not standing in a bathtub to take a shower. Nice bath products. Whole experience was great. Will be staying again in June.
