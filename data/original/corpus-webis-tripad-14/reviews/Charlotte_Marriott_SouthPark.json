The rooms were okay and pretty clean. Linens and major fixtures were clean, but there wasn't great attention to detail in the cleaning though (dust in the corners, dirty grout around the border of the bathroom, etc.). The service at the hotel was so-so. Maintenance was very helpful when we had a problem with the toilet, but the front desk left something to be desired. We had a giftcard issued by Marriott to us that we gave them upon check-in. It took the woman at the front desk forever to process it, but then she finally told us we were all set and had been credited the money. Then, when we went to check out, another front desk person said there was \"no record\" of the card. We eventually had to call a manager to get it taken care of.

Although the front desk and bellman were very pleasant and helpful, the service in areas such as room service and restaurant fell far short of what we expected. After our room service meal was delivered, we had to call back for them to deliver cream for the coffee and silverware! Needless to say by the time they came back, the rest of the meal was cold. They only had one person bartending and waitressing in the afternoon. No fault to this lonely employee who was trying to serve everyone to the best of their ability, but was not able to provide prompt service. Aside from the service, there was mold growing on the bathtub tiles. I was interested to see if they would clean it the next day (which they did not). The maid service also knocked on the door and asked if we we \"needed anything\". I thought daily cleaning was the norm for Marriott and it was not necessary to request this service. The computer area for business and customer use was at the junction of two hallways with alot of noise and traffic. The computer was also facing the center of the room making everything on the screen visible to the other people standing around.

When we checked in, we were informed that a wedding party was occupying most of the 6th (top) floor, but our room was on the 4th, so we should have no problem with noise--and they were correct. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but we had drinks in the lounge (again, lovely) and another time outside on the patio. Service was prompt.

They stayed open so that my friends and I could eat after our long flight! We stayed in there past 4p enjoying lunch and there company! We also returned later that same evening to entertain other visiting guest of ours at about 930p. We stayed til they closed with no rush on their part both times.
