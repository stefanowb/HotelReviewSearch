After 4 months traveling around South East Asia and India, all my boyfriend and I wanted to do was stay at a nice place, relax and enjoy peacefully. And that\u00b4s what we could do here! Clifton is a very cheerful and charismatic person, always smiling and willing to help, so is the rest of his lovely family. The Guest House is a renovated house, painted in different pale colours, very cozy and quiet. It has a nice terrace for breakfast, which is not included in the price but is extra-cheap and it was my partner\u00b4s favourite, as he said.. The rooms are very clean, fan doesn\u00b4t work much, but complimentary AC for a couple of hours did the trick. It is very well located, in one of the nicest neighbourhoods we walked around while in Panaji, and walking distance from almost everywhere.
