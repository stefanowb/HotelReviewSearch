Should you find yourself wanting to stay here consider this hotel. The biggest downside is parking. The hotel does have a garage which is a bit on the expensive side. We did find a public spot not too far from the hotel and carried our luggage the short distance. The hotel itself is in the middle of a pedestrian zone. Street noise wasn't bad for a Saturday evening. By 10 PM it was very quiet around the hotel. Sleep comfort was great with a comfortable king size bed. The room was bit on the small side but all furnishings were top notch. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast and had some of the best croissants during our trip across northern Spain. We thoroughly enjoy our brief stay in Estella.", "title": "Wonderful Small Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "highdesertbadger", "date": "April 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 158469981}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "After walking 6 days on Camino (through hail, snow, rain, wind and landslides!) stumbling on this little gem was like arriving in heaven. We were greeted by a charming member of staff who could not speak English, yet this was no problem at all, she smiled and pointed at maps, making us feel welcome even though we did not speak the local language. This is very much a boutique hotel, with edgy furnishings throughout providing super comfortable beds and linen. Breakfast was included and by Spanish standards was excellent (usually quite basic).
