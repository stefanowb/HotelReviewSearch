Once at the airport it's so easy to get a bus direct to either Nykoping which is ten minutes away or Stockholm 2 hours. I found the Park Inn hotel excellent value. Don't be put off by the outside, the inside is welcoming and the staff friendly. Good breakfast plenty of choice, hot and cold. All day coffee and tea lunchtime buffet or meals and a small cafe attached with cakes and hot beverages. The rooms are clean and warm, with coffee and tea making facilities. Sauna free to guests after 5pm. The bus station is 5 minutes away and the train station 10 minutes, but you cant hear the trains as they are so quiet. We went to stockholm for the day, and it was brilliant! it's not expensive to travel around. Even cigarettes are cheaper than uk. Nykoping has its own unique shopping centre, and a pub called the twist with an English theme. The food there was fantastic and very reasonable. We also found loads of walks around the river which runs into a harbour near the baltic sea. This time of the year it was frozen but what a sight! Don't be put off because it's a small town, it has a lot to offer. He even has its own nightclub.
