The neighborhood of Yanaka is very quiet, which may be exactly what your looking for if you've spent all day in Harajuku and all night in Shinjuku. Lots of temples, and art galleries. I really liked this place and wouldn't be suprised if I headed straight back for my next trip, unless I'm super rich by then.

The owners of the inn are super friendly and helpful. The location of this inn is perfect if you don't want to stay in a noisy part of Tokyo. Also, it is a five minute walk to the subway. There were also plenty of restaurants, markets and post office nearby for any of your needs. Our room did not have a bathroom so if you want one you might need to book a good ways in advance because there were none left. However, even if you room has a shower I HIGHLY recommend the public bath they have. It was awesome! There were two, the one on the right being big enough for two. You can lock the door so its completely private and the bath is simply amazing.
