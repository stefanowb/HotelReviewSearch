I couldn't be more impressed with a facility. This hotel is lovely and grand in every way. I followed the advice of an earlier trip advisor review and requested an outside room, for quieter evenings. The inside rooms have french doors opening out to the lovely atrium. It's a fabulous space, but they do perform shows every night, and the could get irritating if you are here for more than a night or two. Right now the hotel is doing their Christmas show, which is actually wonderful (but not if you have to listen to it night after night). Food and service at the Villa de Flora is very good for a buffet. They do try to change many of the dishes nightly. The parking lot is a bit of a walk, but I am not sure how it could be otherwise. The pools and pool areas are lovely. Overall, you could pay a lot more for a lot less! This hotel is extremely well located to get to the Disney parks. While I am not here for that, and probably won't go to any, I would recommend it for it's proximity if that is what you are here for.

Last year my wife and I & our youngest daughter & her friend came over from Daytona and truly enjoyed it & had a great time If I remember correctly I think we paid somewhere around $20.00 for adults & maybe $18.00 for kids (under $80.00) for all of us then of course they sneek in the $13.00 +TAX for parking? But last year they did at least give every person a complimentary coupon for a free hot chocolate afterwards. And the show last year seemed to be a lot bigger & nicer with more characters & sculptures & more variety. And the ICE afterwards last year was SO MUCH nicer than this year, they had games the kids could play and win tickets , they gave away prizes , they had ice slides and just so much more the kids could do and enjoy. This year ICE was extremely small and very boring for adults and kids alike, we heard numerous people talking about both the Shrek the Halls and ICE about wow this is it this year? And not only that we paid $160.00 for 4 of us to go this year plus that sneaky $13.00 + TAX parking fee , and the $20.00 photo. Took us less than 13 minutes to go though Shrek The Halls and we struggled to keep the kids in ICE for 20 minutes they were bored to death, nothing to do. AND NO HOT CHOCOLATE this year. So to sum it up it cost us $193.00 for a 33 minute visit to Gaylord this Christmas and none of us or anyone else were heard talking about there experience thought it was worth it this year. Once again looks like GREED is taking over and ruining something else in Orlando that started out to be such a great thing. Last time for us and many others im sure.

We stayed their last December and we thought this ICE! was nice but it was one of those things you only needed do once. Then this summer, the DreamWorks Experience was announced to be the new theme of ICE!. Due to my kids, 5 & 8 yrs. old love of the DreamWorks movies, we hesitantly decided to do it again and booked the two night package. I thought the package was pricey but considering the only full DreamWorks Experience with characters is the cruise (which is a lot more expensive), I booked the package. Surprise, Surprise... it was a totally different experience that the typical ICE! events and I am glad I booked it. We arrived late Sunday night to the beautifully decorated hotel. Check-in went smoothly and we arrived and in our rooms fairly quick. Our rooms was \u201crecently renovated\u201d and boy, what a difference from last year. The room we had last year was dark and slightly depressing. The renovated room we stayed at the last few days was bright and modern. The only complaint about the room is that I found the bed slightly hard. I have a bad back and felt very stiff in the morning. The next day we went to Shrek Feast, a buffet at their Villa De Flora restaurant. Shrek, Fiona and Puss in Boots rotated around the restaurant to take photos and interact with guests. Patrons were given green ogre ears after they have been sworn in as honorary ogres and wait for their server while drinking their green \u201cswamp juice\u201d. The hotel had Santa in the main atrium area to sit with kids and take photos (Parents cannot take photos and you\u2019ll have to buy the photo you want to keep that memory). My kids and I roamed the hotel the entire day doing their polar bear hunt and the Puss in Boots quest for the Magic Beans scavenger hunt. In the afternoon, we moved on to \u201cHoliday Hall\u201d for the meet and greet with the DreamWorks characters\u2026 we went around not only once but twice at two times during the day. My 5 year stated his favorite part was meeting the characters and taking photos with all of them (Alex & Julian from Madagascar, Po from Kung Fu Panda, Shrek & Fiona and Puss in Boots). At night was ICE! and the holiday shows in the atrium. (The bad part of this package is that you could only visit ICE! one time and SNOW! was a separate admission price). We were up down and all around this hotel the entire day; my kids were pooped by the end of the night. The next morning, my daughter\u2019s delight, we were woken by a wakeup call from Donkey (from the Shrek movies). The food overall in the hotel is good (the ShrekFeast was very good) but it\u2019s typical pricey resort fare (ex. $15 for burger and fries). If you are willing to leave the resort for food, you have many options one exit away on I-4. The service was good and I think the waiters at the ShrekFeast were in good spirits (especially since they were walking around with ogre ears all morning). The renovated rooms were definately an improvement. I will consider staying here in the summer when their new children's water park is completed. My son was already excited by their artist rendering of the new pool area that was on one of the walls. Was the whole thing pricey \u2013 YES! Did my kids love it \u2013 YES! So in the end, that was the reason I was there and it was well worth it for that reason.

This hotel is close to Disney (very close to the Wide World of Sports - WWS - complex).

There was an ICE show in the connected Convention Center which looked amazing but we did not see it as we are from the north and have enough cold temperatures! We dined at the Old Hickory Steakhouse. Prior to going we read reviews. We parked ourselves with no problem and knew parking would be $7.50. Some reviews of the Old Hickory Steakhouse complained about the prices. Gaylords has 3 dining options. We elected to eat at the Steakhouse ($$$). My husband and I had a wonderful 'dining experience' at the steakhouse. I had one of the very BEST meals I have ever had in any restaurant. Yes, it was expensive but it was ABSOLUTELY supurb. Because they were booked we ate at the bar and actually ordered 2 appetizers and then split one (steak) meal. What I liked is that the waitresses suggested this when I mentioned that I didn't want too much. They brought an extra plate and were very gracious, funny. It was wonderful.
