This was a classic, midwestern, small-town country inn. Had many business perks, including frequent stay program, free breakfast, pool and small gym. What you'll notice here is very nice, genuine service from the front desk, and a more mixed demographic crowd (blue plus white collar, construction plus consultants, retirees and random families). So, it's probably the best option in this small town. Room was typical 2*, with the free stuff in the bathroom, movies for rent, clean, and basic. Nothing fancy here, but quite a deal for the price. Perfectly fine as a business hotel or a family trip across Ohio. Oh, you do have to pay for your own newspaper, unless you're in the frequent stay club, in which case you get the paper, plus a bottle of water, some in-room cookies, and other perks.", "title": "Pleasent stay and good location", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "navigator", "date": "July 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5492749, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good rooms, Location and clean"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006, traveled on business", "text": "This was our first stop inOhio on our road trip.
