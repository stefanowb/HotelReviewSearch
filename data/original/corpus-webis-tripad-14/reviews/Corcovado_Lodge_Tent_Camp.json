This was our starting point for our hike. We didn't do any of the day activities that they offered there like bird watching, horseback riding or hiking. We stayed for three nights and relaxed before the start of our three day hike through Corcovado National park. This place was great. The setting was amazing. We arrived by truck to the little town and I mean little...it is just a store where we had made previous arrangements to have our luggage picked up so we could walk up the beach to the camp. This is well worth the effort though it is an easy beach walk if you decide not to do this. We were amazed at the scarlet macaws flying out of the trees as we walked along the beach. We could hear the howler monkies off in the jungle. The beach was amazing and deserted. How could some place so beautiful be so isolated. Once at the camp the staff was very accomodating and helpful. I don't think they liked that we did not do any of the guiding activities but we were there to relax before our hike into the park. There are day hikes around the camp, lots of birds to see, lots of interesting people to talk to. There was never a dull moment there. The food was good but sometimes small portions especially for the men. We found if you sat at the seats closest to the kitchen you could get a little bit more food than the seats further away from the kitchen. Bathrooms and showers were communal but I never had to wait. The cold showers were a welcome relieve from the humidity believe me. Summer, the hotel manager was very friendly and helpful. She is from the states and hopes to open her own lodge camp one day. The actual tents are really all you need. You are off the ground and dry. I am not a bug person and was happy to not see anything in my tent. Lights are out by 9 but you can stay up in the lounge area for awhile longer or read by candle light in your tent. This really was a beautiful spot to go to if you want to see alot of wildlife, do some hiking or just relax.", "helpfulness": 27, "user": "Anne50SB", "date": "May 10, 2004", "id": 1924945}], "location": {"country": "Costa Rica", "continent": "Central America"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 1, "very good": 5, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 16}, "aka": "Corcovado Lodge Tent Camp Hotel", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "16 tents between the pounding surf and the living wall of the jungle.
