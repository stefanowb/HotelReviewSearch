The food was ok but breakfast on the saturday morning was very disorganised as everyone seemed to come down at 9am and the queues for the tables were massive. There were not enough staff on to get the tables cleared and set up again. The other thing that annoyed me was that the hotel clearly stipulated on their booking form that they did not allow any single sex parties-what a joke! There were at least three big parties of women only. One of these parties were in rooms opposite and ajoining ours and the noise when they eventually came to bed I will leave to your imagination.

At the best of times, I am quite a cold creature but the heat in the hotel and the room - even with the heat off was very uncomfortable. I found the hotel itself had a very oldy worldy feel to it and if you are into contempoary clean cut designs, stay well away from this hotel. Checking in and out was fine and the staff accomodated us with our early arrival and also let us keep our room on until the late afternoon on check out as we had a late flight. The staff were all very friendly and the rooms were clean and tidy - a little on the small side for a family room but we made do. The prices in the hotel were extortionate - I thought the prices in Dublin for a drink were expensive but it was little in comparison to what the Imperial hotel charges. Also, as we had 2 children with us that were in buggies, we found accessability very difficult. There were steps to get into the hotel which we had to lift the buggies up and down. The lift was small and only allowed 1 buggy in so there was a lot of coming and going on that front. Overall, we had our share of problems but it was more to do with the hotel and not the staff. One thing I would like to point out is that my sister and her family were staying in the hotel and she had booked a family room for 2 adults and 2 children (aged 12 and 13). She was allocated a double room with 2 camp beds and when she got it changed, at check out, the hotel charged her \u00a340.00 per night.
