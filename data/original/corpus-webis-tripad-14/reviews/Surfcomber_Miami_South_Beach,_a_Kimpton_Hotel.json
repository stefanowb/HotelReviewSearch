Close to shops/restaurants and right on the beach. The overall vibe is chill. No loud music at the pool (like their is at the SLS next door). They have a low key bar area. Overall good staff, particularly Chris at the pool, but the outdoor bartenders were unfriendly. The rooms are small. The bathrooms are tiny.

It's location is wonderful for leisurely walks to a myriad a fabulous restaurants and venues in South Beach. The hotel is warm and most welcoming. The staff is very attentive and work to make sure that your stay is enjoyable. The rooms are nicely appointed and the pool area is wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and would go back there the next time I find myself in Miami.", "user": "Jill R R", "date": "April 17, 2013", "id": 158012346}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Sleepless nights", "text": "Spent 3 nights in this place and could not sleep the entire time.

Having booked through a third party website that did not inform us, either of the festival or of the Surfcomber's large well-known pool-parties, we arrived and found we were unable to use the pool during our stay, and even time on the beach was accompanied by a heavy bass and beat coming either from our own hotel or (even worse) was battling in volume with one of the neighbouring properties.", "user": "Sutter93", "date": "April 12, 2013", "id": 157558484}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good location, pleasant pool area and warm friendly staff but our room was very small and, in our view, not suitable for 4 .", "text": "Meanwhile, the staff at the beach (K17) could not have been friendlier, more helpful, or more understanding of our frustration and this was a contributing factor to our positive feelings at the end of the trip (though we were disappointed and surprised on our one day when the pool was open that the staff at the pool were very different and not particularly friendly - to the extent that we moved back to the beach).", "user": "mcrtravelers", "date": "April 12, 2013", "id": 157550083}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Another great stay at Surfcomber", "text": "We were really grateful that the hotel acknowledged the inconveniences and compensated us in part with food and beverage credit on our final bill.

The decor and cleanliness of the hotel was impeccable (and I am very picky) even down to the bed sheets. The location and proximity to the beach -amazing! My only concern which I refuse to account into my star rating because the hotel has no control over is the size of the rooms, we stayed in a deluxe king and between the size of the room itself and the bathroom it reminded me of a cruise ship stateroom.

(I just wish the poolside food service attendants could be equally so....perhaps no motivation with the gratuity already figured in?) The poolside food was tasty. The beach attendants were also very attentive in securing beach chairs and umbrellas. Be aware there is major sound bleed at the pool from the thumping music at SLS next door (and we were disappointed that on our second day part of the public area was booked with a private bar mitzvah party which brought their own loud music system....just seems like private events should not infringe on the paying guests enjoying the property) The only major negative was a disaster with room service breakfast but to the management's credit the meal was comped (The wrong meal was sent up and the eventual meal which made it to the room was not particularly tasted or well presented). The bar Social has an innovative drink menu with a very talented mixologist.
