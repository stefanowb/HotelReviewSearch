Granted we got a cheap rate through priceline (with tax for a Saturday night was right under $100) and that's about the most I would have paid. Parking is 25 per night and includes in/out privliges. The lobby is nice, but very lacking in ameneties for travelers. The lobby bar serves Starbucks, but the menu is very limited, there are six levels of shopping, but there were no brand name or recognizeable stores...mostly six levels of gift shops, or luggage stores. One level is fast food type shops, look to be all locally run (no franchises). The new workout room is nice and spacious. The room that we were in was directly next to the elevator in the blue tower, so when we had the lights on, you could see directly in. It was very quiet however, considering we were literally right next to it. Room was very small, with double beds (not exactly comfortable for three people who are all almost 6 feet tall. I did try to use my Starwood Preferred Guest card at check in for a room on the 26th level but was declined. The tip I had read on here may only work on a weekday or during a slow season. We made one visit to the Bonaventure Lounge on the 35th floor. It is a revolving lounge, it is very slow moving and subtle, but offers some beautiful downtown views. It is a large convention hotel, however outside of larger lines for food/beverages, it didn't feel as crowded as I'm sure it was.

I didn't know about the trade centre, but we parked at the Mariott for $18 per night which is not bad for the middle of a city. The room was very clean. Yes it is a little dated, but very clean. We had 2 beds which were very comfy and a great view from downtown from the 15th floor and we were not by the elevators. We like the fact that there was an italian restaurant and a pub as part of the hotel for reasonable prices which we could go to easily as single young females. The pool is great as was the gym.

The room that we were first assigned had a stains on the carpet and seems dirty. We had a connecting room to a family that was so noisy that we had to request another room. The carpet in the second room was also stained and dirty, but at least it was quiet. The room has the air vent about a foot above the headboard, which I did not like. The bathroom sink was situated far in the corner, which makes it hard for our family to use the sink being only 5 feet and under. The edge of the sink was about 6 inches away from the edge.
