We were told by the staff at K+K that we had been upgraded to an executive suite without charge to compensate for the inconvenience. When we arrived at the Rockwell Hotel at 1.10 pm we explained the situation and asked if we could check into our room. But we were told that the room wasn\u2019t ready yet and that check-in time was 2pm. I\u2019ve stayed at a lot of hotels and most of the time the rooms are ready to check into when you arrive after 1pm. When we told them again that the hotel we were supposed to stay at was overbooked and that we were transferred to the Rockwell instead and that we expected to be able to check-in, we were very crudely told that wasn\u2019t their problem. Total negligence on the part of the management at K+K George because they should have made sure that our room was ready and if not, they should have told us ahead of time that it might not be.

When I confronted them with their behaviour, all we got was a condescending look and again the response \u201cit\u2019s not our problem\u201d. So much for customer service. So we had no choice than to leave our luggage at the hotel and fend for ourselves. When we eventually arrived back at the hotel around 5.30 pm the staff behind the desk was still acting very rude and arrogant, but our room was ready and we were looking forward to taking off our shoes and relaxing for a bit. Well, if that room was their definition of an executive suite, today\u2019s executives must have low standards. It had one huge window looking out on a busy road with a huge curtain that could hardly be drawn. There was a grubby old sofa that seated just 1\u00bd person with just enough room to plant your feet without hitting the desk. The television was mounted on the wall next to a small spiral staircase that led up to the bed. So no watching television while lying in bed. The upstairs was very close to the ceiling and we couldn\u2019t even stretch out our arms without hitting the ceiling. The bed was uncomfortably low and in the wall just above one of the sides of the bed was an air vent that blew cold air. So needless to say, it wasn\u2019t very comfortable up there. And don\u2019t get me started on the bathroom (for lack of a better word). The shower cabin was just big enough for one person, but it was impossible to lather up without hitting the walls or the ceiling.

It is very safe at day and night. Easy to walk to hide park, noting hill and even to Covent garden (around an hour walk - 3 km). We paid great rate (186 pounds including breakfast). The hotel design is just great! Like visiting a design magazine. The design is chick and inviting and pure fun and look even better that the photos on the website. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The garden outside is just great (pure london style of red bricks and white furniture, again like a design magazine) and having breakfast there was great. I wouldn't take the ground floors room with the balcony - as there is not enough privacy, and wouldn't take the single room as they are very small. Our room was great, and even though it was less than 18m square it was comfy and big enough because of its well design. The bathroom is very small - but again it it designed so good that you just don't feel it. The only minus about it is that in the shower only one person can wash at a time and that the shower head position is fixed which makes washing a little bit annoying however the stream is excellent! Another minus is the bed size - it is only 1.4 m width (probably because they wanted to make the room look larger than it is), but it is very comfortable. Breakfast is nice and quite rich - but they don't provide eggs . They provide good WI-FI internet which is a plus! The hotel was romantic and fun and I would definitely go back again.
