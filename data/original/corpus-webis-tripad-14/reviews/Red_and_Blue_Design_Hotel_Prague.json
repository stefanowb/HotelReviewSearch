The rooms are spotless and very modern (obviously recently decorated) and the bed was one the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in! Our room faced the road so we were a bit apprehensive about traffic noise but the thick double glazing meant that we didn't hear a thing. Unlike other reviewers, we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, check in and out was a breeze and we managed to book an airport transfer with them by email before arriving (it was 1000CZK both ways). Breakfast was very good, they had a huge selection of cold meats, breads, cakes, cereals, juices, eggs, bacon etc which changed everyday. The hotel also has a bar but the prices are high - it's also very quiet which I suppose reflects the high prices. The hotel has free wi-fi and use of a computer downstairs which is helpful when you want to check in your flight before you leave. It is located on the outskirts of town, but like other reviewers said, I think it is better for it as there are a fantastic selection of cheaper restaurants only a few metres away (we ate at the Artisan, Cantina and La Bastille - which were all lovely).

The rooms were lovely - very modern & spacious, with a separate desk & sitting area. The hotel itself is on the west bank, and thus quite a way from the center of Prague, though it is easily reached by a cheap tram ride. This has benefits - some restaurants were far better value than the center of town, for example. The staff, however, were barely above rude. They were continually condescending, and made no effort to provide help. Example - when asked for a local laundromat, they insisted that the only solution was the hotel laundry (at obviously exorbitant prices).

They are SO big you can't really sleep on them. I woke up with a sore neck that nagged me for the rest of the trip...NOT impressed by that. Location wise I'd only say is mediocre. It's probably really nice in the spring or summer but if you are planning on travelling in the winter I'd probably recommend something a bit closer to the main areas of town. It was rather cold while we were there so the 20 minute walk to get anywhere was rather miserable. Also, the cobblestone sidewalks seem to be much more treacherous than a normal sidewalk so be careful when you are walking. Oh, and this hotel is located on a hill with a semi steep incline so you might want to keep that in mind when booking as well. The ice made getting down the hill on the sidewalk an adventure.
