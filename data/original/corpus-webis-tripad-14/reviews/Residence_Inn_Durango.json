The Residence Inn in Durango was the best of a very good lot. We had a friendly reception with a hospitality hour drink and snack when we arrived. We had a two beddroom suite for my wife and me and four teenagers. It had pleanty of room for us. The indoor pool and spa looked wonderful, but being in a winter location we did not bring suits. The wireless internet worked well and was free. The breakfast was ample, with something for everyone. The staff were very good. The only drawback was that it was a few blocks across a busy highway to the train station, but it had much nicer accommodations than the downtown properties.", "title": "Impeccable!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "captainmcd", "date": "March 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 26536985}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed for a week with my kids while in town for a spring break ski trip.

Looks like the only rooms that would have any view would be the 3rd floor, highway facing rooms. The hot breakfast buffet was very good and many more choices than your typical continental breakfast. My only disappointment was the kitchen (which was one of the main reasons I selected this place). We had planned to cook a few meals in to save on some expenses. The utensils, pots and pan selection were limited and very poor quality. So poor that after one use, I didn't try to use them again. And the front desk told me that was all they had.
