You could do it in 10 mins if you were really in a hurry but then if it was really hot the going might be a bit slower. On the way back it is a good uphill walk & the whole time we were there I never once seen anyone walking back up the hill except us. In the event that the hill does prove to much for some then the taxi varies from \u20ac3.50 - \u20ac5 depending on the driver you get. To get into Albufeira just leave reception, keep walking down hill untill you reach the round-a-bout, turn right & keep walking. There is a super market at the bottom of the hill from the resort. At the round-a-bout just look across the road & its there. There is also a Lidl if you get to the bottom of the hotel hill, cross the road & follow the road back up the hill & turn right (car or taxi needed for that).", "user": "rachel2390", "date": "November 7, 2011", "id": 120296256}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Terrible Food And Ignorant Female Reception Staff", "text": "Food: I can't comment on the food as we were staying self catering.

We had a ground floor apartment which was well equipped and very modern. We arrived 10.30am and check in wasn't until 4pm but they did speed things up and our room was ready by 12.30 ish. The breakfast was ok plenty to go around usual stuff salad, fruit and bacon etc.Evening meals were a different matter though, queuing to get in first because our experience was that the food ran out about 8. O clock, but the food was very restricted and never hot! The restaurant was a bit like a holiday camp canteen, queuing again while holding your plates! This is the first time we have gone abroad so late so was a little worried about the weather and oh my god we should have been worried, we had torrential rain off and on the whole time. Out of our 4 days we had about 3 hours to be able to sit by the pool, no one can be blamed for the weather but it does ruin what should have been a well earned break. We had to go with the flow and spent a lot of time in the town centre, which was full of restaurants and bars. There is a free shuttle bus from Eden resort during the day into town which was good but a nightmare to come back as it only carried 6 people and there were about 20 plus waiting to come back which resulted in my pet hate (queue jumpers!!!!). To evaluate, firstly if you want peace and quiet the complex is great but go self catering, there is a supermarket at the bottom of a steep hill. If you want entertainment we can't comment because we had none, it appeared to have finished at the end of the summer. The only place to sit and have a drink was in what appeared to be a kids room with pool table and you had to drink out of plastic. Overall a bit disappointing due to weather and there not being anything to do on and around the complex, but to add some praise staff were friendly and the grounds pruned to almost perfection.", "title": "Accommodation excellent - rest is lacking!!!!!!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "shellandandy", "date": "October 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 143667873}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed here from 16-23rd October and enjoyed our stay. I Would recommend this resort for a relaxing stay in Albufeira. There is very little to do in the hotel if the weather isn't great which it wasn't a few times in the week we were there so we took the free bus into the town. Entertainment is on three times a week in the small kiosk bar which is understaffed and pretty crowded at times. We ended up providing our own entertainment most of the time or heading into the old town to one of the many cocktail bars. The apartments themselves are very modern and well equipped, i cannot fault them. The pool bar closed on our second day and didnt open again which was a pity as we were all inclusive and it was handy having the bar so close. Staff here are overworked and work very long hours, they do need to smile a bit more but they are definitely understaffed. I was disappointed with the food, it is like a canteen, there is little atmosphere in the restaurant and food is bland and repetitive. Snacks however were good. We did really enjoy our stay here and I do recommend the resort for a cheap all inclusive holiday but it wouldn't be 4 star in my opinion. . We had a massage in the spa, i must admit the girl in the spa was very unfriendly and did not make the experience overly relaxing or enjoyable.

The resort is not designed as an All Inclusive resort - the resort was built as properties for sale, and they are obviously trying to recoup some of their costs by offering AI/SC to holidaymakers. The food is OK - all good quality, if somewhat bland, breakfast is probably the best meal of the day with excellent choice. If you're not a fussy eater you can usually find something to eat - and I liked the provision of a microwave to give your plateful a quick blast to ensure it's hot enough. Nice fresh salads and excellent fruit. The AI choice of drinks is also good. The downsides are the restaurant is a bit canteen-like and the bar in the evening is too small - all in all not really enough quality public areas. As we were there out of season the pool bar was closed which would have been a nicer area to sit at during the day - although we often spent time on our sun loungers outside our apartment, which was great. The grounds are beautiful and pristine. Only a 20 minute walk to the old town, and there is a courtesy bus which goes several times a day (which we didn't use) - taxi is only 4 or 5 euro. It wasn't ideal, but we were only looking for a quiet week in the sun and it was really cheap - we paid under \u00a3600 for the two of us for the week!

I think they may turn the thermostat down to save on the heating, but most people dont complain...so let them know right away. The staff were hit and miss. A few were fab, and a few that were very aloof and just didn't seem to care. Internet was a joke. We paid 25 euro for the week, but this was only good for one device. So I wanted to use my device one day and purchased for the day and could not get any signal or connection. We did not go for the all inclusive, but did go for the meals on 2 nights. We paid 15 euro per person each night, and the food was average, good if you just didnt want to go into town. Very close to the beach, and the old town. Easy walk down hill, and a 3-5 euro taxi back up...well worth it. The store is very expensive on the resort. You are way better off going into town as there is a grocery store and you can find everything you need there. The only thing that was a bit of a let down was the pools were freezing. It was very hot, and we still couldn't enjoy a swim. We also found the beds to be a little uncomfortable, but we had been travelling for a few weeks at this point and I dont think anything but home would have been good. Both rooms had A/C which were great.", "title": "Just a few things....", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "melanie b", "date": "November 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 145078893}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012", "text": "Eden Resort Albufeira 5 Star (Per Easyjet Rating) is a joke!!!

The appartments i cannot fault they were finished to a very high standard & i would rate them 5* as for the rest of the resort i don't kno where to begin, the food was awful, on one occasion i had a chicken curry & needless to say it was still raw in the middle, on many occasion they had run out of food & were very reluctant to replace what had been eaten, as for desserts there was lack of choice & most of it still frozen. The bar was very small & had little seating for everybody & you wre waiting nearly 15-20mins to get served for drinks as they only had 1 barman! There was no entertainment & nothing for kids to do & they claimed you couldn't use the swimming pool with out wearing a swim hat in which they then decided to try & charge you for ( the pool was always empty!) The only other option of food was to head into town to a restaurant which was 15mins away, the town was very nice but very quiet due to time of year. Staff were not very welcoming or helpful so i will not be going here again & i'd advised u not to either as i think you'll be disappointed & you can get alot more for your money else where!", "user": "josie f", "date": "November 17, 2011", "id": 120698130}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "nice break", "text": "lovely appartments everything we needed ,it rained most of the which spolt the 5 days we were there ,we were a/inc and had a long walk back to the resterant ,we had no problem with the food ,cos it was raining there was not alot to do ,think you need to hire a car realy and maybe self catering ,were in 112 an it a fair walk in the rain for ur meals ,but i wud go back there again at a sunny time cos it is a lovely place .", "user": "loftus-sharp", "date": "November 16, 2011", "id": 120662326}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "complete chill-out!", "text": "Just got back from a 3 day break at the Eden, what can i say?. . . .went for a chill-out break and that is exactly what we got.

Key card to get in and we were given a key each....which we have never had before. The apartment was outstanding, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms large living area and a very chic kitchen. Fridge, freezer, microwave, dishwasher, pots and pans, plates, cutlery etc all there...Also added bonus of iron and ironing board,..oh and a hairdryer. Because we had a 2 bed we had our own little garden with table and chairs and sun loungers. It wasnt quite the weather for a swim but the pools looked really nice, and there is a little lake where you can feed the fish.......We had the all in option which was great....loads of choice at breakfast. hot and cold buffet plus cereals and waffles......also lunch and dinner there was quite a variety.
