Having missed our connection to Rome, I emailed the hotel and their free shuttle was at the airport right on time to pick us up from another flight. Maria and Gustavo the two front desk personnel we encountered were great. They assisted us with all of our requests and questions and couldn't have been nicer. The room we stayed in was a one bedroom apartment and was more space than we needed, but it was great. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed and even had wonderful bathroom amenities including toothbrushes, shampoo, shower cap and more. Breakfast was unexpected and apparently a new addition to the hotel since we had booked the room. The cappuccino was the best I had in Italy and I loved the pan du chocolate pastries which were served warm and fresh. We left after a one night stay to go on a cruise and looked forward to spending our last night in Italy at the Amelindo Residence. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone who needs to overnight close to the Rome airport. I only wish that all of our Italian accommodations could have been this nice.", "title": "Best hotel stay of our trip", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PRretired", "date": "June 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 164644333}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "My friend and I stayed here one night before leaving Rome.

I had to use my cell phone at a $ a minute to call hotel 2x to find it. The girl was snippy , the second time I called, and told me they sent info in email about shuttle location, but that email came after I had left for Europe 18 days previously- so I never received it. The Rooms are very nice, I had asked for 2 beds and got one. Very large, modern rooms, ours had a huge terrace, sitting area, But probably the smallest opening to the corner Shower I have ever seen! It was laughable. Breakfast was basically continental.heres the problem, I had flight problems and needed to contact Delta and Amex Travel, they have no phone service in the room, there's phones but they do not work. So when Amex travel called me back I had to go to the lobby to get the call. Then they were not happy with me, because they have one line and this was their only phone, so they asked me to hang up. I had to ave them. Call me back on my cell at $1.00 a minute. So a good hotel if you do not need any extra services or have an emergency.
