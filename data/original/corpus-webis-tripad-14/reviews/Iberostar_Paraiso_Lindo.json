And yes the beds were hard, but I had no problem passing out each night and did not have any back problems. The housekeeping was awesome. We had a new animal made out of towels with fresh flowers each day. We did walk to the Del Mar and the Beach which were also lovely, but you could see they were not as new, but the landscaping was more lush, and tropical birds did live on the property, but for the extra money, I prefered eating inside air conditioning rooms. I did not see the Maya, but it was right next door. I am sure it was beautiful, but you do get the same for your buck at the Lindo. The gym was a nice size, but the lack of air conditioning is silly, and almost passed out one day trying to work out around 5pm. But this did not have a negative impact on my vacation. The club at the Del Mar is really for teen agers. Perhaps it was spring break for high school and it is not like that all the time, but it was a great place for kids in that age bracket.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Make absolutely certain the slider to your balcony is shut tight and locked... my daughter opened the door on our first afternoon, closed it, and thought she had locked it -- but the door wasn't quite tight enough and it shut down the AC... we awoke to suffocating heat and humidity in the wee hours of the morning.

We just remembered to write a review while doing our research for an upcomming vacation. So we will spare you a lot of details and just say what a great resort we thought this was. It is the cleanest, most well kept property and although it is enormous when you consider you have the run of the four hotels, it never felt crowded or did we ever have a problem getting a spot on the beach or at a restaurant. We were also impressed with the numbers of specialty restaurants and the fact they have a concierge available at each building where your room is to make reservations anytime of the day.", "title": "Great Beach Resort", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "lpweb", "date": "March 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7252893}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We have no qualms about recommending the Lindo to others, you will have a good time.", "title": "Wonderful", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Kristen007", "date": "March 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7218722, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything, it was gorgeous there.", "disliked": "\u2014 The pools closed at 6:00"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "22 of us went to the Lindo to celebrate my mother-in-law's 50th birthday. My husband and I brought our two kids, age 3.5 and 1. Before I left I read all the reviews and not all were good. I was a little let down by that. But when I got there it was amazing! The place is big, so yes, it does take some walking to get around. The lobby was about seven minutes away, but how often are you in the lobby? The beach was maybe two minutes away and was gorgeous. Lots of beach chairs ensured that everyone had a place to sit. The water was warm, and yes, the beach was rocky in a few places. But you could see them under the water, and they were huge, almost 10 foot long pieces of coral. There was a sand bar out at the end of the swimming area which was perfect to stand on and body surf from. I also read a complaint that the pool water was too cold. Well, when it's that hot out it's nice getting into a cool pool. It wasn't cold, just cool. But once you were in it was fine. The staff was amazing, always there to refill your drink, to get you whatever you need, everything. My kids were too young for the kids group but the kids show was on every night at 8 and everyone enjoyed it. Younger kids are more than welcome to get up on stage and participate. We ate at a specialty restaurant every night and the food was amazing. Eating at the steakhouse was odd because (I'm from Calgary) the inside looks like a log cabin, there's country music playing, you're eating a steak, and look out the \"cabin\" window to palm trees and blue skies. Very funny! This was the perfect place to go for all age groups (1-7, 17-29, 43-50, 72-79).

Actually, i thought those were jokes. I saw so few people when i dined but yet it was difficult to get a reservation. Wave pool for kids was the best part. Lazy river is the laziest and smallest i ever saw and while i tried to laze around, the counselor of the kids club decided to bring the children in to splash and swim - go figure. The rooms were musty and dark. I had a junior suite. The entertainment was practically non existent and juvenile. I felt safe with valuables etc and found staff to be very personable and tended to my needs (shower drain clogged and tv didnt work). Fixed immediately.
