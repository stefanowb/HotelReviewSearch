We were very satisfied with the hotel. We paid $125 for a 'suite' which was actually more like a very large hotel room. There was no 'sitting area'. We had a comfortable double bed with a lovely handstitched bedspread. The furniture was obviously brand new and included a table with two chairs, two end tables a large bureau and a writing desk. It also included a coffee maker, mini-fridge and a tv. The entire room was spotless - including the bathroom. In fact it was so clean we assumed the Inn was virtually brand new. We were also impressed with the flooring which was real hard-wood. The bathroom was very big and included a hair-dryer. The tub was large, the water pressure good and we never ran out of hot water. My only complaint was the complementary shower products given were a bit cheap (ie no conditioner or body lotion, no shower cap and the shampoo did not lather well at all).", "title": "Great find close to the Fortress!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TravelinDD", "date": "September 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 19667679, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 It was big, bright, clean, spacious and right next to the Fortress of Louisbourg.", "disliked": "\u2014 It was a bit pricey for the location."}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We were on the second floor with a less than spectactular view of the parking lot, but we did have at least 6 large windows (including one in the bathroom) that let in lots of light and fresh air.
