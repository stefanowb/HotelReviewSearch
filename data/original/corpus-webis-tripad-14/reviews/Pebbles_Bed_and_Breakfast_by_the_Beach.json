We had five nights this time and we stayed in the Lighthouse room again with lovely views of the beach. Rosemary and Humfrey were amazing hosts and good fun. Breakfast is amazing, everything is so fresh and tasty. It sets you up for the day ahead. Sadly they are retiring from Pebbles but a couple who have stayed there before are taking over in February. We have already book for October next year.
