It started when we arrived and the front desk reported that there was no availability on the 8th, 9th, 10th or 11th floor despite my earlier request. Ahhaaa the front desk man found something...... For $. 50,00 extra per night we could choose for an upgrade to the club member level on the 11th floor. And yes, WiFi was included. In the other rooms you have to pay $. 10,00 (per device!!!) per night extra. We asked for a room with a view and the front desk man found us a wonderful room, he said. We received the key and went upstairs to level 11. There we entered the room. The room was okay, but when we opened the curtains all we saw was another wall. We complained to the front deks and after 30 minutes of waiting we finally received another room. Smaller, no safe (as promised), but with somekind of a view. If you are in a club level room you can make use of breakfast and apatizers and drinks in the evening between 5pm and 8pm. We were very negatively surprised when we heard that my daughter was not allowed in the club member area. The front desk man never mentioned this and I am sure he saw my daughter on ckeck in. Especially since he has three people checked in. Then parking. They very aggresive try to sell you valet parking. Very intrusive they try to pursuade you to pay $. 40,00 per night, \"Otherwise it will still be much more expensive\" they said. When I mentioned that I first wanted to know what my options are, the man became very annoying and and threatened that I should be back soon, otherwise he would remove my car. Finally we parked at the otherer side of the street in a parking near the Hilton. They charge $. 30,00 for valet. There you have no in-and-out privaleges, but who needs that when you are gone all day. I paid $. 10,00 for the night. We had no stamp on our ticket, because the hotel said we did not need that. The man in the parking was very friendly and gave me the discounted Millennium Biltmore price anyway. Tonight I parked my car there again and once again I tried to get a stamp from the hotel and once again they said they never stamp tickets. That is not true because the guy from the parking let me see an example. Tomorrow we will see what happens. When you call the front desk, they always reply with: \"One moment\". Then they leave you on hold for at least 15 minutes. I think they wait till you give up. I forgot to mention their way of \"solving\" problems. My daughter is not allowed in the club lounge where they serve breakfast. So they gave me a voucher for breakfast in a restaurant downstairs. I asked for them (3 vouchers) to slide them under my door. The front desk man promised to do so. The next morning no vouchers. So i went to the club lounge. There I finally received a voucher. I asked for three, since we are staying for three days. No that was not the way to do it, the lady replied. I have to collect my vouchers every day. That is an example of the service level of the Millenniuw Biltmore. Finally the room. Not worth the money. I have seen much better for much less.
