In the past it has always been the Pillar and Post or The Prince of Wales but this year our budget was a bit more limited so we decided to give the Vintage boutique property a try...and it was a very pleasant surprise! From the moment we arrived we felt like welcome and appreciated guests.

The only things we found missing from any other Vintage property was bath robes in the room, room service, spa facilities and an on site bar/restaurant....there is a restaurant but it is closed in the winter. It is considered a budget hotel but honestly we didn't get that feel. We paid the same we would have for a motel type room in Niagara Falls!", "title": "Welcoming, cozy.

Nicki, the receptionist, was welcoming and so very helpful. We were able to check in early. Our room was cozy (small) with a gas fireplace which was lovely. The room was tidy/clean. Bathroom was modern. Closet was very tiny. Due to bad weather we needed to book a second room for family and Nicki came to the rescue. So everything about the Moffatt inn was perfect for us.
