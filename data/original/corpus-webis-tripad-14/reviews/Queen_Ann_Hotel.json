Its quite a new hotel and has most of what you want - very modern furnishings, flat screen tv etc. There were a few disappointments however. We had a suite which was very small but had lots of natural light. There was no attachment for the shower over the bath (which was a spa bath) and that was annoying. Also the neon light was a bit annoying at night right outside the window. Breakfast was OK - a lot of asian style food but some western food also, omlette chef etc. Watch out which room you book as I suspect one or two may not have a window.", "title": "Another 3 star to consider in Ho Chi Minh", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CiaraB", "date": "January 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 53829279}], "location": {"country": "Vietnam", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 11, "very good": 26, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 13}, "slim_ranking": 0.346153846154}
