We had our friends staying in the adjoining room (all junior bungalows are duplexes) and that made enjoying the private pool enjoyable. I think it could be awkward if you did not know the folks in the other side of the duplex. If you are in that situation, the suites in the 400 level should be perfect for you because they are close to the infinity pool. The rooms were huge and the beds and linens were nice. The mini fridge simply does not hold enough beer though . . . . The plunge pool was in great shape and was very refreshing after our scuba diving excursions.

I arrived around 8 pm and had no problems checking in. The front desk staff was friendly and fluent. Transportation is provided for you, to your room and back (the rooms are all on a pretty steep hill). When I got to my room, I immediately noticed that it was in desperate need of a renovation. Some of the tiles were cracking, the sink had rust, and the corners were dirty. Besides the age associated faults, the room was clean and had very high ceilings, giving it a spacious feel. The landscaping outside of the room was very nice, giving it a very tropical ambiance. Now here is the best part; the view from my patio. Phenomenal..I had a shallow beach full of small boats, and mountains in the background about 100 feet away from my bed. It was breathtaking, especially in the morning. At night you could hear the waves crashing just outside your doors, and it was cool enough that I slept with my glass doors open. In the morning, I walked out to the beach from our patio, and then hiked up the trail to the top of the hill for breakfast. The view from the top is also breathtaking. (see pictures). Breakfast was great (included in the room rate), and was buffet style. Dinner the night before was also very good, but expensive by Costa Rican standards. The tour desk is NOT very helpful, I had to find out what tours were available by my own methods and present it to the desk so he could book it for me. Try to have a good idea of what you want to do before you get there, because the tour desk will not give you many options. There are several pools on the property that are also great. If you are traveling to Arenal, or La fortuna from this resort, make sure to ask about the transportation they provide (much cheaper and quicker). Mr Patel (the owner of the resort) was present during my stay, and was very helpful as well. Overall, excellent choice, beautiful views, and non-touristy.

One of the chef\u2019s is Asian and he adds that flair to the dishes which are a work of art when they appear.
