The Management of the Hotel by Irene was superb! She was totally present to us at every step of the Journey. Whether it was changing a light bulb or booking a taxi, or parking an oversized Van, Irene was always accomodating to our Group. The service at the desk, and in the Dining area, was superb. All the staff totally go out of their way to provide outstanding service. We booked for two nights upon arrival in Dublin in advance, and then two nights upon our departure. Coming back after our Journey to Cork, it truly felt like coming home to Schoolhouse. The food and service in the Hotel was so exceptional that we dined there every evening. I cannot say enough about the management of this Hotel. I thank Irene, and Brian, and Zoe, and Indira, and all others who provided such an amazing restful experience!
