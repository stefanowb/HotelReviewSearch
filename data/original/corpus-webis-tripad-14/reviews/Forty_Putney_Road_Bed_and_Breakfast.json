The room was lovely. The bed and linens were very nice and comfortable. Breakfast was very good - awesome waffles one day, quiche and a yogurt parfait the next day. The service and their attentiveness was great too. They have thought of all the details and were willing to help with anything we needed - dinner reservations, suggestions for things to do, etc. Nice jazz music playing throughout the house. There is the greatest little pub inside the house that serves great local beers and good wine. The owners, though young, really have it together. Fun to talk to. This was a great find and one I would revisit in a heart beat.

Sitting in the pub and chatting with Tim was a great way to unwind after our 6 hour drive. The room was tastefully decorated - cozy without being kitchy - and comfortable. The jazz music that was playing on the radio as we entered our room was a warm touch and set the tone for the rest of our stay. Each morning, we woke up to an amazing breakfast (I definitley missed it this morning now that I'm back home) which we ate outside surrounded by the beauty and serenity of the garden. Downtown Brattleboro is about a 10 minute walk from the b&b, as is hiking and kayaking.
