It is very pretty and the people are really nice. The roads are narrow, curvy and you're either going up or down, always! I hiked Mt. Scenery and for this non-hiker, it was tough! There's an entrance to the trail right by the resort. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to get to the top. I recommend wearing the proper shoes and using a hiking stick (some areas of the trail are slippery). I snorkeled with Sea Saba (I'm not a diver). We went to Tent Reef which was a little too deep for a good snorkel. So that was disappointing. I was worried the water would be cold but it was fine. I stopped at Jo Bean's Glass and bought a pretty glass starfish. I also booked a 50-minute massage with the resort. There's no spa there but the resort will bring Sally of Saba Day Spa to your room.

But, our room at The Queens Gardens Resort literally took our breath away. The views from the huge expanse of sliding windows showed a shimmering sea between two mountains with the twinkling lights of the capital city shining below. This suite consisted of a large living room, kitchen, dining room, bedroom, and modern bathroom. All rooms were filled with charming antiques and art work from around the world. The four post bed and the chenille spread were the epitome of romance and made me wish I was on my honeymoon again. Age does have its limitations! The jacuzzi warmed up nicely and had the same incredible views as the living room. Was I in paradise? This seemed pretty close! The pool and bar were lovely with a great view, and the total of 12 rooms in the entire hotel allowed an intimacy that could not be matched. The staff were warm, friendly, and couldn't be more helpful. The food in the dining room was excellent and with the candles flickering and the view before us, we realized how truly lucky we were to be in Saba. All this for $195.00 a night!
