We stayed at mainly 2 to 3 star hotel/B&B, and they are not what you will find in the US! Nothing luxurious, just very basic. Most of the time, none of the furniture matched and looked old. However, everything was always clean and more importantly, no bugs either!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ZKDDS", "date": "February 4, 2008", "id": 13270990}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Anyways, we stayed at the B&B for 3 nights during a 2 week trip throughout Italy. This small B&B was a good deal by Italian standards. The room was huge compared to other B&B was stayed at, and we shared a double room with four adults. The rate was 150 Euros/night or 130 Euros/night if we paid in cash.

It's in Altrarno, or a part of Florence that is south of the river Arno. It's convenient because it's close enough to all the sights (usually 15-20 walk), but then far enough away to get away from all the tourists! After long days of sightseeing, we loved coming back to the Santo Spirito square where the B&B was to just hang out and drink Cava!

We randomly ran into a few people we knew from our hometown of Chicago on S. Spirito square eating at the pizza place directly below to B&B! It was such a coincidence because we knew that we would be travelling to Italy around the same time. We asked them what they were doing in the area, and they said that they were told to come to S. Spirito just to really get a good feel of what normal life is like in Florence for a typical Italian person!

We walked and it took us about 25 minutes, and it was difficult rolling around our luggage on the cobblestone streets. I was very tired, but my mood brightened when I saw the lovely farmers market that was set up on the square! Also, I should tell you that late at night, there were a few shady individuals to watch out for. We consistently saw the same drug pusher every night. This is a common thing in Italy, so don't let it disuade you. He never approached us, and seemed relatively harmless. We are from Chicago, so it didn't really bother us.
