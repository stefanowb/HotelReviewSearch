We loved the room and view but found the extras very expensive. The first morning, we went to breakfast and the buffet was $29 a person plus they tack on 18% plus tax to everything so a buffet breakfast for 2 was $70 plus... Ala carte you could get a bowl of oatmeal for $7.50 or raisin bran for $6-- plus the tax and 18%. We ended up going to a local store and bringing in some muffins, etc. There is no coffee maker in the room and ice has to be brought to your room by room service or housekeeping...We requested a small refrigerator and that was brought to our room. The tips for all these trips to the room add up. There was free coffee in the morning in restaurant entrance area. Others who stayed at the Towers or other property-not the beach club- said they had a small cafe where things were a little more reasonable. Two club sandwiches and 3 drinks at the beach bar were about $75. Also the convention met at the Mizner Center across the water (part of the Resort property) so you had to take either a shuttle bus or boat to go back and forth. It is a beautiful resort but not a good value. We did have a wonderful time but at company expense.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 10, 2005", "id": 4103083}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005, traveled on business", "text": "Even though I was there on a conference and the company paid for the bill - it was definately not value for money.

I had read mixed reviews here so I wasn't sure what to expect. When you arrive at the hotel you must pass through a security gate, where they confirm that you are a guest. I'm not sure why there was such strict security just to gain entrance. If you are driving you must have your car parked by the valet at $20/day as there is no parking facility available. Check in was a breeze and the bellman showed me to my room quickly. I stayed in the towers on the 20th floor. The room and bathroom weres large and nicely appointed with a beautiful view of the ocean and intercoastal. There was no in room coffee maker. I did their stay 2 nights with the 3rd night free promotion. I had dinner at Lucca's restaurant and the food was good, not overly to expensive. The service started off being excellent but sort of waned towards the end. I would expect more attentive service for the price. Drinks here are expensive and will average around $10 or more. I had a Bloody Mary by the pool that cost $14. I had a 16oz fountain soda at the coffee shop and this was $3.20. The hotel charges a daily $18 resort fee that I thought was unnecessary. The resort fee covers such things as a daily newspaper, free local calls and 1-800 access, etc. If you plan on staying oceanside you will need to take a bus or boat shuttle back and forth to the main hotel. Most of the guests staying at the hotel appeared to be affiliated with the conferences that were goin on. While my check in experience was excellent, I had the opposite on checking out. Typically I receive a bill at the door on the day of depaerture. Here it seems that you must come to the front desk and obtain a copy of your bill. On the day I was leaving there were so many others doing the same that the front lobby was chaotic. I called the hotel when I returned home to have my bill faxed to me. There were some things that I thought were overpriced but I enjoyed the hotel/atmosphere for what I was there for which was to attend a conference.", "title": "Some Good, Some not so good", "user": "MERandy", "date": "October 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3992367}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "Yes, it's expensive, but really first class.

The hotel and staff are only a shadow of what they were 5 or 10 years ago. Hopefully, it will turn around but as of November 2005 it needs a lot of work to reach it's previous 4 star status. Our room had ants in the bed causing us to be moved at 11:00 PM by a bell hop who acted like he was doing us a favor. There are no family restaurants. The only one they had, Chaunceys, has been closed. At one meal we waited 5 minutes for a hostess to get of the phone with her boyfriend so she could seat us. Once seated we realized that she only gave us 2 menus for 4 people. When I went to ask for 2 more menus she was talking to the boyfriend again.

I love the elegant historic Addison Mizner old world Mediteranean (Spanish) revival architecture with it's pink buildings, arches, ceramic tiles, open breezeways, terra cotta tiled roof, and wrought iron. That is why I prefer to stay in the old Cloister section instead of the modern tower. It is fun to dock your yacht outide of the dining room with it's cathederal ceilings and explore the grounds. Golf lover's are in luck as there is a world famous golf course. It is well worth the extra $200 to use the spa at the Beach Club. Take the shuttle there from the hotel,rent a cabana and have lunch with your friends or have the excellent $49 seafood buffet dinner.

We traveled over new Year's from Washington DC for a \"relaxing\" five day stay. Not so much. From the moment we checked in, we recieved miserable or NO service at all. The front desk was lacking in explaining our 'romance' package, we had NO housekeeping services, the room service was awful, the spa was just horrid and the concierge was an absolute joke. We don't mind paying more for good service and accomodations but this place was charging for five stars and gave us about two. The whole \"beach front lanai\" room with \"overstuffed outdoor furniture\" was a room that faced the beach, with no lock on the door so that you couldn't walk down to the beach and wire-and-slat chairs covered with bugs. EACH DAY we had to call for housekeeping to come, as we'd return to our room after being on the beach and they'd never cleaned our room. ALl of the package items to be included, were not. The spa menu tells of a relaxing 45 minute pedicure, which turned out to be 20 minutes of a polish change with no massage or privacy. What a joke! My husban's massage was interrupted halfway through because they \"thought\" the time was up! The beach personnel is noplace to be found; we were dragging our own beach chairs around and FORGET about getting someone's attention to order a drink or even lunch. Keeping in mind that they add 18% to EVERYTHING in this hotel, regardless of whether you are pleased. Such a disappointment. No wonder they are no longer on any of the travel/leisure lists anymore. The only positive was Nick's restaurant, where we had dinner one evening. Otherwise, don't visit the Boca Beach Club unless you are prepared to be ignored and treated as though they could care less.

I walked the entire property and I can say that all of the pools are about as nice as a two star hotel. Maybe that wouldn't be such a big deal but there is nothing to do here but lay by the pool or go to the beach. Unless of course you want to pay extra to play tennis or golf.

Hardly. My husband and I have had the fortune of staying at many beautiful places around the world, and have rarely encountered more a case of \"the emporer has no clothes on\" than this. First, for $275 a night (which is a cheaper \"conference\" rate), we are in a \"renovated\" room whose halls smell musty, bathroom tiles are old, cracked, lined with discolored grout, tub is rust stained and chipped and the view is of the HVAC equipment on the roof of the second floor below. The first night, a ceiling light began filling with water and dripped a steady flow onto the carpet. It took two calls to the front desk before someone came to \"defrost the airconditioning unit\" in the ceiling above. I am sure they have nice rooms here somewhere, they must. If you must stay here, make sure you are NOT in the interior Cloister. These rooms should be storage. We are accustomed to paying high prices for things - we live in SF and travel well. But generally expensive resorts will not take to nickle and diming you once you are there - it is offensive. I will understandably pay $16 for a martini in Manhattan or Tokyo, but in Boca? A $5 charge if you want to share your entree? $8 for the bottled water in your room (they will give you a little free one, though)? And if you are in the main hotel, you must take a BOAT over to the beach - I am sorry, but a \"premier resort\" has the beach, which should be a beautiful one (not), at your feet!
