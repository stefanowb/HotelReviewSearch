I found out about Pangkor Island by chance, it's not on the main tourist trail and doesn't really appear in any of the guidebooks. It's a 3hr drive from KL (which was appealing to me as I don't really like flying). I chose Sandy Beach as it looked the newest accom option and had some good reviews.", "title": "Pangkor perfect", "user": "Beckiboo1983", "date": "April 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 105124228}], "location": {"country": "Malaysia", "continent": "Asia"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 8, "very good": 47, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 52}, "aka": "Pangkor Sandy Beach Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.214285714286, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Our new 3-star beachfront resort lies in Pasir Bogak, just minutes away from the jetty.
