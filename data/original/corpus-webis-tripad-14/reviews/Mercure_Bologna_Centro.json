We chose it because of its location directly opposite the railway station where the Aerobus from the airport (4.5 euros each way) stops. It is also a ten minute walk, along the straight porticoed Via Independenza, to the city centre. This road is lined with shops so is an interesting walk. We had a room on the first floor overlooking the courtyard garden at the rear of the hotel. So it was very quiet. The room was also clean and well equipped - mini bar, trouser press, 23 channel TV etc. The hotel does not have a restaurant but there are plenty of restaurants and places to buy take away food around the hotel - and loads more in the city centre. The hotel breakfast (an American buffet) was fine with both hot food (scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages) and cold food including a very good selection of breads/pastries. It's not the greatest hotel I've stayed in. It is not the cheapest - we paid \u00a385 sterling through an Expedia special offer. It's not the best located if your interest is really the city centre. But for us it did the job for a one night stopover. It was nowhere near as bad as some previous reviewers have said!", "title": "A convenient stopover", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "hallyboy", "date": "May 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5069159}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Welcome to hell", "text": "The hotel faces the main station, right around the corner you see drug adicts doing their business and the romms itself are just dirty and old and do not represent the usual Sofitel worldwide standardt", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 5, 2006", "id": 4933750}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Avoid this hotel!", "text": "Stayed 1 night at the end of March. 2006. A very disappointing experience at this hotel and I have big doubt about the SofitelPrivilege Card program. Despite making the reservation online via the Accor website with all my Privilege Card details included and served by the Duty Manager onsite upon checked in (again with my Privilege Card presented and validated), I got NO special treatments nor gifts at all. In fact, a very unpleasant checked in with rude service provided by the Duty Manager. We had to carry our suitcases to our room. I raised my question about those benefits to the Duty Manager after I have checked in the room and she denied any knowledge about the benefits to the Privilege Card Holders and offered a voucher for 2 free soft drinks at the bar as a gesture of good will. Funny enough, all the gifts (water, a bottle of wine, slippers and bathrobes) suddenly appeared in our room when we came back in the evening!
