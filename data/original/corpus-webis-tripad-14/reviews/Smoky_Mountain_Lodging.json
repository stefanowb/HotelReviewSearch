We were travelling across america and decided to hire a car and drive to a cabin for a few days rest and relaxation. The drive on its own was an adventure going through the beautiful landscape and then we arrived at the cabin which was exactly as it looked on the internet. It was clean, homely and had beautiful views. Our cabin had a pool table and a hot tub which meant we got to spend some time relaxing and having fun. The hot tub was on the deck which was secluded enough for privacy but open enough to feel free. Me and my partner have stressful jobs and all our stresses were gone and forgotten when staying at the log cabin. We hope to go back one day.", "title": "A dream come true", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "usabackpacker", "date": "December 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 23100569, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 feeling of freedom and calm"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "before staying at BLACK BEAR LODGING please read", "text": "while staying in the Great Smokey Mts. our family chose to stay at BLACK BEAR LODGING, upon check-in everything seemed to be fine our cabin was just like the picture it even had it's own putt-putt.after spending 4 days here taking in all the scenery and wildlife..including a bear our vacation ended and a whole problem began..shortly after being back and in retrospect we were being feasted upon by BED BUGS. the main bedroom with the king size bed was obviously infested with them . Myself had over 40 bit and both my kids had close to 90. i brought this immediately to the attention of the owner ,BILLY, he waited to respond then after i finally got a hold of him he still put me off for about a week then says his exterminator couldn't find no evidence, there was no sense of urgency,compassion or even concern.his main concern was renting it again.since trying to get a truthful answer it obviously out of the question. i have now had to throw away all blankets,pillows and our king size mattress. what an expensive vacation this has continued to be. i just want people to know especially those who will have kids traveling with them that even when you pay $200.00 plus dollars a nite & your room seems clean and new this can still happen.would i stay there again... NO...because there was no responsibility taken and i don't believe a true apology was given and definitely no follow-up shows that greed over powers good manners.", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "jdoubleDaytonOhio", "date": "September 6, 2007", "id": 8667758}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 15, "average": 7, "very good": 23, "terrible": 22, "excellent": 35}, "aka": "Black Bear Lodging Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.6875}
