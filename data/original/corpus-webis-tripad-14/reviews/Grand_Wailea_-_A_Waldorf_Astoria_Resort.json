The gardens of the hotel are the highlight as they obviously spared no expense in landscaping the grounds. The hotel is a masterpiece. The open air lobby is magnificent and the fitness center is the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel. The problem is you pay a heavy price to stay here and I am not sure it is worth it. We booked our room through an opthalmology meeting that was there in order to get a meeting rate. We still paid 400 dollars a night, plus multiple fees were added on including an 18 dollar a day \"resort fee\" supposedly to cover our access to the swimming pools and fitness center. The food and drink prices are prohibitively expensive. They charged my children 8 dollars each for a frozen lemonade at the pool restaurant. A minimal lunch for 3 was over 70 dollars (at the pool). We ended up eating every meal at restaurants in Kihei. They even charged us 25 dollars to rent a small fridge for the week as the rooms have a fridge, but it is full of high priced snacks and drinks and is locked unless you opt for the \"self service bar\" option. The rooms were nice, but not exceptional for the price. The swimming pools were so cold that it was unpleasant to swim in them. There were no organized pool activities and no drink service at the pools. The beach was great and well maintained. The staff was pleasant but not overly friendly. The nicest person I met there was the maid for our room. They did respond quickly when or toilet clogged. The whole place had an air of pretentiousness about it. I think the only people who can afford it are foreigners who's currency is strong against the dollar. I struggled daily to find a parking place big enough for my rented minivan in the under sized self park garage that was quite a hike to my room. The garage by the front of the hotel is valet parking only. When I return to Maui I will stay somewhere more reasonable as the main attraction to the Grand Wailea is the many pools and its location.

However, if you want to use an umbrella on the beach or sit by a covered area by the the pool you have to rent the umbrella for $35.00/day or pay $50.00 to sit under a covered chair.

The resort grounds make it difficult to venture off the property. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable but do not deserve bragging rights; the carpet could use updating or periodic cleaning. The room views do not disappoint though. The pool and poolside activities are without rival; kids and adults will love the pool and not want to leave; for those 21 and older the Grotto is the place to be. The food and amenities are first rate, while the staff does all they can to see to it that you are enjoying yourself. Overall, the property is world class. However, world class comes at a very steep price. Be prepared for shocking prices, as noted in the other reviews. A modest breakfast for two adults will set you back $50 or so; drinks and snacks poolside could set you back $100; dinner is off the hook, $130 - $200 depending on where you go.
