In hindsight I think I\u2019d have preferred one of the white rooms, as they would be brighter. My only alteration to the darker painted rooms would be a glitzy crystal chandelier to match the d\u00e9cor (something like the ones from downstairs to make the room a bit brighter!). We did have a very leaky shower, but as only one other recent guest mentioned this on trip advisor I think this was just an issue with our one (they perhaps were in the same room!).
