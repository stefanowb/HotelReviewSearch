We went to a pharamcy the next morning and purchased repellent. We then applied the repellent generously before going to bed.

Owners are very nice and helpful. Old town Antibes is a 15-20 minnute walk from the hotel. The beach is just up the driveway from the hotel. If you do travel with a baby, just let the owners know before you arrive and they may put you in an end room like we stayed in so the baby will not disturb the other guests. Also parking is first come, first serve... There are only 5 parking spots so it may be a problem in peak season, wasn't for us though. This was a great little find and very inexpensive (unlike everything else in europe). Another tip, make sure you know what your rental car will cost, there is a steep tax they charge and we didn't know about this before we went, very expensive! Perhaps use other forms of transportation...
