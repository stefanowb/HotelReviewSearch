Location is convenient to the water and to downtown Pacific Grove, with easy driving to Monterey or Carmel. Our room was more than adequate. The shower, as others have mentioned, is a high-placed addition to an antique claw--foot tub. Not the most convenient, but it gets the job done (although a safety bar or two might not be a bad idea). Electric heater was efficient and easily controlled, and the windows opened for ventilation. The parlor area features comfortable chairs and sofa with newspapers and other reading matter. The TV is small and on only when someone wants to watch it. (As noted by others, the inn is not a spiffy, 21st-century luxury hotel; it is more on the lines of a B&B or guest hotel you would find in the British Isles.) Breakfast was more than adequate, fresh and well prepared. A menu offered choice of one entree from two quiches; a spinach, cheese, and mushroom omelette with a small portion of home-fries; oatmeal; OR yogurt-fruit parfait. Also available were orange juice, hard-boiled eggs, granola and another cereal, toast, bagels, cream cheese, butter, and English muffins. Coffee (not bad) and tea available all day. In short, plenty of good quality fare. Wireless worked fine. Staff were readily available, helpful, and amicable.

Having said that, I did have a few problems: We stayed in one of the front rooms (top floor) and there was significant traffic noise, which luckily died down overnight. But there also was a light problem -- street lights shined in through the blinds on our windows and interior hallway lights were surprisingly bright and seeped in as well. I am a light sleeper and had significant trouble staying asleep because our room was so light. I also would recommend against a room on the ground floor as our floor creaked. Finally, although breakfast was good (mainly a choice of several crustless quiches), it wasn't special like in some B & Bs I've stayed at over the years. Nothing I would call gourmet.

Freshly baked cookies in reception together with coffee and tea round the clock and my personal favourite, a chilled glass tank of iced water with mint, strawberries, cucumber etc in it. Very refreshing. The wine hour was incredible! The first glass was very generous as were the cheese, biscuits and crudites. We had a second glass of wine and happily paid $5 each for another very generous glass! They made a mistake and charged me for the room even though I had pre-booked via last minute.com.
