Staff are friendly, but rooms leave quite a bit to be desired. They didn't feel all that secure either. The staff and some guests also decided to have a party when we were there and played some thumping techo till the early hours, the noise from which easily travelled through the thin walls to our room. I reckon if you're an 18 yr old traveller on a tight budget then this would be an acceptable (and maybe even fun?) place to stay. For us it was a bit below par.", "title": "No frills place.
