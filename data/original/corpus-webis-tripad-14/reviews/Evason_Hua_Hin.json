There is no beach during the day (because of the tide) and the town is pretty dull, although modern, from my point of view. However, they got most sunny days in Thailand which is great advantage. Six Senses Hideaway is located about 30 minutes south of Hua Hin, but it doesn\u2019t matter. There is no need to leave this beautiful resort. I have previously stayed with Six Senses Hideaway on Koh Samui (and went there again this time after Hua Hin) and I just love Six Senses for their quality, beautiful design, breathtaking environments and outstanding service. The villas are large and very comfortable with everything you can ask for. Gorgeous outdoor sala, pool area and garden with its lotus ponds. Large bedroom, indoor and outdoor shower plus a floating outdoor bathtub in the lotus pond. The d\u00e9cor is simple, yet beautiful, well maintained and genuine. All modern facilities such as large flat screen TV, DVD, stereo with outdoor speakers, free wifi and tea/coffee making facilities. Plenty of complimentary drinking water replenished morning and evening. Six Senses is an eco friendly resort which shows in both design and function. However, as a guest no comfort has been spared, just carefully well-considered. Here in Hua Hin Six Senses Hideaway share some of the facilities, such as the large beautiful pool, with their sister hotel Six Senses Evason. Although both separated resorts link together and are equally beautiful, I think the Hideaway side offers more privacy, comfort, luxury and personal service. For instance, here each villa comes with a pool and has butler service. The outstanding breakfast is partly \u00e0 la carte. Hideway side is smaller and more intimate. However, both resorts jointly offer excellent dining opportunities (Italian, Thai, Tapas, Gourmet and weekly buffets), a nice bar with live music and 2 different Spas.
