The staff is friendly, helpful and pleasant. I really appreciated the shuttle bus, as it took me to the train station every day or into Old Town Alexandria, which was too far for me to walk. The location is excellent. There is a grocery about a block away which is another option for snacks or carry out food. There is plenty of free parking which appears to be rare around here.

The snack bar was great as well, I was able to get bottled water whenever I wanted. The only real issue I noted with the hotel was the bathroom, it's outdated which made it look some what unclean.

The hotel offered breakfast, which was good, we didn't have to leave hotel to find breakfast. The breakfast was average, typical continental things to choose from, including make your own waffle. The breakfast room had one high chair, we were fortunate not to have to wait to use it, but I could see it being a problem if there had been many toddlers or babies. The hotel also had a snack room which was great. Variety of snacks and juice or water or soda. I would stay here again. It was also close to the airport. It is set back from the street a little, so you might drive by it once. Also, there was a playground a couple blocks away, which was great for our toddler. Also close to walking path right along the Potomac which was really nice.

Alexandria is a very pleasant town in which you can stroll, shop and eat. Crystal City is a short, but circuitous drive away but it has a great selection of restaurants and shops. Parking there is in lots under the office buildings and was free after 4 p.m. Each morning, we made use of the hotel\u2019s free shuttle to take us to the Braddock Metro station. From there it was a convenient ride into downtown DC. We purchased Smartrip cards which are very convenient as you can add money at machines in the Metro stops. The cards aren\u2019t time limited and you can add as little or as much money as you like using cash or credit cards. You tap the card as you enter the station and then again as you leave and the amount for the trip is deducted. We also used our car to go on a day trip to Leesburg to see the Air and Space Museum and then drove back into DC to tour around a bit. This was a mistake as we experienced some major traffic jams. It wasn\u2019t a big deal as we are from a large city with similar traffic, but it was a waste of a couple of hours. Take the Metro! There has been mention of not so nice areas around the Braddock Metro stop and warnings about not walking back to the hotel. We did walk back, up Madison Ave., on a few occasions during the day. It took 20 minutes from the Metro to the hotel. The area in question is a low income housing area and was similar to what you\u2019d find in any large city.
