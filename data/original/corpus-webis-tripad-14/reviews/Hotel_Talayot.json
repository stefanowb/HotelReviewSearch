After reading some reviews on Trip Advisor we were expecting to be met by a flood of walking frames, wheelchairs and walking sticks. There were maybe more older generation than you would expect to meet in a hotel but plenty of people from all age groups, from 2yrs upwards. We were given a very warm welcome by the staff in reception and then made our way to our room. Our room was larger than a lot of 3 star hotel rooms that we have stayed in around the world and the bathroom was of a generous size. The room was provided with a kettle, cups and saucers and spoons, if we had not taken our own coffee with us we could have purchased some from reception, this goes for tea as well and of course bottled water too. There was a television in the room and some people might complain at the size of it, it was a little small, but we do not go on holiday to sit in our room and watch the T.V., What was nice about the T.V. was that a good number of the channels were in English, which is most unusual for hotels abroad. You could hire a safe for a nominal fee, as well as an iron and ironing board. Our room had what you would call a side sea view but it was still a very good view of the sea, from our large balcony. The room was kept spotlessly clean, the towels were changed when we required them to be and the bed linen was changed once during the week we stayed there. The food was of a very good standard, the breakfast was a good selection of cooked and continental style and the evening meal always had a good range of fish and meat, salads and puddings, not forgeting 2 types of soup. Entertainment was variable,of the 7 nights we were there we thouroughly enjoyed 4 of the evenings. Dave Collins singing and playing his guitar, Dejavou a couple one on keyboard and a lady singer, Fallon a comedy magician and an evening of Flamenco. But as we were in a three star hotel we did not expect international cabaret stars! The indoor swimming pool was nice and warm, the outdoor pool was provided with plenty of sun loungers to go round. One thing the Talayot has got going for it is LOCATION, just 50metres from a flat promenade that stretches for a long way. If you do not fancy a walk along the prom. why not hire one of the bikes, 2 or 4 wheeled, that can take from 2 to 6 people. There are peddle go-karts for the children and also all manner of push along carts for the younger generation. There is a well marked bike lane, so remember to look behind you now and again. I can understand the older generation using the Talayot as they get well fed, well looked after and probably feel right at home, as we did. The staff are very friendly, efficient and most helpful, keep up the good work Talayot, we will be back.", "title": "Great Location, good service, will return", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "mickeyjune", "date": "June 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 112892256}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We knew what to expect from this Hotel, and yes it does have a predomitably older clientele, but I prefer a quieter resort and don't want 'kids clubs' and a heaving modern hotel.

The food, as with a lot of places has to be rotated into different meals each day, financially I don't suppose there is any other way it can be done. All the food was hot, fresh and if you didn't like something, there was nothing to stop you going to get something else. I personally like having a set table, and I'm sure if you weren't happy, Gregory would be more than happy to move you. The downside, for me was the entertainment, if you don't like bingo you've had it!! DJ Tony does his best to accomodate everyones musical tastes.
