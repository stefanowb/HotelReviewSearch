Big seats next to the bunks, big segregated bathrooms and nice big kitchen. I do a lot of sightseeing so I'm not one to hang out too much, but there is a very friendly crowd going thru the hostel, but never rowdy. The lockers were located in the back but very few poeple were using them, the hostel has such a welcoming, homesy feeling. You're only one bus or a 45 minute walk away from downtown but a mile north of the hostel is a rail stop that'll take you anywhere. Powell's Hawthorne branch is just a few blocks away and worth a visit.

The hostel is in the Hawthorne district, which is full of eclectic shops, and it's also close to the Belmont district. Good restaurants there. All walkable.
