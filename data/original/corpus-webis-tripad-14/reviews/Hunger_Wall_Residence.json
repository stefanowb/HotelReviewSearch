I was able to cook my baby's food since they had everything, except from a blender that I brought myself. They provided an Ikea baby's cot, much nicer that the usual travel cots. Staff was great and Gabriella provided us with all the information that we needed. She is a very kind and helpful person. They came to clean every day except Sunday. I found it great! The location was great for us. Very near to all the main areas. They also have the tram super close. I I came back to Prague I would stay in that apartment again for sure.
