The nearly 250 year old house and gardens were lovingly restored and are impeccably maintained. The location and views unmatched in Annapolis Royal. No detail too small; everything exuding a tremendous amount of style and warmth. The bathrooms new, towels thick, linens soft, bed firm, paint fresh, rugs clean, furniture period appropriate yet modern and uncluttered. Breakfast each morning was delicious - fresh, organic (much of it from their own garden). While there are many inns and hotels that are beautifully decorated, with wonderful views and attentive staff, they do not have the soul of the Bailey House - a true testament to Greg and Rich. The website pictures while accurate, actually do not (cannot) fully reflect the inn's warmth and charm. Greg and Rich were always present and sincerely attentive, but never underfoot. Per their direction (and accurately drawn maps) we had a wonderful time touring the area and have memories for a lifetime.

Wonderful hosts, excellent breakfasts, lots of good advice for places to eat, drink and visit. The house is old, and is not one of the pretty Victorian mansions, but has warmth and charm while retaining the feeling of a very very old home. We had one of the front rooms, and I recommend reserving one of these.

Greg and Rich have restored the 18th century house with style and warmth. The two front rooms have fantastic views of the river and gardens, both tastefully furnished with not a piece of frilly lace in sight. Breakfast was terrific and suggestions on things to do and where to eat were right on target. Sipping a cold glass of lemonade while sitting on the banks of the river in the late afternoon was the perfect way to relax after a day of sightseeing.

The innkeepers, Greg and Rich, are extremely hospitable and catered to our every need. The inn is a wonderful 1700's inn that has been beautifully restored and decorated in period furnishings perfect for the house. So many B&B's are decorated with \"grandmas leftovers\", but not the Bailey House. They have done a wonderful job of keeping this inn true to the period. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in and the night we spent there was our best night's sleep on our 2 week vacation. The breakfast was outstanding. We cannot say enough good stuff about this place.

The proprietors, Gregory and Richard, were extraordinarily gracious and helpful, without being obsequious. They provided us with excellent breakfasts in the gorgeous dining room. The Georgian period house has been lovingly restored and decorated and is a romantic and cozy place to stay. We stayed in the Marm Bailey room which provided views across the Annapolis Basin and into the town. Annapolis Royal is a beautiful place to visit, and the Bailey House made it even better.
