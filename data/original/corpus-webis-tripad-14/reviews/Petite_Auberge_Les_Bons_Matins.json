We spent wo nights in luxury suites (502 & 601) to celebrate our anniversary. There was a mix-up with another guest so we did not have the same room both nights. We are flexible so we were not unduly bothered; they were apologetic and adjusted the rate, also. Loved both rooms. If you really love having natural light, one of the lower-level rooms (eg 502) probably isn't for you, but in winter or for some people it won't matter and the room was just lovely. The many photos on their website really do give you a good idea of what to expect with each of the rooms we booked. We found both beds quite comfortable. The whirlpool tubs really only fit one person comfortably, but because both of ours were basically in the living rooms, it made for some humorous and delightful socializing even while bathing. We enjoyed the funky, eclectic, colorful and cheerful d\u00e9cor. There were amenities in our suites we did not use (music system for DVD's, TV).
