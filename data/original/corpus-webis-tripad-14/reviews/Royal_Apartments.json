The rate was 580 Kn a night for a large apartment with 2 queen beds, kitchenette and nice bathroom. The location was fabulous, a very very short walk from the gates to the Old Town, and next door to a bar, internet access point and bakery. My hosts were extremely friendly and warm. While the husband didn't speak much English, it was more than adequate to show me the features of the room and point out key locations to visit. His wife did my laundry, a large load, for just 10 euros! Overall, a fantastic place with very nice people for a great price.

The pick of the apartments are the front ones facing the harbour. Anna Maria and Marko are charming and helpful. We did not have a toaster in the apartment and asked Anna Maria if there was one we could use. Within a short time Anna Maria had returned with a new toaster for us. The apartments have each have a small but functional kitchen. As we were there in early April the town was very quiet. This meant no crowds but also meant that many cafes, restaurants and shops were closed and the town lacked a bit of atmosphere. Still it is a beautiful place and well worth a visit. The only (slight) negative about the apartments is that the staircase is noisy when walked on. Our group used 3 rooms and there were no other occupants at the time so not really an issue for us but could be a bit of disturbance at night if fully occupied. However there was no street noise and the apartment is not a backpacker style place so this is a very minor thing and does not detract from the overall appeal of staying here.", "title": "Lovely apartments in great location", "user": "Chook14", "date": "April 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 105743500}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed two nights at the Royal Apartments and were quite pleased with our accommodations.
