It is true luxury. Not pretentious like most big chains but gives you a seance of elegance yet casual and very comfortable. The villas are well appointed and the service is amazing. The pool in the two bed room villa where we were staying, is great as you can do lengths and exercise as well as chill out. I spent time at the gazebo reading and listening to music which is connected through the main system. The kitchen comes in handy when you dont feel like going out and just want to make a salad etc for lunch.The staff is amazing and the villas supervisors are very helpful. You like coconut...we will get it for you, cut it, pour out the water and make you feel special. The highlight was the massage we took every morning, in the villa. I had mine in the gazebo which was amazing. The therapist are well trained and professional. We stayed five nights but could easily do another few. The location is great as its not to far from the restraunt's and Main Street of semanyak.

We had to check at noon but did not fly from Bali until midnight. We could not get a late check out but the manager invited us to come back to the offices at 9 pm for a shower before the flight.

The butler service is great, breakfast cooked for you each morning in your villa, with a few different choices. A couple of small things that would have made the stay even better, the umbrella isn't big enough to provide shade for both the day beds a bigger one would be good, a pillow menu would have been good as we found them too soft, and the coffee wasn't that great.
