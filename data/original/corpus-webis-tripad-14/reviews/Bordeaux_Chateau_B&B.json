They recommended Chateau Bellevue. It was the most pleasant surprise of our trip. It is a totally renovated 19th century chateau totally surrounded by vineyards. They actually have their own tiny vineyard in front. The rooms were spotless and impeccably decorated with an eclectic mixture of antique and very contemporary furniture and art. The rooms ran from 100 to 120 Euros and there was a lovely dinner, with wine, available for 30 Euros more. The owner and host, Petra, is from Germany and could not be more welcoming. She made our stay the highlight of our trip.
