The rooms are close together and nearby public paths (like sidewalks) so you cant leave the windows open over night. The rooms had AC though. The pool was nice, albeit small and deep. You could not relax in the pool without treading water or holding on to the side. The various patios were great for relaxing on chaise lounges in the sun. The owner and staff were attentive -- the service was excellent. Visit Santorini Mou for an incredible meal in Oia -- Mikalis is a great host and you will have a blast listening to him play the guitar. Also eat at Momma's Cafe in Fira for a great breakfast (try the blueberry pancakes).", "title": "Picturesque and Hospitable Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "capturedplanet", "date": "September 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5832367, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Service", "disliked": "\u2014 Large amount of stairs needed to climb to reach/leave the room"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent 2 very memorable nights at the hotel in September.
