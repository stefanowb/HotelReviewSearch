The hotel is just outside the old city.

The hotel has its own parking, under the building and the cost is reasonable (22 euros a day) and there is street parking around it, which is free overnight.

It was to be our treat to a nice hotel and we weren't disappointed. We had a twin room overlooking a beautiful old church. The room was really big and the staff we exceptionally helpful. We didnt eat at the hotel at all as there were so many lovely patisseries in Strasbourg for breakfast. They organised a tour for us at short notice to the old convent and the Alsace region which I would highly recommend doing, there was only 5 people on the tour and the guide was amazing. The old city is within walking distance and there are heaps of amazing restaurants too.
