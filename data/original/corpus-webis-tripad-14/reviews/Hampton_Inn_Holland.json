Our second floor room was immaculate and had a nice size balcony which overlooked the indoor pool area. Stairs near our room led directly down to the pool area, which had a game area. There was both an indoor and an outdoor jacuzzi with views of a landscaped pond. Even though our room was off the pool, it was extremely quiet. The beds were extremely comfortable. The location was conveniently located near main attractions. The staff was very helpful in recommending several restaurants and giving us directions to the beach. The complimentary breakfast was quite extensive and good. The free wi-fi was fast.

Cleanliness is very important to me, and I have never been in a cleaner hotel in my life! A nice touch is that on the bed is a duvet that they launder after every guest. so no worries about a dirty bedspread that someone else has used. The room and furnishings looked new - beautiful tile floors in the entry and bathroom, granite countertop, large 4-drawer chest of drawers in the bedroom area and 2 night stands with 2 more large drawers. All the doors were 6-panel, including the closet. A comfortable chair and ottoman were also in the room, along with a desk and office chair.

Our room was excellent, very spacious, with a generous bathroom. Large shower with no tub, which was perfect for my husband, who has some disability issues. As tall folks, we appreciated the higher counter in the bathroom. Our only issue with the room was the loudness of the fan, which we were using as white noise, as the hotel was full of families in town for a youth baseball tourney. There was no low fan setting, so the roar was a bit much. Also, the king bed had a queen top sheet. Hampton's very lumpy duvets need to be replaced soon! We often take out the inner comforter and just use the cotton cover.

We stay in Holland but in addition to downtown Holland, we spend time in Saugatuck and visit friends in South Haven. The reason we stay in Holland is because of the hotel and the fact that it has a restaurant/bar which up to this visit we always enjoyed. There were usually business travelers and locals who frequented the bar. After a busy day shopping, we would go down to Sharkees for a glass of wine before retiring. This trip there were few people in the bar. They have a \"Happy Hour\" from 4-7 PM. During this time, a 16 ounce beer is $2 and a mixed drink is $2.50. Time and time again, patrons would come to the bar and ask for a beer. The bartender would ask if they wanted a 16 or 20 oz glass but never mentioned that the 16 ounce was $2 and the 20 ounce was $4.50. No signage at the bar - only at the tables. In addition, the young bartending staffs drinking friends took over the bar and discussed how drunk they got last night and how many times they threw up. Not a nice top for a restaurant/bar.
