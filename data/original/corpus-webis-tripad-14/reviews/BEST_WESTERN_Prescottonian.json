A beautiful town and very friendly people but the stay at the Prescottonian was jewel of the trip. Starting with the staff, I have never felt more welcome at any Hotel/Motel in my entire 61 years. The rooms were spacious, well appointed and comfortable. The beds were as good as my own and each bed had FIVE large pillows. My only want was for my 60\" HDTV but I suppose that would have been too much to ask for. The Wifi worked great after a young lady at the front desk came to my room set it up for me when I couldn't quite get working on my own. The free breakfast was great also and it was as complete a meal as I have ever wished for. Eggs, bacon and sausage, biscuts and gravy, orange and apple juice, fresh cinnamon rolls and cerel with milk.
