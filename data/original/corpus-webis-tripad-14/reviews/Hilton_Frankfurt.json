On the first, we were given a terrific room called the Hoover suite, which was beautiful, very clean, had a great bathroom and a fabulous view, especially beautiful at night. The room was very spacious and we decided to have dinner in and did not regret it; it was delicious. On the second occasion, we weren't as happy because the room, instead of having a window to the exterior with a magnificent view like I was expecting, had a window to the inner foyer of the hotel, which was very strange because I always felt like it wasn't very private and we had to keep the curtains closed at all times, day or night. This was very disagreeable. But I liked the hotel so much the first time around that I'll rate it only considering the first stay.
