Having said that, if you go expecting a good 4* hotel you won't be disappointed. The good points = beautifully decorated; decent size rooms; fantastic location; and, good quality food. The bad points = poor pool side service; shortage of beach loungers; some bathrooms look old/tired; and, some staff were a little 'indifferent' to our problems. Overall highly recommended if you go with realistic expectations.", "title": "Not 5* but still very good", "user": "sjwoolnough", "date": "August 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 170395264}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "After having stayed in the Ile Rousse a number of times we were all very disapointed on this occasion and hope that it was just a one off.", "title": "Going Downhill", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Petalpuddle", "date": "July 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167265715}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "It seems like they are going through hard times.
