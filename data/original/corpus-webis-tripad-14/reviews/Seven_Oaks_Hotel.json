You could walk into the centre of town in about 10 minutes I\u2019d say however we took taxis as it was raining which only cost about \u20ac5. The food was AMAZING! We had breakfast brought to our room both days and ate a meal in the restaurant, the portions were generous and the food very tasty indeed. The resident\u2019s bar was open until quite late which was handy for a cheeky night cap!
