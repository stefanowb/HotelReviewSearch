The owner couldn't have been more helpful and both rooms were extremely comfortable. The house is large and very nicely decorated and the extensive gardens are quite beautiful ... obviously a labour of love. Breakfast was delicious with a good variety of juices, smoothies, cereals, fruits and of course \"the full Scottish\".
