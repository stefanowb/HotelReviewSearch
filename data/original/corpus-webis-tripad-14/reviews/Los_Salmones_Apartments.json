The holiday started off on a bad note as first of all the private taxi transfer we had paid for was in fact not private at all. We had to share a minibus with about 8 others even though we had paid extra for our own 4 seater taxi. Anyway got to the hotel and were a bit taken aback by the presentation of the hotel. Found out that they did not have us down as all inclusive. Then found out that even though we had specified a triple room we were given a twin room with not enough space for a 3rd fold-up bed. So one of us ended up sleeping on the sofa for 1 week. Next day called the travel agent in England to complain which fell on deaf ears. Anyway the all inclusive was sorted out so we just decided to make the most of it. Once we got over the initial shock we had a great time. Staff were very friendly and chatty. Beach is only about 5-10 mins walk and easy to find good spot. Shops & nightlife same distance. We were 3 girls and did not feel afraid to walk back to hotel at 3-4 in the morning, very safe. China white is a good club to go and you get free entry and buy one get one free drink - which you get in most bars/clubs. Beware though if you have a late night flight as they won't give you the room for few extra hours even though we offered to pay. We had to check out by 12 and our pick up was not until 11.30pm!! Even after all that we didn't want to come home by the end. Great for young people just out for sun bathing and fun.", "title": "We had an excellent time !!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Haylse", "date": "March 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7193857}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not bad for what we paid", "text": "Having read some of the previous reviews, we knew this was going to be a fairly noisey hotel.
