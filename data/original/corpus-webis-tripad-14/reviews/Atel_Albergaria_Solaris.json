The hotel is in a great location for walking to dinner, shopping, sight-seeing, and even beaches if you walk to the ferry and go to Troia (you can see dolphins from the ferry!). The rooms are simple and comfortable with A/C and refrigerators and the bathrooms have shower/tub combos. The staff is very polite and professional. Breakfast was quite diverse and included fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs and of course, breads, from 7-10am. There was quite a lot of TV in English. The hotel is right on a plaza where young people hang out at all hours, that with a lot of traffic noise makes it hard to sleep, if that kind of thing bothers you like it does me, with the window/doors open, but with the windows closed and the A/C on it was no problem. We made a joke of our very large room key fob and called it our gas station bathroom key. We really loved the Albergaria Solaris and would happily stay there again.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 22, 2005", "id": 3025381}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Setubal and the area arround", "text": "I spent there 3 weeks, and it was really amazing!
