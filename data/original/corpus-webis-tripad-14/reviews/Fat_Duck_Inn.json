Manager Richard makes the place hop. Richard will likely contact you a few days before arrival and then again on day of arrival to narrow down your specific plans....he wants to be sure to be there to welcome you! He will offer to carry your bags, then invites you to the kitchen for general information and a (large) glass of Walla Walla wine. He has lots of opinions to share and is glad to hear yours, too. We stayed in the room on the second floor, which was huge. The bed was comfortable and there was a sofa and a chair for relaxing. We enjoyed our wine on the nicely landscaped patio. We were traveling with another couple and took part in the winemaker's dinner offered most Saturday nights. This was excellent. They seat a maximum of 20 people so book ahead. You do not need to be a guest of the Inn to book. Most of the dinner patrons were non-Inn guests.

We will definitely stay at the Fat Duck Inn again and can't wait to return. All of the people we met were so knowledgable about their wine and very friendly. Richard was very helpful.
