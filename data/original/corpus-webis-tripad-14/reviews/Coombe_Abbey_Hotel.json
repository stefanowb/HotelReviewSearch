SPOILT ONLY BY THE STUPID ACTIONS OF THE HOTEL STAFF WHO RANG THE POLICE TO SAY THERE WAS A RIOT!!!! GOING ON.... I think the wedding couple have been treated appallingly by the hotel ending up with the groom spending the night in the CELLS!!! and i would never recommend this hotel to anyone i know in the future signed ww from wordsley", "title": "wedding disaster", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "william w", "date": "April 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 127738288}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I recently attended a weeding at coombe abbey and i could not fault the staff/service, everything from start to finish was fantastic and a good day was had by all so you can imagine my amazement when i came to write my review on seeing the above comments.", "title": "These reviews must be made up!!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "valmorgan94", "date": "April 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127721620}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I also attended a wedding of a relative there last year and again everything was perfect.", "title": "\"nightclub bouncers\"", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "william w", "date": "April 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 127714941}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I wonder are all the above comments from the same wedding and is this some sort of attempt to claim compensation.

We will surely be back next year and every year after that!! Its confusing that other wedding couples could be treated in a different way to how we have always been treated at this hotel.
