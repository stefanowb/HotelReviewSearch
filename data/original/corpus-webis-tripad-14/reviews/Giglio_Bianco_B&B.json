But the best thing about this B&B is the incredible service that is provided by Edoardo and Varnia. They go out of their way to help make your stay in Florence as perfect as possible. From the time we arrived from the day we departed they treated us with kindness and were so helpful in making the most of our day trips with tips and directions. Edoardo even phoned a reservation for a bike tour we wanted to do. They are such wonderful people and I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else the next time we come back to Florence. Also, don't miss the opportunity to have Chef Varinia cook you a specially created dinner just for you. I saw reviews of her dinners and decided to give it a try. Wow!

Host Varinia and Edoardo really try their best to make our stay as comfortable as possible. They provide a short introduction of Florence as soon as you arrive, some useful maps and tour books for your review and will make museum and dinner reservations upon request. Drinking water is available at all time. We tried the 5 courses Tuscany dinner prepared by host/chef Varinia, the experience was like enjoying a homemade cooking in a romantic restaurant, we totally love it. During our stay, I accidentally broke one of the windows in my bedroom, Edoardo's first reaction was if I were ok, and then calmly told me not to be worried (I still feel bad at this moment). When we came back to our room in the afternoon, the window was fixed and my room was spotless clean, no trace of any broken glasses at all. This incident shows just how caring and how professtional they are.
