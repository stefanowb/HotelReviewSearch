The location of the hotel is excellent in that it is in between Soho and uptown,has a number of affordable restaurants nearby and the subway is very close. The rooms were clean and the beds comfy. The staff were helpful especially the day we left where they organised a town car to pick us up for a very early flight which was cheaper than a cab and much nicer with less hassle. If you are looking for an afforable option in New York that is clean and above average without breaking the bank then this should fit the bill.

Anyway I we thought that the noise would be too unbearable and so went to reception to see if we could change, bearing in mind the hotel was very busy, it was no trouble at all to change rooms. We moved to a room on the 9th floor to the side of the hotel which was much quieter again the room was small but lovely inside - comfy bed , vey clean and the shower in the bathroom was huge with a normal shower head and a second 'rain effect' shower head.

The rooms and other hotel areas are decorated nicely and looked very up to date. Our room was smaller than expected, although not the smallest, according to the floor map hanging by the elevators. It was nice for a short stay, but I would need more space for a longer stay. There was no closet to hang clothes (just a rack on the wall where you could hang a jacket or two). There was an iron, but no ironing board (as there is no room to stand one up) so I had to iron my clothes on the bed. We were on the 6th floor and found there was noticeable street noise but I slept fine with ear plugs. The bed was not particularly comfortable - this is probably the one thing that really bothered me. The location of the hotel is good - subway stations are within a 5 minute walk and there are lots of places to eat in the area. We made reservations directly on the hotel website and the price we paid was very reasonable. Other hotels we looked at were 3 or 4 times the cost. There is somewhat of a view of the Empire State Building from the 10th floor lounge, but I'm not sure if there are any rooms that offer a view.
