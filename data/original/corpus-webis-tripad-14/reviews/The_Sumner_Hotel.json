The staff were very helpful - they even arranged theatre tickets for us. Nothing was too much trouble. The position of the hotel is great, close to the busy shopping precinct of Oxford Street and close to the peace and fresh air of Hyde Park. Plenty of restaurants, cafes & pubs nearby. Also the Odeon picture theatre just around the corner in case you want to sit down for a couple of hours rest and catch the latest movies. Of course the Marble Arch tube station is very handy.

This hotel is small but I liked the ambience. The room was not big but spacious enough for us. It was clean and comfortable. This is important for me. The availability of free internet access and elevator was a bonus. I avoid hotels without elevators due to luggage concerns. The shower facilities were good and toiletries supplied nice. We liked the availability of ironing facilities and hair dryer in our room. The reception staff was friendly and helpful, which we appreciate. It is so close to the Marble Arch underground station and we had no problems visiting sights in London. Being Muslims, food is a concern. But Edgeware Road has plenty of small Middle Eastern restaurants and is only a short walking distance away so food was no problem. We felt safe walking the streets around this hotel, and having Starbucks and Sainsbury's around the corner is also great. My children had no complaints while we were there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to visitors to London. I certainly will stay in this hotel again. Getting a London Black Cab was easy. So transport to the airport was no problem.
