A lovely, elegant yet comfortable decor penetrates everywhere, from the salon at the hotel's entrance (perfect for receiving friend's before an evening on the town), to the salle a manger where a delicious breakfast is available, to the rooms, of which there are maybe two dozen. We had two rooms on the fourth floor, arranged in a sort of suite, because we were four: my wife and I, and our children, 12 and 13. We were extremely comfortable, in every way. Air conditioning was efficient and unobtrusive. Bathrooms were lovely, uncluttered, and immaculate. We were on the street side but the double-pane windows kept it quiet as a Bentley. The staff -- in particular the three young men who rotate at the reception: Brice, Mathieu and Sebastien -- were attentive, extremely courteous and anxious to be of assistance. Though I speak fluent French, I often heard them speak English to other guests and on the phone, and their English is very good and can make Paris a lot more serviceable for those who do not speak French. One evening I asked Mathieu to make a reservation for us and some friends at a restaurant in the neighborhood -- 7 people in all. To my astonishment, he walked to the restaurant, spoke to the owner, and picked out the perfect table for us. Taxis, theatre tickets, tours, packages, recommendations -- I recommend they be relied upon, and I know they relish the opportunity to serve. I must say, also, that we were fortunate to be introduced, one day, to the owners of the hotel -- an exquisite, charming couple whose presence and conversation were a pleasure. They decorated the hotel, they selected the staff, and they have infused the hotel with their taste, knowledge and spirit. And the location? Get on your Google Earth or GPS and take a bird's-eye view. The heart of the heart of Paris: St. Germain-des-Pres, between the gorgeous Luxembourg Gardens two blocks south, the boulevard St. Germain two blocks to the north, and all around a classy neighborhood with a calmly vibrant nightlife, wonderful restaurants, shops and sites -- everything we wanted to do with the children in walking distance. This will henceforth be our home for our yearly trip to Paris. It should be yours.", "title": "Perfect Hotel in the Perfect Location", "user": "Jopebi", "date": "July 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35524427}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009", "text": "My adult daughter and I spent a week in Paris in June. The hotel Odeon St. Germain was just wonderful. I had booked an executive twin but they upgraded us to a jr. suite at no extra charge. Our room was at the top of a spiral staircase. Very quiet with blackout shades; a plus in the long days of June. The staff was so accommodating with dinner reservations and all. Also, the location is perfect - about 2 blocks from the Odeon metro, walking distance to Notre Dame and the Luxenborg Gardens (our favorite) with lots of cafes nearby. Tip: if you have trouble with stairs ask for a ground level or street facing room. Otherwise there is no way to avoid the narrow spiral staircase for at least some of the rooms.", "title": "An oasis of tranquility and elegance", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lizg718", "date": "July 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35456676}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed in this hotel for three nights in mid-July 2009, and I loved it.

Went off of Tripadvisor reviews, and feel sure I did the right thing. Close to Carrefour Odeon 4 M\u00e9tro line, Perfect for a morning jog in Luxembourg gardens and on the Isles. Shopping withing walking distance is great - Rue St Sulpice & Blvd St. Germain are both superb, Le Bon March\u00e9 is walkable, too. We took three rooms, double, executive, and single; if you can spend a little extra, go for the executive, although all three were great, and spotlessly clean. The beds are on the firm side, which we like. Double-glazed windows, individually controllable a/c. If you rely on internet/email, make sure you bring your computer - I believe they have wireless in the rooms for free. We didn't bring the computer, so had to use the one they had downstairs, which was rather slow and unpredictable (also, that French keyboard...) The buildings's bones are old, so don't expect a Hausmanian grandeur. Breakfast (downstairs or in your room) was optional, and, although not a bargain, still a great idea if you're in a hurry or can't face ordering yet another grand cr\u00e8me/viennoiserie.

I honestly can't recomend this hotel enough. Our room was of a good size, on the first (second for non-Europeans) floor. I was worried that there might be some street noise, but Rue St Sulpice is surprisingly quiet. In every direction from the hotel there is something interesting within a few blocks. North you have the Seine and Notre Dame, East is Blvd St Michel - with some excellent bookshops (in English!), South is the Jardin Luxemburg and West is St Sulpice itself.

The hotel is also a 5 minute walk to a very reliable and safe metro. The rooms were a good size and graciously appointed. The rooms were also spotless. Housekeeping did an outstanding job each day and when we would return to the room; it would look brand new. The concierge was particularly helpful. We were able to arrange several excursions and met our every request. There were absolutely no issues with the hotel the entire time that we stayed. It was truly a perfect getaway.
