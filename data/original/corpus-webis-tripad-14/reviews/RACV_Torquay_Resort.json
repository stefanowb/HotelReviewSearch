We had a premium ocean view room. Upon arriving in our room there was a note acknowledging a birthday with wine and chocolates which was a very nice and unexpected touch. The room was very spacious with a nice little area to sit and watch the ocean as well as a very nice balcony area. We had dinner in the \"Number One\" restaurant which was near perfection. The quality of the food was fantastic and our waiter, Christopher was amazing, we would take the 2 hour drive from home just to go there for dinner again. Only hiccup we had was at breakfast the next morning. We were seated for breakfast and given orange juice with tea and coffee to follow. Unfortunately the wait for the tea and coffee proved to be a long one. We had actually finished our breakfast and had to ask for our tea and coffee just before we were about to leave. Maybe this should be offered on seating rather than the juice as I would think most people like to start with tea/coffee.
