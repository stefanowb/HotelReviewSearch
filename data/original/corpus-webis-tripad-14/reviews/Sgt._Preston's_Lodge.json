Our room was huge--lots of space and a very large bathroom. Our room was very recently remodelled and was very clean and quiet. The location is right in town, walking distance to the shops, etc. Free internet is available in the hotel office, and there is free parking outside. The room was a bit pricey ($135 for a double) but we felt safe and comfortable.", "user": "WBinBC", "date": "August 8, 2006", "id": 5579885}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Off beat, but very OK", "text": "This is a fun place with good, clean, large rooms. It's older, but being upgraded to very good standards. The only problem I had was that although I had email confirmation of my reservation, they didn't have it when I arrived. Sagway is a busy town and if they had been full, I would have been in a jam. Make doubly sure you have a reservation.", "user": "fredcarl", "date": "September 15, 2005", "id": 3906234}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Sgt.

The folks who own/run the establishment were extreamly helpful when we needed anything or wanted information. Our room was clean with easy access. They have a great mascot named Brodie who greated us upon our arrival. Sgt. Preston's Lodge has a public computer so you can make reservations or check your email or you can walk 1/2 block to the library. The lodge is located within walking distance to everything, or they offer shuttle service to the docks or airport. If we were to go back we would definately stay there again.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 13, 2005", "id": 3899661}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Alaska Hospitality", "text": "The room was clean and average size.
