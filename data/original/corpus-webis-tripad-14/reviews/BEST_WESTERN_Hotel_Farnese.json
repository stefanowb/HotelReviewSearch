The room was very big and comfortable and the position of the hotel was very convenient for having quick access to the motorway. The hotel is a bit far from the city center of Parma, but this was not a problem for us, since the schedule of our trip was to travel all around the area with our car. The breakfast was very good, with a very big variety of options, including delicious local products, like prosciutto and Parmesan cheese. The hotel restaurant was also convenient, with a bit small portions though...

We were of course attracted by the low price. I normally prefer a 4* Hotel outside the center to a 2* hotel in the center. But next time I might opt for a hotel inside the center. The hotel is about 40 minutes walking distance from the center of Parma - so I would only recommend to those who have a car. We were assigned a room on the main floor next to the elevator. Unnecessary to say that our sleep quality was not very good. The room was ok, but nothing special. there was a balcony showing against a wall, the bed was a pull-down bed, never seen before in a hotel. Due to this fact, the lights on the bed table didn't give you enough light to read. Furthermore the main light was not working, which meant we had to go ahead with only 2 small lights. The bathroom was nicely furnished, but that was it. The shower curtain was disgusting and also the shower was not as relaxing as it promised to be. but the biggest problem was, that there was a lot of noise coming from the bathroom due to other rooms flushing toilets or having a shower.
