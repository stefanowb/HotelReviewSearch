For my sister's birthday we took a trip to the universal parks (Universal studios, Islands of Adventure, City Walk) and we decided to stay at this resort. What a great property this is. The convenience of staying at a property that is literally walking distance to the Universal parks without having to worry about parking is fantastic!! You park your car in the hotel parking lot, and you can either walk or ride a small taxi boat (free of charge) that drops you off right in the middle of City Walk. The boats come & go every 15 minutes or so... so you're never waiting too long to take one. If you don't feel like waiting for a boat you can always walk back & forth on the walkway that follows the route that the boats take. The room we stayed in was VERY comfortable. The breakfast was great!! (Try the hawaiian pancakes!! hahaha) They offer a breakfast buffet if you're really hungry.

We went into rides where the wait time was listed as 60 minutes.... We got in the express line and we were on the ride and out within about 15 minutes. It's like you're getting some kind of VIP treatment. Being a Florida resident and a frequent visitor to the theme parks around the summer time I know that Orlando in the summer is when the parks are most crowded with both Florida residents and out-of-towners. Being able to get on a ride in that short amount of time is phenomenal! Another great thing about the express passes is you can keep them even after you've checked out. The room keys have your name & dates of your stay shown on them so if you are planning on going to the parks for 2 days but you're only staying in the hotel for 1 you can still use your room key as an express pass on the 2nd day... even if you've already checked out of your room.", "title": "Loved the Express Pass system, didn't love the slamming doors", "user": "kcou", "date": "July 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17769242, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Using room keys as Universal park Express Passes", "disliked": "\u2014 Constant door-slamming"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Overall this was a great experience!

We swam at night, and the kids loved the water cannons. Afterward, we went upstairs, picked up dessert and soft drinks, and headed to the room. Our room was a little small. There was not enough room to keep our big suitcase open which was frustrating. But the rooms were clean and decorated nicely. It also featured a Keurig coffee maker.

When we arrived at Disney's Port Orleans at 11 AM, we were given our rooms right away although they were not connected. No matter, there was only 1 room between us. When we arrived at the Royal Pacific at 11:30AM which was well earlier than check in, we were told that although our room was not ready we could use the pool and facilities. No problem, we were early. My cousin was notified by 2 PM that her room was ready, but because the kids were having such fun at the pool, we decided to wait until I also got the call. At 3:45, my call came and we both went up to redo our check in. Although we requested rooms close to each other, the hotel insisted that we needed to be in different wings. Then after talking to a manager, we were given the same building, but different floors. Finally, we were given the same floor, but at diffent ends. It is quite surprising that a hotel with 1000 rooms cannot accomodate such a simple request. I really did not feel that my request to be close by is unreasonable or over the top. My cousin got to her room and her beds were not made. By this time it was 4:30. We were assured that by the time she walked back, the room would be finished. The managers (plural because we got to speak with 3) could have easily remedied the situation by finding us closer rooms. Again, they have 1000 rooms! They could have comped us a drink at the bar or an icecream for our kids and it may have made the situation more bearable, however, all they did was give us a glassy look of \"there is not more I can do\". The rest of stay was fine. Nice amenities. It seems though that everyone has their job and do not do more than that. A tissue was on the floor outside of my room when I arrived.
