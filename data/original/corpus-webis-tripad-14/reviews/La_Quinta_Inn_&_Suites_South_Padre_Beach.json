Its end location provided a level of privacy not found at some of the other beach locations. However, and this is a big however, the location does not mediate their customer service--the worst I have ever experienced on SPI, even worse than the mediocre level of customer service found at your typical La Quinta. This property advertises itself as a \u201cresort\u201d\u2026beach location, free breakfast, and a cheap beer box wine \u201chappy hour\u201d does not a resort make. The only beach service which the city of SPI allows to service the La Quinta due to a new beach permit policy elected to stop providing service because of the \u201cslow\u201d season. We had to resort to having a beach service provide us umbrella and chairs if front of an adjoining hotel approximately 200 yards away. The hotel staff was not even aware of how guest could get beach equipment and they weren\u2019t aware that the service had stopped. When I advised the on-duty manager about this she said, \u201cOh, that might be a problem, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to fix that.\u201d Well, I can fix it\u2014book at the Sheraton!", "title": "Location great, service mediocre", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "sanantoniopete", "date": "October 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10093376, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Total Lack of Customer Service"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The Laquinta South Padre Island \"Resort\" advertises itself as a new hotel - new maybe a couple of years ago, but it is clearly showing it's age.

There are two VERY VERY slow hydraulic elevators. The center elevator also serves as the house-keeping elevator so you stop at every floor to let a staff person in thru the back elevator door. The one on the east end is quicker because it is only used by the guests. There are icemakers on all four floors, but only one was working at the time, and was usually empty. Washing machines were broken on the third floor and 4th floor hallway AC was out of order and HOT. Parking is difficult and although there is a large long parking lot, when the hotel is full you have to park in the fire lane. The parking lot is very long making your haul to the room very cumbersome, although they do have a golf cart to shuttle people to and from the front door.

I originally started out on the south side of the building, which overlooks a 1960\u2019s nasty looking building. I was then moved to a room on the north side which had great views. The balconies are very shallow and hard to navigate. Each balcony has 2 cheap plastic chairs which had broken backs. The balcony doors are hard to lock, mostly because the strike plates are rusted and the doors are cheap. The beds are horrible and flatten to 1/3 their original size when you lay down. The pillows are cheap and provide no support and in my opinion need to be replaced. During my first night the AC system was leaking condensate water onto the floor and it smelled like dank mold, fortunately I was moved then next day. Also 3 light bulbs were out and this made the room dark at night. Being there with two other families they had similar problems with their rooms; broken patio chairs, ceiling fan did not work at all, phones did not work, sink drain stopped up.
