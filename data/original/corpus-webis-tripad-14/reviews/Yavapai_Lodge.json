So, we booked a room at Yavapai East (in 'Market Plaza') for three nights in July '06. We were pleasantly surprised. Our room was comparable to a stay in a nice Holiday Inn, Courtyard, etc. Our room appeared to have been renovated fairly recently and had a nice king size bed, mini fridge and air conditioning (one of the few properties at the canyon with this amenity---being from FL, we sure like to have A/C!). We stayed in Building 4, which was right near the shuttle stop. Having the free canyon shuttle nearby was a plus, but we actually enjoyed walking around the area as it is so beautiful & peaceful there. Nearly every day we saw elk or deer roaming near the woods of our property. Our room was located on the back side of the building and had a nice view of the woods (vs. the parking area). We ate at the Yavapai Cafeteria a couple times and it was not bad and had a wide selection of items at decent prices. Also, there was a nice general store and bank right across the parking lot from the Yavapai Cafeteria where you could buy groceries (including fresh fruits), souvenirs, toilettries or whatever. We were able to buy several items (soda, milk, water, yogurt, etc.) and store them in the fridge in our room for snacks and breakfast. We also ate at the Bright Angel restaurant and The Arizona room (nice views of canyon from the restaurant) and felt the food was good at both, though prices a bit high. Though some might feel it is a bit more convenient to stay in 'Grand Canyon Village' area vs. 'Market Plaza' (they are located about 1 mile apart----not a bad walk of about 25 minutes and much less w/the convenient shuttle), we felt our stay at Yavapai East was wonderful and the canyon itself is spectacular.", "title": "Good location, even though not on rim", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "Tampa_FL_Girl", "date": "July 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5515156, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Helpful staff, clean rooms, good value, convenience to shuttle", "disliked": "\u2014 No canyon views from property"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "We were very surpised at the quality of this lodge.
