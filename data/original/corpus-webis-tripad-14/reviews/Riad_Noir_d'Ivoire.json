The weeklong stay at Riad Noir d'Ivoire included well-planned excursions to the market for shopping and street dining, a camel trek, and a chance to explore Morocco's night life. A friendly guide was sent when needed, a courtesy cell phone was provided for each room for emergencies, and reliable taxis were arranged every step of the way. Although we couldn't speak Arabic or French, we got by as one of the drivers spoke a third language, Spanish. The entire staff was willing to bend over backwards to accommodate all requests. Everyone smiled and seemed to enjoy the role they played in extending hospitality. The design of the rooms was to DIE FOR! Much better than ANY hotel. The owner, Jill, was very much hands on with the guests and saw to our every need and desire. The manager, Damien, also enhanced our experience with friendly suggestions of how to best enjoy the city. Shout out to the staff that became part of our \"family\" during the stay: Aziz, Miriam, Butta, Muhammed, and all the others.

He's very well behaved but some hotels and their guests can get a bit put out by such a young guest. I needn't have worried. The staff are as wonderful as the other reviews have already indicated and go above and beyond the call of duty to make you feel welcome. The rooms and the decor are fabulous: like something from a film. Many thanks once again to Jill & Damien he are such great hosts.
