This motel should be branded under the Four Points name so Starwood customers know that this is a lower end Starwood motel. Shower has no water pressure. You have to flush the toilet multiple times.

For the money (or for just a few more dollars a night which would be worth it) you could stay at a much much much nicer hotel.

The moment we pulled up, I was very impressed with the valet staff. They were quick with our bags, and very knowlegable about the area, hotel, DW, and US. Once we walked in the lobby, I loved how bright and airy it was. The front desk agent was very nice and check in was rather quick. The pool area is very nice with lots of lounge chairs, a nice bar, cool fire pit area, and water slide! However, the rooms, that is another story. You can instantly tell once you get off the very slow elevator that this hotel is a work in progress. The rooms are ok. The bathroom area has a very weird set up, with the light switch being on the outside of the bathroom door. The vanity area was recently updated and nice with plugs on both sides. The bed was very comfy but I wasn't a fan of the \"down pillows\" but hey that's me. I don't like squishy pillows. Our room was a street facing room and did have a little balcony, which was nice for fresh air. Overall, our experience was nice until our last day. We decided our last full day to take advantage of the pool. We ordered lunch from \"Joe\" at the bar and he seemed very annoyed to take our order. I had to confirm with him which 2 sides I wanted with my burger and he never asked how we wanted it cooked. My boyfriend and I assumed they cook all of the burgers to the same temp so we took our place at our lounge chairs. About 15 min later, he came over to tell us our burgers were 3 after the ones currently on the grill because \"the burgers are frozen\" ok...TMI...we didn't need to know the burgers were frozen. The food here ok, nothing special, but does hit the spot. The bar staff seemed irritated by everyone, and the drinks were rather weak for their price. We did eat in the restaurant one time and our server was very sweet! Oksana? I can't remember her name but it was an Eastern European name. She was very attentive and made sure we were happy! Kudos to her!
