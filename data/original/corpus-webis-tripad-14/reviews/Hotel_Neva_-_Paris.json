Lots of shops, cafes etc in the area - we did not fancy paying the hotels price for breakfast but found five or six perfectly good alternatives within minutes of the hotel. The rooms (we had two twins) were quite a good size for central Paris, clean and everything worked. While nothing to write home about, the hotel is perfectly good for a short stay at the price and we had no real complaints. But equally it is pretty ordinary in terms of facilities and quality; our cleaners forgot to enter our room on one of the days; and when I sought some help regarding a quick internet search to confirm which airport terminal I needed to go to when leaving, the hotel desk was more interested in selling a taxi service to me - so overall an \"Average\" rather than \"Good\".
