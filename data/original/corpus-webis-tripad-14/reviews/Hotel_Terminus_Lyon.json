The major advantage that it has is its location. It is directly opposite the Gare de Lyon and so is ideal if the stay is in connection with a trip by the TGV to many destinations in the South of France. Even nearer is the entrance to the Metro and RER station giving quick and easy access to the whole of Paris and the banlieue. The Bastille Opera (the cause of a number of our visits to Paris) is a short walk away. From a gastronomic point of view, this is not the best of Parisian locations (although Le Train Bleu - the railway station restaurant up the belle epoch staircase from the main station concourse, NOT the eponymously named buffet directly beneath it on the ground floor - is well worth a visit, both for its cuisine and for the beauty of its dining room). However, there are a couple of perfectly serviceable brasseries nearby that keep the sort of late hours that operagoers need (the one directly under the hotel is ideal if your fancy is for a gut-busting Alsatian choucroute!), and the public transport links make easy trips to temples of gastronomy elsewhere.", "title": "Convenient location", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Freischutz", "date": "November 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6174656, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007", "text": "We picked this hotel because of its proximity to the Omnisports Bercy and the railway station, having read the reviews on this site.

We were travelling as a family with 2 kids aged 15 & 12. Picked this hotel because we only had one day in Paris (travelled from Dublin with Ryanair to Beauvais). I have to say that this was an excellent choice,not only for cost but also the position. We paid \u20ac132.00 for a quad room which we felt was good value. The room had 2 large double beds and a bathroom with double sinks. The room was clean and the bathroom was spotless. After an effecient check in we threw the bags in the room and planned to go sightseeing to make the most of our one day. Our room was facing the street but there was very little noise, even at night. The lady on reception was excellent, gave us maps and advised us how to get to certain sites the best way..we actually walked to Notre Dame from the hotel as it was quicker! Notre Dame was beautiful, candle-lit with xmas hymns being played. We also managed to climb the Eiffel Tower and go to the Louvre (free entry on Tuesday nights).", "title": "Excellent Service", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "wheelman", "date": "January 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6615324, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The personal service", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "After Hotel Foch overbooked and sent us to this place we were a tad reserved on our way there as we had no clue about the hotel...", "title": "Great Location, good breakfast!", "user": "jazz1450", "date": "September 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8831023, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 Slightly outdated rooms"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just what we needed", "text": "We were pleasantly surprized.
