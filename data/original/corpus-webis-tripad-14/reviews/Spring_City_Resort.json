The last time we stayed was June 2006. A very elegant hot spring resort located at a hilltop in Beito Area. Every staff member greets the customer in a friendly manner and willing to assist the customers in every way. The rooms are spacious and have stunning views of Beito city. Every room also features a bathroom appointed in Kuang in stone. There is also a hot spring soaking tub in every bathroom. Again, the bathtub is constructed in Kuang in stone. The only complain that I have is that the room needs urgent renovations.

Outstanding separate communal (and private) hot spring spa with outdoor covered hot spring, hot and cold plunge pools, sauna, steam room, communal showers (extra charge applies). In the Beitou area of Taipei. Also a fine outdoor patio swimming pool and adjoining snack bar, excellent restaurants, bar. Rooms all feature private stone hot tubs, emphasize the hot.

However I would warn against the taxi driver's who even though were waiting outside the hotel did not know where we wanted to go (my partner is Chinese so language was not an issue) even when shown the written address. We later found out that we had been ripped off by this driver as he had driven us half way around Taipei to get to our destination which could have been reached in half the time. Fortunately when we complained to the hotel about it they were good enough to refund most of the excess we had paid.
