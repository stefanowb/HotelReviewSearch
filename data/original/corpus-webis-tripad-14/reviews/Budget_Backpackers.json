We had a double room (sadly no double bed), which was very clean and in a quiet part of the hostel. The toilets and showers were always clean, and the breakfast was cheap and adequate (although be warned, they really pack up quick at the end). Give the muffins / pastries a miss though - they're dried out and not too tasty. We were there during the Edinburgh Festival, so the whole place was buzzing and yet we could still get a great night's sleep. Everything was within easy walking distance, and the friendly staff were great for directions when needed.
