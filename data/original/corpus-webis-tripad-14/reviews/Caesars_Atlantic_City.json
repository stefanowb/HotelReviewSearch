We were in the older section (Temple North) of the hotel (someone said it was originally a Howard Johnsons hotel). Our first room was spacious but had no window; I felt like I was put in a back room. We requested another room and they kindly assigned another room on the same floor. It had a window but the view was of a rooftop with HVAC units and the side of another building. The room was a decent size but had a very small bathroom. Next time, I'll pay the higher rate or stay elsewhere. Aside from the room, they have great restaurants and casinos. However, when will Atlantic City go to total nonsmoking in the casinos?

Okay, so the room prices are a little more than the other casinos ... but you save $5 right? WRONG. There is a $5 'room booking fee' added. Nobody could explain what this was to me except for the fact that it is a non-removable charge. The fact that I booked through the website that claimed they did not charge a $5 resort fee was pretty funny, considering anyone who books a room at Caesar's will pay this $5 room booking fee.

However, while I was there I noticed that all the fountains were turned off for cleaning on the first day I was there making it somewhat less spectacular.

I visit AC frequently, but this was our kids' first time. ( two daughters ages 9 & 7) Obviously, this was not a beach trip since it is December, but our expectations were to have a nice time shopping and eating and strolling ( weather permitting ) around the boardwalk and hotel. I am a Total Rewards member, but planned to gamble just a few hours in the morning of departure. I made the reservation at Caesar's because of its proximity to the shopping and ocean front views. I thought the $209 rate was a bit steep for essentially an offseason double room, but could not determine from the website if suites were available, which is our preference when traveling with the children. We arrived around 2pm and waited nearly 40 minutes to check in despite there being about a dozen people in line ahead of us. There were four clerks for the diamond club check in and two for regular guests. Of those two clerks, they would intermittently disappear or stop checking in guests to talk amongst themselves. There was no sense of urgency or welcome to the process. When we checked in, we asked about suites availability to give our children their own space but were told nothing was available. The clerk explained that the website does not show the suites unless they are available. While we signed in, we overheard the people checking in next to us being upgraded a room upon request. Our room was in the Centurion tower and we had a cityscape view. It was a nice size, clean and comfortable, but located in some corner lock-out area behind a heavy hall door that led to the room door. It happened to be raining throughout the day and evening, so we did not go outside of the casino/hotel the first day and night. The hotel does not have a game room and the pool was not open, so two strikes against the kids having fun outside of watching movies and playing games in the room. We had lunch in one of the restaurants in the Pier area ( Continental) and dinner at the Morton's steakhouse. Morton's does not have a kids menu, but you can order off the bar menu for them to keep the overall meal cost reasonable. We learned the next morning that the breakfast buffet is not open during the week, so that dinged our breakfast plans. We departed late morning the next day and while we have no complaints about the actual room, I don't think I would return to Caesar's with OR without the wife and kids. The confluence of odd little missteps ( no shower caps, room service order without enough utensils, odd staff interactions ) suggests that not only is there a lack of business savvy to offer family friendly amenities during a holiday week, but an indifference to the kind of experiences they would want their guests to have away from the tables and slots.", "user": "Farmerica", "date": "December 29, 2011", "id": 122223935}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "You can find better places to stay", "text": "We booked thru expedia so maybe we got the cheap room.
