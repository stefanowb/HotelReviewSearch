Our room looked as expected, so no surprises there, but I noticed that the AC unit was very noisy, although it seemed bearable at first. It got noiser without cooling the room at all, and later, water started spurting out of the vents.

This room was connected to the adjacent room by a suite door, and the walls were paper thin. We could hear every word from the people in the next room\u2026all the loud music, party games, TV, drinking, etc. each night. It was horrible! Also, every ten minutes we would hear this loud BANG! We finally figured out that it was from all the other visitors on our hall coming in and out of their rooms, and each time, the door would bang shut as loud as ever. We also tried the restaurant next door called Casablanca\u2019s after reading other reviews on this site. This place was THE WORST. The hostess tried seating us at a dirty table, the waitress was rude, the food was terrible, and to top it off, they added gratuity to a party of two!!

Cons: Rooms are a bit cramped (the ones with 2 beds at least), closet smelled of mildew, and room keys are on a dated system (we got locked out at 5am and had to wait 30 minutes before we could get back in due to problems with the system).
