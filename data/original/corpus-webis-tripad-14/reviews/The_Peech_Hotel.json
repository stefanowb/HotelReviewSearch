The room was excellent, restaurant was nice and overall styling of the hotel was great. Location also good - within easy reach of various shops and services. My only gripe was that there was no hot water when we arrived (early evening) and it hadn't even heated up in time for me to shower before dinner, despite the fact that I'd asked them to switch it on manually. We had been on a long trip travelling through Madagascar and that day had a particularly testing one. BELIEVE ME, I was looking forward to a hot shower and was pretty disappointed when the most luxurious place we stayed in all trip managed to fail in this basic regard. They were apologetic and told me that they have some eco-friendly water heating system, which is all well and good, but if you're in this market charging this kind of money then guests have a right to expect hot water whenever they arrive at the hotel.
