We reserved a studio for 50 Euro a night and they booked us in the Jardim I (the older building) and it was dark, smelly and just disgusting plus the location is on the out skirts of town, far away from the center of town. We asked the very rude receptionist if she could move us and she said they had nothing else to offer so we left. I would not board my animals at this hotel!! We then spent two hours trying to find other accomodations in the area. The 3 star ratings in the Algarve are not equivalent to a 3 star in other areas that you travel. I would recommend staying at the 4 stars in the Algarve. Luckily, we found the Alagoamar hotel for 60 Euros, a 4 star hotel that was only 10 Euro's more and was perfect!", "title": "Not a 3 star - beware!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ROSEOC", "date": "June 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3550414}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Algarve", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 0.884615384615}
