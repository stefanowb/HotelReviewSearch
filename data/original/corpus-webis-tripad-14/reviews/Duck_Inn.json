We wanted a relaxing weekend away from it all with a view of the ocean. The property is beautiful and peacefully located far off the beaten path. It's on one of the higher points of the island with wide, distant views of ocean and the lighthouse. The 2nd floor maximizes the view. The house decor is shabby-sheik...as if put together from yard sale finds...but is so incredibly warm and comfortable...no worries about putting your cup of coffee down! The quirky duck theme adds a sense of humor and guests are so well cared for. We stayed over Memorial Day Weekend 2012 for two nights, were pampered to an extreme and left entirely relaxed. We loved the bird feeder frenzy every morning, the rabbits in the yard & breakfasts to die for. We considered returning this Memorial Weekend (which is what reminded me to finally write this review), but we're headed to NYC.", "title": "Relaxing and charming...", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "kekeman", "date": "January 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150789503}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Elise was warm and welcoming.

The Duck Inn is a beautiful historic building set among fields, woods, and dry stone walls, with wonderful views of the ocean and lighthouse. The interior, with passive solar design, is charmingly furnished with vintage pieces that were selected with love and often humor. And yes, it's clean, notwithstanding the third review below! Elyse, the innkeeper, gave us a warm, generous welcome and quickly became a friend. Her organic breakfasts were delicious (try the fresh fruit crepes). Aquinnah was our favorite part of the Vineyard, with its magical light and its openness of sea and sky. We're definitely going back.", "title": "Warm welcome, beautiful rooms, stunning location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Rosalind S", "date": "November 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146143631}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Quirky, magical, breathtaking views, relaxed vibe", "text": "Short, beautiful walk to best beach on the island. This eclectic inn with breathtaking views is one of the last vestiges of what island hospitality used to be. The end-of-island sea breezes eliminate the need for summer air conditioning while efficient passive solar construction and a Rumford fireplace in this 200-yr old house provide cosy comfort in winter. Charming innkeeper provides best breakfast with local produce - worth the visit. This is a Bohemian experience, more like a home stay than a hotel stay.
