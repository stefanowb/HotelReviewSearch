Also, most guests are independent travelers. We did not encounter any tour groups. The hotel restaurant is excellent and cheap. We had a semi-deluxe room, which was small but adequate. Bathroom was fine, lots of hot water. The air conditioner was loud and it took the staff a day or two to get the temperature right. Beds are hard as they are everywhere in China, but housekeeping put a quilt underneath the sheet for us. Service is great even when you can't find anyone who speaks English. We booked by sending Wendy an e-mail from the hotel website. She arranged our stay, and an excursion to the Jinshanling part of the Great Wall for 150 USD. Do arrange for an airport pick-up, about $25 to $30 USD. It's more expensive than a cab but you won't risk the driver not knowing where the place is.

The hotel is down a small alley lined with little stores and restaurants but is off a busy main street lined with restaurants and shops and lots of taxi's to take you where you wish to go. The subway is a short 10 minute walk from the hotel and will take you around the city even cheaper and as fast as the taxi's. The hotel was beautiful and comfy. Our room looked out over the gardens and the bed was very soft compared to other beds I have slept on in China. Free internet was a plus also (computer in the room). We only ate at the hotels restaruant for breakfast (a nice blend of Asian and Western food) for about 60 RMB.
