The location is superb (right in the centre of the medieval La Cit\u00e9), the rooms we had were roomy and well appointed and the welcome we received was delightfully warm and friendly. One of our rooms had a charming courtyard and the other a rooftop terrace with an excellent view. Our tiny kitchenettes were well-stocked with all the necessary food and equipment. This is the very antithesis of a standard chain hotel. Our experience was thoroughly enjoyable and, indeed, unforgettable for all the right reasons.

There are beds for 4 with a large bathroom, small kitchenette, dining area, and a lovely terrace with table and chairs. Our wonderful host, Nicole, keeps the kitchen stocked with basics so we could make our own breakfast. And in venturing down to the old town we found the wonderful bakery Croc en Stoc where we could pick up delicious quiches and salads to go for delightful little dinners on our terrace, as well as fresh croissants for our morning petit dejeuner -- at half the price and better quality than any of the sandwich shops within the old city walls. The room is basic and the whole place in need of a modern update, but it is clean and very comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.

The location inside the walls is fantastic and allows you to explore the Cite during the quieter times when the bulk of the day trip tourists have left. Nicole suggested a late night walk between the walls which is a must to absorb the atmosphere of the Medieval city. We stayed in the blue room which had its own little balcony.
