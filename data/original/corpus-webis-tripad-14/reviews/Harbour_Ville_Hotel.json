The only plus points I can think of was the bathroom, which was newly renovate.

The furnishing of the room was basic, but both the bedroom and the bathroom were clean. Breakfast is included - don't expect it to be from a first class restaurant, but at least it's hot (as long as you get there before 9:30AM) and not bad for the room rate. It may be slightly out of the way, but several bus routes have stops just steps away from the hotel. On one side of the hotel is a church, and on the other side is the Canadian International School. If you have a room facing the street you will hear heavy duty trucks passing very early in the morning, but that didn't bother us. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.

You can take busses from there to the MRT. Takes about five minutes. If you want to connect to the net in your room, you need to borrow a modem from the front desk which is chargeable by the hour. They have about four to six modems. So sometimes, you may not get the modem when you need it.
