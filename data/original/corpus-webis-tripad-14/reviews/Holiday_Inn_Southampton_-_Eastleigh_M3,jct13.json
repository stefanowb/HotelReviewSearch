With that I was abruptly told that the hotel was full and there would be no upgrades available. This was irritating as I had checked availabilty the previous day and there was plenty of space, but I then re-checked and discovered they were in fact telling the truth. No drinks vouchers or wine in the room was received as I often do in other hotels in this chain.", "title": "Very Functional", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Gags", "date": "October 31, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10467304, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Leisure Centre", "disliked": "\u2014 Check-in Staff"}}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 56, "very good": 92, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 82}, "aka": "Holiday Inn Southampton-Eastleigh Hotel Eastleigh", "slim_ranking": 0.2, "description": "The Holiday Inn Southampton-Eastleigh is located between Southampton and Winchester in the heart of Hampshire, with easy access to the M3 and M27 and ample complimentary car parking.
