On this particular visit we stayed in the lodge but we have stayed in 2 of the cabins, 4 of the lodge rooms, 1 rv site and tent sites over the many many years. My observations are...I think the staff has become jaded by previous guests who did not behave themselves and it has effected staff service for eveyone. There are some real safety issues that need to be addressed and taken seriously and not just passed off as someone who wants a free room. There are also very small changes they could make that would make a world of difference. Finish painting the patched drywall in rooms before you rent them, fix the draperies that hang there, clean the windows, address all of the dangerous slip hazzards by the pool, put local art in the rooms or have themed rooms, put hooks up on the back of the bathroom doors and other locations around the room so you don't have to hang damp towels on the lamps, chairs or the bed and try and find a better way to offer internet. On the bright side, the grounds are absolutely beautiful, the entrance and lobby are very inviting and of course the hot spring pool is the reason we go although it really needs some attention.

While the grounds are still beautiful and the pools OK the front desk staff is horrible. We arrived on Labor Day as most people were checking out, planning for a relaxing evening at the end of long holiday weekend. The next morning my husband was reprimanded by the lodge front desk clerk as he was going to breakfast. He tried to walk into the front door instead of the side door and she told him she was just too busy to deal with guests like him...hmmmmmm, seems like without guests she would not be getting a paycheck? Later we were lectured regarding towel usage and I overheard the same front desk clerk berating a cabin guest for trying to trade in a dirty towel. Seems like it can't be a big surprise that white towels might get dirty camping or even staying in the cabins. The front desk clerk refused the towel and charged the poor women $2 for a new one.

The resort seems to function on a shoestring staff. They appear overwhelmed and stressed at times which may make them a bit curt.

Although they have added and remodeled cabins and increased the number of RV spaces, perhaps decreasing the number of tent spaces, there has been no improvement to the restroom/shower facility in the upper pool area. It seems to me that with all the money that has been spent to increase rent-able space that there should also be money spent to accommodate the increase in guests using the pool and restroom/shower facilities. They are dirty, worn and unsafe. There are always pools of water all over the dirty floor with no mats to raise one out of the dirt and water. As one guest pointed out when we were in the restroom, if someone were standing in the water and used their hair dryer or curling iron it could be very dangerous. My friend slipped and almost fell from the water on the floor more than once. They really need to have more than one sink in the restroom so more than one person can use it at a time too. I am sure that the restrooms are cleaned in the morning but in the summer with heavy use they need attention more than once or twice a day. I will say that when we reported that someone had put a lot of paper towels in one of the toilets and on the floor they sent someone to clean it out right away even though the maintenance person had gone home for the day by that time.
