It's proximity to the main train station, local bars and restaurants was great, plus it was only a short walk down to the main shopping area. The staff were very helpful, and spoke really good English. The breakfast was excellent, and the bar/lounge/garden area was very trendy. The rooms were small but adequate (had a minibar, fan, and the bed was comfy) , the only only improvement would be cleaner carpets in the rooms, and the walls were scuffed. Overall a very good stay and would recommend it .", "title": "Trip to Frankfurt", "user": "burnetk", "date": "July 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 35334223}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled solo", "text": "Great location. Not only close to hbf but also a safe walk. I was travelling alone and afraid to walk around by myself. There is a shortcut at the platform No. 24 to this hotel. By the raod is a post office and I can always see some police resting there which made me feel safer. Modern decoration and clean but no A/C. They give a small fan in the room. My room is by the stree where the Tram would pass and this made some noise when window is open. At the counter I heard some lady complained about the wireless signal is not stable and I feel the receptionist is not replying in a satisfying way. Two free PC at the lobby for internet.
