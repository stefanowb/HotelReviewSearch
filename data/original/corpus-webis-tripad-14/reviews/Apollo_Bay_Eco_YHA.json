Its brand new, modern and feels like a big contemporary holiday home. Before you read more into this review, please consider that I came in the winter and thats why I am trying to alert people who come to hostel in the winter and cooler months of the year. If you are a summer traveller, please disregard my rants on heating etc. Generally, I had a pleasant stay. The hostel is quiet and peaceful. There are many rest areas where you can escape and read a book/watch tv etc. The couches and living areas/kitchens are all emaculate. The only problem I had with this hostel was that it was too cold !! The overall sealing and insulation of this building to the elements is also questionable as I could feel an overall draft in the building. The rooms are huge and I guess part of the reason it is cold is due to the air that needs to heat, which I can imagine would be a huge expense for a hostel to pay for. I opted to stay in a single room for the night, thinking that maybe I would receive more amenities in terms of heating and other extras. The room again was clean, no dust and I was reasonably happy. Problems were the light fittings which were extremely dim (due to environmental offset targets). Also I didnt like the use of concrete in all rooms as it felt slightly surgical having nothing but grey concrete brick everywhere. Sure, it is the \"contemporary\" style that they are after but when it comes to general comfort and warmth I think that the customer comes first? ..... if I can \"beg\" to ask that? ... also getting back to the heat the wall heaters were not good enough. I woke up sneezing and felt that more could be done to either insulate the building properly or create more options for heating. Why should travellers be subjected to sickness in the name of meeting environmental targets? That is a question that I want answered. Sure, the environment does come first but is saving every ounce of electricity in exchanged for cold, tired and weary travellers a \"sustainable\" thing to do? I am sure that I wasted more environmental deficits on the amount of tissues that I used in exchange for the megawatts of electricity used to heat the room. Please take a moment to think about this and re-justify the \"sustainable\" pursuits that the hostel is trying to achieve. May sound ridiculous to you but try to imagine all the trees being cut down in exchange for your policitcally correct environmental best practices. The IT and TV room were my favourites. THe kitchen, while brand new and modern seemed to cater for the masses. I am sure that groups would love this hotel as there is just so much space, almost too much space and that leaves me feeling well .... rather cold and in need of a comfortable warm stay !!!!!!", "title": "Modern, contemporary .... but cold !!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Tony_au77", "date": "March 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 98598755}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Not being a habitual \"hosteller\" I was lulled into a false sense of security with this place!
