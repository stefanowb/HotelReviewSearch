Most of the staff was friendly and courteous, but we had some problems, such as the night doorman allowing a very loud group to film in the garage (we called around 2 am and they just got louder revving motorcycles and such), our toilet broke the first night and we were given a plunger to fix it ourselves, and one of the management insisted (very rudely) that we must get our room cleaned every day.

This property was perfect for our needs-2 separate bedrooms and 2 separate baths along with a kitchen and a grocery store (so inexpensive!!) right next door. This is not a super fancy place, but a pretty modern, comfortable, convenient space. The service was helpful and friendly especially the bellman/doorman who was very kind and as they say in Argentina \"muy amable\". The Recoleta neighborhood is lovely for walking and for eating as well as very easy to catch cabs. The rate was a little higher than other places, but this is a full 2 bedroom apartment so it was worth it.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "NVRam123", "date": "February 10, 2007", "id": 6777849}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We really enjoyed our week in BA.

We found it clean and spacious. We had a kitchen, large patio and TV in the living room. It's more like an apartment than a hotel. There was very little noise. My only suggestions are that it would have been nice to have some furniture outside on the patio. The bathrooms were functional and clean but lacked character. I read on some reviews that they felt the breakfast was small. We thought it was just right. Toast and medialuna with OJ and tea. Guests have to remember that in many countries like Argentina people don't eat a big breakfast with ham and eggs. We thought the medialunas were yummy and it was nice to get breakfast brought to the room.", "title": "Enjoyed our stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "oktane", "date": "January 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6542447, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Room size", "disliked": "\u2014 Service"}}], "location": {"country": "Argentina", "continent": "South America", "city": "Buenos Aires"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 11, "very good": 68, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 84}, "aka": "Art Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.220454545455, "description": "ART SUITES & GALLERY, offer business and leisure travelers alike, all the comforts of home in the stylish neighborhood of Recoleta, the residential heart of the City of Buenos Aires.
