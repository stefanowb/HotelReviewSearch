This was a good location for that - about two thirds of the distance covered and in a town that did offer a choice of eating spots for dinner. However the hotel itself was extremely disappointing and really not very pleasant. The room, though clean enough was really shabby with cheap flimsy old furniture and the thinest scratchiest sheets and towels I have ever been offered. If I had not seen th sign I would have thought I was in a Super 8. The shower was at chin height and I have never met with such flat pillows. It looked like a hippopotamus must be been sitting on them for at least a year. The room was so overheated that we had to leave the window open all night which was not very secure in a ground-level room.
