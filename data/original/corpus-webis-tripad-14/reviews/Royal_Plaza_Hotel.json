The staff were courteous and efficient. Check-in was hassle-free. The superior room that we got was large by Hongkong standards. We got a double-double bed with each bed approximately 4 feet across. The room also came with a kitchenette which came in handy when heating up some snacks that we bought from the night market. The room was clean, except that the decor looked a bit tired. Also the bathroom tiles could do with a little bit of cleaning up as the mildew stains were quite visible. The hotel would do well with little extras like a daily newspaper and free wireless internet which the front desk said did not come with the package that I booked. As it was marketed as a five star hotel, these extras are what one would come to expect. The MTR station is just a short 10 min walk away along elevated sheltered walkways. There are lots of shops and eateries in the hotel's vicinity, so you don't really need to eat at the hotel. Cafe de coral and Fairwood can be found in the adjoining Grand Century Place Mall so you can practically have breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner there if you are not so adventurous. Btw I had a scrumptious hotpot dinner at Cafe de coral for only HK$45. A good dimsum place, called Maxim's can also be found on the 7th floor of the Mall.
