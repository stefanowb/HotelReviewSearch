I found the Aqua Wave Hotel on Trip Advisor and ended up booking the room right on the Aqua website because they were the only ones who had the \"Partial Ocean View\" option. I used the corporate rate (just showed my business card upon arrival) and got an \"Partial Ocean View\" room which was on the top floor (15th) half facing the ocean and half facing diamond head for only $108 a night! I was very happy with my stay. I picked the Wave property over the other Aqua resorts because of the new modern decor. Room had an LCD TV and new style linens and decorations. I liked that the hotel was located in the International Market Place and accross from Dukes which is one of my favorite beach hang out spots. Negatives about the stay were that the business center charged for internet access (even to just print boarding pass), lighting in bathroom was very dim, and the TV was very small (if I had to guess I'd say 25\"). The room was very clean, bathroom was a nice size, large closet space, and all basic amenities were included (even toothbrush, saving cream, rasor) free of charge.

One can be improved by the hotel, and one is out of their control. This hotel is noisy. Like the other posts said, they provide earplugs (one set is in the room already, and you can request more). The one problem that can be improved is the room doors. They slam. Loud. Every time someone closes a door, the walls rattle and you can feel a door slam clear on the other end of the hall. I understand its an older building, but even letting the doors close on their own (just the last few inches or so) will slam the door. We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village after leaving this hotel and sometimes I had to turn around and make sure their doors were closed because they self-closed so quietly. The other cause of the noise which is just a symptom of their location is the neighborhood noise. You have Kuhio on one side (which is a fairly busy street), the International Marketplace on the other side (which has a Hawaiian band playing nightly about 100 feet away), and alleys on the two sides (one of which is a lift garage). The music stopped early enough but the alley traffic was loud, especially with noisy and beeping trash trucks every morning taking multiple loads.

The outside is very non-discreet and could use some re-furbishments. The inside could use some work as well. However, the rooms are all done very nicely, very modern. My friend and I lucked out. We were given a corner room that was probably 1 1/2-2 times the size of a normal room. The bath room was quite small and needed some work but everything functioned. The elevators were alright. I've stayed at hotels where the elevators were MUCH slower. Unfortunately, one of the two elevators broke down while we were there and it was possibly at the worst time: the weekend. But it did get fixed come Monday and everything seemed fine. It could have been better if the pool were accessible from the hotel, instead of having to walk outside and around the hotel to get to the pool. But the beach is 2 blocks away. Why go to the pool?

I hate complaining but I figured since we're on a honeymoon, I'd atleast attempt to get a better room with only \"one\" bed. As I said the staff was nice, and he apologized but he informed us that they were unable to upgrade our room as promised by agent, unless of course we forked out more money. He did move us to another room. However again there were two beds, and even worse water pressure. The rooms were clean but rather dim and rustic looking due to decor and carpet. Our sheets were changed only the 2nd day of our stay. After a few days I asked a maid for fresh sheets and after she handed them to me, she mumbled to a co worker that a tip goes a long ways. I guess the $3 tip we left each morning wasnt enough to even get a change of sheets.The free breakfast consisted of a danish roll and a cup of coffee (No, Im not kidding) The location of the small pool creeped us out. But overall we were close to the beach and some good resturaunts. The noise wasnt as bad as it could have been. There was a nice tv in room and the beds were comfortable.
