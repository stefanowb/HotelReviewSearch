Last time we stayed in the Paris city center and had to deal with the hectic trip to the airport, so we decided to stay near the airport and make it easy. Initially we planned on still heading to Paris, but we had just arrived from the 3 hour train ride from Bordeaux and to turn around and take another train to Paris for one last night of frolick just did not sound too appealing. I believe we figured that for the both of us (me and my husband) the cost to take the RER train into Paris and back to the hotel would have exceeded $100, and since we had both had been to Paris several times, we figured we would get just as much out of relaxing at the comf Hyatt hotel. So we stayed in and ordered room service -- it was great! After 2 weeks in France and staying in rented apartments, it was nice to stay at a place with English speaking channels as options on the TV. We also enjoyed the lounge in the main lobbym and while we only had wine, we enjoyed the endless un-requested refills of the wasabi cracker mix and the green olives. Breakfast was over the top -- most everything one would could want was there. Several meat, egg, and cheese options, in addition to pastries and breads and fruits and vegetables were available. I believe the breakfast option was included with our stay but this would have been something I would have been willing to pay extra for. The gym was fantastic. The gym was separated from the main building area which I like as this separaing added to its privacy (can't stand the hotels with the fishbowl gyms). The rooms were clean and bright and fresh and felt new. The way I recall it, the room furnishings felt more up to date the the actual hotel lobby, which while clean and attractive, felt a little circa 1993. Still it seemed in good shape, so not a complaint, just an observation. There were only 2 cons to this hotel in my opinion: the area around the hotel is pretty void of any place one could walk to for a quick bite -- one would need a cab or a shuttle to the train. And the next con is pretty common for most hotels I have seen in Europe -- the beds do not come with a top sheet, just a duvet. My American preference is for the top sheet!! The next day we took the hotel shuttle to CDG. I did not find the shuttle driver - a woman - to be overly nice or accomodating, so that was a little disappointing. But otherwise the hotel was great and I would definitely stay there again, as long as I did not have plans to go into Paris. If you want to go into Paris, just stay there in the city at one of the other Hyatt's or at a boutique hotel.", "title": "Easy breezy last night in Paris", "user": "Ariel519", "date": "September 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 176390274}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "moderate but comfort", "text": "I had stayed recently at Hyatt CDG airport and it\u2019s an excellent hotel with amenities.

You can't walk it so for an early flight we were forced to take a taxi which cost 25 Euros. If you want a hotel to use between flights there are ones closer to the airport. From memory there is a hotel in the terminal. All this seems a bit frustrating when you are tired and jet-lagged and just need somewhere for a few hours kip before catching an onward flight. We landed at 11pm and had to call up the hotel at around midnight to enquire about the promised shuttle bus. Some other guests had been waiting over half an hour. Our outbound flight was 7.30am so staff told us we could only get to the airport by taxi (the driver ripped us off because he started running the meter when the first member of our party got downstairs rather than when we all got on board.... but there you go) Also, without moaning too much there was no bottled water in the rooms so the bar sold water for eight Euros!
