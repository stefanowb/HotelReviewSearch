When I got it back, it was torn a bit. It became shabby. I was somehow scared of her, so I asked her very politely what happened. As soon as I started to point out their mistake, she just shouted at me and never listened, just talked like \" we never make any mistake and you are just insulting me.\" To me, anybody who owned the hotel, even a great hotel can make a mistake. As they were not bad, I did not want to ask her too much conpensation, but I started to be so angry after seeing her reaction. She also added \" just tell me how much it costs and I will pay it\". I did not have any idea how much it would be, so I could not tell her. When we check-out, they cut the airport pick-up fare which was about 35 pounds( if I remember correctly). Then, we moved to another hotel, as I planned from the beginning. When we were at the other hotel, they called us and asked us to pay the rental car cost which they forgot to charge.

Quite simply, it was one of the best hotel experiences in our life. What made it special? First, the stunningly beautiful location: right at the Indian Ocean overlooking the barrier reef, with the soothing rumble of the waves in the distance. Then: the tasteful cabins (10 in total), in a clever layout that gives you maximum privacy. Third, the excellent food - outstanding French-Creole cuisine - either indoors or outdoors on the terrace. But more resorts boast nearby ocean, nice cabins, and good food. What makes Maison d\u2019Et\u00e9 truly special is its small scale approach. It announces itself as a family run establishment with charm and intimacy. This is a completely accurate description. Maison d\u2019Et\u00e9 stands out because of the friendliness and service orientation of its staff. Everyone, from the owners Marie-Michelle and Jean-Claude to the chamber maids was exceptionally pleasant and working hard to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Guests are treated in a genuinely personal manner, almost as friends, which gives the place a warm and intimate feel. The only other experience I have where hotel staff had a similar personal approach to the guests was in the Sukhothai hotel in Bangkok, a very different (bigger, urban) and much more expensive place. I shouldn\u2019t forget to mention the many small free services Maison d\u2019Et\u00e9 provides which add to your stay: free bikes (we used them a lot), car rentals (the cars are delivered to the hotel), snorkeling equipment, kayaks, and free internet. When we left Marie-Michelle found us another nice hotel for our three remaining days and arranged for a scenic ride with a taxi to bring us there. Perhaps a quote from a German couple we met during our stay sums it all up. They had stayed in several resorts, many times the price that Maison d\u2019Et\u00e9 charges. I asked them if they had any advice where else to stay. They answered; \u201cActually not, this is by far the nicest place we\u2019ve been on the island.\u201d", "title": "One of the best hotel experiences ever.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "hendrik60", "date": "May 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 62996172}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled solo", "text": "I arrived after flying straight through from Washington DC and was greeted as someone badly needing care--and I received it.

We snorkeled a few times a day and were amazed at finding something new every time (on our last day we came across a giant shell crab). They only have 10 rooms so there is more than ample sun lounges, cabanas etc. They have complementary snorkeling equipment, bikes and helmets, kayaks, internet and a small library. There is a new massage suite with staff on call, two pools, lounge areas and a guest reception. Staff were very sweet and left us to our own devices which was lovely. The only thing that we would suggest would be air conditioning in the room as even though the sea breeze was lovely we did fight with the bugs.
