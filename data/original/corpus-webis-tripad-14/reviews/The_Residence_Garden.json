The only way I would stay someplace else would be if the RG was sold out. Even then, I'd check with them each day to see if something had become available. The staff is very friendly and works hard to make sure your stay is comfortable and trouble-free. This all-suites hotel has true suites: completely separate bedroom and living area, as well as a mini-kitchen if you want to stay in and cook yourself (utensils are provided as well). Breakfast on the patio by the open-air lobby is good and reasonably priced. The all-you-can eat BBQ at the Captain's Corner restaurant, while not a true Texas-style BBQ, is an excellent deal with a wide range of good quality choices.

Compared to some of the horror stories ive heard in pattaya this has to be a real find. From check in to departure, overnite guest policy and cleanliness you wont find better for your baht. Admittedly its central location may not be to all tastes but for a good starting point you simply cant go wrong. The graciousness and freindly attitude of the staff was a real boost no matter what your inquiry or demand was always met with a smile and a can do attitude. Evidence of refurbishment in public areas and upgrades in rooms good to see. I was a 1st timer and found the electronic safe a real boon aswell. security is good as is guest policy. thumbs up all round will rebook next year.", "title": "\"Garden of Eden!\"", "helpfulness": 58, "user": "Ozejim", "date": "May 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 3438727}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 10, "very good": 36, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 25}, "aka": "The Residence Garden Hotel Pattaya", "slim_ranking": 0.145714285714}
