No, it doesnt have the fantastic views of Roal Champagne or the swanky restaurant - but it is in a far superior location - right next door to Mercier. Staff are very friendly and rooms need to be seen to be believed. All are individually designed and have fantasic bathrooms - ours had an enormous roll top bath. One has a little courtyard just outside where we enjoyed a very reasonably priced bottle of house champagne in the sunshine. The staff reccommended a great little restaurant in town which we got a taxi to and walked back from. Highly reccomended.

It's an easy walk to the hotel from the station so you don't need a car.

However, we were captured by this newly opened hotel which resides very convinient on the beautiful Avenue du Champagne in a totally renovated property formerly build and owned by the great Champagne producer Eugene Mercier (hence the name). The new owners have done a remarkable job of restoring the building and at same time maintain the special atmosphere that has been generated over the years by this very succesfull family. Our room where spacious, very clean and full equipped with all that the turist - or business traveller - requires. Even though it faced the Avenue du Champagne we where not bothered at all by noise from the street. The staff of the hotel where highly customer focused and nice in a special pleasant way. They spoke perfectly english and all of the time during our stay we felt welcomed and treated specially. We will strongly recommend staying at this hotel when visiting Epernay and we made bookings to revisit in Spetember 2006. By then it will be interesting to see the bar and the pool which are planned to be added to this nice hotel. This will really allow the guests to fully absorb and enjoy the history, atmosphere and beauty of the place.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 20, 2006", "id": 4472521}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "A new hotel that was opened in mid 2005, Villa Eugene is a very special place to stay if you are planning to visit Champagne.", "title": "Superb hotel", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "Spinalonga", "date": "January 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4387957}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "This hotel is quite simply the best hotel I have stayed in for the money.
