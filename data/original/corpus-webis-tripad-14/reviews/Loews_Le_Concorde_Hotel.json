The rooms are nice and clean as you would expect it from that kind of accomodation. There are no special highlights to point out, but unfortunately there are some issues I didn't like very much like e.g. no free internet access in the rooms. You can buy online time via WLAN (really slow, frequent disconnects, ...), the hotel's TV system seems not to be maintained too well - you get boot-screens of PCs or shells of linux systems on some TV channels. Worst of all is the elevator system. You have to calculate additional 5 to 10 minutes if you want to get from e.g. 22nd floor to the lobby.

(Minus the rude bartender in the bar area) Even with my poor French, we enjoyed our honeymoon stay in Old Quebec. Loews was walking distance to old city gate....great value for a modern hotel stay. Tips: Skip The Canon\u2019s Restaurant on the Grande Alle.....the WORST meal I\u2019ve ever had...plus the view of the giant rat. Go to the Farmer\u2019s Market. Amazing local products.
