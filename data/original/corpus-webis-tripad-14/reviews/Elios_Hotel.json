The wonderful husband and wife owners and all the staff went out of their way to assist us in this upsetting situation. Of special mention was the bell boy Duc, who asked everyone in the area that our camera was stolen if they knew anything. He took us to the police station and translated our problem to the police so that we could get a report for insurance. The police would provide no help at all. The owners had another bell boy take us to the police station the next day in case another shift would be more helpful, but the police were still uninterested.
