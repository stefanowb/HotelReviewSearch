Perfectly fine for short stay near airport. clean room, nice staff. Not too fancy, but has all basics, and it is cheap. I paid only $45 US on 16th day of Olympics when other \"cheap\" hotels were $500. Take the free shuttle van, b/c place is hard to find for taxi drivers. Can go to \"hotels and information\" booth at airport, and they will call the driver for you. he arrived in 10 min for me at 11:30 at night.", "title": "Good, very close to airport", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Johosephat", "date": "August 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 19284916, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location near Beijing airport, extremely responsive staff taking too and from airport"}}], "location": {"country": "China", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 30, "very good": 27, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 2}, "aka": "Aulympic Airportel Apartment Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.361998361998, "description": "Aulympic Airportel is a three star hotel in Beijing, China.
