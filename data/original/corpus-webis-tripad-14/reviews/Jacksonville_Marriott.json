I was given a tomb on the 4th floor. The room was tiny and dank with a painted brown wall and a dirty old dark green carpet. Wallpaper was peeling from the walls and the drywall was buckling in the bathroom. The furniture was old and looked like it had seen its day. It was probably purchased at fire sale from an old hotel or maybe even at a yard sale. The drawers would stick when you tried to open and so I put nothing in them. The TV did not come in an armoire. It was placed on top of the chest of drawers. The linens on the bed were of a very low quality and felt very uncomfortable to sleep in.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 20, 2005", "id": 3019435}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Jacksonville Marriott up to par", "text": "I did have dinner in the Bistro and the waitress was missing teeth, but very nice.
