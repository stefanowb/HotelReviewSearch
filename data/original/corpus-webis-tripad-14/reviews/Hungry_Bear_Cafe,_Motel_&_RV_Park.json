I ordered a salmon burger with a salad and was satisfied. The salmon tasted a little like what I buy and prepare for myself at home. Normally, I'd expect something more fresh, but for the area and because it reminded me of what I make at home, I was happy enough. The side salad was especially good. I really liked the mix of vegetables in it. My friend had salad and a shrimp basket. She received a HUGE portion (see pictures).", "title": "Favorite restaurant stop of the trip", "user": "lanakoala", "date": "August 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 171439977}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My friend felt like service was a bit slow.
