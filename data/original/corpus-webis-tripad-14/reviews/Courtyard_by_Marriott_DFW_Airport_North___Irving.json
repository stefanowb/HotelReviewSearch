I liked the fact that they had 3 newspaper by 5:30am (including WSJ). I had a 7am flight so I took a 5;30 shuttle. They sell icecream in the lobby. I ate at the Restaurant that they have. Semi grill food but had a decent steak and a small salad bar. The room was clean, nice. The TV was on a small side - I haven't see one that small (20inch?). The soap products, some generic brand - nothing recognizible. Nice, clean looking decor. Had a balcony overlooking the pool (too cool to use).", "user": "elakan", "date": "April 29, 2006", "id": 5019390}], "location": {}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 22, "very good": 36, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 34}, "aka": "Courtyard By Marriott Dfw Airport North / Irving Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.337662337662, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "description": "The Courtyard Dallas DFW Airport North is two miles from DFW International Airport and minutes from the Gaylord Convention Center, and Texas Stadium.
