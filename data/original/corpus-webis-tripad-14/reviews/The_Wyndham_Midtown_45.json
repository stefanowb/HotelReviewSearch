Well, The Alex is more than that: with views onto the Chrysler building, two blocks from Grand Central station and exceptionally pleasant staff this mid-town hotel doesn\u2019t make you miss the hip designer hotels. I was gate-crashing my husband\u2019s business trip and wasn\u2019t involved in the choice of hotel. Unlike me, all my husband wants is to be as close as possible to his NY office and doesn\u2019t care about the coolest hotel lobby or best view or bar. A comfy bed and proximity to his office were his criteria and I have to say this attitude gets you a lot in NYC. At least at The Alex. So, the decor doesn\u2019t aim to win design awards but it is neutral, well thought through and comfortable. The hotel food is OK and not too pricey, but there are many nearby options, so you are not stuck with the hotel menu. Most rooms provide for an extended stay with in-built kitchens, dining table and lounge area. We were staying on the 28th floor but the wi-fi didn't reach up all the way, so the hotel staff gave me another hotel room on the 3rd floor to work from. For that i am giving them a huge golden star for resourcefulness and helpfulness. So my main point is, if you remove all your fussiness about style, design and 'where to be seen' attitude, then at The Alex you can get a nice sized suite for the price of a standard room in one of those hipster downtown hotels.
