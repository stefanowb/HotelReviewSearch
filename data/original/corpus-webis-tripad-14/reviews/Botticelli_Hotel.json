As with every room I've stayed in in Europe, the rooms are small. My best advice for travelers is don't bring a different outfit for every day - pack light! There are no drawers but we were able to fit one suitcase in the armoire. There is too much furniture in the room, making it seem even smaller. Our room was on the first floor overlooking a busy side street. It was noisy from about 7 am to midnight, but that coincided with our sleep plans, so it wasn't a problem.
