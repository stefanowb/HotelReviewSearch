Because the five buildings have not been made to communicate with one another, one must use the treacherous \"tower\" stairs (yes, very charming but not very navigable) or use the elevator which did not bring us anywhere near our room.

Public areas of the hotel are charming, with original prints and paintings by Dutch artists on the walls, antique furniture and decorative objects, and a cozy library lined with books written by authors who have stayed at the hotel. This is not a hotel for anyone with mobility problems; because it is made up of many old townhouses that have been connected, there are narrow, winding stairs between floors, and many rooms are quite distant from the front desk. If that is not a problem for you, this is a wonderful hotel, located in a charming and convenient part of Amsterdam.", "title": "Lovely hotel", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "WillowG", "date": "December 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6354009}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Excellent and helpful staff, beautiful room.
