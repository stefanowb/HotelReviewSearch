Checkin was prompt and correct. Suite was okay. Some stains on floor. Foldout bed not very comfy but kids didn't complain. King size bed was nice. Did find human hair on the extra linens in the closet (for the sofa bed). Housekeeping tried to argue that they didn't see any. New linens were brought anyhow. Breakfast was VERY good and staff very friendly and helpful. Bathroom vents connect and a neighbor intermittantly smoked in theirs despite the hotel being nonsmoking. Front desk did try to take care of finding out who had been smoking but wasn't offered to change rooms. Didn't use the pool on site. Business lounge was nice but printer was out of ink.

I went down to the front desk to see if anywhere was close to purchase toiletries. The sweet lady at the front desk, Shelly, told me where to go and also offered to give me a ride, as my colleague had taken our work car. I am so grateful to her and touched by her kindness.
