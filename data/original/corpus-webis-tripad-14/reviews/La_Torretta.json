The owner and staff were so helpful and friendly and spoke good english. Our room was outstanding! The space was unbelievable by European standards and our children (10 & 12) even had their own room equipped with minibar and a television. A bottle of sparkling wine was left in the room for us to enjoy. The owner also stocks the bathroom with plenty of extras for you to use or take home (new sponge/looffah, incense, etc). The shower/tub was small, as some have mentioned in their reviews, but our family had quite a laugh cleaning up in this unique set up. We must remember that travelling comes with new experiences and if we want things exactly like our Canadian or American homes...we should stay there. The towels were small and thin, but they were of very high quality, quite absorbent and certainly nothing to complain about. They were so clean that they looked new and if they weren't, I think someone ironed them! Everything was lovingly displayed in our room as well. We had a huge balcony which my husband and I enjoyed some quiet time on during the evenings while the kids watched a bit of english tv. The view out to the sea was stunning. And, watching the locals from our balcony was very enjoyable. Early in the morning men and women were tending to their grape vines on the tiered land across from us, and late in the day people gathered in the streets sharing stories of the day. This little town was much less touristy that Vernazza and Monterossa and that was appealing to us especially during the evenings because it was much more peaceful. I was disappointed with Vernazza actually. We weren't even visiting during the busiest time of the year, and the garbage pails were overflowing with garbage and the streets were full of tourists. It was a pretty town, but I'm glad we stayed in Manarola. Monterossa was wonderful as it has a lovely beach. The kids played in the water and there are many great spots to stop for a bite to eat and a good Italian beer and just enjoy the view. It too was more touristy, but cleaner than Vernazza. When we first arrived in Manarola by we weren't certain where to find La Torretta, but just had to say the name to locals standing in their doorways and they would just say \"up\" and point where to go. The climb was not too bad, but we all had wheels on our suitcases and that made it quite bearable. There were no stairs to climb, just a windy street with pretty homes and shops lining it. When we left we had to leave quite early to catch the train and head up to Paris and couldn't wait until breakfast began, but the owner went out of his way and packed us a huge breakfast. It was enough food for the four of us to enjoy for breakfast AND lunch since he packed us so much food. The breakfasts were large, tasty, and quite artisically displayed. We will definitely come back and stay here. I'd like to stay longer (only spent two nights) next time and relax a bit.

We emailed back that same evening and told La Torreta that we would definitely like to reserve the room and would send them via fax (rather than email) our credit card information on Monday, December 4th. We specifically asked if they would hold the room until they received our fax on Monday. La Toretta emailed us back and said that would it be fine to fax our credit card information on Monday. We faxed our credit card information to La Toretta first thing Monday morning and received an email response back later that day saying that the room was no longer available \u2013 they had given the room to someone else.
