I made the mistake of looking at other reviews the night before we were due to leave and panicked all night that I had booked the wrong place. However, we arrived and the hotel looked good on first impressions and then we got to our room waiting for the disaster ... but there wasn't one - a lovely room suitable for us and our 3 small children also equipped with a jacuzzi bath which the kids thought was great. Breakfast was fabulous but other meals seemed overpriced so we ate out - beefeater, harvester, pizza hut, the plough and room service one night. The only down side was the pool which we only tried once and said never agin it was filthy with tiles around the pool mouldy a used plaster by the pool and general wear and tear just out of control.
