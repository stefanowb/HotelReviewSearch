The evening meals were fantastic and great value too, breakfast is sparse but typical of German hotels. The whole hotel is spotlessly clean,,,,,, but ,,,,, strong smell of cigarette smoke in downstairs lobby, TV room and corridors. My room was non-smoking but also smelt of cigarettes. (you can't hide the smell from a non-smoker). The bathroom, furniture & decor were dated but everything worked and everything was very clean (apart from dirty windows - view from hotel would be lovely). I also prefer to have coffee & tea making facilities in hotel rooms. My room was cold at night - this is not a complaint for me but some people would not like that! Heating seemed to come on about 7am. Despite these things, I would not hesitate to return because of the hospitality and the dining :o)", "title": "Fab food, friendly family, but faded", "user": "gabsterUK", "date": "March 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 126134414}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled on business", "text": "This is a beautifully appointed hotel with family guest house charm.

It is easy to find between the outskirts of town and the old city of Isny which in itself is a small jewel to wander around in. The rooms are nice and partly very large and normally with a garden view. They have all the amenities you may need. However a small fridge would not be totally out of place. The service is excellent and the kitchen is a dream for local and international fare. It is a place where you feel at home away from home. They have an indoor swimmingpool although I never used it. Parking is easy right in front of the hotel. It is quiet and no street noise or other noises would disturb your sleep. A place to stay which I highly recommend, and it is good value for the money.", "title": "Great small hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Tom D", "date": "September 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117956715}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Isny im Allgaeu"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 6, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 6}, "aka": "Hotel Hohe Linde Germany/Isny Im Allgaeu", "slim_ranking": 0.6}
