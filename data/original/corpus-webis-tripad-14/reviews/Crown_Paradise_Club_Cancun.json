The Japanese place was open 12-5pm. The food court was open until 9 and then you could go to another hamburger stand for food. The only bad thing was the food court closed from 11-1230 or something like that and if you stayed up late and wanted to get a late breakfast early lunch, you had to wait or just go get a hamburger or sandwich. But other than that the food was pretty good. Some was too exotic for our taste, but we always found something we liked. As far as tours go, I highly recommend the Xel-ha snorkling tour. Don't combine it with another tour, you won't have enough time to enjoy yourself. you would definitely want all day. Buy the all inclusive package also. If you're there all day, you will want it. I heard the jungle cruise was a good one, but we had to cancel because they scheduled the wrong day. We took the Captain Hook Pirate Cruise, that was pretty good - get there early tho, so you can get a better seat.

We had a fantastic time. Things could not have gone smoother from the airport to catching up with apple vacation for the ride to the hotel to checking in. We arrived at the hotel at 2:30 pm and recieved a room right away. We were in the old tower on the third floor. We were just about above the bar in the lobby but it was not a problem when we went to sleep. The beds are firm but not uncomfortable by any means. It is just a regular bed without a pillow top. We have a very lush bed at home and we never woke up stiff or sore on these beds. The kids club is fantastic after a few days there our son wanted to have lunch, dinner and go to the shows with them. Emily is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!, as all the staff members there. The last night our son met a friend and we allowed him to hang out at the arcade and sports club with his friend on his own. I felt very safe with him doing this. He kept checking in with us when he would move to a different location but I felt the hotel was very secure for him to do this. The slides at the teens club are great. The staff at the main pool was fantastic. One morning it was raining pretty hard and they brought the entertainment to the lobby till the strom blew over. Rain or shine they are always there to keep you entertained. They even have things going on for the kids besides the kids club. The food there is very good. Always found something to eat. My son ate enough pasta to last a year. I've never seen him eat so much. The only down fall is the floors everywhere especially near the pools are very slick!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband flew up in the air and head first into the pool one day. Luckily he missed the stools in the pool. You have to be very careful walking around the pools. All in all our trip was fantastic. We would certainly go back. I have no ideal where all the bad reviews came from. Maybe people are just expecting to much. Please, please tip everyone they work 16hr days for not much pay. We even tipped the girls that cleaned the bathrooms everyday.

A great vacation spot for the whole family..", "text": "After reading all of the negative comments, we were unsure of this resort. DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF IT! I think that all of these negative comments come from people who are not happy with anything. Our room (with bunk beds) was perfect. It was clean and our beds were made everyday AND we also saw the maids scrubbing the tub and bathroom EVERYDAY! The beds were great - yes they were firm, but what's wrong with a firm bed - that is what we are supposed to be sleeping on. We did not even ask for a topper. We phoned everyday for room service, asking for 6 waters - they were delivered quickly. The food was AMAZING - if you find something you don't like - don't have it again - there are SO MANY things to choose from. It was delicious. We phoned every morning at 8:00 to book for the NEXT day at an a la carte restaurant. If you don't do this, you may not get in. Many people expected to just walk in or reserve an hour before the meal. Call the day before. You can only call one day in advance. The only restaurant that we didn't go twice to was the Mexican one - it just wasn't our favourite. The beach was beautiful. Our girls, 10 and 12, had so much fun in the waves. I would suggest going down early to reserve your chairs (by 8:00 or maybe a bit earlier). Just take your towels down and put them on - the signs say you can't, but EVERYONE does! The Sushi bar opens at noon - absolutely DELICIOUS. We had it EVERYDAY!!! You can order two at a time.....get in line at 11:45 because it takes a long time to get your meal as they make it right in front of you. Be first in line!!!!! All afternoon there is fries, hamburgers, tacos, amazing wings, drinks,etc.......to eat. You can always go into the buffet and grab some ice cream or whatever else you want. What we loved the best was that when our girls were hungry an hour after they just ate, they could go and find some more food!!!! The only negative thing about the resort is that the pools are FREEZING....too cold to get in......at least for us. The kids pool is better but it isn't deep - too shallow for our kids. My husband wants to go back to this resort ASAP!!!!! This is a family resort so adults without children may not want to come here - but I sure would - there are kids everywhere but there are so many clubs for them to attend that they are off and away enjoying being with the wonderful leaders.

I could not fault this hotel in any way shape or form. The staff are so friendly and will help with anything and their strawberry daiquiris are immense. The lobby/reception is open plan so the breeze from the sea flows through the hotel.

Before my trip I had found a coupon on tripadvisor.com for a free room upgrade for this hotel at the time of check in. I asked repeatedly at the lobby if he had upgraded us and he evaded my questions every time. The room itself has very old broken down furniture. We had room 1309. The balcony door was missing a handle so when we would go out on the balcony we could not close the door all the way. We did have a view of the ocean but it was not \"ocean front view\". The majority of our view was an abandoned construction site next door. The a/c does work, the beds are hard (typical of Mexico), however the pillows are not standard size, they are not even bed pillows, they are sofa accent pillows! very hard and uncomfortable. I travel a lot and I have never seen pillows so small. You do need to leave your a/c on to muffle the noise from the lobby. The room was an extreme disappointment. I had been to Cancun before and was expecting somewhat the same, man was I wrong. There was no decorations, no dresser, no fridge, and no luggage rack. We had to leave all of our clothes in our luggages for the week. The TV did not work with the remote and the volume did not work. I was traveling with a large group and checked out all of their rooms. THey all had nicer rooms(not much, but nicer than mine) and their maids would leave them towel decorations formed into the shape of animals or flowers.", "title": "Clean resort", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "shanie2011", "date": "January 22, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 94097811}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled with family", "text": "BATHROOM: Our maid never cleaned our floor or bathtub the entire week we were there, nor did she leave us any type of towel animals.
