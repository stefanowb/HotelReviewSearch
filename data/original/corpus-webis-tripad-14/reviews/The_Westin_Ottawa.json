However, when I checked out after a 2-night business trip, I left a small bag of jewelry on the counter in the bathroom. By the time I realized my mistake, I was already in Quebec City. I called the hotel the day after checking out and as luck and honesty would have it, the cleaning personnel found the bag with all the items still in it (a diamond and emerald ring, pearl earrings, an amber bracelet and a silver necklace) and turned it in to the manager's office. Which is where things began to go terribly wrong. The manager on duty at the time told me he would immediately send the bag to my sister's home in Quebec (as I live in Mexico). When the bag never arrived, I called several times to follow up. The manager who finally gave me some answers (Rhonda McDougall) told me that the bag had been stored over the weekend in a locked container attached to a wall in the manager's office but that it became 'dislodged' over the weekend and all of the contents spilled out on the floor. When they went to collect the various items, they could no longer find the bag of jewelry. Ms. McDouglas apologized profusely for the 'loss' of the item, which appeared to me to be more of a 'theft' of the item. I suppose no hotel wants to admit that personnel with access to the manager's office would steal, but I was left to file a theft report with the Ottawa police on my own in the hopes that someone would make a proper investigation.
