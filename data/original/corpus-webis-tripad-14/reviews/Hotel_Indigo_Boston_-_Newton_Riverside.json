Honored an early check in for 3 rooms( which seems unheard of now a days). The bar was excellent outdoor gazbos and fancy fireplaces.

O n the DOWN side, the hotel's main focus is the bar and the clientele they cater to, young to mid aged singles on the prowl. You can only access the pool area after 8pm by making your way through the bar, which is jam packed. We did a lot of rushed sight seeing and were ready to just relax by the pool in the evenings, but, it's not a family environment at all. Men leered at my 14 yr old grandaughter each time she had to make her way through the bar to the poolside. Our main complaint was not addressed. Although the hotel has a dog friendly policy with rooms for them set aside, we were disturbed by a dog that had been allowed on a non dog floor, and was in the room next to us, he barked in the late night and in the early morning , the whole time his owner left him in the room. When we complained to the desk, it took 3 calls to learn that the dog was allowed because his owner was a friend of the manager. No compensation was offered for the inconvenience of being kept up all night. We had 8 rooms and were all pretty disappointed with our stay.", "title": "Cleaning service is terribly slow...", "user": "Sparbaja", "date": "July 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 69567315}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010", "text": "Cleaning service is terribly slow, elevators are sketchy and location is not so hot.

We booked two nights this past weekend and we now dub this establishment 'hotel hell'. While this place masquerades as a modern boutique hotel (no room service) with a popular, and rather good upscale restaurant on the lower level, the service is non-existent, the employees are disgruntled, and management is incompetent. The place is just run so poorly. At 1:08 am Saturday we had a loud group of at least a dozen people outside of our room; a fight broke out with running, people being thrown up against walls, screaming, etc. We opened our door after the police and ambulance arrived and, I kid you not, there was a good amount of blood smeared all over the walls next to our room and down the length of the hallway. Unfortunately after the sirens subsided the flashing lights made their way through the drapes. Hoping for a good night of sleep on Saturday we were awakened every half of an hour until 6 am by a drunken group of rowdy (cheering and yelling) post wedding partiers a few doors down. I am certain we were not the only guests calling the desk all night, but security began the eviction process a little after 5am as we regrettably heard every word of that discourse until it ended at about 6am. We wonder why security did not make floor rounds after these party-goers disperse to their rooms after 1am. Walking the halls periodically during the night would have detected the issues that were happening all night on multiple floors. We know that other guests had a rough night because we were able to share stories at around 7:45 am when we were evacuated from our rooms (some of us roused from the shower) by the hotel and fire department. Apparently it was someone's idea of a joke. Of course the hotel manager could not adjust our bill more than $50.00. Nothing could compensate us for how totally exhausted we are. If anyone is masochistic enough to stay here do note that if you call down to the restaurant and are told they can't seat you because they are fully reserved - walk down anyway - you will find that they can seat you and you will find that 30 percent of the tables will be empty throughout your dinner.", "title": "Brutal experience; absolutely worst hotel experience.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Crewlaxfamily", "date": "October 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 82048829}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel is billed as eco-friendly.", "title": "my worst hotel experience ...", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "vicvic4", "date": "October 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 81977334}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The room was ok - tiny but ok.", "title": "Good location, average stay", "user": "Ellen205", "date": "September 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 81220940}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010", "text": "The hotel is in the middle of nowhere.", "title": "Euro-trendy hotel in superb location", "user": "DonInConnecticut", "date": "September 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 79715146}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Be careful if you are a business traveler!!", "text": "They will provide you a copy of the bill with your hotel room and tax.

That sums it up. I was traveling on business and needed to check in early because I had an early meeting. The clerk said there were no rooms. I could accept that - it happens - except that no less than 10 people checked out in the 10 minutes I was standing there. I had just flown across country and yes, I should have thought to book the room for the night before, but they were no help. I was willing to pay extra to check in early, even an extra day's stay, but was told the housekeeping staff could not get a room cleaned in less than 5 hours. The man in front of me had just finished yelling at the front desk staff, so I'm pretty sure my case was not an isolated incident of just UNhelpfulness.
