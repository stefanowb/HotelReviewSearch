Kathy and Larry who own and run this B&B were more than hosts, they quickly became our friends. You can tell they truly love what they do and are there for you. There hospitality, generosity, and culinary skills are second to none. We had one of the best breakfasts we have ever had. We had to take pictures of it before we could begin to eat it as it was like art work. We enjoyed the breakfast on the patio and watched the hummingbirds and finches feed while soaking up the views. Although this was a bed and breakfast you received more than just breakfast. They had everything you needed from water and soda(stocked all over the house) to cheese and crackers. They even have the most amazing home made ice cream to treat yourself to anytime of the day. My wife and I had a tough time leaving and we have not quit talking about how wonderful our trip was and when can we go back there again soon. They truly thought of everything.
