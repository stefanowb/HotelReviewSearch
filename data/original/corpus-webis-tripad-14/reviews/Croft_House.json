Lovely rooms, welcoming hosts and the parking is a real bonus as the public car parks with Cockermouth's one way system can be a little complicated to reach. We found Cockermouth absolutely delightful with lots to see and do and some really different shops. The town seems to have used the awful floods to revitalise itself as it now looks wonderful although local people have terrible stories to tell about their experiences when the rivers ran through the town. Very handy to be able to walk to the Jennings Brewery tour especially as you taste a pint and a half of pretty strong beer. We enjoyed eating at the Bitter End and Tarantella which does an excellent early bird meal. The walk around Buttermere is delightful and fairly flat with beautiful views all the way round. Would like to have stayed there longer and I am really sure we shall go back.
