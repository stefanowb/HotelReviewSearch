I did a lot of research on hotels,, read the great reviews of this one, and decided to give it a try. When my husband and I arrived at 1pm there was not a room available. No problem. We knew it was early. We left our luggage and went out shopping. When we returned at 3 pm our room was ready. We had specifically asked for a very quiet room. During check-in we again requested a quiet room. We were told no problem. There were two men at two desks doing check-ins. One was helping us and the other was taking calls. At one point the two men began chatting and seemed to forget there were customers in front of them. We were handed keys to the room without even being asked for a credit card. OK. A third man said he would take us to our room. We waited at least 5 minutes for the one elevator. When we arrived in our room we asked the bellman if the room was going to be quiet. He assured us that it was one of the quietest rooms in the hotel. The hotel room was very small and cramped. Frankly, it reminded me of my grandma's guest bedroom. Everything seemed kind of old and worn. The bathroom, however, was large and modern. It did not seem to go with the rest of the room. I layed down to try to take a nap, but within 10 minutes hammering began. It would intermittently stop for a minute or two and then begin again. After 20 minutes of it I could not take it anymore. My husband called the front desk to ask what was going on. The front desk staff was clueless. My husband asked for the manager. The manager said they were replacing the carpet on the floor above us and the work would likely be done around 5pm, but would begin again in the morning. We explained that we had requested a quiet room -several times. Nobody in the hotel seemed to think that having a work crew hammering above us for hours on end was a big deal. We asked for another room, but were told none were available. After 90 minutes of hammering and back and forth with the manager we checked ot and went to stay at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza which was a better, bigger room with new furniture at half the cost with 100% less snottiness.", "title": "The Worst", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "rakawa", "date": "June 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 16758915, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 The way the staff actd put out when we complained about the hammering."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have stayed at the Mosaic Hotel before and had an excellent experience.

The location is ideal for exploring all that the area has to offer - close enough to walk to shopping and restaurants yet far enough from the madding crowds! The hotel was chic and comfortable at the same time, very intimate and inviting. The rooms were beautifully decorated and our beds were so comfortable! The courtyard pool setting was a big attraction for us even though it was cool - the cabana type seating and heaters made it great and we enjoyed the best pizza there. Breakfast in the dining room was lovely with the view over the pool, and they served wonderful coffee.
