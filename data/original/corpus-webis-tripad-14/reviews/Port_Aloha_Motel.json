Friendly, personal service from the moment of check in. We were upgraded to a family suite which was great having two young children. After the long drive they were happy to go into their bedroom to watch the kids chanel on austar (giving us a chance to unwind) and have a quick dip in the pool. It was walking distance to the main street with lots of restaurants etc. It is an older style property that has been repainted and is extremely clean and comfortable, we slept well!", "title": "Clean and Comfortable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kazkap", "date": "January 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 12913516, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly service, quiet location", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The Aloha is close to everything and fantastically close to the beach.
