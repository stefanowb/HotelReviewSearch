We stayed here 6 nights while visiting the Zoo, Sea World, Legoland, etc. The hotel was very clean, new, and the staff could not have been nicer. The FREE buffet breakfast every morning was perfect, huge selection to eat from, waffle maker, eggs, bacon,biscuits and more. Then in the evening from 5-7 is a FREE dinner- yes free....with wine! This worked out super, bc after being at an amusement park all day we were all tired and hungry. It was great to go back to the hotel after a long day and enjoy a meal as a family and then all get in the hot tub and relax before bed.", "title": "Could not have asked for better", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "sbrekus", "date": "April 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 103216997}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Our hotel room had a large room with the king bed in it and full bath, then another separate living room with a desk, kitchen(very convienient for left overs and any groceries), and fold out couch and TV for the kids to sleep on and watch cartoons when they wake up.", "title": "Business Trip - Great Restaurant", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "delmarsurf", "date": "April 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 103086523}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We would stay here again in a heartbeat!!!!!

The amenities were great and any and all questions we had were answered by either the desk clerks or the manager. I really felt they cared about us as guests. Traveling with two young kids is very difficult and it really meant a lot when I was having difficulty getting breakfast for the two kids to the table and the general manager, Ann Marie, came over to help because she has a young one at home and said she knows what it's like.

Despite its close proximity to the highway, there is little to no traffic noise - being situated on a hill certainly helps. Torrey Pines State Park & Beach are within a 5-7 minute drive. For the active-types, you'll certainly get your running in with the surrounding hills and spacious bike lanes which will take you right to Torrey Pines, or should you crave a little more inland trail running action, Los Penasquitos Inland Preserve resides just to the east. There are beach supplies available for rent (beach chairs, umbrella, boogie board) individually or as a package deal ($30) which is convenient for beach-goers that packed light. There are multiple grocery stores (Vons) and restaurants within driving distance or utilize the handy shuttle provided by Homewood Suites.

The location was perfect for us - 20 minutes to the airport, 15 minutes to Sea World, 25 minutes to Safari Park. Close enough to all the major attractions without having to pay $30 for parking. Staff was superb - very helpful, friendly & accomodating. They have a free breakfast that is actually quite good & a lite meal Monday - Thursday. Both were heavily attended so obviously they were very popular. They also have a small area where you can purchase snacks should you get the munchies. We had a king bed suite which had a kitchenette area with a refrig, 2 burner cooktop, dishwasher & microwave. The sitting room had a desk, sofa you could stretch out on & an easy chair. The only complaint I had here is that the desk chair doesn't go up very high in relation to the desk height. Free internet access was a biggie for me plus they had a business center should you need to print out anything. The suite had 2 flat screen TV's. The bathroom set up was a bit different - the toilet & shower were behind a door but the sink was open to the bedroom - I get why they did that but it can be a bit of a pain if one is asleep & the other is up & about. But that is so minor compared to all we found that was right with this place. You do have to drive to get anyplace, it felt as if the hoeld was in a tech area but we had a car & access to I5 & 805 was a breeze. La Jolla was right around the corner as was Del Mar. Parking was ample easy. They had a small fitness center with a recumbant bike, 2 treadmills, an elliptical and set of weights. Hot tub was clean & enjoyed after a long day at the parks.
