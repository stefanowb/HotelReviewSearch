I'm a Milwaukee residence and avoids been proud of the Fister. However, something has taken place which is causing the Pfister to slip both an appearance and service. Andrew not prepared on time. The carpeting looked matted and worn. The bed was uncomfortable and was tilted forward to make me feel I was sleeping on a bouncy incline. I didn't think the room was worth what we paid nor does it compare with the many hotels I have stayed in over the last couple of years. I am a frequent travelers have experienced many different levels and brands of hotel. Said to say the Pfister is definitely not what it once was. there are certainly better values in Milwaukee. On a positive note we loved meeting in the lobby every morning for coffee and enjoying the comfort of the lobby.

We had a king bed in the tower portion of the hotel. Our room had a nice view of the city and the hotel lobby was amazingly beautiful, but let's face it - the lobby is not where you spend most of your time. Our room had old carpeting that had not been cleaned in awhile - dirt and fingernail clippings on the carpets (gross!). The window in the room is a large bay window however the ceiling above the window was crumbling down on to the bay window seating area. There is no mini fridge in the room, which would have been nice since the temperatures outside were in the 100's for most of our stay. The bed had a pillow top that was wearing out because all of the stuffing was relocated to the foot of the bed causing you to sleep at a slant with your head slightly lower. The bathrooms are small but the granite was pretty. Overall, for the kind of money we were paying ($200+/night) I would recommend staying somewhere else.

Absolutely stunning! The reception is quick and friendly. There are 2 different parts of the hotel. The older side and the newer side. The older side is accessible by it's own elevator, and gives the guest the feeling you might be staying at a more special type of room...not so much. Rooms are pretty regular, and aren't worth paying additional dollars for. The hotel does have a nice location. It is convenient to many nice restaraunts and a short cab reuse to most downtown locations. The downside is knowing where to request a room. I'd you'd like to have an undisturbed and bit of sleep in, request room facing away from where garbage gets picked up. I believe it was between 7-8am. Fine if you have business meetings and have to be up early, not great if looking forward to a little more rest. The food in lobby restaurant in morning is ok, but service can be a bit slow. There is a pretty lounge on top of building, Blue, which serves this, Blue, as a signature cocktail. Fun spot, and request some cashews, yummy snack and free. The downside of this place is it's fairly small and if you sit near musicians or piano player, hard to have a conversation. The hotel has many amenities and history. It is a nice spot to stay in Milwaukee, but pretty pricey.

Worth it as the suites seem to have been refurbished. The room was clean but we had a slow draining tub and sink this time. We only stayed two nights so it didn't seem worth it to complain. Bathroom sizes seem to be the same in both the suites and the regular rooms. Nice to have a separate TV and couch area. The one negative thing we keep encountering here is the noise level both in the hallways and out on the street.
