The grounds are georgeous, the staff is attentive, and the atmosphere is relaxed and languid. No bar, loud music at the pool, or bustling crowds to distract you from the breathtaking sunset on the dock. There's a tennis court and sea kayaks if you feel like you need some exercise, but we spent most of our time here soaking in the jaccuzzi, hanging out on the dock, or lounging together in the room. A very friendly and beautiful retreat from the local dive and bar scene. Although no food services on the premesis, there are many good restaurants, convenience stores, plus chocolate/ cigar/ sprits stores a short drive away. A boutique retreat, centrally located on Key Largo, but buffered from the road and neighboring properties (mostly older and not as upscale) by the botanical gardens.", "title": "peace and tranquility and a place to reconnect", "user": "ellen k", "date": "November 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 145511921}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went to Key Largo to snorkel and since it was the weekend of Hurricane Sandy that was not possible.

Thank goodness we stayed at Kona Kai! Even though the winds were almost 30 mph and it was cold and you couldn't see anything in the ocean, the grounds were so beautiful, the rooms so comfortable and the staff so gracious that we had a good time anyway. It's really peaceful and the rooms have all the small amenities; real wine glasses, corkscrew, excellent coffee with ceramic mugs, lots of fluffy towels and great bath products etc. Since we really couldn't swim much in the ocean (the bay had big waves!) we were very appreciative of the pool which was heated and surrounded by beautiful gardens with a gorgeous view of the water. We saw lots of egrets and frigate birds and I saw a mantee in the bay.
