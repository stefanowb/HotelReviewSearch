I think the problem was the staff.. there was one guy at reception with glasses who spoke brilliant English was very friendly and helpful but when he left it went downhill. The was no concierge no doorman at the door no bell boy or butler so can\u2019t be 5 star maybe Spanish 5 star. They had a pool but was so small it was a joke. It was very central to Malaga town 2 minutes and 15 minutes to the beach waking. I would say it was a nice hotel but lacked the va va vroom of a 5 star. It\u2019s good for location and for European standards Ok but I am used to America and UAE so no comparison..Even when I left they did not help me with a taxi i had to try and get one from outside which was a joke..
