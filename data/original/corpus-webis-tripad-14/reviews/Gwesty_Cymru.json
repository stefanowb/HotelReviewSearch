We stayed one night in Room 5, the green room, at the rear of the building. The bed was comfy with high quality bedlinen and duvet and the bathroom was beautifully designed with rain shower and gorgeous glass mosaic tiles. It was very clean and the proprietor was friendly. The restaurant was booked up for the evening meal but they took our number in case of cancellations. They did ring too, for a 6pm sitting, but we thought that would be too early. If the breakfast was anything to go by this is probably the best place to eat in Aberystwyth. The breakfast bar included delicious Rachel's dairy organic yogurts, croissants and cereals, as well as ccoked breakfast such as traditional Welsh - bacon, egg, beans, black pudding, tomato (grilled with thyme), mushroom and toast. We ate out at Wasabi, a new(?) Japanese sushi and noodle place, with delicious bento boxes.
