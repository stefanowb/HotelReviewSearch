The property and landscaping are well maintained but you can see where they chose to cut the construction costs and overhead. Marble accents......not marble floors, for ex.

It was freshly painted and newly remodeled. But, it was strangely arranged and starkly decorated with mid-grade furniture. The bathroom had cheaper fixtures and it was here that it was obvious that it was a refurbishment of an 80's hotel......not a complete remodel. Odd, empty spaces. No door to block the light if someone was still sleeping. Bright light spilled through the ill-fitting door to the room from the hallway. The bed was quite hard and the linens and towels were old and rough.", "user": "16lincoln", "date": "October 14, 2013", "id": 181018925}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Our anniversary weekend", "text": "The worst part was the old, clanking air-conditioner and noisy pipes from other rooms or floors!

The location of the hotel is amazing. One of the most beautiful beaches I've seen in the USA. This place is really about the beach and beach activities, which are many. The beach staff is awesome and they go out of their way to attend to every last detail. Ditto the hotel-based staff. Food was pretty good and the decor was nice. Seems much better than your typical Marriott -- more like a Renaissance property or just below a Ritz-Carlton. On the down side, the facilities, which are well maintained -- certainly have an 80s vibe to them. Also, there's little to do on Marco Island besides hang at the beach, which is usually fine with me.", "user": "Andrew G", "date": "October 9, 2013", "id": 180333928}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing Hotel", "text": "My husband and I have traveled and stayed in many resorts both domestic and international. This Marriott is one of the best. Their attention to detail is wonderful. It is very clean, staff is so friendly and they all go out of their way to be helpful. Front desk, especially Angie was always so helpful and friendly. Little touches, such as cool towels handed out at the pool, fresh orange juice samples passed in the morning by the pool , and even freeze pops in the afternoon are some small ways that make this resort special and stand out from the rest. The grounds are amazing and so clean. It really is a treasure , and we will look forward to coming back soon.", "user": "Denise D", "date": "October 7, 2013", "id": 180039183}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Marriott Marco Island ...Oh heck yea!", "text": "The hotel grounda are beautiful, the rooms are clean (bit small but who cares). The food was very good (yes it is expensive your on vacation stay at a budget inn if you are cheap). The pools were awesome and the kids had a blast. My kids are 5 and 8 years old and they jsut had sooo much fun swimming and playing and meeting new friends. Drinks are fantastic (yes expensive your on vacation). The best for last: The beach is just amazing the sand, the water soooo blue you would think you were in the carribean...but you are in the USA baby. I absolutly recommend this hotel, just keep in mind it is procey, but you only live one.

The spa pool area is so very peacful so be sure to enjoy it the day of your service.The beach is incredible and a Catamaran ride is a must. This hotel is within walking distance to restaurant and store off property. Although we did enjoy Finn's located on property. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars for all categories was because they had to shut our power down in our wing twice for about 4 hrs each time.Again Allie was amazing giving us another room for our last day there.", "user": "travelgeek163", "date": "October 1, 2013", "id": 179406263}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We were so spoiled!", "text": "This is a nice property overall. The beach is beautiful, the food is very good and we tried just about every restaurant on the property. However, upon arrival, we were shown to our first room...Immediately I spied a wad of blue bubble gum upon the headboard. How housekeeping missed that I will never know. There was also makeup on the pillowcases. We were disgusted and were given another room next door along with a $50 gift card which we immediately went and used at the tiki bar. This is definitely a family hotel and I love kids...but our family now consists of young adults. There wasn't a night that went by that I did not hear children running up and down the hall. I opened the door and there was a boy all by himself kicking the door beside ours. Then the baby started crying. Every night. We tried the spa. Be forewarned, this is not a top notch spa, just a way to unwind, but they do charge top notch prices. I would definitely skip that. It was not worth what I paid. Judging from the other reviews of this property, I would guess that we just had some bad luck. That happens sometimes. As I said, the beach is incredible, and all in all, how can you not enjoy a vacation at the beach?", "user": "982405", "date": "September 29, 2013", "id": 179108938}], "location": {}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 30, "average": 109, "very good": 477, "terrible": 22, "excellent": 912}, "aka": "Marco Island Marriott Resort, Golf Club Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Welcome to Marco Island Marriott Beach Resort Golf Club and SpaCome kick off your shoes and explore paradise found at this one-of-a-kind Florida resort, now celebrating the completion of a $225 million renovation and redesign that has infused every moment here with the spirit of Balinese beauty, hospitality and well-being - and added even more wondrous experiences to this already acclaimed destination.
