Great breakfast service, mix of fresh fruits and meats, plus English-style bacon and eggs if you're in the mood. Pleasant, attentive staff. Only minus is the cost of wifi.

Some might say it's old fashioned, but for me, it was charming. Don't get me wrong, I love funky modern hotels, but everything about this place just felt homely and right. It's big, but feels like a family run place, with friendly staff from several generations. My room was spacious, and had everything you might need for a few days away - including decent air-con: a necessity in humid June! Breakfast was fresh, with plenty of choice. Has a swimming pool, but didn't use it. Next time I'm in Bonn, I'd have no qualms about coming back here.

The staff were outstanding: helpful, nice, and always available. The hotel felt new, well appointed without being ostentatious, very clean. Bathroom was a mix between European and American. Big, but w/bidet, towel warmers. Only problem (minor) was the bed. Because I asked for a King (other choice was \"double\" which one never knows what one will get in Europe) and so we got essentially a combined twin set. Sadly, they did not have the gap covered, so \"snuggling\" was a bit difficult. Also, the mattresses were rather harder than I like, but we slept great, so it wasn't a huge issue. The other odd thing was the couch & chair in the room were miniature. Like for kids, rather than for adults. But we weren't in the room much, and they weren't uncomfortable, just smaller than normal.
