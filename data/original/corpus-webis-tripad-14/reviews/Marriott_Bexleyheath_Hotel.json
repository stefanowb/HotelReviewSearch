Check in was a breeze, our room was spotless and spacious, We arrived late due to being tied up in London and it was not a problem.The person at the front desk offered to make dinner reservations for us when we inquired about the restaurant's hours. When we arrived in the dining room, we were greeted kindly and throughout our meal the staff was very attentive. The food was excellent. The breakfast in the morning was excellent as well. Chocolate belgian waffles....fantastic! There was at least one function going on while we were there, and other than seeing people arrive as we sat in the lobby, which by the way was also very nice, there was no noise or any other way to tell a party was going on. The only glitch was that due to needing to check out prior to breakfast hours on our second day, we ordered room service to deliver breakfast at 6:00 and when at 6:15 it still had not arrived, we had to call the front desk to inquire about it. It did not arrive until 6:30, making us late checking out, but the person delivering the food waived the tray fee because of the inconvenience. From check in to check out, every person we encountered there was pleasant and helpful and made us feel comfortable and welcome.
