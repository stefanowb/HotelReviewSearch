As we pulled up first impression was that the building looked tired, there were 3 members of staff standing by the front door smoking, which does not give a good impession. We were shown to our room which was in the turret, the room had 3 windows giving views down to the beach, which were nice, but unfortunatly we had to close 2 of the blinds as the people in the next room had a balcony which came across our window, at one time our room and the room next door were one room and had been divided.The shower room was tiny, the top of the toilet cistern was held on with plastic ties. it was very small and had an electric toilet which when flushed made a munching noise, that seemed to go on forever, the lighting in there could be better.

The hotel is situated about a 10 minute walk from Barmouth town centre. It's set back from the main road to Harlech, and has ample free parking. We were greeted by the hotel manager, Steve, who was very welcoming and showed us up to our room. The hotel is full of character and the reception includes a lovely stove, wood-panelled walls, original tiled floors, and stained-glass windows. From the reception we had fairly high expectations for our room, but were left a little disappointed. The room was quite small with a mish-mash of pine furniture. As expected from a turret room it was circular in shape and had several windows with great views over the town. The bathroom was unbearably small - my chin was resting on the sink when sat on the toilet, my husband had to come out of the bathroom in order to get dressed after a shower, and bending over the sink to brush my teeth caused the door to open. To cap it all the electric shredding toilet sounded very much like the opening riff to T Rex's 20th Century Boy (I know, it couldn't have been, as the band wouldn't have managed to fit in the bathroom!!).", "title": "Lovely quiet weekend", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "turkishdelight08", "date": "June 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 132230466}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012", "text": "Really impressed by cleanliness and such a comfortable bed I wanted to take the mattress home.
