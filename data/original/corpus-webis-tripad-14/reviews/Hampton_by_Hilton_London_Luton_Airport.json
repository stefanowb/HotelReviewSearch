The hotel is located at the station so no travel was needed and check in was smooth. The room and the hotel is geared up for business travellers clearly so the multiplicity of plugs was welcome. Especially the one next to the bed for that overnight phone charging. Room was very well appointed and very comfy. Its not a hotel for staying a week as the location is a bit industrial. But commuting to London daily could not be easier and Luton Parkway connects to Kings Cross in 20-30 minutes. Breakfast was a little average but the tables and breakfast room were good. And a \u00a33.50 cost added to your bill and a taxi ordered for the 5 minute transfer to the airport. Fab. All in all, well done for this place guys.

Located within walking distance of the commuter train station. Although it's located close to the airport they've done a good job of soundproofing against airplane noise.Rooms are generally clean for an airport hotel, but not quite as pristine as other Hamptons. Breakfast was nice with hot and cold options, and none of the food was allowed to sit in the warming pans for too long. Really good selection of television stations. Seriously, this matters after you've stayed at a London hotel where there were only four free channels and one was dedicated to airing Big Brother.

Perhaps this wouldn't be such an issue if the in-room guest services and visitor information guide books had any sort of detailed information. None of the staff had any clue about wifi connection problems, specifically about how to connect an iPad or iPhone to the wifi. It took me hours of testing and Googling to sort it out. (Here's a tip: DO NOT connect to hhonors. Use the BTOpenzone.) Finally, they don't offer free or retail items like extra toothbrushes or shower caps.
