The hotel is right on the beach overlooking the Skerries and Dublin Bay and is a marvellous setting with great walks in both directions. We were upgraded to a sea view room on the ground floor on arrival. The room was very comfortable with a garden outside and a 2-seater swing chair outside the French windows. The rooms in that part of the hotel are in an extension and are reached through the Tower Bar/Grill, which is a bit quirky. There is also a separate entrance to the extension from the car park. We had dinner in the hotel - in the Samphire Restaurant - and both the food and the service were first class.
