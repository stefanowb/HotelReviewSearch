Literally every person I encountered was WONDERFUL (bell staff, restaurant staff, front desk, room service, cleaning lady -- EVERYONE). Not to mention they offered complimentary drinks and snacks in the Tai Pan Club everyday (which definitely came in handy). When you have to travel a lot for work, great hospitality makes life that much easier.

I know Washington quite well and enjoy being able to explore different neighborhoods and try new restaurants, but there is none of that in close proximity to the Mandarin. As for the room itself, it was superb, even though the key didn't work in the minibar. My biggest irritation was after taking a great 2 hour hike along the Potomac I came back to the hotel hoping to have a nice brunch outside before my conference began....except that the restaurant closes between 11 and Noon on Sundays?
