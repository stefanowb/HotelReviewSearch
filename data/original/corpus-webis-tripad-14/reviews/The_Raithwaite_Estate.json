In fact, it's the nicest dining experience we've had in quite some time. The grounds and gardens are well maintained and a pleasure to spend time in. Just a couple of little niggles that i'm sure were particular to our room and no reflection on the accommodation as a whole. Our room, although nicely furnished with a beautiful view was a little on the small side. The bed was actually too large for the room and it was difficult to get down one side of it because of the proximity to the wall. The other little thing was the bathroom. Again, it was lovely and very clean but there was no space to put your toilet bag (other than the floor) as there was only a very narrow tiled shelf below the mirror. As I said, I'm sure those little hick-ups were probably particular to our room and I would have no hesitation in returning to Raithwaite or recommending it to others.

Nice touch with a complementary bottle of water each before bed - just what we needed after sampling Poacher's bars yum cocktails. All the staff were really friendly and helpful.
