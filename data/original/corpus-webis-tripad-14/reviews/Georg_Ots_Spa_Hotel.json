The rooms are spacious and our's had a balcony. The bathrooms were nice. The lobby bar services an area where you can drink on the patio or inside beside the fireplace. The fireplace area is outfitted with great reclining \"sofa\" type chairs. The hotel's restaurant serves the included breakfast in the morning and has a great decor. The food is excellent as is the wine selection. The breakfast buffet has a wide variety. The hotel has ample free parking, has a small grocery store nearby and is a 5-10 minute walk from the castle and downtown. The only downside, which cannot really be attributed to the hotel, is that it sits beside a small inlet and the mosquitos there eat you alive. Bring repellent if you plan to hang outside after dusk. Lastly, the women in our party raved about the spa services. These services were quite cheap when compared to US prices.", "title": "Fabulous Hotel, but mind the mosquitos", "user": "capturedplanet", "date": "September 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8720854}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Georg Ots Hotel is situated overlooking the Tori Yacht harbour and the medieval Bishop\u2019s Fort.
