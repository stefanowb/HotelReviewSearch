The location of this hotel is excellent for sightseeing, the opera, and shopping. We were pleased with our room and the breakfast was simple but adequate. The internet access was spotty and the staff person on duty the afternoon of July 17 was unable to help us with securing our travel arrangements the next day. However, when we checked out on July 18, we were very surprised to be charged 124 euro instead of the 93 euro we had been guaranteed by email via our travel agent. The staff person on duty explained that the room we had booked was unavailable at check-in so we were upgraded to a room with a kitchenette (which we never used). Of course, we were not informed of the change at check-in and had no idea that we would be paying an additional 31 euro per night. Consequently, we had to scrape together the additional euro to pay in cash (as that is the preferred method of payment for this hotel) and find an ATM in order to have enough cash to take a cab to the airport to return to the U.S. I have mixed feelings about recommending this hotel as I have never experienced this problem before. We stayed at much nicer places with air conditioning for 120 euro in Munich and Salzburg.", "title": "Double check room rate and room guarantee at check-in", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kathyohio", "date": "July 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 35833289}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "No hotel can beat the location this hotel offers in the heart of Vienna.

The 8-story building with elevator has about 4 rooms per floor, some of which are privately owned apartments, so it feels more like a small apt. building than a hotel. The rooms are clean and quiet. We opted for a quieter back room, even though it had no view, so we could sleep with the windows open (no air conditioning, although they did provide us with a fan--nights were cool, so it was fine.) The staff all spoke fluent English, and called us a cab for us very early the last morning to take us to the airport (although they missed the wakeup call, so bring your alarm clock). Breakfast was quite adequate--rolls, meats, cereals, soft-boiled eggs, juices, coffee/tea. Note that there is no laundromat anywhere in the area, and the hotel does not do laundry, so pack accordingly!
