We are planning on buying a home in the area and we had appts to see various properties. When Peter heard this, he was a great help to us. He and my husband pulled out their iPhones and real estate apps and started scouring the area for places. Peter is well versed on the valley and he pointed us in the direction of some homes he knew about and his favorite areas. When Peter told us he'd remodeled and built some buildings of the Chateau himself, we peppered him with questions on building and California code law. In fact, I'm afraid we kind of hogged Peter the whole time, most likely keeping him from his host duties and the other guests.

When we got there, it was even better than I had anticipated. Peter and Philip were so great. The grounds are beautiful and we sat in probably six different spots in the first hour we were there while we had our fruit, cheese and nut plate (yum!) and a glass of wine. The food was amazing. We went for a walk in the morning through the vineyards and I almost started crying it was so beautiful and perfect.

Chateau de Vie fit all of our requirements and then some. Just off the highway, but seems quite all to itself, surrounded by beautiful gardens, fountains, piped in music, and of course the vineyards at your back door. The proprieters Peter and Phillip, were very friendly and seemed genuinely interested in making our stay a pleasant one. They succeeded. We had the top floor suite and unless you are very tall (angled roof) this is a good choice. The king bed had lots of excellent pillows (sometimes not the case) and the mattress was very, very comfortable. The biggest selling point here however, is the charm of the owners and the effort they have put into the decor and the beautiful outdoor space. There is a spa and a small pool of which we took advantage. Sitting by the pool, reading a book, looking out over the vineyeards with the mountains in the background....that works. Breakfast is on the gourmet side and Phillip puts a lot of work into his dishes. A Spinach, Artichoke and Sun Dried Tomato Fritatta one morning and Scrambled Eggs with Cheese, Taragon, and wonderful mushrooms the next. An Orange Zest Coffee Cake with Creme Fraiche was very tasty as were his Berry Filled Muffins. Chardonnay with breakfast in addition to juice and coffee, OK by us. Wish we could have stayed longer to what more he had in his repotoire. We had friends come over to visit our place before we went out to dinner one evening and Phillip was quick to offer us all a gourmet cheese plate with his Sun Dried Tomato dip and a bottle of their own signature Cab, which was quite good. Phillip's hospitality was overwhelming and our friends were quite impressed. We all chatted about our world travels for sometime. If you prefer a classy, tranquil retreat with gourmet food and personal service over a big resort, then this is your place.
