I have to travel frequently for work and have stayed in some dives for a stupid amount of money (the Best Western in Worthing springs to mind), but the Seagoe is a true gem. The welcome is warm, the rooms are huge and the food is just fantastic. Also you are not paying stupid corporate rates for the pleasure which is just brilliant.
