The room was a 2 bedroom and very generously sized. The kitchen was a little basic for our taste. The TV was well stocked with a range of channels for all countries and preference. No Wi-fi in the room was a disappointment but the Lobby had a strong signal. We had a wonderful sea view and a massive balcony almost as big as the apartment. A little road noise and some building going on but not excessive. I personally found Madeiran cuisine quite limited. The staff were very polite friendly and helpful. The local supermarkets, except for the big one, were woefully stocked with most fridges closed down.

Very room studio overlooking the sea, pool area, sea and a view of the harbour. Accommodation was fine - very spacious and much bigger than we had hoped for. Very quiet and restful. However the whole place is a little higgledy piggledy in that you go into reception, up the stairs to the 1st floor, then across the garden, across a bridge over a road and then another lift down to your studio room. We had an end room which had a semi-circular balcony which was delightful. We were next to the lift which we thought might cause a problem but didn't. Everything worked well within the studio room which included a kitchenette and all the mod cons. Large TV with 70 channels most this time in English. Food in the Yacht Restaurant and Bar was delightful - we only ever ate there at lunch times and the staff were lovely. Overall a lovely stay - thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Madeira which has been about our 8th year.

This is nice, on nice days, but unfortunately it rained a couple if times this trip and going out and across the bridge was a nuisance. They've also dropped the courtesy bus that used to go into the town centre, which is a big loss, although the walk into town alongside the harbour side has been greatly improved by the authorities and is now very pleasant.

I have to say that this is the tattiest apartment we have ever stayed at in over 16 years as timeshare owners. The furniture was tired and dirty - our sofa had ink stains amongs others and the beautiful fabric on the armchairs was dirty - particularly the backs which looked as though the many many years of use have seen some people sitting against them with suncream on (thats all I can imagine). The sofa was so bad, I covered it up with a blanket rather than have to look at it. The kitchen units were peeling so a definite upgrade is required. The air conditioning was useless and wasnt functioning during the night because reception said it was too noisey! The pillows on the beds were awful so never had a decent nights sleep. As an RCI exchangee we were made to feel like 2nd class citizens - made to vacate our room earlier than owners and refused a discount card for use in local restaurants etc.... as we were RCI! Plus we were charged 50 euros per week service charge which I feel is a disgusting addition to the holiday costs and 10 euros per week for a safety deposit box.
