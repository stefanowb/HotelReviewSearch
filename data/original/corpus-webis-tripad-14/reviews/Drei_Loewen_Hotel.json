The beds were comfortable which is always important for me! However, the walls were thin and I can imagine that during a festival there could potentially be noise issues not only in the hallways but outside the hotel. Luckily for us, we weren't bothered by noisy and inconsiderate guests! The breakfast was incredible, down to the frothy hot chocolate, omelettes prepared to order and the huge selection of pastries, meats, and cheeses. Just a stunning and fabulous way to fill up for the day! I must also say that the service was excellent. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready. We said we were happy to wait so they called housekeeping, got them to do it up and got us coffee and tea while we waited. Each and every time we passed a member of staff they greeted us. On the way out, a staff member was in the small elevator (there is only 1) and noticing our luggage, got out and allowed us to go down so we wouldn't have to wait.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Stacey S", "date": "February 28, 2005", "id": 3236690}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Would stay there again", "text": "We stayed for about a week visiting our son who was studying in Munich.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 22, 2005", "id": 3024992}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Three Lions", "text": "The hotel is in a very good location near Haptbahnof to get to the sites in and near Munich using public transportation.
