The rooms are large and well maintained. We had a room on the 2nd floor facing the rear and it was quiet. They don't have microwaves in the rooms or refrigerators but they let us use their microwave in the kitchen. Breakfast was better than you would expect with a decent variety.

We were on the second floor and could hear the people above us moving around - there was a lot of creaking when they walked across the floor. On the \"plus\" side, the room was very quiet and the bed was pretty comfortable. We like to sleep in a very cold room and we were able to turn the AC down quite a bit. The fitness room was excellent. There was a treadmill, recumbent bike, free weights, an ellipitcal and weight training machine. The breakfast was OK, not up to the usual Hampton breakfast, but OK.
