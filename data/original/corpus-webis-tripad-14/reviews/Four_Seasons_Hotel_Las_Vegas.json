The service at The Four Seasons is over the top perfect! We had Presidential Limo. pick us up and take us back to the airport $100 round trip, they were great/prompt. From the minute we exited the car, the attendant at Four Seasons reconized us by name, we checked into our room at 10am. The room was good, great bed, nice bath, nothing to complain about but nothing special, view of pools and mountains, there are nicer rooms in Vegas. Breakfast at the Veranda was perfect, the best eggs I have eaten... we ordered lunch by the pool all 3 days, ordered something different each day and each meal was better than the next, loved the Tuna 3 Ways. The pool attendants were incredible, 8 attendants each day, the pool area is small size so 8 attendants make you feel like everyone gets personal attention. Free ice water w/ lemon that is constantly refilled, evian spritzers on your face, fresh fruit and fruit juices of the day, sunglass cleaning, fresh towels galore, mini massages for your feet and hands, 15 minutes for $35, 30 miniutes for $65 and 45 minutes for $95 include your hands, worth getting every day. We ventured over to Mandalay Bay on day (for 15 minutes) way to crowded, we loved our little corner of the world at Four Seasons. We had SPA treatments 2 days, loved the Dessert Oasis so did my husband. A taxi to Ceasars Shops was only $11+ tip so even though you are at the far end of the strip it's a cheap taxi ride. Here is the best description that my husband came up with, The Four Seasons is \"old money\" not necessarily but the Point behind the saying is true, the Belliago where we've stayed (and loved) is \"new money\". The attention to detail at Four Seasons and the quality of guests are top notch. All the guests were friendly, chatty and we were probably one of the \"poorest\" (everythings relative) couples there.

We were treated to the most fantastic \"free\" firework display on New Years Eve which we watched from our room on the 18th floor. The service at this hotel is faultless. Roomservice plates were removed the second they were placed outside the door. The whole hotel was immaculately clean.

Here's the good and the \"areas for opportunity\". For the most part, service and atmosphere were excellent. Only one exception was dealing with a staff member trying to resolve a billing error. It was unnecessarily difficult and uncomfortable to fix thanks to a not-so-pleasant front desk receptionist. Otherwise, it was refreshing to be treated so well. Christian, a bell stand staff, and May in reception were very pleasant and professional. We paid $100 to upgrade to a larger room. We did not get a strip view. Instead we got a lot of airport noise (starting at 6am Sun-Wed, 5am on Thurs). We were also next to an ice machine/room. A few times during the night we were woken by the noise (either a door slamming or the ice machine). The bed was very nice but not as comfortable as the Signature beds or the LV Westin beds. The rooms were wonderful though. We did have room service several times. Dinners were good but breakfast was overdone and way over -priced. The room service orders were always correct (yay) but we always had to ask for the bill. The server never offered it.
