It was very good - nice bed, which could be separated from the living room (although that made it seem a bit cramped, so we didn't), and good bathroom, living room and kitchen. The balcony would have been nice, but there was (is - probably for the next 9 months) a major building project underway just across the street, so too noisy to use the balcony during the day (and at night, there's a sports centre nearby which can also be pretty noisy!). But a very good location; a Woolworth's already open in the new building opposite (for those from the UK, this is not the 'Woolies' you remember, but a superb large supermarket!) where we bought good food and wine for dining in the apartment, but also restaurants, cafes, bars just a short walk away (the Italian trattoria 'Caffe e Cuccina' is great, and pretty authentic), and trams right outside. Oh, and loads of fashion shops. Excellent if you want to be in the South Yarra or Prahran areas (Prahran market also excellent for food), and trams on Toorak Road will take you to Botanic Gardens and downtown, etc. But Federation Square ain't what it's cracked up to be!", "title": "Good apartment, great location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "salmoneater", "date": "November 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 88195721}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here for 6 nights.
