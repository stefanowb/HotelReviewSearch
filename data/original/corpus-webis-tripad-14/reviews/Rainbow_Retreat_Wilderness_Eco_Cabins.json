The retreat sits within St Patricks Head Private Nature Reserve; you can see for 230 km along the expansive eastern coastline of Tasmania. Voted the best eco retreat and private nature reserve in Tasmania. Rainbow Retreat is a comfortable drive from Freycinet National Park, Wine Glass Bay, Ben Lomond National Park, and the beautiful Douglas Apsley National Park, so why stay in the cold wet and windy south of Tasmania when you can stay on the sun coast, the warm region of Tasmania, local holiday destination for many Tasmanians? The property has been proclaimed by the Tasmanian government as a private nature reserve, the highest conservation listing available. If you are expecting a resort, you will be disappointed as we are a nature retreat; we prefer to cater to nature-based travellers who appreciate the beauty of staying in a true carbon neutral Eco retreat.
