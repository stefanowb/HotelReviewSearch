The rooms are more upscale than a typical Marriott, with wood floors in the entryway to the room and granite in the shower. My room was a little bit bigger than the typical room with enough space for a couch and coffee table without feeling cramped (comparable to NYC Marriott Marquis if you have been there). The landscaping is beautiful, and I loved the outdoor pool area. They had a poolside grill but it was not open when I was there (maybe only on weekends?) There is also an indoor pool and gym. There is an upscale steakhouse in the hotel - I never ate there but ordered room service and it was better than typical Marriott food. Parking is free but not covered.

The TV in my room quit on me and they offered to move me because they could not swap it out. They did come right away and try to fix it but they could not. I did not want to move. It may have been the cable service and luckily, it was fixed by the next day. The thing that I did not like about this hotel is they charge you $12.95 per day for wireless internet access. This is crazy and so I just used my phone to answer some emails while out of the office.

We got a group rate one night because we were there for a seminar, we did ask for the same rate or similar for another night and they could't match it the rate actually doubled the next night.
