The hotel was just as good as the previous reviews say - a huge comfy bed, a great shower in a nice clean bathroom and its location near to numerous busy bars and restaurants was perfect for us, although this might not be to everyone's taste. We were in a room to the side of the hotel (Room 405) overlooking the swimming pool next door, so outside noise was not a factor for us.We didn't eat or drink in the hotel, so can't comment on that but we can certainly confirm that the staff were exceptionally friendly, helpful and professional (particularly Donna who was on reception when we arrived and departed). All in all a super base for us to visit wonderful Durham - I would not hesitate to recommend it and look forward to returning one day.", "title": "Excellent value for money", "user": "NittenStar", "date": "June 18, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 67905778}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Great location handy for shops restaurants, pubs including Wetherspoons.

Hmmmm, didn't factor in chaos round the M20, Dartford Tunnel n M25 after an earlier accident. Thought at this point it might be wise to advise the Premier Inn that we were most definitely goin to be a late arrival. The lady who took my call could not have been more helpful n when I mentioned that we were travellin 300 miles with two 9 year olds n didn't expect to be with her until about 1am she kindly enquired if we would like any sandwiches after our journey n made me aware that the bar would still be open for a well deserved nightcap for us and a hot chocolate for the girls.

Whether asking for an iron, storing the case after check out or calling a taxi, we felt they could not do enough.

You cant get cross with people like that. The room was fine, though I wish they would provide more than one easy chair - and even that is not very comfortable. We were worried about noise from a nearby pub and the heating vents below the window, but the sound insulation must be good as we were not disturbed. The bar and restaurant area looked welcoming and breakfast was good. The location near the centre of the city is good, though it is an arduous walk with a heavy case from the station.
