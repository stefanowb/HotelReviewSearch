In addition to the countless restaurants of all types and price ranges in the Roppongi Hills complex itself and on the main streets, the surrounding neighborhoods, especially the winding, small side streets, are teeming with all the character and charm of modern Tokyo. The small side streets are packed with residential buildings mixed in with (they must have no zoning laws) shops, neighborhood eateries, pastry shops, sake bars, night clubs, live band venues, Parisian style cafes, Italian mini-bistros, sushi restaurants, etc. All this and the electric buzz of Tokyo is right outside your door at the Grand Hyatt.

I highly recommend the high end japanese restaurant on the 4th (or 6th) floor of the hotel connecting the mall (Shinbou may be the name). I had lobster sashimi which is nearly impossible to find in the US. The tail was filled with meat and was separated from the body but the lobster kept moving it's eyes and legs while on ice. Also had fugu (the real deal costs at least $200, mine US$300 for one person at kuromonto near this hotel (5 min taxi).

It has fantastic rooms (although you could spend 10-15 minutes trying to figure out all the knobs and still don't know how to turn the lights on) and its restaurants are amazing. Its location in the Roppongi Hills complex is an added bonus to those who want the convenience of shopping and even more restaurants from which to choose. The only downside is that there is practically no view other than the office buildings next door. The gym and pool is adequate though not amazing.
