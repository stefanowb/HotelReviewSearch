My room overlooked the Homewood Police Department (not too scenic), but there was very little outside noise.

An iron and ironing board would have been nice and the closet was basically a short slanted bar with room for only a few hanging items. Since I was only there overnight, that also was not a big concern. I had a room on the top floor and was very far from the elevator so it was quiet.
