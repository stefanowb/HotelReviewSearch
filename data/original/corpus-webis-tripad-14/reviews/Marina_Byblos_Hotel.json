The hotel is located in the Marina district of Dubai and is a perfect location for the beach, restaurants, yacht club and Dubai Metro (easy to use to get to other main parts of the city including the airport). Non-smoking room was comfortable and clean, looked on to Marina and yachts. Roof top pool good, in the shade mid afternoon but not really a problem. On site restaurants and bar fine, although found breakfast a little expensive for what we had, probably better to go to one of the local eateries near the beach. Found a greet little supermarket (Amalyos I think), just around the corner to the right of the entrance, open 24 hours, serves great vegetable samosas!
