The view from the hotel is fantastic. The staff at the main desk were lovely, extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel has all of the basic amenities for a comfortable stay, and it was nice to have breakfast in a homely breakfast room. Although there wasn't a vast selection for breakfast, it did the job. If you're looking for luxury, then this isn't the hotel for you, since as others have noted, it is quite small and dated.

Went to school in SLO and have stayed in multiple inns/motels and this one is fairly priced for what you get. The quality of the Peach Tree is comparable to other in its price range. Parking is great, as each room has a spot virtually right out front. Stayed in a king room in the older part of the inn. Old and outdated decor but that's no big deal for me. Found the room to be dark unless you drew the curtains. Bathroom was very modest but larger than some chain hotels I've stayed in. The bathroom was very well lit. The entire room was clean and serviced promptly every day. I found the bed to be very comfortable and slept well every night. The wall heater was not working when we were there which was fine because it was a hot weekend, but it would clearly need attention in the winter. We paid $129/night with a buy 2, get 3 nights free promotion, so we effectively paid $86/night. The Peach Tree completely met my expectations for a motel in this price range. It also offered a complementary breakfast which I was completely satisfied with. It offered muffins, cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs and coffee/tea. Cookies and snacks were offered throughout the day which was very nice.
