I also wanted a hotel that had the option of breakfast and possibly a restaurant. This hotel met all my needs perfectly. The superior single was certainly big enough and would have even been fine had I been traveling with my partner. The room smelled nice and clean, the linens felt fresh, it had a bathrobe, and they clean linens daily if I needed it.

It was a bit fancier than I'm used to but it was the staff that turned me off \u2013 they were loitering and staring me down as I ate which was unnerving (initially I was alone in the restaurant). I also wasn't sure how to eat everything the right way (since I ordered some French foods) and the staff in the restaurant didn't really know English - one gentleman did but only basic words - making my restaurant experience a bit difficult. Most of the other restaurants I ate in within France were a better experience than this one.

We dined in the superb restaurant most nights and had booked in advance for the Xmas Eve special dinner. The food served every night was awesome and although not cheap was very generous in portion sizes and well worth every penny along with the fantastic Alsace wines.
