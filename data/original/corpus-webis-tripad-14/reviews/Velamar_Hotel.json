Just around the corner is Soft Caffe which is run by a lovely family and the son Bruno is the waiter his mum makes lovely food and cakes and this is worth a try but we would not recommend you visit 3 Marias as it was not a nce experience, staff were nice but food and decor were awful!

Couldnt fault the cleanliness (although there was a black rim of dirt around the pool's water level), and we had a bad problem with flies around the pool (you couldnt relax cos you were always squatting the pesky things - it was probably due to the fact that some of the houses next to the hotel kept chickens and other animals). The breakfast food was delicious (didnt like the jam and marmalade though and there could have been some eggs) - there was always a queue for the toaster though (for the number of guests, there should have been two of them - it only did 6 slices at a time!). The staff were really friendly and efficient. What really spoiled it though was the noise at night and early mornings - we had asked when booking (6 months prior) for a 'quiet' room but on arrival were allocated a room directly outside the lifts!!! We asked to be moved, but were told the hotel was full - we also had a room underneath one of the main hotel air-con units which was going on and off all night. Each room has TILED floors - which is probably ok for the cleaners, but makes the acoustics of the rooms horrendous - you can hear TV's, people shouting to each other (some were really inconsiderate that people may be sleeping), furniture scraping across the tiled floors and people walking about.- there should be carpets in the rooms. The beds werent that comfy (2 singles pushed together that had mattresses so hard I was in pain. Also, the room doors slamming gets on your nerves - the doors have entry 'cards' but to close them on exit you need to use the card as well to take the lock off - most people were just slamming them shut! On our side of the hotel there were some villas (5 in total, which had about 8 dogs between them) so all we could hear was dogs barking (one barked, which set them all off and the owners didnt seem to give a s**t). If the hotel were to make a few changes to eliminate the noises, it would be a lovely place to stay - they could also do with putting on lunchime and evening meals, as it was a pain to have to go out of the hotel every night just to have a meal. Local restaurants are very good - Tiffanys (Indian), Cozy (Chinese) had lovely food but if you want a good meal deal, go to the 3 Marias further down.", "title": "value for money but poor location", "user": "alanreay", "date": "October 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 83709725}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "What can I say that hasn't already been said, this hotel really is value for money, great staff, good location, not far from the main town of albufeira on the local bus link... lots of attractions nearby which you can avail off.
