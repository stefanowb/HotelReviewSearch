There are trolleys, but we usually walked. The buffet breakfast was very good, included in room price. The room we had was pretty small, and there was no A/C, not much of a problem in October, but the open window brought a little street noise in. The hotel has a contract with a taxi service, which we used to go to the airport, to avoid the problem issue of Czech cabs. There was an outstanding little mexican restaurant on the way walking to old town, just before the Subway Resaturant. I would probably stay at another hotel closer to the action and get a bigger room, we had our 13 month old daughter, so the hotel provided crib took up some space.", "title": "Nice, but not spectacular", "user": "Herk_Driver", "date": "February 10, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4452072}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Premier Kinsky Garden for three nights in early November, and would happily go back again. The hotel is not in the center of town--it's south of Mala Strana Square on the left side of the river--but is easily reached by taking Tram 12 to the Svandovo stop, then walking one block up the hill, across from the park. We booked our room through the Best Western web site for 95 Euro a night including breakfast, and were given a very nice, high-ceilinged room at the front of the hotel. But because we thought it would be noisy at night since the hotel is on a busy street, we asked to move, and were given a slightly smaller but still nice room at the back of the hotel. No view, but we could open the window in the evening to keep cool and it was still very quiet.", "title": "Very nice hotel", "user": "toughbutfair", "date": "December 2, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4158821}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Just average", "text": "The staff was friendly and offered suggestions for sightseeing, etc., and when we needed to buy a few odds and ends they pointed us toward a large, modern shopping center about four blocks south of the hotel, with an impressive array of restaurants and shops.
