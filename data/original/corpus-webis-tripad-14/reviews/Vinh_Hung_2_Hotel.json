The breakfast is adequate but pretty boring after 2 or 3 days - there was very little choice.

The swimming pool is refreshing and the restaurant has an extensive reasonably priced menu. The staff are very friendly and the buffet breakfast is plentiful and constantly topped up so food is always fresh. Due to the design of the hotel noise does echo and there is a constant problem with water pressure (we tried out three rooms during our stay and all had the same problem) as showers pumped out either scalding hot or cold water and the water could not be regulated no matter how hard we tried. Top floor rooms tend to be noisy because of the water pump and also dusty because of the open eaved ceilings. Bed linen is a little tired (some stained and holey) but the housemaids seemed oblivious to this when making up the beds!

I noticed one or two small insects in the bed, but on closer inspection it turned out that the headboard was literally crawling with bedbugs and eggs. There were also tell-tale black marks on the headboard and sheets - bedbug excrement. We asked to see a manager with a view to changing rooms, but the night receptionist said that nobody was available and that we could not change rooms. He then sprayed the headboard with a foul smelling insect repellent (which, we have since discovered, is the worst thing you can do. The bugs potentially scurry into your cases away from the poison). We had to pull the bed away from the headboard, which revealed months worth of dust behind the bed, and sleep with out pillows at the other end of the bed.
