Awful musty smell, bugs in bed and on ceiling, bed was broken (had to put an ice chest underneath in order to be able to use bed.) We had non-smoking room, but smokers were all around the room we were in. In fact, they had pulled chairs from the room outside, so they were smoking both inside and out. So, of course, the smoke was everywhere, not to mention that there was 4 or 5 people sitting outside their room smoking, which happened to be right next to our room. We have stayed at many places at the Cape, and this was by far the worst experience we have ever had. We paid $130 per night plus taxes and fees, which was absurd. This is at best a $39 dollar \"hotel.\" Also, if you are not in your room by 9:00 at night, it is almost impossible to find a place to park your car.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "shelbasto", "date": "August 17, 2007", "id": 8443498}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This Howard Johnson is exactly what you'd expect for the price.

It's definitely not somewhere to stay if you're going to be hanging around in your room for great lengths.

We walked in the hotel room had a funny odor to it, there was no screen door so if you wanted to open the sliding door bugs would come in, the bathroom was probably the nicest part of the whole place. My friend and I came back to the hotel late and just passed out then I woke up the next morning to find ANTS in the BED!!! I was disgusted wondering how many were actually in there, then i went to grab some stuff out of my bag and there were ants crawling up the bag and more climibing up the bed. So of course I said something when I was checking out and the guy who was i guess the manager didnt seem to care he goes well its probably just from food, which we didnt have any of he goes from the people before you then, which to me implies they really didnt clean the room good to prevent ants. So the next day I called because i was bothered by this and wanted them to maybe adjust the amount that I paid the manager told me he would look at the papers and call me back, so almost 2 hours went by i heard nothing so i called back and he said he still hadnt done anything and if i wanted he would refund me a whole ten dollars which to me is unacceptable so he said to give him till five to call me back so in the mean time i called howard johnson services to file a complaint, i waited for my return call which came around 430 he said he could give me 10% off my next stay, a place I never will stay again so how was that going to help me so I said just take the amount off what i paid and he said he couldnt do that i said well you said you would refund me 10 dollars earlier he goes that was then and this is now and since you called customer services and filed a complaint this is all Im going to do cause you filed the complaint, so in the end i got a nights sleep with ants and nothing from the hotel cause they just didnt care. I also asked if i could speak with the owner he said NO i said what is the owners name he said I cant give you that he has too much to deal with basically telling me that I wasnt a important customer! SO MY RECOMMENDATION IS STAY SOME WHERE ELSE THERE ARE MANY OTHER PLACES TO STAY! If you want to sleep with ants this is the place to be, but your probably better off camping out somewhere than here!", "title": "Ants in the Bed...Don't Stay Here!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "ashwee", "date": "July 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5506105, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 NOTHING", "disliked": "\u2014 EVERYTHING"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "I had an early check-in and as I was doing so a couple were checking out and told the desk clerk that the light over their bathroom sink was burnt out. When I got to my room the light over the bed was burnt out. I thought how many other rooms had burnt bulbs. The room was an average size with okay furniture and appeared clean at first but the bathroom door was covered in fingerprints and filthy. All the chrome fixtures such as towel racks and kleenex dispenser where covered in rust. The whole bathroom area was less then pleasant. The small fridge was very old and rusting. The A/C and heating unit was also very old and very loud. There was no way a person could sleep with the A/C on. It was hard to even hear the TV when the A/C was on. The worst thing about the room was I opened the window for air as the A/C was so loud and before I went out for dinner I shut the window but could not get the latch to lock the window. As I was fiddling around with the lock a young man walked by and said something to me. I opened the window and he asked if I was having a problem with my window locking as he had the same problem in his room. I called the front desk and their response was that there was a screen on the window and the area was very safe. I left the next morning and went down the street to the Town and Country Inn to a much nicer and cleaner room for $20.00 less. Avoid this Howard Johnsons. I think it used to be called the Lewis Bay Inn as my Visa receipt showed that name.", "title": "Much better motels nearby", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Hudson99", "date": "June 17, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 5356620}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Hardworking owners, patchy product", "text": "This is a family run independent motel, within a strip of what seems like 100 others in West Yarmouth.
