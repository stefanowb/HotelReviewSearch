Our first time and definitely not our last. We booked the oceanview Penthouse Suite to celebrate our birthdays. The bedroom was so spacious and beautifully decorated. The living room facing the ocean was a great bonus room. We enjoyed watching the ocean waves and the view of the sunrise in the morning. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Chelsea Prime. The food was phenomenal. My husband said it was the best filet mignon he had ever had. We had exceptional service everywhere we went. Mike, the Manager at Chelsea Prime, came to the table to introduce himself and verified that all was well with dinner and we were enjoying ourselves. The hotel was super clean and spotless everywhere, even the bathroom tile shined. The check in process by Darrell and check out by Monique were both smooth and timely and both were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Bellman Bill was also very friendly and the valet staff was efficient. The Chelsea is located right next door to the Tropicana for gaming and shopping and in the evening we walked the boards. It is only a ten minute walk to the Pier. We enjoyed a stroll on the beach in the morning after a wonderful breakfast at Tepitsky's.

AC was about an hour and a half from my next day's appointments, so it was a reasonable excursion to have a nice dinner and do a little gambling in my off hours. I travel to AC a few times a year but have never stayed at a property on the boardwalk. I booked an ocean view room for $159. The hotel is just as described on its website. The decor of the lobby reminded me a bit of a W Hotel layout and styling. You have to valet park which was fine and service was prompt and attentive. Check in was smooth, but there was no orientation to the hotel's amenities. I found out independently that the bar/lounge was not open during the week and the nice meal I'd planned to have turned out to be fish and chips in the empty diner style restaurant in the motel side of the hotel. This is not a knock against my stay as its clearly mid-week and off-season and the staff was highly competent in every engagement I had with them. My room was slightly smaller than I expected and had an odd oversized floor lamp stationed in the middle of the window area which I had to move to the side of the room to have my ocean view unobstructed. The bed was very comfortable and I have to say that the room service breakfast was better than average and not over-priced. I did not use the gym, so cannot comment on it. I would recommend the Chelsea based on price and level of service. You can also walk down the boardwalk to Tropicana, Trump and Ceasar's to gamble as Chelsea has no gaming.", "user": "Farmerica", "date": "October 27, 2011", "id": 119814513}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Staff, Great Room", "text": "I came up to The Chelsea last weekend to see a show at the House of Blues.

We arrived on a Monday and had a fantastic stay in this very posh AC hotel. If you're looking for trendy and elegant, you will not be disappointed. This hotel is far better than any AC casino hotel I've stayed. If you like the idea of being in AC but do not want to stay at a casino, this hotel is for you. The valet parking was a surprise and it was the same price to park here as it is to self park in the AC casinos. Check in was a breeze, and even though we arrived a couple hours before the check in time, they took care of us and found two rooms. We stayed on the Luxe side of the hotel. The pool is the BEST in Atlantic City. Take a look at the photos on their website, they speak volumes for the atmosphere at the 5th floor pool. The pool service was also excellent. The chaises were ready to go with terry-cloth covers and towels for headrests. Unlike other reviews, the pool was fully staffed, on a Monday, the bar had ample mixers and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. If you're looking for great pool food, you will not be disappointed. The burgers were outstanding and don't forget to try the Maryland fries! We played pool in the Game Room and had very potent drinks at the Chelsea Prime bar. Hey, if you're paying $10 for a drink, it better be good and these drinks did not disappoint. The Oysters Rockefeller at the bar were also quite enjoyable. Our room was clean and I have to mention how comfortable the beds are. If you like a great bed and nice linens, you'll have a great night's sleep here. With the comfortable bed and room darkening drapes, we even slept in. The breakfast at Teplitzky's was a treat. You can eat on the diner side or the very cool open air side. The food was great and Diana, our waitress, was excellent.

The hotel itself was cute and trendy and had a very cool retro vibe. We checked in late (2:30am) and had no problem with the valet or the front desk finding our reservation. What was a problem was the girl at the front desk told us about the Club on the 5th floor and said she was trying to find us a room on the higher floors because of the noise, once she hands us our room key she tells us our room is on the 5th floor - I then asked \"uh you couldn't find anything higher up?\" to that she just said \"no, that's all that is available.\" I wasn\u2019t about to challenge that at 2:30am so we go to the 5th floor to which the elevator open to a nightclub, totally confused we interrupt a bouncer in the process of kicking some guy out \"where are the rooms?\" There are no rooms on the 5th floor, we show him our room keys and he tells us our room is the on 18th floor. Now we both swear up and down she told us that our room was on the 5th floor, not that big of a deal just a hassle and annoying. Once we got to our room it was adorable, clean, and had an amazing mini bar with beer, wine, sodas, and snacks - oh and a price list for it all which you don't see very often. The bed was very comfortable and because we were so tired the throbbing cheesy club music didn't really bother us, but even on the 18th floor we could hear it - loudly. I was also woken up by what I assume was a hotel worker whistling in the hallway at 6am for what seemed like an hour. Checkout was very easy, I just called the front desk to let them know and our car was brought around quickly. Overall not too bad of a stay. The hotel is very hip and interesting but lacking in the functionality department, we are really easy going so we overlooked the noise but I know most wouldn't.", "title": "Cute, trendy, but not quiet...", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Koki18", "date": "July 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 35392045}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "Believe the negative reviews that you read - they are all true.

The room and bed were very comfortable and the bathroom sparkling. The only complaint I have is that the air conditioning must be the original from when it was a Holiday Inn.

The bartender's service was ok early in the afternoon when it wasn't busy. But later when a small after work crowd arrived around 6pm I was ignored for almost 15 minutes. I left the bar without being served after having already spent $75 on drinks earlier and went elsewhere.
