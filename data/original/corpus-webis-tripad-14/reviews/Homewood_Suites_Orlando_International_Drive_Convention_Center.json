We eventually got to sleep but were woken by someone banging on our door at 6:30am. It was a maid wanting to clean our room!! I said we are still in bed and she practically ordered us to be out the room by 7:30!!! We couldn\u2019t believe the attitude. We decided to go to Magic Kingdom and take advantage of the free Disney transport. We went to front desk and, yes you guessed it, greeted by the same receptionist as before. We asked for the free coach and she informed us that the free shuttle was only available on certain days and that today we would have to pay!! We were disgusted.

We got back from the theme park to discover a watch of my husband\u2019s had gone missing.

During this time rooms were not cleaned well or simply not cleaned at all, the broken electrical things were never fixed or replaced, loud music and noise went on till all hours with nothing being done.

Once I returned everything was fine, but agent forgot to redeem my special rate promotion and I needed to go back to ask. SHe did apologize, but I'm glad I remembered to ask!! Breakfast was just OK, I think sue to the large amount of people and I skipped the receptions all together, once again due to the large amount of people. The rooms were OK, and nice amenities, however the desk is located immediately next to the door. Poor design and found I wasn't comfortable using it.
