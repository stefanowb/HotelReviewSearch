McDonald's and Black Angus just a few hundred yards walk away, along with a dive shop to rent gear. Plenty of free onsite parking. 5 minute drive north of Kaanapali. We like being away from the crowds and hustle and bustle of Lahaina and Kaanapali, but close enough to drive there.

This beachfront community is the calm cousin to West Maui\u2019s high-profile destinations of Lahaina, Kaanapali and Kapalua Resort. You won\u2019t find the typical string of Maui hotels, dazzling storefronts, and streams of shoppers and diners \u2013 although that\u2019s only a few minutes away if the mood strikes. Instead, step into casual comfort at Outrigger Royal Kahana, a pleasant Maui condo that takes full advantage of its discreet Kahana setting. Welcome the sun on a morning stroll chasing waves along the sand. Breathe in the breeze that sweeps across the ocean view from your high-rise lanai. Marvel at humpback whales slapping and rolling so close to shore!"}
