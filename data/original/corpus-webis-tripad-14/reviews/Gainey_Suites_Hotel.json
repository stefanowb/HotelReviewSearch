The hotel provides a buffet breakfast included which is fine, cold juices and coffee seems to be available free all day and canapes are provided in the evening with complimentary wine and beer. The rooms are nicely presented and have comfortable beds with good amenities and a nicely appointed useable kitchen area with full size fridge freezer.
