We stayed in the Flying Jib room on both stays, and were not disappointed. In addition to its harbor view, the purple walls and modern and interesting furnishings were a welcome change from the \"fussy doily\" look in many B&Bs. There was plenty of space to relax when we wanted a break from the festival, and it was an easy walk from the B&B to anywere in town. The Addington Arms rates a best B&B bathroom award for its gorgeous sea green mosaic tile walls and nifty looking tile floor.

The room faces a busy street, therefore, the thoughtfully provided sound machine comes in handy if you like to sleep with the windows wide open (as we do).
