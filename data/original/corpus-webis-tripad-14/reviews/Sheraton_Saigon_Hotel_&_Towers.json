I really can not sya a good thing about the experience. You can judge a hotel on how they deal with complaints, and when things go wrong.

OLD. My first room smelled like a basement and when I mentioned it they offered me a room in the Grand Tower for $75 more a night. I went in the saw the room... while it was quite nice... it was NOT worth the extra money. This hotel is the WORST Sheraton Hotel I have ever been to in Asia. Not only was the hotel just OLD the service was terrible. The concierge could not suggest any restaurants and could hardly speak English. He also seemed to careless about helping us. I am VERY disappointed in this hotel and would suggest people stay other places if they want true service. I could have overlooked the oldness of the hotel if the service was what a \"5 star\" hotel should be. I am a starwood platinum member and very rarely leave a property unhappy.

There were actually a total of four tv`s in the room. (two in the living room,one in the bedroom and one small in the bathroom). The lounge is really nice. Good selection of breakfast,afternoon tea,and then from five to eight,free drinks and a good selection of food. After the intense traffic and horn blowing in Ho Chi Minh,it was so nice to get back to the calm atmosphere of the Towers lounge. They also had a good selection of movies for borrowing. Great for my daughter before going to bed... The swimming pool area is a little dark and boring,but the gym looked good and was actually quite busy while we were there. We did not use any of the other restaurants at the hotel ,so this review is basically only for the new tower area. Everything was really nice ,clean and fresh. Lovely ,big towels.
