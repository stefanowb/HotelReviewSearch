Pleasantly surprised to be sent to El Cortijo Blanco, San Pedro - a couple of bus stops up main road from Puerto Banus. No airconditioning and can be very busy at weekends due to influx of Spaniards but our week overall was very enjoyable. Good location, approx 5 mins walk down the side road to lovely promenade and grey sand beach and bus stop yards away to take us to Puerto Banus, Marbella. We're veggies but self-service food was fine (lovely salads), bar open from 1000 until midnight! The entertainment team work hard too - several professional shows laid on during our week of a good standard. 3 pools to choose from, one much quieter than the other 2. San Pedro a short walk up the road is worth a visit too. This Pretty hotel has well maintained gardens etc and the rooms were cleaned daily. Pueblo style with blocks of ground floor and first floor rooms. Ideally suited for all including wheelchair users, families with children.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "rosetaylor", "date": "July 2, 2006", "id": 5417339}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2004", "text": "before i start to write this i am TRYING to think of some good points............................................................................. still trying!", "title": ":( bad bad bad bad bad bad", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "pammymt", "date": "June 22, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 5373720}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "loved everythink", "text": "ANTS!
