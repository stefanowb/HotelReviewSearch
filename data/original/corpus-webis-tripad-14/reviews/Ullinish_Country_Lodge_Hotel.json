From the moment we walked in we knew we were in for a treat! The reception was friendly & quick then we were invited to get settled in our room & then come down to the lounge area for tea. We were booked in the Johnson room. It had a wonder Cuillin views the en suite bath was very roomy and there was a tray with brandy, waters, and coffee/tea service! When we arrived in the lounge for tea there was a cozy fire going and a great spread for tea time! We went on a great walk after tea then back to get ready for dinner. We were greeted at the restaurant with a welcome drink and canap\u00e9s then taken to our table. The ambiance of the restaurant was wonderful and was the food & the wind list! The only problem I had was with leaving! We really would have liked to stay another night, but I will be booking a return trip soon!", "title": "Regimented hotel in a beautiful setting", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "angi01", "date": "September 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 177220640}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 11, "very good": 21, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 82}, "aka": "Ullinish Country Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.166666666667}
