I'm giving them two stars instead of one because they didn't charge us for the second night even though we didn't leave until 2:45 because our next hotel wouldn't let us check in until 3. The main problem with the Georgian is that it has absolutely no working internet. None. They advertise free wifi. But don't believe it. They know they don't have it. We both need to work while we're on this nice two-day getaway for my husband's birthday. Not a lot but we both need internet access. It worked for maybe 1 minute yesterday, then nothing. We spent hours today (stupidly) trying to get it to work. I called the front desk and first they said \"did you try the backup network?\" Then they guy said he'd look into it but he never called back. The other big problem is that, while the ocean view suite we got was spectacular (and pretty cheap at $360 a night), the sheets had holes in them and when we got into bed last night we saw that there were all sorts of faded stains under the covers. Has this place really spent a bunch of money rennovating, but then totally cheaped out on clean, new sheets? What hotel actually puts sheets on their guests' bed with holes and stains? I have photos but it's gross and so I opted not to post them. We moved to the Fairmont which is a beautiful oasis. We also got a suite here for only $20 a night more, and when we told them about our experience at the Georgian the front desk guy threw in free internet for us! I'm so happy now. My computer works, we're still in a nice big suite, the Georgian graciously didn't charge us for the 2nd night, and I'm going to the bar in a minute at the Fairmont for a nice, relaxing drink in beautiful surroundings.

Despite that, there is a lot of great things about the hotel - rooms are very nicely decorated, comfortable beds, the Art Deco history has been well preserved and has a lot of charm, and everyone was very friendly. Bathrooms are small but cute. The best thing the hotel has going for it though is it's location. Absolutely I'd stay again, but I'd know I need to pay a bit more attention to service requests.", "title": "Charming Hotel, Fantastic Location", "user": "SarniaCI", "date": "February 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 54908387}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was a return trip for me to The Georgian Hotel but on this occasion I was travelling alone and I would not hesitate to recommend it to solo travellers. This hotel has an individual style which makes a pleasant change from the usual characterless chains and the staff are genuine, helpful and friendly. I had a good-sized room with beautiful linen and wonderful views over the ocean & Santa Monica pier. The Veranda Cafe is a great place to people watch and the prices are very reasonable. I would recommend enjoying a cocktail there while watching the sun setting through the palm trees. The hotel is located a convenient three minute walk from the Third Street shopping area which was ideal for dropping off shopping bags.", "title": "Perfect location, beautiful hotel", "user": "mscaccia", "date": "January 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 54871945}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Santa Monica"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 57, "average": 136, "very good": 471, "terrible": 25, "excellent": 681}, "aka": "Georgian Santa Monica", "slim_ranking": 0.117647058824, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}}
