The location is absolutely perfect. We were able to dine and shop on funky 4th Ave., visit the open-air bars in the university district, and attend UA football, all within suitable walking distance.

When you encounter these things in the beginning, then you start adding up the other failings: coffee maker but no pot or coffee for that matter; drawers that had crumbs and \"things\" left behind; water cooler that only dispensed hot water, not chilled; electrical outlet with no cover, leaving exposed wires; no soap even though there was an empty dispenser sitting by the sink for 3 days. All giving the feeling of neglect and kind of leaves you a \"creepy\" feeling that it hadn't been cleaned since the last guest check out. About Laslo (we are most assuredly cat-lovers, sharing our home with 2 felines) although he is a sweet cat, he obviously has peed in the entry and possibly in our private bathroom upstairs as the distinct odor was very prominent in both places during our stay.", "title": "Charming", "user": "Sarah C", "date": "October 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180817689}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "It doesn't please me to point out these things because I truly believe that the owners care deeply about this place and are doing the best they can.
