We tried to cancel 48 hours in advance and they denied it stating their policy was 3 weeks in advance. The cottages sit on top of a hill but at the bottom is the freeway. Despite the cool temps at night we had to keep the fan on the a/c running to drown out the trucks on the highway. No, I would not recommend this place.", "title": "beware of cancellation policy", "user": "four-from-nc", "date": "July 31, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 36352741}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed here for one night because the red roof inn across the street was full. The inn looked ok from the outside. They told me all they had was a cabin available for 118.00 a night so I took it even though I thought it was a bit high considering they didn't even have a pool. As I was bringing a few of my things into the cabin the owners children all came over and watched.The cabin wasn't really a cabin it was a detached hotel room. It was very run down but pretty clean.It had 2 double beds and a very old fridge and microwave. The furniture looked like it was all found at yard sales mismatched and saggy.each window had a curtain that was too small for it. The bathroom was very small with a very homemade shower the walls didn't touch anything so water went everywhere. spiders in the corners in the bathroom.They had a free cont. breakfast that consisted of coffee and fruitloops but they had no milk to offer. They had an ice machine outside with some bugs in it and a soda machine.Most of the cabins have people living in them year round. I asked the owners about some local places near by but they weren't very helpful and it was very hard to understand them. I will never stay here again.", "title": "Very overpriced", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "desireme98", "date": "August 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 8408729, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Leaving", "disliked": "\u2014 price"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Don't stay there !!!
