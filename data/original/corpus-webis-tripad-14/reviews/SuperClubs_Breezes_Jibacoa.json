My husband and I got an ocean view room that came with a fully stocked mini bar with juice, water, mineral water, pop and diet cola.

They really were making an effort to make the food as tasty as possible considering their limited supply of seasonings. We had an excellent roast beef dinner one night , and a turkey dinner another. The seafood night was not so great as every thing was far over cooked and it was a realy shame that all that fresh seafood was dry and almost tasteless. I also found the pork, fish and chicken on the buffet line was over cooked all the time. The Italian a la carte was really good and we ate there two nights...the air conditioning was so nice, the service was exceptional and our steaks were very well cooked to our order and juicy and delicious. Many people talk bout the breakfasts being the best meals...I disagree...I didn't really enjoy the breakfast offerings...but by the third day had settled on a meal that suited me....dry ww toast (two trips through the toaster was required to actually toast it), a fried egg over easy (just ask the omlete guy..he will gladly cook it for you)..on slice of carefully selected bacon (it tended to be quite fatty if you weren't careful) and the fresh oj (this juice is divine and superior to anything we get here in Canada), papaya slices and cappuccino (which you get at the lobby bar). I have to finish this section by saying that the bread and buns in Cuba are the best I have ever eaten...just incredible...so if nothing else suites you...make a great sandwich from some of the meat available from the buffet. The pasta bar at dinner and lunch was ok and if you explained to the chef exactly how you wanted it ...he did his best to accomodate...things like extra garlic...or cooked in butter rather than oil...you can request and he will do for you.", "title": "Wonderful relaxing vacation and great value for dollar", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "canadiantennisgirl", "date": "July 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 17793826, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Close location to Havana and relaxing atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Resort could use some updating and is showing it's age but still clean and maintained."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "SERVICE: the service at this resort was exceptional and I don't understand the people that have come here and complained about it...if you are getting poor service I think it is more a reflection of they type of person YOU are than the staff.
