Everything is opulent, marble bathrooms, beautiful rooms, the spa centre is to die for, the food in the restaurant is the best we had throughout Vietnam, one thng I would like to see is some western food on the menu, it is all vietnamese which is fine because that's where you are but I was dying for a hamburger and there is really nothing in Hue that you can get anything decent. The resort is out of town, but they have a shuttle bus and are very accomodating in this regard, as we just wanted to chill out it was no problem, 2 swimming pools and the spa centre accomodated our 15 year old daughter quite nicely.
