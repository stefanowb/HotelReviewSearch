However, one little piece of additional info would have made a world of difference. We asked if there were \"ocean-view\" units available and were told there were no ocean-view units in the resort at all. In fact, the resort is bordered on three sides by a golf course, over which you can see the ocean. Instead, we were directed to an interior spot with what had to be the noisiest air conditioning unit on the planet. If you go, ask for the rooms overlooking the golf course.
