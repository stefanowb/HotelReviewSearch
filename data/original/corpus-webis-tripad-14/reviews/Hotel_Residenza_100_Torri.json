Public rooms and reception spacious and interesting but our room was a little on the small side for a 4 star hotel. We had difficulty getting the air conditioning to get the room temperature to a satisfactory level and were surprised at the lack of in room information. Also we were not briefed that the door electronic card also operated the hotel entrance door and had to wait a liong time to get back in the first evening.
