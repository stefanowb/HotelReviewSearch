I was looking for a place that would be decent after I traveled half a day to reach it but it didn't need to have a lot on offer as I was only staying a night. The location next to the train station gave me pause at first but made no difference in the end. This hotel is well maintained and the staff is very attentive. They placed me in a smoking room and when I asked to move they took care of it immediately and even gave me a better room. The hotel is well located for transport and walking around the center of Torino. The breakfast that is included with the room is also another positive. It was a pretty impressive spread for a hotel of this type. Eggs, pastries, fruit, cheese, yogurt. I have stayed in better places with worst breakfast. Torino is definitely worth a visit with lots of historical sites, good shopping and a local vibe almost everywhere you go. If I head back I'll probably look to book this place again.
