I had read reviews saying that staying on the Edgeware Road side was noisy, well hello, you,re in London, what do you expect? the tweeting of birds and hooting of owls!!?? with the double glazing you could hardly hear any outside noise and with the air conditioning you really didn't need the windows open.

Room was fine, but lack of air conditioning on the top floor a real disadvantage when the weather is really hot (it is sometimes!). Fan is provided but not ideal. Air conditioning fans from neighbouring buildings are also quite noisy in the rooms at the back, but this is a common problem anywhere in London. Staff as usual are very helpful and friendly, and the situation is convenient for the West End in particular. Lovely also to be able to wander in Hyde Park in the evenings before dinner! Upgrade priorities: in room phone, decent mirror, more electric sockets and small fridge.
