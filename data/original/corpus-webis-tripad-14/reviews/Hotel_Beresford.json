Since we were just meeting a friend and needed a place to sleep, I wasn't looking for anything fancy. Generally, the hotel was exactly what I expected. It is an older hotel, but the staff was friendly and it is in a great location. Upon arrival, we were asked to double park in front of the hotel while the valet parking attendant arrived (15-20 minutes). It was traffic hour and we did not feel comfortable doing this, so that caused some tension for the employee who was in charge of this....but he found a place for us in front of a nearby garage temporarily. Other than that, all employee's were very friendly. The hotel looks nice even though the decor has not been refurbished for some time. Going up to our room, there was an \"old\" smell. I am very sensitive to smells, so this was a little bothersome for me. My husband said he liked it and it reminded him of his grandparents home. The decor of the hotel is outdated: older - but good quality and clean carpet, wall paper, etc. Our room was clean. We asked for two twin beds because this hotel does not have King or queen beds, and the two of us on a double just didn't sound good. The beds were comfortable, more so for me I think, as I am small. The bathroom was basic, but fine. There was shampoo, conditioner and soap available. I asked for a QUIET room, as I don't like to be interupted when I sleep, so they put us on the 6th floor facing a non-vehicle alley which was, indeed, quiet. Breakfast consisted of Cold cereal (3 choices), whole fruits (oranges, apples and bananas), tea, coffee, juice and cocoa, and pastries (croissants and swirl fruit-in-the-center type). The surrounding area of the hotel is fine - I felt perfectly safe walking at night.", "title": "As Expected", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "S_Simon", "date": "July 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5494817}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006, traveled on business", "text": "Overall, the hotel is fine for an overnight stay.
