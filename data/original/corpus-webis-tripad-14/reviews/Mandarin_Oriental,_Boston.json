I have stayed in many hotels but this was a 5 star experience. I was very impressed from beginning to end. As I made my through the hotel, the hallways, the common areas, I kept noting how clean, and quiet the hotel was. The room was large, CLEAN and quiet. Great bathroom, great shower (how rare is that in a city hotel?). The staff was very polite and gracious. I was there for a meeting, the facilities were fine, comfortable, made for a nice meeting. The hotel bar and restaurant were good. The location was easy walking distance from Back Bay Amtrak station. I made dinner reservations at a local restaurant and got a free ride in a Mercedes sedan without asking for it.

It is a new building (only 10 months old at time of writing) and the amenities, decor and overall cleanliness are faultless. Service is probably the best I have experienced (undoubtedly drawing from the 'oriental' background of this hotel group) and very friendly, right from the doorman meeting the taxi to the housekeeping staff. And nothing was too much trouble for the front desk / concierge. The rooms we had were very large with every possible amenity and extremely comfortable beds. As a hotel guest, you can use the vitality suite in the spa and you really should - it is the most relaxing environment with huge whirlpool, steam room and multi-programme shower (not shower as in bathroom - you have to try this to understand!). The bar is great - they can do any drink you can think of and the bar staff are very friendly and really knowledgeable about the drinks they have. Finally, the restaurant (Asana) is well worth a visit with top notch food and an Asian twist (getting away from standard steakhouse menu - although they do a lovely filet mignon and an outstanding Kobe Beef). The location of the hotel could not be better - on Boylston St, surrounded by other great restaurants, yards from Newbury St, very close to Copley Place; strolling to Faneuil Hall takes only 30 to 40 minutes if you are inclined but taxis are lined up outside and there is a complimentary limousine to bring you anywhere within a couple of miles of the hotel.

All it takes is one careless guests to open the bathroom door to fast and you've got a 4 inch hole in the drywall. The left closet door smashed into the door frame of the bedroom when it was 70% open, and judging by the marks and dents in the frame, I was not the first guest to discover this. 2) According to the website, each guest room has a walk-in closet. Now come on...no way ours could be considered such. Maybe if you removed all the hangers and ducked below the shelves someone could technically fit in there, but let's call an apple an apple. 3) To the left of the dresser in plain view against the wall were remnants of peanuts. We looked behind the dresser and were disgusted to find other trash and food bits behind there. 4) For only being 8 months old, the dresser furniture was somewhat misshapen. Both doors to the dresser were warped. The left one was difficult to close without some force because of clearance issues, and the right one when closed and touching at the bottom produced a half inch gap near the top. Strange for brand new furniture. 5) Dust had collected and gone uncleaned on the bathroom light fixture lamps. 6) Maybe it was operator error, but the lights in our room had three master switches, one near the door, and one on each side of the bed. Obviously this is so you don't have to go around turning off every lamp before bed...just crawl in and flip the switch. However, without the master switch on, the bathroom lights won't fire on either, thus you are left with a strange predicament should you have to go potty in the middle of the night...either fumble around the bathroom in the dark or blanket the whole room in 60 watt light. Luckily, this situation did not present itself during our one night stay. These issues may or may not be confined to room 508, but in any case this is not what one would expect from a luxury hotel.", "title": "One of Boston's Best", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "JoeNH", "date": "January 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23263410, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The luxury of this hotel", "disliked": "\u2014 We wish our bathroom had two sinks.
