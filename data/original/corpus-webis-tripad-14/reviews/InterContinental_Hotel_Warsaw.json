I spoke to a Polish girl who was a member of the club and she said it was the best and the views of the city from the hotel swimming pool area and jacuzzi are spectacular. There is also a sauna and stream room and separate beauty salon which offers very good treatments for affordable prices. The gym was also quite big for a hotel gym and the equpment was really good.", "title": "great location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "nicanriogh", "date": "October 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 21325418, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay somewhere nice in Warsaw and if I need to return to Poland, I would want stay here again.", "title": "Lush", "user": "alandlea", "date": "October 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20935834}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stay at the Intercontinental Warsaw in late July, we had booked a standard room from hotelsclick.com for a great price. At the time of the check-In, and for our surprise, we were sent to the 40th floor, one of the Club Intercontinental floors. The room was spacious and elegant, with a notorious attention to all details. The bathroom had both bath and rain shower and it feels very luxurious. But the best feature of our room has to be the view, from a 40th floor window we can see almost the entire city and the huge palace of culture, it\u2019s a delight at night! The end of our afternoons was spent in the pool on the 43th floor, there\u2019s also a Jacuzzi, a Steam Bath, a Sauna and a Gym. The breakfast, with a harp as a background, is very good, with large varieties of things. The location of the hotel is perfect, right next to the main rail station and a shopping center, and you can take a bus or just walk to any place.
