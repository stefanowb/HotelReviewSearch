Suffered and injury to my thumb in the shower from a poorly designed and located shower shampoo dispenser. Management unable to process my complaint till the day of my departure and even then poor attitude demonstrated to the injury and complaint. Totally failed to deliver customer satisfaction.Do be careful in your use of the shampoo dispenser in the shower!Seek an early meeting with the ellusive Mr. Akhter, manager of the hotel.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 6, 2003", "id": 987976}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Comfort in Luxembourg", "text": "We stayed here for 2 nights on our European driving holiday. Yes - it is out of the centre - but we know this when we booked. There is a normal bus service plus the tourist bus that stops directly outside the rear of the hotel. We stayed here with our 4 year old and found it to be very family friendly. Rooms are large and very clean. We had a view of the European court of justice - and cranes on a nearby worksite. But for our daughter this was a plus! You could hear very little of the building works so this was never an issue.", "user": "Australians_Abroad", "date": "November 14, 2005", "id": 4110995}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Large hotel with problems in the restaurant", "text": "Breakfast was a very extensive buffet.

The hotel is very large and set up for conferences. It is in an area full of high rise blocks with more being built. The rooms are large and clean - the views are OK if you like modern architecture. The staff were very helpful. The major problem I had was in the restaurant. Although far from busy service was very slow and I was repeadedly asked if I wanted anything else to eat - it transpired that they had lost my order! When it arrived my linguini had been substituted with spaghetti. The meals were expensive but substantial. I would stay there again but eat elsewhere.", "user": "Sthlm", "date": "July 12, 2005", "id": 3659582}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Almost loved it", "text": "Unless you're there on business in the EU parliament area, you won't like the location of this hotel. It's a long walk to the center, over a very busy bridge that spans a very deep gorge. There is a convenient bus line that is within a couple minute's walk though, if you don't mind that.
