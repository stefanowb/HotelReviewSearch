The best part was purchasing two-day aquarium tickets at the front desk for the price of one; I think the deal is the inn is a Member and gets a discount. Free wireless internet was another pleasant surprise. It's sort of a motorlodge, small and quaint, in a quiet residential area among some other motels/inns and a golf course. The town was adorable with great places for breakfast (Red House Cafe and Lighthouse Cafe) and lovely Victorian homes to drool over. There's a lighthouse (Point Pinos) which was open 1-4Lots of antique shops, pet services and chiropractors. We walked to the Aquarium to avoid paying for parking and to see the cute streets all the better (@ 25 mins) There's a nature trail along the coast where we saw harbor seals and otters along with alot of bird life. We had dinners at Paradiso on Cannery Row and Hula's; both were nice.", "title": "Perfect for our visit to the Aquarium", "user": "SoCalTraveller34", "date": "March 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 58824790}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room had a small refridgerator and coffee maker, apparently left over from the previous occupant's requests; it took a day to get the actual coffee, but it worked out.

We visit often and this is my third time at this motel. It is located in a quiet area and the property is typically peaceful and the grounds are clean and maintained. There is a gas firepit outside that added to the ambiance. Parking is just outside the room door which is convenient and the beach is walking distance away. I was traveling with extended family members and their rooms had been remodeled but mine was dated. My biggest complaint on this visit was the paper thin walls which wouldn't have been a big deal except we had loud neighbors for all of our three nights. Even when they quieted down at night, we could hear them talking quitely and coughing. There is also no A/C which wouldn't usually be a big deal given the cooler climate of Pacific Grove but we had neighbors smoking outside our window causing us to close it. Breakfast was Costco type muffins and juice which was actually pretty good. Ability to buy Aquarium tickets at the front desk was convenient. A decent property and I would still recommend it overall, but a little disapointed with the room noise and dated room.", "title": "Terrible", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "annieBiisloved", "date": "October 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 47939686}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Neat and clean rooms", "text": "Stayed overnight on way to San Francisco.
