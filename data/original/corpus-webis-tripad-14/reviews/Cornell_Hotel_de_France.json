But it was fine, and the little ones adored the dog, the glass elevator, running up and down the stairs, and the medieval decor in the restaurant. 20 family members from 2 months to 91 years gathered here, and no one had any complaints other than some rooms being too warm and one window in a room with kids having no screen.

All others were much more than adequate, and contained everything to make for a comfortable stay, including good matresses, ample closets, good water pressure, hair dryers, TVs, and superb cleanliness. Ours, in the back on the 4th floor, was not at all crowded, and delightfully cool.
