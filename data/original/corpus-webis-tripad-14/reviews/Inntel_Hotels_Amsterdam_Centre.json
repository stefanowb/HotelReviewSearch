The breakfast bar was a little high priced. If you get stuck there with a tour group (which I was part of \u2013 over 100 people), the food runs out and the coffee line is way too long. There are plenty of other local choices nearby for breakfast at a better price. I would definitely ask if there are any large tour groups booked there for when you plan on staying. Our group of over 100 people clogged up the elevators, breakfast bar, lobby and lounge for days. Elevators only hold 3 or 4 people with luggage at a time. Imagine how long 100 people with luggage take to get up the elevator. Very frustrating to say the least. We will stay here again, without the group. Room service is from Humphrey\u2019s next door.

There was no view from the window whatsoever. The hotel is located near Dam Square which means that the ringing of the bells at Dam Square can be heard quite often. The room service/snacks were impressive however extremely pricey. There are many coffee shops as well as the Red Light District that is very close to the hotel. Do not use the hotel telephone as we had made 5 calls to South African mobile telephones from the hotel for roughly 3-4 minutes and had been charged 140 Euro!! Insane? You bet! When we had arrived back in South Africa, we had realised that the hotel also charged us an additional 73 Euro as a holding charge but was never refunded.
