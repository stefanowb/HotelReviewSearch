My wife and I did a whirlwind last minute trip to Italy on Feb 19-25th 2005. First of all, everything you read about regarding the small size of the rooms and even smaller size of the room showers is absolutely correct. Hotel Al Piave is 5 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge and 5 minutes in a different direction to Piazza San Marco. We were very pleased with the location We took the Alilaguna from the airport to the hotel and got off at the San Marco stop, which is the last stop on the route. The Alilaguna is 10 euros per person and is very easy to use. The airport Alilaguna booth accepts credit cards but the booths in the the city do not. You can buy your roundtrip ticket at the airport, so if you want to save your euros, just buy all you Alilaguna tickets at the airport with your credit card. It takes almost exactly one hour from the airport to the San Marco stop. It leaves every 30 minutes. The first day we just walked around and got the feel for the place. The second day, we bought a one day water bus pass. It was 10.50 euros and well worth the money. Most food places will not accept credit card unless you spend a certain minimum. We mostly ate pizza and pasta. Pizza is about 5-7 euros and pasta is the same. Food is excellent. The Hotel Piave staff is awesome and most helpful. The room is nicely decorated. The only English channels on tv is CNN and BBC. My only comment to the hotel would be to add some more english speaking channels. It would have been very welcome while I was still adjusting to the time change at night. Breakfast is provided and is a nice start to the day. Same food everyday, but it tasted just fine. Overall, I would definitely return to the Hotel Al Piave. By the way, if you pay cash instead of credit card, they will reduce your hotel rate. We paid 10 euros less per night by paying in cash. We went to Rome and paid a good amount more for the hotels over there. It was nowhere near as nice as this hotel. Also, I was very pleased with how clean they kept the rooms. Nicely done to the staff of Hotel Al Piave.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "pechung", "date": "February 26, 2005", "id": 3232639}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved Hotel al Piave", "text": "pechung@yahoo.com", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "anitabitt", "date": "February 20, 2005", "id": 3212860}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Compact & Bijou", "text": "Our family of eight was in Italy for the Christmas holidays and were lucky enough to have booked rooms at Hotel al Piave.

I did read one bad review of this room on the TripAdvisor website so wanted to add a more positive one - to give another opinion!!! We found the studio room was pretty much ideal for us. It wasn't cramped, it was really clean and had a downstairs shower room and upstairs kitchen/living area with separate double bedroom. Moreover, it was very reasonably priced (just 145 euros a night)...making it an excellent, central, base for exploring the city. The other review moans about the steps. There are about 12 and, if you are able-bodied they really are not a problem, so don't let that put you off!! All in all. it was kinda like having your own wee Venetian flat for a few days...somewhere to rest your head after a busy day - not somewhere to laze around in luxury.
