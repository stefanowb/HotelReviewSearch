All the staff are so helpful and the bedrooms are immaculate with flat screen plasma wall mounted tv, lovely modern bathroom with more than enough toiletries, fridge with mini bar and the bedroom was very well lit for reading with lamps and spots on the ceiling. The room was very quiet and the bed was comfy. Breakfast was a feast with cereals, rolls, cheeses, bacon, smoked salmon, pastries, cakes, yoghurt etc. and even diabetic foods. Just across the road is a large supermarket.
