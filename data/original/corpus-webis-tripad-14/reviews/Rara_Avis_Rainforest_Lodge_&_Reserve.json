We also went to several other places in Costa Rica and enjoyed those as well. However, we thought Rara Avis was the most unique. We loved the tractor ride, even though it broke down, it did give us a chance to hike on our own. Our guide was amazing and was by far the best we have had in all of our travels. We saw many reptiles that we had never seen before and were amazed. We have so many great pictures of frogs and snakes. The terrain was a little more difficult than in other areas that we had been to. I think this was largely due to the amount of rain. The waterfalls at this lodge are really beautiful.", "title": "Amazing!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "adventuretravel30", "date": "February 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 13764419}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "As far as the food and lodging are concerned.... We loved the food, thought it was amazing that they were able to fix such great meals in the middle of nowhere. The food was better than other remote jungle lodges we have been to. We stayed in the River's Edge Cabin and would probably not do that again. The cabin was nice but at the end of a long hike and or a long day it is a bit of a hike just to get to your room. I found myself dreading the hike to the room about 10 minutes before finishing the hike in the jungle. However, if you are ok with that it is very scenic and private. The rooms are rustic but comfortable and this is exactly what I would expect in a place like this.

The jungle plants alone are worth the trip, and I'm not a plant person. But no, it doesn't have all the amenities of a Holiday Inn on the interstate highway. If that's what you're looking for, then stay on the interstate or go to Monteverde. This place is miles from the nearest paved road, life there is WILD. It's a genuine wilderness, not the wheel-chair accessible version. Rivers and waterfalls, coatimundis all over the place, and the brightest, most colorful birds I've ever seen. Tanagers and euphonias, trogons and currasows and who knows what else. Yes, you might get muddy. Yes, you might get sweaty or wet from the rain. But the amazing thing is that you can go there at all, to a pristine jungle that is like life was before there were people. A patch of Eden. It feels like you are at the end of the earth.

The lodge is 15km away, but to get to it is like a world away. The only way to get there (unless you rent a horse from a local) is to get taken up in the trailer pulled by a tractor. This takes about 4 hours along a very bumpy track that you even wonder whether the tractor will make it \u2013 at one point we had to get out while the tractor got pulled up a steep slope.
