The manager suggested a grungy hotel down the road.

I think that it is discrimination to the teenagers, as they would not rent to them with our approval, written or verbal. I can make purchases online, but somehow I could not even place my credit card as security for the price of the room and other expenses. Some policies are too strict and some exceptions should always be allowed. I spoke to Best Western head office and they told me that all Best Westerns were individually owned and operated, therefore the policy was only with this one hotel.
