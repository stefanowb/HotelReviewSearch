Booked hotel thru Hotwire and was assigned a room with a king bed. Since I was traveling with my adult son, I asked if a room with 2 beds was available. I was told there was, but I would have to pay an upgrade of $25. I realize that when you book thru Hotwire, they can give you any room that they want to. But at 1AM, with rooms available with 2 queens that are priced the same as a king room, why wouldn't you accomodate the customers request and make them happy instead of trying to hit them up for another $25?
