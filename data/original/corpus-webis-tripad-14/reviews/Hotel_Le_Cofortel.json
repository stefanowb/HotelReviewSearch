This is a newer hotel with very modern decor and amenities. The room was modernly decorated and the bedding comfortable. The room had a fridge but no microwave which was okay as the price for the king room was reasonably priced. The bathroom, however, was fairly clean with exception to hair on the floor. All other fixtures in the bathroom were clean. Come time to go to bed, we found hair on our pillows. My guess is that the linen was changed and cleaned, however, the pillows were placed on the floor while the housekeeper made the bed. This told me one, that she didn't pay attention to detail, ensuring our bed was clean, and two that the carpets probably haven't been vacuumed in quite some time. We ended up tossing the pillows with hair on the floor and resorted to sleeping on the side of the bed that was hair-free and clean. Breakfast was included, however, the front desk attended did not notify us of this during checkin. My boyfriend figured it out while retrieving something from our car the next morning around 10a. Upon checkin we didn't find the front desk assistant very helpful or pleasant. We had to ask for Wifi access which should've been included with our reservation. The internet was the slowest I've experienced at any hotel. I will definitely not stay at the Cofortel again when visiting Quebec in the future.", "title": "Good hotel", "user": "Shari D", "date": "August 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172718197}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Had exactly what I wanted and more....great LOCATION : near airport and isolated from street noises, bus stops at easy walking distance, busses to town and coach station opposite hotel, varied restaurants walking distances.
