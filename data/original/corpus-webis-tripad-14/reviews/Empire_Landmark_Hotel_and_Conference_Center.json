Secondly, the price was excellent - I think we paid about $125/night, using the hotel's own website. And parking is reasonable. I don't remember the exact cost, but it was much less than the $35 or so that most others charge. Finally, I don't think that there is a room with a bad view. We were on the 31st floor and had a great view of English Bay and Stanley Park.
