The food is good. The rooms are named after animals but are all the same inside. The beds are quite hard but the rooms are clean and spacious and the grounds are lovely. There's a minibar with free water and drinks for purchase. Plenty of hot water and pressure (water is from a spring). Electricity is reliable (they have a backup generator). There is no clock in the room, so pack a travel one. The bar has ample beer, wine and sodas for sale at reasonable prices.", "title": "Nice But Far from City and Airport", "user": "brngckn", "date": "July 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 169280682}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "It's a great place to start or end a trip to Tanzania activities, but if you want to be close to town, choose another location.", "title": "After a week on the Mt, the DikDik is paradise", "user": "psalber", "date": "January 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 149430841}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled solo", "text": "We climbed Mt. Kilamanjaro with Nat Geo/Mountain Travel. After a week without bathing and 2 days of descending the Mt, we arrived at the DikDik to stay overnight before departing on the Safari portion of the trip. Needless to say, the hotel - with its comfy beds and hot hot showers - was a welcome respite. Good service, our New Years Eve (and Celebratory) Dinner was delicious, staff friendly, rooms were roomy and clean. Garden & pool pretty. I would recommend this hotel to anyone passing through Arusha as a part of their great African Adventure.", "title": "An ideal place to stay before or after a hike or safari", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "audant", "date": "July 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 133860031}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The only issue is its distance from Arusha airport.
