It's almost at the entrance to the famed Napa Valley wine and culinary culture. If you are OK with a drive to get there and back, this might be a way to save money to spend on wine and food instead. Nice staff, the usual HGI amenities (Hilton Honors a plus), and renovated recently enough ago. A big difference with this Hilton is that it's right on top of so many food and shopping choices, within walking distance. A big mall. Many chain restaurants of various levels all around. Very convenient. Even more choices just on the other side of the freeway, including grocery. Freeway close, so if you don't like the white noise, ask for a room on the non-freeway side.
