We stayed in a condo within the Aqua Bamboo hotel. While I cannot comment on thier hotel rooms, I can comment on staff, facilities, location etc. The Bamboo is a wonderful find, centrally located ( 5 mins - 1 block or so to the beach) In busy Waikiki where huge hotels are abundant, I really appreciated the intimacy that the Bamboo provided. The staff were genuinely sweet and helpful. It was nice to see the same faces every day. The lobby is immaculate and newly re done. They have complementary newspapers and a bowl of apples out everyday. Breakfast, while we didint partake, from what I saw consisted of baked goods, fruit, juice, coffee & tea. There are two computers with internet access for guests to use ( free!). The pool area is lovely, lots of teak lounge chairs and tables and 2 cabana like areas. They light tiki torches at night which are very pretty. There is also a BBQ down in this area which was very nice - the bbq is new and works very well. We used it twice during our stay. A word of advice, the \"Food Pantry\" grocery store acouple of blacks down on Kuhio, will just hose you price wise (close to $10 for 4 litres of milk!!). I think this may be due to the fact that it is the only grocery store in this part of waikiki. Both Foodland and Safeway offer much better prices and are maybe 5 minuites away by car. I digress....there is also a spa at the hotel, which we didint use but offered alot of massages and body treatments. There isnt alot of parking at the hotel, we parked next door at the Pacific Monarch for $12 a day, which is an okay price but very convenient.
