My wife and I live within 50 miles of the Trapp Family Lodge and and have driven by it innumerable times when visiting Stowe. Living so close, we would probably not have ever stayed there had it not been for receiving a gift certificate. We went there with the impression that it was probably living off its Sound of Music reputation and was rather touristy.

I have stayed at many different styles of hotels, B&Bs and Inns, and I have to say that the Von Trapp Lodge ranks as one of my favorites overall. It is not the most luxurious, but it is cozy, clean, has large rooms and the nicest, most helpful staff and great extra touches. The Lodge itself is so picturesque, with twinkly lights and freshly fallen snow (it helped that it snowed every day we were there). There were so many nooks and crannies to relax: in front of a fire, in the game room, in the \u201cLibrary\u201d. We didn\u2019t take advantage of the Fitness Center , but we did check it out and it had a very nice pool, hot tub and sauna. We never felt the need to work out after several hours of skiing! My boyfriend and I planned this trip as a cross-country skiing trip because we had never been, and after doing some researched, learned that the Trapp Lodge is one of (if not the best) place to cross-country ski in the U.S. Since this is my only time cross-country skiing, I can\u2019t compare it to other places, but I have to say that this was just gorgeous. The trails were well-maintained and easy to navigate, the ski shop was very convenient to the Lodge, and everyone was so helpful in getting us on our way. I did learn the hard way that cross-country skiing involves a lot of up and down, especially in trying to get to the Cabin. It was a work-out climbing up to the Cabin, which is a rustic resting point/restaurant at a cross-point for several trails. It was fun to stop there, and squeeze in with all the other skiers into the tables and eat soup and a slice of freshly baked bread, which tasted heavenly after working up the hill. The Lodge itself offers many amenities, including tea and cookies in the afternoon, hot cider at the end of the day, cheese and crackers in the early evening, and a free movie in the evening. We thoroughly enjoyed the hearty breakfast buffet to start our days of skiing. The only nit-picky thing is that the dinners could use a little punching up. But otherwise, overall, we had a wonderful trip and we will be returning.", "user": "sunshineDC", "date": "January 30, 2009", "id": 24044099}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very Nice for Families of all ages!", "text": "We booked with Interval International a two bedroom unit. Not the brand new villas but the older units. We loved it. It was very cozy. What I liked was the huge family room with large table and a very nice wood stove that comes with all the fire wood you could want. Love the views. We had a upper unit which I recommend because the steps to get in were kind of noisy for the guests underneath us. I did feel bad about our kids walking up/down the steps. I loved the building with the pool and rock wall (a bit small though), air hocky and ping pong and games to play for the kids. They also had a small fitness room, an aerobic room and a pretty large outdoor hot tub.

I've turned out some beautiful meals from that kitchen and after all these years the only thing I bring are my own spices and a sharp knife. The beds (1Q & 2Tw) are quite comfortable and the bathrooms are small but again, meet every need. The wood burning fireplace is delightful with wood and firestarters provided, and there is a \"mud/coat room\" that is perfect for hanging coats, storing skis & shoes.

No, it is not part of the main building (as an earlier writer complained) but the walk is ridiculously short. Book a massage, climb the rockwall or play a game of tennis if weather permits. The main restaurant and the alternate tea room provide consistent and large meals, the atmosphere in both is charming. A daily walk to the bakery on site every morning for fresh baked pastries and breads is sure to add a couple of lbs despite the many activities to keep you moving...or not! Take a wagon ride, look at the beautiful gardens and wildlife in the pastures; hike on property or any of the surrounding areas; drive to the Notch, take the tram at Stowe to the top of the mountain; bike or walk the gorgeous trail in town; drive the toll road and hike to the highest point in Vermont; catch a movie in town, in the lodge or curl up in your own cabin and read a good book., spend an afternoon checking out all the nooks & crannies in the main lodge and looking at the amazing pictures and Trapp Family memorabilia. Sit outside and take in the fabulous beauty that is TFL/Stowe.
