For this hotel to be all-inclusive was not true, due to we had to pay to eat at the French Restaurant ($10 per person). The bar restaurant was always busy no matter what time of day we try to eat there. People was just there to watch sports so every time we would try to make it for lunch or dinner it was always busy so we didn't get to try out much at the bar restaurant.", "title": "summer vacation.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Lisa N", "date": "September 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141287768}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The staff was very nice and friendly especially the staff at the Taino Pool Bar , Omar Madrigal, Jan Valdez and Luz Rodriquez.

Service is uneven and the staff is not friendly. For me that affects my vacation. We loved our room-a family suite. The kids need their own space(TV, Bathroom, Closets, and Ipod docks). Every resort should add these to their room selections, Food was uneven-the seafood restaurant was lousy. Our best meal was at the Japanese restaurant and the 19th Hole, The 19th Hole is the best kept secret on the resort. We also liked the Italian restaurant. What I hated is that you had to make reservations and none of the places was ever full. Getting the reservation was difficult too, Finally, my other complaint is that we never got wash cloths after the 2nd or 3rd day of our stay. Our room was cleaned on all but one day but a phone call to front desk rectified that problem but it was 7PM when we came back to discover this, There is nightly entertainment and daily activities near the pool.

I am a travel agent so I know travel and expectations. Of which some of you have wayyyy too many. Let me start by complimenting a few employees who went out of their way for us. Ms. Amarfi checked us in at Club premium and she not only greeted us with enthusiam, but with a beautiful persona as well. Her first words to us were \"welcome home\"...and that's just how we felt. We had champagne while checking in and so our initial touchdown was a sheer success. We booked the master suite and the panoramic suite and were deliciously entranced with the rooms, ammenities, and not to mention,the view!! I thought Aruba, St John, Jamaica, had great beaches, but this beach is my favorite by far. The rooms were very clean and modern with a minimalistic hint, and very comfortable.My housekeeper was the best. I didnt get her name because I was out when she was in, but we communicated by notes, very well! My husband left a bag on the bus and it seemed things were going to take a nose dive since he had no other clothes or his golf shoes and that was his main focus. However, Berali came to our rescue and diligently phoned CNT Tours until she located someone(after hours) who delivered his bag post haste! I can't tell you how Ms. Berali saved the DAY!!! She is a friend for life. I am bringing a group in January and will look for Berali and Amarfi upon arrival. Edison our bellman was very helpful and informative and even with my limited Spanish, we GOT IT! He explained our room, lighting, doors etc. It was great to know, because the doors must be closed to keep the AC flowing. Thanks Edison. Our food was good everywhere we ate and we are a bit particular but adventurous at the same time. We had great steaks, seafood, and chicken dishes and loved loved loved breakfast. (SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE) Our bartenders were great in the lobby bar Carey. Many thanks to Willie, Victor, Samuel, and Maria for making us feel like family. The spa....thanks to Wendy, girl you are the best. I hope all who come for spa treatments/hydrotherapy, whatever there, gets you! So friendly and genuine. We relaxed well, ate well, and yes drank well the entire week! It was like paradise. The adults side was AWEsome as well....loved the open air restaurant and soooo loved Chez Gourmet! So if you go to Barcelo Bavaro Palace looking for good people, you will find them, if you go looking for good food, you will find it, if you go looking for great rooms with great views and great beaches, you will find those too. If you go with an open mind to experience a different enviornment with a lot of Spanish culture and bring a little patience,your time at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace can mimmick the time we had there.

The Staff is incredibly rude, I mean really rude No one speaks more than a few words in English, I mean no one. I read that from another review and I was like no big deal. But it is actually a big deal. Front desk is slow and useless. We checked in, verified we had a king room. Went to the room and it was 2 double beds. It took literally 42 minutes for the front desk to answer the phone. No one spoke English so we had bellman try to explain in Spanish. They said no King till tomorrow. We called the next day and were told to come to the front desk. When we got there we tried to explain. She left us at the front desk for over an hour until we saw her laughing with someone else. We got her attention and then she said to come back or call in an hour. When we called, again no one answered for close to an hour. They eventually sent a bellman, we went to the room and again 2 double beds and no king. We went back to the original room out of frustration.

We tried all the buffets and they all serve the same bad food, their so called 2 buffets Miramar and Bohio Dominicano is the same crap food that they serve the only difference is the different seating furniture. The restaurants that they have all look nice and their food is better than the buffets but they are still bad. The food is incredibly oily and tasteless and no authenticity. Now included is unlimited liquor right?? Well the liquor in all of the bars are cheap imitations of the real stuff. They taste absolutely awful. None of the drinks were good, even straight drinks tasted like crap. And you can forget about the minibars in the room. All you will find in there is presidente beer. It will take 12 cans of it just to feel like you are drinking beer. The juice and the soda in the minibar is almost never refilled by housekeeping. They also taste funny, once I checked the bottles I noticed why.
