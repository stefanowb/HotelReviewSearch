We were there for the USSSA softball tournament at Disney's Wide World of Sports. The location to all of the Disney properties was excellent. Living in Florida and being a Disney annual passholder we have never stayed anywhere but on Disney property. That said I was very concerned when I read about this hotel on Trip Advisor. I called Priceline to see what my alternatives would be if the hotel turned out to be as bad as some have written and was only told to call customer service at Priceline with any problems. As others have reported the hotel is older (around 25 years) and is showing its wear. But I must say the customer service was very good and I found the hotel to be mostly clean and acceptable. I had emailed the hotel to request a king non-smoking room. Our room was 324 in the north wing of the hotel. Our room was clean and the carpet was fairly new. The furnitiure is dated but in good repair. The room had a refrigerator, coffee maker and a safe. All included in the price of the room. After we had been in the room for a few minutes the front desk called to make sure we were happy with our room. This hotel is being remodeled and sold as a time share condo. On checkout we found that due to slow season all rooms were being upgraded and we were not charged for the $10 extra per night for the king size sleep number bed. We were told on check in of the $5 per day resort charge. I truely feel for the price we got a great deal. Five nights for $310 how can you beat that. The hotel lobby and pool area are also acceptable. However I would skip the breakfast buffet.", "title": "Moderate hotel worth the price", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Disney213", "date": "September 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8852785, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Price per priceline", "disliked": "\u2014 Tile around pool could have been cleaner"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Previously posted reviews scared me enough to contact Hotwire about whether or not this hotel should be considered a 3 star property. They assured me it was. We stayed 8/24-8/29. Upon arrival, we were sent to room 418. It was damp, cold and looked like it was last furnished in 1975. The air conditioning wasn't alleviating the humidity problem after the first night so I went down to the front desk and was immediately given a new room. The new room was better. It had been slighlty upgraded with sleep number beds, new linens and a new working air conditioner. The stay we had was satisfactory now that the room was dry, but the hotel was still a bit runned down. The side doors are opened all the time with no security locks. The whole place has a wet musty smell. I found out later that because it was slow season, we got upgraded to the \"renovated\" room without charge. It normally would have cost $10 per night to upgrade. The hotel also charges a \"resort fee\" for any rooms booked through a third party vendor such as Hotwire, as we did. It amounts to about $5 a day. Location was great if you're going to Disney, but I would not stay here again. I think this is a 2.5 star property at best.
