What else could the kids do, since everything closes so early. I would recommend this hotel. It is close to the Orkney Island ferry, and I'm not sure if there are places on the islands to stay.

I ordered haddock and chips and I suspect that there was no chef at the time or that the chef was busily engaged preparing the meals for the large party I have mentioned. I suspect that the waitress herself made my meal. It was definitely the worst fish I have ever been offered. It resembled cotton wool between two thin dark cardboards!
