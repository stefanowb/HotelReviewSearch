This was the worst experience ever. My friends and I (16 total) had reservations for 6 months and a confirmation #. When we arrived there from NC, they had given our rooms away even though they had held our credit card #. They were INCREDIBLY RUDE to us and didn't give a darn that we had no where to stay. They made the comment that we'd \"take what we give you!\" My friend that made all they arrangements had called 3 times during that 6 mth period to double check our arrangements and room type. That confirmation meant nothing to them. The receptionist slung paperwork at us and then called us jerks, etc. Needless to say after that the cops were called because of 16 angry people that have just been insulted.
