My husband is a vegan and we were worried about the food. We booked through Adventure Life who assured us that it would not be an issue but given the remote location, we were a little skeptical. The box lunches we received before the river trip to the lodge did not include a vegan lunch so we were starting to get worried. We needn't have worried! During our stay there, the cooking staff went out of their way to prepare plentiful, delicious, creative, and beautiful meals for my husband. In fact, there were a few occasions when our dining companions were a little envious when his meals would arrive at the table! Our guide Sebastien was amazing and truly knowledgeable about the wildlife. He also had eagle eyes and would always somehow spot the birds, mammals, and reptiles and amphibians that were initially hidden from our eyes. Our indigenous guide also shared wonderful insights into his culture and their relationship with the environment. The accommodations are rustic and while there are screens on the windows, the rooms are by no means impervious to insects. Expect nightly visitors in your rooms! Also definitely use the dry box! I left a book out for a few hours and the papers had completely curled by the time I returned to the room! The service by the rest of the staff was above and beyond. We decided to try to fish (feed) the piranha in the lake and the staff cheerfully provided some old meat to use as bait. I was worried about mosquitoes but it was not buggy around the lodge at all (although I was stung by a wasp randomly while drinking coffee and minding my own business - ouch!). The forest is of course another matter and you definitely need bug spray. One last word: I am terrified of heights and went on the canopy walk anyway. At one point, I simply could not take the rope bridge to the next observation tower. The rest of the group went on and I remained behind. After a few minutes, our guide returned and tried to coax me across. I initially refused but he patiently walked ahead of me and ordered me to just focus on his shoes and grip the handrail. He even told me he was initially afraid of the canopy walk when he first started working there to make me feel better (even though I'm pretty he just made that up!) I was petrified but once I got across, I was so happy to be there (we saw some great wildlife)! I was even able to go back across the bridge after we finished, to the other tower so we could make our way down. I was glad I did it so even if you're afraid of heights I would recommend you try it anyway (at least if your guide is Sebastien)!", "title": "Perfect end to honeymoon (with a vegan)", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "starhawk", "date": "May 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 109182264}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "Four of us went to Sacha Lodge for a 4 day stay.

I wasn't fully aware of the tip policy in both the Galapagos Islands and the Amazon Rainforest, but I sure am now! We each tipped $5 a day, which is what I was told, and both myself and my group were severely rebuffed by a guide named \"Marcos\" a.k.a.
