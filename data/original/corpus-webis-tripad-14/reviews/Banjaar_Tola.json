From greeting us with a cold towel/drink after every return to hotel to waving goodbye. Service at all the Taj hotels/lodges was excellent. Didi, our butler, took great care of us. The chef - worried we weren't eating enough (it was 110 degrees, we weren't very hungry in heat) - offered to make pasta or non-Indian food if we wanted. The managers & staff were delightful. Service was the best! The \"tents\" are extremely roomy and comfortable. The huge bed was great and the lights, etc. easily accessable from the bed - with a great view of the river. The bathroom was huge - with 2 sinks, shower, tub, lots of closet space, safe....all amenities.

Our Naturalist Guide Payal was the absolute best....she's the only woman naturalist there and is so enthusiastic about her job - her love for the animals comes through every minute of every drive. We loved her! Our first sighting was a tiger in a tree (a rare occurence), we saw 3-4 others on elephant back. It is not an easy thing to find a tiger. Much harder than seeing animals in Africa...but what a thrill when you do! Well worth the trip. Our trip was arranged by Deepa Krishnan of Mumbai Magic and her service & coordination was excellent every step of the way.
