Dinner was in a conservatory with great views out to sea. They only had one real ale on offer (due to expand) but again, excellent. The atmosphere of the place was relaxing and the staff (Hazel in particular) was very hospitable and welcoming and couldn't be more helpful. D,B&B was good value for the quality we received.
