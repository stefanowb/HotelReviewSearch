There is a spa attached, but we didn't try that. Service was good, with very friendly manager and staff, especially Will and Dan. Afternoon tea on the terrace in the sunshine was very pleasant; the sandwiches were excellent, though the scones were not as fresh as they might have been. Bar service in the lounge was good.

Our room was small, as was the bathroom, but newly refurbished and quiet. Dinner and breakfast were both excellent, as was the spa. Particularly appreciated that we could place a dinner order at 6, take ourselves off to the pool/outdoor jacuzzi, and return to dine later in the evening - the staff didn't seem particularly phased by this request, indeed any request, which made the place feel v welcoming. Those running the dining room on the evening we stayed, and the following morning also, knew what they were up to and had everything under control.

Relax in our spa, play croquet on the lawn, enjoy afternoon tea on the terrace or some family time in our gardens. New Park Manor offers the perfect destination for anyone wishing to explore and appreciate the unique mosaic of woodland, heathland and wetland that comprise the ancient landscape of the New Forest. The New Forest, Britain's most popular national park, was created by William the Conqueror in 1079 as a royal hunting area. In 1611, King Charles II chose New Park Manor as his favourite hunting lodge and his royal coat of arms is still displayed prominently above the fireplace in our award-winning Stag Restaurant. New Park Manor was carefully adapted for use as a country house hotel with 21 bedrooms and opened in 1970. Interesting details such as acorns and oak leaf patterned doors and original furniture and fireplaces can still be seen throughout the building. These commemorate the debt owed by King Charles to the oak tree which hid him from Cromwell's men on his escape to France in 1651. Today, New Park Manor is a beautiful, stylish country hotel, where the traditions of days gone by still live on and many original features can still be seen around the hotel. Bedrooms range from the splendor of our Barbara Villiers Family Suite to the contemporary style of our Forest rooms. Over recent years, our facilities have expanded to include a heated outdoor pool, croquet lawn, and our award-winning Bath House Spa which included a heated indoor pool and outdoor Canadian hot tub overlooking the New Forest."}
