On arrival, we were dealt with quickly and efficiently by the young reception staff. Our room was located to the front of the fairly busy K'strasse, but we soon learned that the double glazing was very effective at keeping out the traffic noise. The bed was comfortable and the room clean ansd generally well presented. We knew that the HIE brand was a basic one and our expectations were ranked accordingly, but we were very happy with ehe overall presentation. Slight minus points on the lack of a wardrobe to speak of and safes in the room. The bathroom was very nicely preesented, and we both loved the funky violet light! Good shower, towels and tea making facilities were fine. Breakfast was included in the price (not always the case), and was decent with a limited choice but tasty and excellent value. Bar prices a bit of the high side, and range of drinks limited. Lifts were on and off during our second day of stay and I had to leave my showere when the fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate. Another minus point here is that some of the staff hung around the side of the building while the guests were left to exit the building and mall around outside on the street. A young staff to be sure, but they tried hard to please and they were polite, friendly and generally decent. Location is great fro Wittenbergplatz, the Ku'damm and Zoo all within 5-10 mins easy stroll. We wanna go back, but would like to see just how quickly the building will wear own.", "title": "A Good Deal All Round", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "BillyMcIlroy", "date": "May 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15735324, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The price, the cleanliness, the location, friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Lift problems, lack of safes"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed there for 6 nights from April 23rd to April 28. It is a new hotel, rooms are designed carefully. Our bathroom had only a shower, which was fine with us. The WC itself is in the same space but the door can close it leaving the sink and shower free for others to use. Really sophisticated. The room was small-medium in size. What I did not like at all is the there is no wardrobe, only a few open shelves. A desk with no drawer, and only 1 chair.
