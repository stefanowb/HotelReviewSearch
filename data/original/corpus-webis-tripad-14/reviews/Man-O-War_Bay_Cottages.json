It sits on its own at the tip of the Island, a world away from the big touristy areas of the Island. and Manowar has a few cottages to chose from. We stayed in 2 different cottages and yes, there are a few insects, yes there is no air conditioning but you are sat on the edge of the jungle in a tropical island. If you want somewhere to relax, sip carib and eat tasty locally caught fish, this is the place for you.

The UK govt has reported an increase in crime on the island so make sure you take care in remote spots. We saw an increase in hassle from some of the locals, but they are just trying to make ends meet. At the end of the day this is a 3rd world country and so long as you approach with care and be polite we didn't encounter any problems.

The 6 cottages are at the waters edge in a spectacular botanical garden that has evolved over the generations of Turpin family ownership.The cottages are located in the village of Charlottsville and offer an opportunity to interact with the friendly & accomidating residents of the island.All cottages have running water, electricity, a sitting area & kitchen.Most are 2 bedroom.The Turpins will help make reservations for island adventures as well as local cooks to come in and prepare meals for an unbelievable low fee. After a week on the island, I was pressed to spend $100.00 US.The exchange rate was approx. $1 US to $7 TT. Once outside of the metropolitan area of Scarboro, prices were not inflated to bridge the difference in the exchange rate. SCUBA diving was great & the island offeres a multitude of opportunities to hike the rainforest, explore the many waterfalls and visit the numerous historical sites. This little island offeres vast opportunities for sightseeing, adventure and relaxing.
