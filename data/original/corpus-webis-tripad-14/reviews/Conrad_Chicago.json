The location is perfect, an easy walking distance to both the loop and the magnificent mile. The room was much smaller than I expected, but very clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are huge. The bed was very comfortable, and everyone we encountered, from the front desk to room service, was very friendly and accommodating. We ordered dinner and breakfast from room service, and the food arrived quickly, and was delicious. But minor issues did ultimately add up and negatively impact our enjoyment. The rooms have a mini-fridge, but they are not stocked. You must place a room service order off the mini-fridge menu, and pay the 18% service charge plus $5 delivery charge to stock anything in the fridge, which I found rather ridiculous. I've never stayed in a hotel with an empty minibar. The Conrad Indianapolis fully stocked their mini bar, so this perplexes me. The TV is hooked to a Bose surround sound system, which would have been great - if it worked. Our speakers were full of static, and after a call to the front desk, an engineer was immediately dispatched to our room. He simply unhooked the TV from Bose. I was given the impression that this was not an uncommon problem, so why bother to offer the Bose if it doesn't work? Also, on our last night we ordered takeout from a nearby restaurant, and found after the delivery person had already gone that utensils were not in the bag. Room service was happy to provide us with forks, but we had to pay a $5 delivery charge. Seriously? The room was upgraded to a high floor (15), with a city view, but the view was mostly of the HVAC units on an adjacent roof top several floors below, and a very close office building. Finally, while the wireless internet service is free, I had to re-log in multiple times per day, which was frustrating. Finally, at check-in the desk clerk noticed that my birthday was that same weekend, so I was hoping for maybe a small treat sent to the room, or even a discount coupon as a happy birthday. Would I stay there again? Probably not. If asked, I recommend other hotels in Chicago first, such as the Hotel Indigo, the Hilton on S.
