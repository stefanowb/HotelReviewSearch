However, our room smelled like vomit, there was no elevator to haul our luggage (and later stroller) up to the second floor, the beds were hard and the bathroom had no tub to bathe the kids in. There was also no internet service, which my husband needed for work, so he had to go down a few doors to McDonalds which was unhandy. The staff at the front desk was not very friendly and spent much of their time on the phone or talking to each other while making the guests stand and wait and wait for service. I was happy with the free parking, the location and the continental breakfast but there are other nearby hotels that I have been happier with.
