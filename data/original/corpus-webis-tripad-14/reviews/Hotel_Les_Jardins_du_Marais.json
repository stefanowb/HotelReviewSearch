I had heard that the marais district was a nice place to stay, but i didn't realise that this hotel was actually located just off a main road in a really horrible area (not really marais at all)! The rooms were ok, but were small and not in keeping with the modern theme of the rest of the hotel. The kitchenette was bizarre too and made the room feel like a 2 star room. One of the buildings is being renovated and we too got woken up at 8 in the morning, which is not what you expect in a hotel. All in all I'd say that there are far nicer hotels in Paris for the same price and I would not stay here again. I suggest the latin quarter is one of the best areas to stay in, as it is close to all the sites and is a fun and safe area!", "title": "Not four star, better hotels for the same price in nicer locations", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "claire015", "date": "December 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 50430376}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in the Renoir building,the room was spacious.Great location,close to subwaystation.only flaw was beakfast,bread wasn't fresh and terrible coffee!", "title": "Great hotel,good service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "diva34_2008", "date": "November 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 49875693}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Would defenitly recommend this hotel.", "title": "Abominable - Avoid, Avoid, Avoid", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "beefdripin", "date": "November 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 49488043}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed for two nights, having booked as a \"top secret\" hotel through Lastminute.com.

Rooms comfortable if a little dingy and very poorly lit. Definitely a 3* level. Staff on reception very pleasant and helpful. Decor a bit odd (but that's what counts for style in Paris as France is not known for its interior design!) - lift worked (despite signs to the contrary) but it is very small. There are stairs....! The hotel is probably nicer in summer. BUT - and this is a huge BUT - our rooms faced the front street, opposite a bar that raves until 2am from Tues to Sat.

We popped to the reception and got a kettle but were not bothered about the rest. headed acros sthe road to corner bar/restaurant where I had the most lovely meal. Arrived back at our room to find that there was a club or something on the street behind our window. the noise was still on at 4am and the reception could not move us that day but said they'd arranged for us to move the next day. We headed down early as we wanted to move and still have the full day. By lunch time we'd been moved into a suite, which apparently should have been \u00a3600 a night - It was slightly bigger than the previous room and in a different building but still close to the noisy street. luckily the noise was only on the Friday night so we enjoyed the rest of the stay. if you can get the hotel on a deal then go for it as it's a good point for making your way about Paris - I wouldn't pay full price.

Found the hotel to be a really confusing mix of good and not so good. The location is good - it's not actually in the Marais district but it's an easy 10 minute walk into the heart of the district and is close to the metro station thats well connected and easy to get to sights in Paris. Hotel looks a bit small and run down from the outside, but once inside the reception area, bar and restuarant are well decorated and appealing, if not a little obscure (clear plastic chairs and purple velvet!). Hotel rooms are in several buildings surrounding an inner courtyard that is pretty, with good outside seating and cobbled rustic feel. Our room was in the 'Ravel' building and this is where it gets confusing. One the whole the room was OK - it was clean, OK size, comfy bed, good bathroom (clean, well serviced and good shower and bath), fridge and quiet room. Decor a bit dated (but not terrible), strange kitchenette with 2 stove hob complete with sink, plates, pans and cutlery, which was useful in the end as no kettle, but felt very strange and out of place! Corridors were wierd - dark purple and black mosaic tiling, very narrow and smelt a bit strange, and lifts out of order while we were there (although reception did offer porter services if required). We had dinner in the restuarant first night, where service was very good and food very good too, but was very expensive! Staff on the whole were friendly. Just felt this hotel was trying to be several different things - the public spaces feel boutique, the rooms a bit old and tatty, and the outside space different again. Think the hotel has an identity crisis. Would recommend to those who want a room as a base to see the city thats comfortable and clean, would not recommend to those who want their hotel to be part of the experience of Paris or those looking for boutique chic. Felt our 110euro a night was a fair price but would not pay much more than this (certainly not the 300euro a night they advertise directly!)
