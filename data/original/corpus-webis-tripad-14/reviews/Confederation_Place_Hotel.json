And don't expect a return phone call from him, he's too busy hiding from everyone. This hotel is a total dump, do not waste your money by staying here.

The stucco ceiling in the room was falling apart in places and the air conditioner was noisy and barely kept the place below sweltering.

If you arrive later than the minimum check-in time (3:00), don't expect to get parking in their underground lot, which will cost you $10 if you are so lucky. When I asked how many cars their lot held, the check-in clerk said, \"Maybe 40 or 50\". Parking in the municipal lot across the street might be an option for you if they are not full, but could run you upwards of $20 per night depending on how long you stay there. The only friendly service we got was from the night maid, who offered to let us stay later than closing time at the pool, and the morning maid, who asked us where we were from and wished us a nice day. Otherwise, customer service was dreadful! A mix-up when booking was not acknowledged with an apology, and both check-in and check-out experiences were underwhelming in terms of friendliness. The elevators are terribly shabby, the carpets in the halls were stained, and the room itself was far from pristine. Dark spots marked the floors, and the bathroom was very dated - with the shower head dangling off the wall by about 5 inches. Coffee mugs and glasses were not sealed for sanitary purposes, and the air conditioner barely coughed out any cool air at all. As well, in these times when one expects to find at least a Queen-sized bed in your room, this place has Doubles.
