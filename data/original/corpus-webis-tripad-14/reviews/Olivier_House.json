It is an old, historic French Quarter building in humid New Orleans and with that comes certain things. The hotel shows its age and the sheets may not match, but they're clean. When I stay at the Olivier I don't feel like I'm staying in a hotel, I feel like I'm staying at a friend's house in the Quarter. No, the Olivier isn't for everyone, but if you like places with character it's a great place to stay. Musicians agree and so does a certain actor from HBO's Sex and the City. Ask for rooms by the pool, or the Creole Cottage. The only down side about the Olivier House is that one must cross Bourbon St. to get there.

Think carefully before staying in this area which is noisy with lots of gangs of young guys on frat / bachelor parties. The noise from nearby clubs goes for much of the night - great if you're in the club or want an easy stumble home! Great if you're with a gang who are here to party! Not so great if you're looking for something else. It's accessibility to the French Quarter is unbeatable, but there is much more to NO than the French Quarter.

When I walked in the front door, it felt more like walking into a large house back in the 19th Century. Every room is different. I stayed the first night in an interior room and although it really had no view, the room was well appointed, unique, had lots of exposed brick, quiet (and, yes, it had a flat screen TV....they must have upgraded) and I would have enjoyed staying in it the whole time.

I really enjoyed the small balcony overlooking Toulouse Street and could see the crowd on Bourbon Street less than a block away. When I got tired of the Bourbon Street partying and noise, I could close the French door to the balcony and it was then completely quiet. I enjoyed the Olivier House but went into it with a bit of an open mind and the expectation that it would be different and not like a 5 star chain hotel. It has the smallest elevator I have ever experienced, but it worked. No bar, no restaurant, nor room service but being just steps away from the bars and restaurants of Bourbon Street, this was not a problem. Also, the small neighborhood Toulouse House Grocery is just around the corner so you can pick up drinks and food for the in room fridge. I really liked the location.

I imagined toilets that were too disgusting to sit on etc. There was a little bit of mold in a crack here and there. duh. The bathrooms were very clean. The sheets and bedding was very clean. The carpets were a little musty from the climate and because there was no fan in the bathroom. The hotel is VERY charming and exactly what I expected my first trip to New Orleans to be. The staff were very polite and accomodating as well. Isn't the whole point of travelling to experience something new? If you want a homogenized experience, why leave home?", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 25, 2004", "id": 2117479}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here two nights, on both ends of our trip to LA, two different rooms. The wallpaper was peeling but hey, they stapled it back on, cool! Very few lights in the rooms, tough to see at certain times of day. Tons of pillows on bed but would rather have some lights. The room at top of first flight of stairs was the more dissapointing of the two. The lobby was charming and whole building interestingly as most are in New Orleans but after getting home and checking prices again, we could have done better in equally interesting places. No, it's not four star as one supportive reviewer said but what's the excuse to not pull down the peeling wallpaper or have more than one lamp in a room? Our fourth trip to New Orleans and we thought we'd stay a new place but we won't stay there again. The staff was inconsistent, male staff was more helpful than the female staff, need to try a little harder. On the plus side, it was quiet enough and well located.", "title": "Lobby nice rooms not charming or well maintained", "user": "Neelie L", "date": "January 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 122724938}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is not a four star hotel.
