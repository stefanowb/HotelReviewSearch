The pools are beautiful but quite heavily subscribed during the day (usual story of towels being laid out by 7 am even though the thoughtful owners (they rarely turn out to be British is all I am saying) don't appear until much later. So I decamped to the Jetty every day. It is about a 5 - 10 minute walk along the prettiest little path hugging the cliff and rolling up and down through a real jungle landscape (including waterfalls). There are just a handful of sunbeds on the Jetty, there is a bar and washroom facilities and you can also swim directly off the pier.
