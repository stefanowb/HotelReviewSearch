Travel to Woodfield mall was a breeze, and one of two routes to downtown chicago was accomplished within 25 minutes (Always check the DOT traffic report before hitting the road). The lobby was appealing and comfortable. The room, while dated, was the same. Pool was great for the kids (3.5' depth on both sides, 4' in the middle). FREE PARKING.

I don't know why we had to hear the back story from staff on getting our room ready. The room was fine - a suite actually with couch and second TV. The bathroom was clean but old--when I turned on the shower it felt like the faucet was loose enough to fall out if I wasn't extra gentle. The room had a slight odor, like it used to be a smoking room or something, but the sheets were clean and the bed comfortable. The walls were thin--we could hear our neighbors quite well. The breakfast is a rip-off, but if you don't have a car there isn't another choice. There is nothing near this hotel. For $10 the continental had limited fruit selections--the typical sliced cantaloupe and pineapple, no berries. There is no shuttle on weekends and it is about $25 plus tip to take American Taxi to/from the airport. The gym is small but functional. The cookies are nice and the staff is friendly enough.
