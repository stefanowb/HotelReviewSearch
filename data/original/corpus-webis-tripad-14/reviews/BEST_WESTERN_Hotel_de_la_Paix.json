The staff on front desk ummed and ahhed, suggesting we pay for street parking and move the car every two hours until 7pm. This would not have been a very relaxing break! A manger appeared and was far more helpful than his staff. He suggested a good outdoor car park in front of the police station just a 3 minute walk from the hotel.
