The AC was not cooling, I have complained once i arrived, they have sent someone who advised to shut it off and wait 10 mins, then try again, i did what he asked for, but of course the same results.. I have called again, but the answer was that the engineer left and better if open the window. That was the day i arrived and for two days, no one bothered to follow up or call again. If will be back, just for the location as its only 5 mins walk from Amsterdam central station and very close to most of the attractions.", "title": "Mixed feelings", "user": "Shadikbb", "date": "November 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144278633}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is one of the reasons my partner and I travel to Europe.........", "title": "City Cafe/Restaurant", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "YukonJohann", "date": "November 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144270383}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Without a doubt one of the best restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of dinning in.", "title": "Great hotel great location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "GOGOx", "date": "October 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144094676}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled solo", "text": "i Choose this hotel for the location .it is nice for me but little cold in august for me .Hotel Have big windows that is why it comes to me cold .For me not to much problem but in winter ...? i donnot know .Hotel offer cokkies on your check in .it is so nice for me .Good luck and have a more guest", "title": "Near Central Station", "user": "EnginEVSEN", "date": "October 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180767419}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Party until 3 am whether you want to or not", "text": "Doesn't matter how nice the hotel is, if you can't sleep, it's not worth a penny.
