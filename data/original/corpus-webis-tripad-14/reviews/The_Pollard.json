Any problems you have to ask the desk to turn it off. Red Lodge is a fun place and there are great walks just back towards the Beartooth - try driving it in thunder, lightening and hail stones (on the 'wrong' side of the road) - it's a blast !

What a beautiful hotel. My husband and I have been there many times. You will absolutly want to make reservations at the resturant in the hotel. There is nothing like having a chef prepare your meal. Enjoy a drink and read about the hotels history in the sitting room. The rooms are wonderful. Dark carpets and woods, terry robes, comfortable beds, and fantastic views-not matter which room you get. (Some rooms have balconies or windows over looking the gallary) The staff is friendly and very helpful. Not to mention you get a free breakfast in the morning. A totally enjoyable enviroment.
