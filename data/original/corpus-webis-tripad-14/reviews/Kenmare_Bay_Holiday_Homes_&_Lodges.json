After much debating we decided to book a lodge as it was easier as the children could go out and play and we would be able to relax known they were safe and not confined to a hotel room. We booked the forelands house as it sleeps up to 8 and there was 9 of us which included a baby. On arrival the receptionist was Jason who was very helpful given us directions, and information on where was best to carry the younger children. When we arrived at the forelands I was very disappointed. I went out to the back yard to find it was a communal yard shared between 3 houses and gardens over grown really not suitable for the children as we were told, However I rang reception and I cannot give them enough credit they sorted us out with lodges and I must say they were beautiful. 5 stars to be fair. Lodges are beautiful modern decorated and the back gardens which was our main point of our weekend were lovely and secure. We had a lovely weekend in Kenmare and the Kenmare bay staff were very nice and considerate. I cannot comment on food as we did the cooking in the lodge but We were all happy and will definitely be returning again.", "title": "family weekend break", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "norsroc", "date": "May 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161866453}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Lodges have everything you need to make your stay comfortable.

Lots of pots, pans, crockery, washer/drier, etc. The only thing that was missing was a clothes line (outdoor). There was a clothes horse but it was small and of poor quality...certainly not able for towels / swim gear after a day at the beach. But that's just a minor complaint. We were very happy with the house itself. We had use of the hotel pool and used it several times. The kids really enjoyed it....lots of toys/floats available. We didn't use the kids camp so can't comment on it. The hotel had a small playground but we didn't use it as the ground around it was far too wet...it could do with an upgrade/relocation in the grounds.

For the first six nights, there were familes in the neighbouring houses. However on the final Friday, we observed a large group of men moving into those houses (stag? golf weekend? Not sure). Anyway those guys were really loud - shouting across to each other at 12am, 2am, 3am as they arrived back from the pub. While they were just having fun & \"craic\", they didn't consider that there was a family with small kids living between their houses. I mentioned to the hotel receptionist the next morning that perhaps the hotel should consider keeping the families isolated from these potentially-loud bookings. The girl on reception did apologise but I guess she hasn't much control over this type of thing. I guess I should have asked to speak to the manager but, as we were anxious to get on the road, I didn't persue it further.

The next time I would definitely hope we can stay longer. The short little walk to kenmare village was really manageable several times per day even for our 3 year old. There was so many thing that we could have done at the hotel and in the area but simply ran out of time so must go back. On the lazy food days we sometimes went to the hotel for breakfast they have a kids corner for the smaller kids and you could easily have a long one. The hotel facilities and 3 sets of activities per day in the hotel for the kids really meant there was time for parents to relax. We used a babysitter recommended by the hotel and had a lovely adults only dinner in Packies - all arranged by the hotel staff.
