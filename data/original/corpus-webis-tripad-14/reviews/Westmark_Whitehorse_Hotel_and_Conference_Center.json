The hotel is owned by Holland America so it caters to the Alaska cruise line crowd, and as a result, it's over-priced and tries to be a high-end hotel but it clearly isn't. We paid $134 for a double-room at end of July and it was not worth the money. The rooms are renovated but small. Ask for a room on the third-floor--the rooms there are nicer. The staff aren't overly friendly but okay. The restaurant is good but again, overpriced and crowded. There's a free internet kiosk in the lobby and a small gift shop onsite. I would shop around for another hotel in Whitehorse (try the High Country Inn)--the Westmark is over-priced and just doesn't go out of its way to make you feel welcome.", "title": "Overpriced hotel but clean and comfortable", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "WBinBC", "date": "August 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 5578019, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Too expensive", "disliked": "\u2014 Shop around"}}], "location": {"country": "Canada", "city": "Whitehorse"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 16, "average": 64, "very good": 41, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 14}, "aka": "Westmark Whitehorse Hotel Whitehorse", "slim_ranking": 0.466666666667, "description": "Located in the heart of downtown, within blocks of area restaurants, night-spots, shopping and government offices, the Westmark Whitehorse Hotel & Conference Center is the Yukon's premier hotel and conference center.
