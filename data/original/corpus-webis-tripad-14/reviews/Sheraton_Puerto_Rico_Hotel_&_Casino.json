I stayed here because I was working at the Convention Center, which is right across the street.

The pool deck is awesome with an infinity pool overlooking the bay and a small airport. The lobby and bar area nice as well. The rooms are just average. They are clean but just average. We stayed on the Starwood Preferred floor and not sure what was so preferred about it. The rooms didn't have any refrigerators and no bathrobes. The rooms have the bare minimum. I will say this, the beds are great. Had a very comfortable sleep. The main thing lacking at this hotel is customer service. All of the staff we encountered weren't friendly at all. They could careless you are staying there. There are a few dining options on site. Choices, China Club, and Texas De Brazil. Although all 3 are on site, you can only charge to your at Choices. This is the only hotel I've stayed at that offers dining options, but won't let you make any room charges. Anyways, Texas De Brazil (which is a chain) was the best of all. I would stay away from Choices. I'm used to paying hotel prices but this place is overpriced! Rude waitstaff and mediocre food. I would recommend going across the street and trying out Ficus restaurant. Great drinks and good tapas style food. Also tried room service one night. Took about an hour to get a simple dessert and of course that was way overpriced as well. The location of the hotel isn't great either. You definitely need a car to get around. A cab to Old San Juan will run you $15. I would definitely recommend renting a car if staying here. All in all, I would recommend staying elsewhere if visiting this area. If the customer service were to drastically improve here, I would consider staying again. You can get more bang for your buck at other hotels.
