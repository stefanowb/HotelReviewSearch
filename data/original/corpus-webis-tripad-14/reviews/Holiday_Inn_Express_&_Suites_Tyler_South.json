This location is convenient to a lot of restaurants as well as the Oil Palace but we were very disappointed that our room was not ready at 3pm as guaranteed. The front desk host did give us a certificate for an additional 1000 Priority Club points that was very nice. Usually check-in times are not a big deal but because we needed to shower and dress for the concert & leave by 5pm it was a little unsettling to not get in our room until almost 4pm which left little time to relax from being on the road and then get ready for the night. The room seemed overly crowded and I bumped into the chair that was at the desk on the way from the bathroom several times.. the chair was way too big for the desk & the space between the desk & bed. I have stayed in other Holiday Inn Express & Suites that were much bigger & nicer & don't think this room could be called a suite. The free breakfast is always a welcome from Holiday Inn Express hotels & it had the standard food but the attendant was very conscientious in her job made sure everything was well stocked & clean. Might try the Staybridge Suites down the road if we every come back to Tyler but this hotel would do again also if we had no other choice.", "title": "Very Good / Economic", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lee M", "date": "January 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150232109}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled solo", "text": "I'm a platinum member with Holiday Prioroty Club and stay in a hotel abut 300 nights year and I've never been treated like this. On my second night here at about 9:00 PM the front desk calls me and tells me they need a credit card for incidentals. First I have two yes two business cards on file with Prioroty club and at all IHG i have stayed at I have never been asked for a personal card for incidentals. So I gave my personal debit card to them when they called the second night they told me my personal credit card was declined (rather strange as I used it all over town with no problems used it 30 minutes earlier for dinner) and I needed to come to the desk immediate and give $20 on a credit card for incidentals. This hotel has no bar no restaurant NOTHING like this all they have is a suite shop for snack I don't use there suite shop due to prices to high. I had advised the person I was not coming back down that night and I could take care of it on Sat. They continued to argue with me finally I hung up the phone. Then bright and early the next morning 8:00 am I got another call insisting I come down to pay a $100 cash deposit for incidentals. REALLY $100 for SNACK ARE YOU CRAZY and cash when I have TWO credit cards on file. I insisted that the manger call me in regards to this matter and guess who calls me.
