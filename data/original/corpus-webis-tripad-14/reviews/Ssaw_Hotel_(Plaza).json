The room was large and clean. In fact, it was cleaned every day whether I left the do not disturb sign on the door or not. The provided free bottled water daily and the mini bar prices were pretty good. It was also nice that the room had a small fridge. There was no bar soap in the bathroom only liquid body wash and shampoo which was a bother. At the same time, they provided robes and slippers which was a nice touch. Others have complained about the staff's lack of English. While I tried to speak with them in Chinese, I hear a few of the front desk people use simple English. My biggest complaint about this hotel is the breakfast offerings. While there was some decent variety, the quality of the Western and Chinese breakfasts was poor. While I am not surprised that the waffles and french toast were not quite up to standard, the poor quality Chinese food was disappointing. The hotel is well located to transportation and while not super convenient to the West Lake, was just about a 10 min cab ride away. They also had a fitness room which has seen better days but the equipment worked fine and that's really all you can ask for in a hotel at this level.", "title": "Large clean rooms but poor food offerings.", "user": "badwaiter", "date": "October 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 182926107}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Not too bad, for that price.
