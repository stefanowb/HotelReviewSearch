But the location is really, really wonderful. Our room had a sweet little balcony overlooking the Aegean. Breakfast was 24 hours and could be delivered to your room or served on the lovely sun deck with gorgeous views. The tile floors were a little sticky and dirty and we did occasionally have ants in the bathroom or near our suitcases. But having said that the staff are lovely, the rooms are huge and airy, the location is beautiful and perfect for sunset-watching, the breakfast is yummy and the beds are comfy. So overall, a really good choice.", "user": "toonceswindtalker", "date": "September 21, 2006", "id": 5822663}], "location": {"country": "Greece", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 10, "very good": 37, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 54}, "aka": "Atlantis Hotel Santorini/Fira", "slim_ranking": 0.561643835616, "description": "A' class hotel (4 stars) located in the best part and center of Fira/Thira, with breathtaking views of the Caldera-Volcano-Aegean Sea."}
