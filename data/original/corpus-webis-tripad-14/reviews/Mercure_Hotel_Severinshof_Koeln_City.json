This is the start of the Xmas markets and a good time to go as it gets busier in Dec so its slightly less crowded. Please note a lot of the shops and markets don't open on Sundays so save Sunday for sight seeing and do your shopping on Saturday if you go for a weekend..The Markets open until 10.00pm at night. There is such a lot of nice cheap food to chose from at these markets too we were spoilt for choice on what to eat. I recommend the market on the floating ship on the Rhein opposite the Dom Catherdral its lovely and well lit up at night.. This hotel is very nice and clean and the staff are all very helpful and speak very good English. Ask for a room which overlooks the court yard as its lovely and quiet. There are some rooms on the front where the traffic and trains go by, they could be noisy, also there is currently a lot of road works going on outside the hotel so again, I think a room at the back would be the better choice. It takes a good 15 minute walk into the centre but it is all main road and we felt quite safe walking around, in fact Cologne feels safe to walk around in anyway. From the hotel there is a regular bus service to the train station every 10 minutes. 132 and 133 service. The train station is at the Catherdral and central. We got a 48 hour pass from the information centre at the airport when we arrived. (Bonn/Koeln). 9 Euros for 24 hours or 14 Euros for 48 hours. This lets you use all trains/buses/trams for that period and well worth it. We took a train to Bonn for the afternoon with this ticket it takes 30 minutes to get to Bonn. There is a 20 minute train service from Platfrom 2 at the airport into the centre of Cologne (15 min journey) (30 minute service at weekends). It is excellent. It costs 2.20 Euros for a single journey or you can use your travel card purchased from the airport. The hotel rooms are huge and clean, nice bathroom toiletries too. Little mini bar with soft drinks and beers (no spirits) We paid 70 euros per room per night through Expedia which was good value. The breakfast is very nice buffett and lots of choice but very pricey 15 euros. There is a Subway food shop right next to the hotel which is open long hours. We got a breakfast bagette (ham/cheese toasted) and a coffee for 3.30 euros. The cheaper option for breakfast and it was very nice. We took it back to the room. There is a nice bar but again quite expensive. All in all this is a great little hotel for the price, but it is a 15 minute walk into the centre. You can take the sceanic route walk along the rhein to town which is quite nice. Some lovely quaint little bars and kellars on the way into town.", "title": "Not a 4 star.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Boet", "date": "August 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 5589872}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Friendly and comfortable", "text": "my girlfriend and i staid there four 4 nights and everything was Ok, except an extrange smell that appears sometimes.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 4, 2006", "id": 4895575}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Just stayed 1 night at the Mercure in a twin room.
