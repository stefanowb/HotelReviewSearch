Room was large and had plenty of space for my family of four. Having the extra seating area was nice. Room seemed cleaned, but when you look a little closer (like under the sofa), my opinion changed. Really could use some deep cleaning behind beds, and under furniture. Beds were very comfortable, but lots of noise from doors slamming and traffic from interstate. Very disappointed with breakfast selections. After the first morning, we did not eat breakfast again. Mostly cold items and all carbs, weak coffee. Small outdoor pool, no hot tub. If I ever return to the area, I would likely pick a different place.", "title": "Newer hotel, average service and accomodations", "user": "Tessa C", "date": "June 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 164074219}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We arrived at the hotel at 1:45 and even though we were told that our room was ready -we were also told it would cost an additional $20.00 for early check-in. ($20.00 for 1 hr 15 minutes) Having stayed at hundreds of hotels over the years, I was shocked by this policy (and it's delivery). On another occasion, a fellow traveler stood waiting at the elevator only to realize, after a very long wait, that it was not working (no sign was posted), and after returning to the desk was told that indeed the elevator was not operational (by the 2 desk clerks he had passed by)!

I called the hotel's direct line which was very refreshing in itself as typically with chain hotels you are transferred to a reservation line. I spoke with Koby and made special arrangements for an early check-in at noon. When I arrived, Koby was working the front desk and actually remembered my call from the previous day and had an early room ready. Awesome! The room is VERY comfortable. Nice bedding and towels! And for $94/night this room is a steal! Both soft and firm pillows on the bed.
