We loved everything about it! The location is beautiful -- on a fairly secluded stretch of beach; the public areas of the resort are lovely; and the rooms are decorated with Mexican art and furniture. The service was impeccable -- everyone at the hotel was so friendly and willing to help us with anything we needed. The food and drinks were delicious; most meals were taken with a gorgeous view of the ocean. We especially enjoyed eating dinner while watching the sunest. Since the hotel only has eight rooms, it is a very intimate place with personalized service. Everything is well orchestrated without being stuffy. We can't wait to go back for another romantic vacation! It is certainly not an inexpensive place to stay, but if you want to treat yourself to some rest and relaxation in luxurious style, don't miss Casa de Mita!", "title": "Casa de Mita is paradise", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AKCHouston", "date": "September 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 40441853}], "location": {"country": "Mexico", "region": "Pacific Coast"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 95}, "aka": "Casa De Mita Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Luxury Mexico boutique villa style hotel ... located on a secluded white sanded beach in Punta de Mita just north of Puerto Vallarta ...
