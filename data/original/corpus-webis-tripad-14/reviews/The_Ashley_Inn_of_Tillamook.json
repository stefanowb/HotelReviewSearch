We signed an agreement that we would not smoke in our room or there would be charges (we are non-smokers so thought nothing more about it). Big mistake. If you sign it make sure that someone looks at the room with you before you leave so there is a signed agreement that you did not smoke in the room. We received our charge card statement with an extra $300 added on to the bill. The hotel did not have the courtesy to even let us know they put it on our bill.
