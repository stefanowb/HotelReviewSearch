The grounds were pretty and it was easy to find the check in area. We arrived late -check in was a little slow but no heavy pressure for timeshare tour. We had one phone call offering the timeshare tour the next day, but that was it. We turned down the escort to our unit with no argument. We were in building CC - 7. My first thought upon entering was \"this place was decorated in the 80's\"! Lots of mirrors and pastels. Everything was dated, but working. The master bedroom had a hard mattress. There was a huge 2-person jacuzzi tub. I did not like that the bathroom was open to the bedroom, with just the toilet in its' own closet. Also, the toilet light and fan were connected, so if you turn on the light the rather loud fan runs. Lots of drawer space in both rooms. We had a screened porch overlooking a pond - very nice. Laundry and dishwash detergent, paper towels, garbage bags, etc. and 1 complementary coffee were provided. It came with sweetener and powdered cream packets included. We really liked the coffee- you can get more at their store. Due to flight delays we were arriving late, so I called and was able to order a few groceries, and they were in our room when we arrived. You can also do this online I think from 5 to 1 day in advance. Location is nice, not too crowded and easy to get to the parks. There was a Publix nearby where we got the rest of our groceries. Did not use any of the pools, facilities, etc. we were die-hard theme park goers. We received maid service and fresh towels once in the middle of the week. Our last trip we stayed in a condo on Disney property, Old Key West, and while the Disney property was nicer in appearance, my family's comfort level was really nearly identical here.

Id read all the previous reviews and was a bit worried. Id rung a week before to request an upstairs one bed villa overlooking the lake if possible. Upon arrival they had no note of my request but did upgrade us to a top floor two bed villa which we were very happy about. However upon arrival at block PP, we realised that this upgrade came with a price - the villa was right next to the Goods In/Out staff entrance and was very noisy and busy first thing in the morning and last thing at night every day with loud staff arriving/departing and noisy goods vehicles. We turned down the timeshare tour and breakfast that they offered at check in and told them we didnt need to wait for an escort (a timeshare sales person) and to just give us a map to find our villa and we'd find the place ourself (it was so simple). We were not bothered again by any of the sales team. We had bought tickets before arrving in Florida on the disney website so didnt need disney tickets, though they offered us $75 cash instead which still wasnt worth sitting through the timeshare spiel, we've done it before elsewhere and it was bad enough then!! The villa was spacious and clean (some bedsheets had some stains on (blood and mold I think) but we replaced those with spares from the closet). The villa had everything you could possibly need, it was very well stocked, even giving you a box of wash powder and dish and dishwasher detergent. Loved the whirlpool tub in the bedroom too! The staff were curteous and efficient when we called guest services. There was no daily housekeeping but we were offered fresh linen and towels each day. The pools and spa were great - heated and clean and the one nearest us wasnt that busy as we were right on the edge of the resort. The main pools were much busier. The pool bar at pool 1 is great and the girls there serve great cocktails. Joe's deli in the store make great sandwiches and there is everything you could need in the store. Disney properties were really close and there were loads of chain restaurants on highway 192 nearby. We loved all the outlet malls, Prime, Premium, Lake Buena Vista etc. We had no problems with lines checking in or with parking at all. I would recommend this resort, we had a good time, but we would've liked a lake view villa with a balcony as that wouldve just topped off our stay, rather than Block PP (one of the oldest and noisiest blocks in the resort).", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "London-Gal08", "date": "March 30, 2008", "id": 14659397}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with family", "text": "my husband, granddaughter and I stayed 3/16- 3/20/08 and had a very nice time.
