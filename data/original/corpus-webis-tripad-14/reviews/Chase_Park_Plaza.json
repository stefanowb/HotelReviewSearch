He's often mentioned the possibility of staying at the Chase some day. When we decided to drive to St. Louis to the History Museum in Forest Park, it seemed like just the time to do so - right across the street from the park and part of the Central West End scene. Although we did eat out for lunch at Balaban's (5 mins away), we spent the rest of our time in the hotel. Their cinema had 5 first-run movies playing - and the matinee price was quite reasonable. The hotel has 5 restaurants and 3 bars - and in the cold weather, the hotel becomes a nest. You don't have to go out for anything. We had a lovely gourmet meal and listened to jazz for free in the lobby bar. The service was prompt and friendly. and the room was immaculate. Galleria shopping is 10 mins away by car. Altogether a wonderful experience. My husband now wants to stay there everytime we go to Forest Park. He's an experienced business traveler and he was most impressed with the hotel.

The hotel lobbies, restaurants and the movie theater are wonderful, but the rooms are completely different story.

On top of that we had 3 false fire alarms in two nights,complete with strobe lights in the room, and the 4th one during breakfast.

We absolutely loved our beautifully furnished room and the professional, responsive hotel staff. The hotel has various eating establishments and a movie theater.

His father pulled one of the cushions off the couch, glanced at what he thought was the pullout part of the bed and realized there were no sheets and we couldn't find any extra pillows anywhere in our luxury suite. My husband called room service immediately and was told housekeeping would bring the sheets up right away. At 12:15 the sheets had still not arrived. Another call. More assurances the sheets would be up right away. At 12:30 and still no sheets my husband called again and was told by the night manager, \"I can't babysit housekeeping.\" Then he again assured my husband the sheets would be coming. When they finally arrived at 12:45 it was then that we realized the couch was not a sofa sleeper but a short couch that my son was going to have to sleep on. Both the front desk and reservations had failed to tell us that this luxury suite only had one bed and no place for my son. I'm not sure where they thought he would sleep. He's 5' 9\" tall.
