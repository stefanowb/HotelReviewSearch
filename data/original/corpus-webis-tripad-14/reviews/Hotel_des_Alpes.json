The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the main train station and is right across from the lake. There is a Starbucks a few spots down for those \"Starbucks Junkies\".

The positives - it was very easily walkable from the train station and the view from our room/porch was terrific. We arrived in the rain, but easily knew where the hotel was because of the location shown on the internet (by the old bridge and water tower). Surprisingly, we met a couple at our last hotel who had stayed here and they told us to enter from the back of the hotel, on the street - and not along the waterway. This was a good help because there were many stairs from the waterway entrance. Our room was somewhat wanting in terms of needing paint and cleaning of the walls - it was also really narrow and the floors uneven (but, you cannot complain about that in a 300 year old hotel - can you?). The bathrooms were very new and immaculate and the mattresses/linens were also new. We have stayed in other old hotels, but the walls needing painting were my biggest complaint - it was dirty. The breakfast was nice - ham, hard boiled pink eggs (that was cute), fruit, bread, coffee - and they had an outside porch - lovely. I would be honest and say that our second day - where we had good weather, made this hotel more appealing. There was another nice looking hotel down the street - hotel des balances...we do not know the price, but I would have checked this out.

The key that remains on the board while you're out is self locked, and the only way to remove it is by inserting the other key you have in your hands while you're out and vice-versa.
