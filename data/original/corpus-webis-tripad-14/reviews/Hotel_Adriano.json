We couldn't access the WIFI in our room and the shower was strange - it was in our room, rather than in the bathroom. But the bed was comfortable and the location was so good that who wants to spend time in their room anyway? We walked to the Vatican, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, Colosseum, etc. There are several excellent restaurants nearby including Obika Mozzarella Bar which is just around the corner.", "title": "Superb Location and Breakfast", "user": "Billy E", "date": "May 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162359989}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is in a great location with respect to popular tourist sites, as well as many good restaurants, bars, and shopping areas. The lobby, bar, and common sitting areas were unusually modern for Rome - I would even say eclectic. The included breakfast was superb. The room was comfortable, though the particular room my wife and I had did not have any chairs for sitting - only a desk chair, also no closet, dresser, or wardrobe, and only a set of shelves and a rod of hangers on the side wall of the room. The bathroom was small with shower only. I realize these features depend on room type selected (we chose superior) but I have stayed at similarly priced hotels elsewhere in Rome and gotten more. The WiFi was acceptable - having a fixed userid and password for the entire stay, though not as easy as when there is no password required.", "title": "simply stunning!!", "user": "Lynn1963_13", "date": "May 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162277741}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lazio", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Rome"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 37, "average": 75, "very good": 345, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 268}, "aka": "Adriano Hotel Rome", "slim_ranking": 0.148264984227, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Housed in an elegant 17th century building in the historic centre of Rome, Hotel Adriano is very close to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona and the Spanish Steps.
