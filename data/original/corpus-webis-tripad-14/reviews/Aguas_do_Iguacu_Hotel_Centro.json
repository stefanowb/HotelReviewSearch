This hotel felt more like a 4 star hotel and deserves each star rating (***) bestowed on it. The entrance lobby is neat, modern and spacious with comfortable lounge suites for the guests. The passages are decorated with beautiful photos of overseas locations that give the hotel a real traveller's feeling. The tiled floors are shiny and clean creating a welcoming atmosphere. We had a beautiful, spacious and comfortable double bedroom with en-suite. The full buffet breakfast caters for all with a variety of hot and cold dishes. There are so many dishes to choose from and all the food choices are very tasty. The reception staff members were very friendly, speaking English fluently.The hotel is within walking distance from the central bus terminal (300m) for local or international bus either to the Argentina or Brazilia side of the Iguassu Falls. A variety of fast food stores are located within metres of the front door as well as a pharmacy right next door with an ATM inside. Our room was well worth the rate.

The night staff in reception however were brilliant. I never usually have much interaction with hotel staff other than check in/check out, however due to my own stupidity we didn't get stamped into Brazil and had to sort this out before we left for the airport, whilst managing time to visit the Brazil side of the falls as well. They helped us decide how to go about it, got us a cab at mate's rates (the guy showed us the meter and still charged us the cheap price), gave us advice on where to dine (we were going to go with Muffato but apparently the place next to Golden Tulip a few blocks away was better and it was tasty!) and generally made us feel pretty good about staying there. The wi-fi worked, breakfast was vast, even by Argentinian buffet standards, staff spoke English well (do you know how to say \"Brother from another Mother\" in Portuguese??) The place was generally clean, the coverlet on the bed was a little marked and we decided against using it - note that you don't need to in that climate. The pool outback actually looked usable and there was disabled access which was rare!

Our room faced a construction site, which started working with loud jackhammers around 8:00 even on the weekends, but that was probably preferable to the other side of the hall which faces a loud street. The advertised free internet in fact cost. The much lauded breakfast was actually a big letdown. While there was a good variety of food, none of it was very good. It was almost like they cooked and baked once a week and just let the food get stale for the rest of the week. The free airport pickup was, however, a definite plus.
