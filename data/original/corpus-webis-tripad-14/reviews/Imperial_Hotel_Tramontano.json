The room was very large, bright and had the most magnificent view of the water. When we checked in we were informed that the room was a french balcony room...I was initially a little nervous as this was our final stop on our Italy vacation and we were looking for R&R and a sea view was very important to us. The balcony is not very big but it did not take away from the wonderful experience. The room was extremeley well kept and the bathroom was large with a wonderful size shower/tub. The hotel and the beautiful grounds surrounding it was so lovely and even better than the website illustrates. The continental breakfast takes place in the restaurant over looking the sea. It is a good buffet and there a plenty of choices available. The service was also very good. The hotel is also in a perfect location to \"everything\" in Sorrento. Half block to where all of the shopping and restaurants begin. The \"center\" of town is a few blocks away. This was a trip we had been planning for many years and we were so pleased with the hotel and service that we would definitely recommend to our friends and return to ourselves.", "title": "Beautiful Hotel with great service", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "yogibb", "date": "July 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115818073}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for 4 nights and had a great time.

I guess there are some Americans (and others) that like that; indeed, one lady had the bell boy walking her two dogs around the garden, which we thought was silly.

We\u2019ve come at least a dozen times, and several friends have joined us over the years. Among us all, it\u2019s unanimous that this is the place to stay if you\u2019re visiting this charming town. It\u2019s also a perfect location from where you can go to Capri and Pompeii. What an absolutely beautiful spot! The gardens, the lobby, the balcony where you can have drinks and watch the sunset over the water \u2013 it\u2019s all fabulous. The staff is unfailingly polite and helpful, which is such a plus when traveling in a foreign country. Every room that we and our friends have stayed in is charming, with local ceramic tiles, comfortable beds, and spotless bathrooms. You can get a beautiful sea view with a balcony or a lovely garden view of rare tropical plants from all over the world: the accumulation of at least a hundred years of plantings, gorgeous flowering shrubs, exotic trees, and beds of flowers. There are tables and chairs throughout this spectacular horticultural setting, which are perfect spots to just sit and read or write postcards. You can either take the lift to swim in the sea below or enjoy the tranquility of the swimming pool that is set in the garden, where you can order delicious salads and pastas for lunch, and snacks later in the afternoon, and feel incredibly pampered. The actual building is quite old and historic, with wonderfully decorated common rooms and charming architectural touches throughout. The kitchen is marvelous! Great buffet breakfasts in the beautiful dining room provide everything from eggs and cereal to delicious pastries and wonderful fruit that you know was just picked. Dinners at sunset are the perfect combination of beautifully cooked and presented local specialties, solicitous service, and a lovely ambience. If you want to try restaurants in town, they are only minutes away because this hotel is so centrally located. The underlying allure of this hotel, what makes you keep wanting to come back, is the way that everyone - from the solicitous general manager and gracious people at the front desk, to the wait staff, porters, maids, and gardeners \u2013 makes you feel so at home. You may arrive exhausted and jetlagged, and somewhat disoriented, but the minute you arrive, you feel so welcome and taken care of.

The hotel is quite beautiful and the accommodation on the third floor excellent and overlooking the sea Everyone in the hotel are all very pleasant and easy to deal with. The restaurant also overlooks the Bay with very large windows. We always had a table for two by the windows and the service was excellent. The food was either Table d'ote or a la Carte and we could switch between either as we wished. Breakfast came with the room rate and was always excellent. The Restaurant was open from 7=00pm and the restaurant manager Luigi was kindest himself and always had some amusing remarks to make. Our last night there was made quite special for us by all the staff. The wine list is also very good with a wide selection of wines at all price ranges. We had a car and one asked the Concierge when one was going out and the car was waiting at the door. Similarly it was parked for you on return.
