If you're not in that market it feels overpriced for what you get. We paid \u00a385 for a room with tatty furniture and paper thin walls. We could hear conversations and tv from next door rooms. The gym was great when I was the only person in it. It's open to non residents. There were 9 people in for 9 gym stations which was totally unworkable so i ended up leaving earlier than planned. Pool looked great. Dinner was fine but a little expensive for the quality at over \u00a320 for two courses. I was amused to have 'full price' written on my bill as though it was an unusual occurrence. I thought the staff were very friendly and helpful.

It was good to have time to enjoy the swimming pool, jacuzzi and steam room, The walk down into Pitlochry was easy although going 'up hill' on the way back took a little longer but there were various different routes to take.
