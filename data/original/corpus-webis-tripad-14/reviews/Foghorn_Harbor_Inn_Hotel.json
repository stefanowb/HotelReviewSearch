LA with shuttle transfers", "text": "Beautifully situated right on a safe childrens beach facing marina - a bay view room is a must.Also, make sure that you do not get a room too near the reception as you can hear the phone ringing etc, but it did not disturb us during the night. Upstairs rooms with balcony are best but downstairs rooms provide immediate access to beach - however people who walk past look into your \"private\" windowed patio as if into a goldfish bowl - they can't help themselves! ( hence upstairs is best.)Room furniture pleasant with air con, fridge and microwave and free coffee and hot water always available in reception, along with plastic cutlery if you bought any food to microwave from the excellently well stocked adjacent shop. A fly screened balcony door was appreciated.Free breakfast was self service in polystyrene and plastic - but hey, there was lots of choice and it was free!Free video library also appreciated and an excellent idea.Female staff and young man all very pleasant and helpful - just an older man needed a course in PR we thought.Need to book to eat at The Cheesecake Factory or be prepared to wait - this restaurant even has valet parking! You can walk nextdoor to it from this hotel though. Eddie's diner just beyond Jamaica Inn was quiet and good value.You can walk to famous Venice Beach - time it for the sunset from the pier - great! You also walk past the Venice canals on the way which are quite pretty.We felt safe here and would visit again on a stop over between NZ and UK. Free shuttle transfer by \"Coast Shuttle\" on request too.", "helpfulness": 29, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 2, 2004", "id": 1761585}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007", "text": "Skip this one unless you like rude hosts.", "title": "Rude People", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Estephania", "date": "July 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 8135973, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 rude man"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We loved this little hotel (30 rooms) which we selected for our family reunion.

The clean beach is a well maintained city park which has volley ball nets, covered picnic tables and play ground equipment for the little ones in the family. here are lifeguards for a roped off swiming area.There is a very nice walking path which goes around the beach and the upscale marina. Each room had a 27 inch wall mounted flat screen LCD TV, refrig and microwave oven . Our rooms were very quiet and the beds (two Queens) comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was average consisting of waffels, yogurt, boiled eggs, assorted cold cereals, juices, coffee and variety of pastries. No pets are allowed.
