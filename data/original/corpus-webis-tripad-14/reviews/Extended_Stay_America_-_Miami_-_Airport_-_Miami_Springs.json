The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and the room we stayed in was huge and comfortable. We had 2 beds and a sofa with a full kitchnette. The table is also bigger than usual ones in Homestead rooms. They offer free breakfast during weekdays, and there is a small gym room within the hotel. Our stay was a happy experience.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "lizzylizzy", "date": "January 6, 2004", "id": 1540684}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Miami Springs"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 15, "very good": 23, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 21}, "aka": "Homestead Studio Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333}
