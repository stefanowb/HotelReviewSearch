Supposedly, the Riviera/White Sands was newer, but we could not see any difference to the lobby/pool facilities in comparison to the Colonial/Kantenah. The room was nice, but there was practically NO drawer space or dresser for a family of 5. We had the closet which had 3 small shelves in it and 3 tiny drawers in the desk (THAT WAS IT!!) We had to take the phone book out of the nightstand to use as a drawer and then place our clothes in stacks on a small table. Our screen was broken and barely opened and closed.

The car to pick us up to go to the airport was late and we were getting worried. I went to the front desk and they told me to go around the corner and look at the airline book. I told them I did and they just kinda stared at me and said to go get the number. So I go back to my bf and complain and he goes (I guess he spoke louder to them) but they picked up the phone and dialed a number.
