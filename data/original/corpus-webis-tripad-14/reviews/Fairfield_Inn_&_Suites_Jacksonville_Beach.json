The hotel was lovely, nice view, the pool was just OK, but the Courtyard's pool was wonderful, and you can use it too, and it is right on the beach. My kids kept going between the pool and the beach, it was nice! The guy at the front desk could not have been more outgoing and kind, I'm pretty sure it is the same guy that was mentioned before. He gave us great dining ideas, we hate the chain restaurants so we wanted somewhere local, and it was great. The breakfast was nice with plenty of choices, everyone found something they liked.

We really did not mind the short walk to the beach, and it was great to have the extra space. Also, there is an AWESOME barbecue restaurant < 10 minutes away called Mojo Kitchen (1500 Beach Blvd) - do not miss this place!
