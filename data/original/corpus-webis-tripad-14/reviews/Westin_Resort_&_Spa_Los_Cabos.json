Starwood required us to prepay our entire stay. This was a big mistake. We were dissatisfied from the start. We requested adjoining rooms - denied. Queen beds - denied. Bugs in room - sprayed and left spray all over floors/furniture. Tried to play miniature golf - facility is so dated it was deplorable with no attendant/equipment. The hotel is huge and impersonal. We gave 24 hr notice that we would like to leave the hotel after 3 nights and requested a refund for only the remaining unused nights - denied. We left anyway and have requested multiple times a refund with Starwood Corporate - denied. They make you prepay and then it doesn't matter if a guest is satisfied or not. You are stuck. They don't care. There are too many other hotels that know how to do business and treat a guest well. Take your business elsewhere.", "title": "DO NOT PREPAY!

Large and awe inspiring. Beautiful beach with small rock outcroppings. Drinks and food brought to you there, the multiple heated pools or in the pool side restaurant. Rooms are ok...nothing remarkable, small to medium sized rooms with shower and bath both. Most rooms in the hotel have incredible ocean views due to the semi circle design. Wifi is spotty throughout the hotel as well as cell service, but available. Food good, but not incredible. Limited choices without taking taxi to nearby San Jose or Cabo San Lucas (20 mins and $28 by taxi). Service is great. Just ask and it will be brought to your room or they will assist. We had a large business meeting there and it went very well. Good organization and coordination. Ability to serve groups 4-500 in size. They offer an all inclusive package for groups. Not sure about individuals. Few gift shops...a couple of locals allowed to sell small items at the beach. Great spa with steam room and sauna. Well stocked workout area with treadmills, stair climber, ellipticals, weights etc. Only downside to Westin is unique design. Takes several days to figure your way around. Be prepared to walk a lot.

I see a lot of complaints about the cost of food but the quality was excellent from the large breakfast buffet with great omelet station at La Playa, pool side bar for lunch (great sea bass ceviche and fish tacos) to the dinner at the upscale restaurant Arrecifes. The service was phenomenal. Every staff member we encountered was very warm, friendly, and accommodating. The grounds and pool were beautiful and well kept.

We did not recieve information from the front desk of specifically how to get to our room so we were wandering around a bit, but it was a minor inconvenience.

The room was very nice -- large, with a nice balcony and big bathroom. The room was impeccably clean. They provide several free bottles of water each day. The WiFi was expensive, though discounted by half for our conference, and the signal wasn't great but not terrible either -- certainly enough to send and receive email reliably. Internet speed was better through the Ethernet cable - good enough to video chat with occasional disruption. Others have complained about the distance from the lobby to the street, in order to get to and from San Jose Cabo or Los Cabos. This is true, however I also think it's a bit exaggerated. It's probably a 10 minute walk, all on the hotel property. The bus comes frequently in either direction and costs less than $2. It takes about 20 minutes to get to San Jose and 45 to Los Cabos on the bus. The service at the hotel was exceptional -- the front desk staff, the wait staff, bartenders, cleaning staff, pretty much everyone we encountered went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.

The staff was amazing, so friendly and I agree with the other reviews about the folded pj's and margaritas.
