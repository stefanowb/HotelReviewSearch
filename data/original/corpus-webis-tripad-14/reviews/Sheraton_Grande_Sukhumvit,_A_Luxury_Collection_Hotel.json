The Sheraton has excellent steam and sauna rooms and the pool is far more elaborate than the Westin, though the Westin's is more practical for a legitimate swim. Both have great BTS access, though the noise of the trains is audible on the front sides of the hotels unless you are on the very highest floors. This Sheraton is a member of Starwood's vaunted Luxury Collection properties and it does appear in the 2009 Conde Nast Reader's Choice Awards, and I've always found that recognition a great litmus test of quality.
