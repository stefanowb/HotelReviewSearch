The food was excellent and the staff very attentive. Jorge, the Manager, runs the restaurant very efficiently and has a great team of staff behind him. The setting is really nice and there is a lovely ambience. We have been going to this restaurant for quite some time and never fail to be impressed each time we visit. We really do feel that this is a great alternative for us as normally we head to London for a special meal. There is so much variety on the menu and there is also a very good drinks menu to choose from and the prices are very reasonable. We look forward to returning in the very near future. Thank you for another wonderful evening.", "title": "ANOTHER WONDERFUL DINING EXPERIENCE AT ROSLIN'S", "user": "GMConnor", "date": "January 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 148991000}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited December 2012", "text": "Our party enjoyed a delightful New Year's Eve lunch with near perfect service from two very helpful waitresses.

The service was outstanding at all times. The menu had a lot of choice, unusual for Sunday lunch, all the roasts you would expect plus a few other dishes including fish of the day and vegetarian. The roasts come with beautiful puffy yorkies and lots of fresh vegetables. my other half's fish came with a beautifully dressed salad. There is a lot of choice for desserts too, including the famous Rossi ice cream and a delectably light sponge pudding. For three courses plus a little smoked duck appetiser you pay \u00a324.50 which is amazing value.
