The hotel staff treated us great for the time we walked in the door until we checked out (3 night stay). The hotel is clean both inside and out. Rooms are a bit small but thats Fairfield. No question where we will stay when we return for another visit. Rates a little pricey but we were on a football game weekend. Go Buckeye's!! P.S.
