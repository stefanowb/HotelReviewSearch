Our room was neat, the aircon worked perfectly, and the bathroom was clean. The restaurant/bar had a fantastic vibe with a great chill area upstairs with tv/dvd for the couch potatos. The quality and variety of food was excellent, and the pool overlooking the beach magnificent. The various snorkelling, rafting and diving-with-dolphins outings we had were incredible and the spice tour and tour of stone town were extremely interesting.", "user": "stix08", "date": "November 1, 2009", "id": 48283232}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Absolutely magic", "text": "When reviewing this hotel, one has to take into account that Zanzibar is a small island with weak infrastructure, and shouldn't be directly compared to a hotel in a first world country.

Coral Rock is excellent value for money, and ultimately it is for people who want an extremely relaxed holiday doing very little but reading by the pool, snorkelling/sailing in the ocean, and drinking cocktails. If you go there with the right expectations you'll find that Coral Rock far exceeds its \"2 star\" rating. I give this hotel an 'Excellent' rating because it exceeds expectations in every aspect.

The service was in African time but so were we after 10 minutes of arriving!

The food was very tasty but after 8 days I will admit the choice became a bit limited and sometimes they did not have everything on the menu but I can forgive and forget seeing as they were so remote!

We did several tours and the best by far was snorkling with a local guide called Mr Chicken (he will happily explain why he is so called!) - he took us out on a peaceful dhow boat and was very attentive in pointing out the occasional nasties like bluebottle jellyfish (they are only there at certain times of the day i.e with the tide - don't be put off) which was great as I've never been an overly confident swimmer in the sea... we reached a very calm chest height rock pool called the 'fish tank' which was 1 hour of snorkling bliss.
