I travel there every year for work/vacation and have stayed at the Oberoi/Taj/Imperial and this is definitely a step above. I arrive at 200 am and they completed check in at my room so I could get more sleep. Breakfast the following morning was a great spread of both Indian and Western food. Had dinner at Jamavaar which was also excellent though the menu could be more varied. The room was gorgeous- very modern and well appointed but at the same time very traditionally Indian. Bathoom was beautiful marble with a huge sink in tub that had rose petals and a TV to watch while you bathe! What however set the hotel apart was the service from the staff. Nothing was too much to do from a specific coffee to running to the pharmacy to get medicine I had left at home (this was done at no additional charge). The spa is also not to be missed with excellent service.
