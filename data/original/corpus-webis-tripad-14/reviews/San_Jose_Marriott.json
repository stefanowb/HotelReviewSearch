I booked a \"deluxe king\" via their website and the room was nice but didn't have any sitting area to speak of. They were able to upgrade me the second night to a room which had a loveseat and two chairs which made a big difference even though the room itself didn't seem appreciably bigger overall. Both bathrooms were spacious with marble counters and were spotlessly clean. I don't like shower curtains but the curved shower rod made it more tolerable. The water pressure wasn't great but I always wish the pressure would be greater. The bed was very comfortable and the, linens and pillows were very nice. Both rooms were corner rooms on high floors (19th and 23rd respectively) with beautiful views of Cesar Chavez plaza and the rest of downtown. Anyone who has been to San Jose knows that it \"boasts\" one of the LEAST impressive skylines but from that height even San Jose looked pretty. On to service...
