To start, the location couldn't be better. Walking distance to all the best shopping, restaurants and nightlife. The hotel is beautifully appointed, with a hip vibe and and thoughtful design. There were 3 of us traveling, 2 in regular rooms and 1 in a suite. All rooms were spacious with really comfortable beds, fabulous bathrooms, fantastic views and really cool decor. But the BEST thing about the Thompson Chicago is the staff. Everyone exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff was extremely efficient and so pleasant! Working with Cheryl, the concierge was delightful. Very knowledgable and a real sweetheart! And Gary, Verdell, Louis, Sam, Dan and Edwin\u2026 what can I say? These guys are stellar!!! Always smiling, so cheerful and eager to help. They made our stay so enjoyable. Even the housekeeping staff (especially the lovely woman who took care of my sons rooms on the 11th floor :) did a great job and were so personable. It was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had.

We were just in town for one night, but it was fantastic. The lobby is chic, but welcoming, with a fire warming you up as you enter. The restaurant wasn't opened yet. Check in was a breeze. We had booked through travel-zoo, so were a little nervous that we'd get the smallest room in the house, so we were delighted to open the door to find a spacious corner room on the 11th floor - room 1113. Really beautiful, lovely room. Great decor. Comfortable seating area. Fun art. I loved the bathroom - even though I usually hate rain showers. I will say that the tile flooring was freezing, but it was beautiful, so I won't complain. Super nice bath products. And my favorite touch in a while in any hotel - a night light setting in the bathroom. Comfortable bed with lovely linens! The staff was all incredibly friendly.
