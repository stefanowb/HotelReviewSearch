The weather was great, although a bit chilly at night, but expected for this time of year. I am always a bit weary of the hotels that come with a package holiday, but this one was really good! The Foyer is very grand with a huge, floral light as it's focal point. The reception staff were very friendly and although not the most knowledgeable - they gave all the advice and tips that they could, complete with brochures and timetables. We arrived around 8.45pm and told us that they would take care of our lugage and to make our way to the dining room to make sure we had something to eat. Rooms are an okay size - very clean with excellent service from the maids (they noticed we were chilly at night and made up our beds with extra blankets!). Our balcony faced onto the back and onto the swimming pool and we could also see a bit of the sea and it was very quiet. We weren't really planning on eating in the hotel as hotel food on a package is, I have found, generally rotten! However, the food in this hotel is okay. We found something to eat most nights (sometimes the 'Prima Patti' first course of pasta is enough!) and the service from the waiting staff is excellent. We ate there a total of 4 nights out of the 7 (simply because we were elsewhere and pushed for time) All speak very good english and if you try a bit of italian on them they are very appreciative! There is also a 'gala dinner' on the Wednesday which is worth it -4 courses of lovely freshly made food. I was very impressed with this hotel and I would definately recommend it to others and if I ever find myself in Sorrento again, I would go back and stay here. One thing that is worth pointing out are the excursions - especially if you book through Thomson or Portland Direct. Don't book them with your rep - they are a rip off! There are plenty of buses to Positano and Amalfi and there are Tourist buses you can catch with a tour guide on Corso Italia (the main street) for a fraction of the price. Also, we met a couple who did a Pompei trip with them and they were only there for 2 hours! We did it ourselves by train (the Circumvesuviana line is 200 metres from the hotel on the other side of the street) it cost only 3 Euros return for the train and 11 euros for admission and we spent all day there - a saving of 30 euro's each!! Also, if you are planning on hiring a car - do it yourself. The reps charged 70 euros (an additional 20 if you wanted insurance). Europcar (who the reps use) which is a 3 minute walk from the hotel charge 55 euros - and that includes insurance, although the staff here are really sour faced. There is also an Avis very near by who charge the same rate (no extra charge for insurance). Also, don't bother with the 'Welcome' meeting - ithey take you to a Theatre that is a 15 minute walk away and all it is 40 minutes of slides of various places around Sorrento and it's main purpose is to SELL!", "title": "The Star of Sorrento!", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "andare", "date": "October 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6006523, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Service and Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was the first time I've ever booked a package holiday (though Thomson's), and I have to say I wasn't disapointed at all.", "title": "Great location", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "fire_sermon", "date": "October 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5967866, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the food and the view", "disliked": "\u2014 the extra charges"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel, while not quite as plush as the pictures - but then they never are - was friendly, clean and in a very convenient location.", "title": "3 star hotel - with 4 star service!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "StuAndJo", "date": "October 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5904316, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The friendly waiters", "disliked": "\u2014 3 star rooms!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our room was quite large and fresh, with a tiled floor, a bath and shower, and as we were on the corner we had not one, but two sea facing balconies.", "title": "We loved sorrento", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "SmithS&B", "date": "September 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5829211, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Aug 11 - Aug 18 2006", "text": "Our large double bed turned out to be two singles shoved together, but I think this tends to be pretty standard practice and it was very comfortable with good white sheets and a throw.

The Hotel is about 15 minutes walk from the centre. If you don't like walking there are loads of buses. It is on a busy road and we did get the balcony over looking the main road and the petrol station! But there was really no noise when the balcony door was closed. It is kinda funny watching the traffic on the road!! I would say that the hotel is very good, not excellent, but value for money. Have to say though it was very clean and our room was kept spotless every day. We liked the hotel, very friendly with a lovely pool, food ok, not briliant, but there wasn't anything we didn't like. Although the brochure stated there was a charge for sunbeds we didn't pay the whole time we were there. We loved our holiday and can't wait to go back to Sorrento. Would I stay at the hotel again, probably yes. However having now been there we found some fabulous hotels overlooking the Marina Grande.

Our double room was very spacious. Unfortunately we were unable to get a room at the back so we were facing the road - which is extremely busy. This is okay for sleeping as once you have the doors to the balcony shut no noise gets through. But for sitting out on the balcony of an evening, after a few minutes if the noise hasn't gotten to you the petrol fumes from across the road will!! So book in time and get a room at the back if you like sitting on your balcony at night!! Also our room was on the floor just below the dining room so I was awoken every morning by the noise of furniture being moved about and things being dropped.
