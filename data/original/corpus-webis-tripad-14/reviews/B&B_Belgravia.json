We were not disappointed. It is less than a 10 minute walk from Victoria Station. Several restaurants are \"around the corner.\" There are rooms on 3 or 4 floors (no elevator). We asked for a room in the back and on the 1st floor (that's one flight up in American terms). Our room was as expected; clean and comfortable, though not very large - typical of Europe. The bathroom was bright and modern. There was a very good cooked to order English breakfast. The staff were kind, efficient and helpful. Tea and coffee were always available in the lounge as was free use of a computer/internet. There are any number of places to stay along this section of Ebury Street - this is the best of the three we have tried in recent years. Only downside is the price of over $200 a night, but this is London and like anywhere, you get what you pay for.", "title": "An excellent spot", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "mizella", "date": "December 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6470637, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, cleanliness, modernization", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing really"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Like so many other posters on this site, my wife and I (both in our forties) really liked the place.
