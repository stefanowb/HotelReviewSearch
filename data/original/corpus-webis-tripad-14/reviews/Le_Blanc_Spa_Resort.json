I had read all the reviews so knew the place was gonna be good. I was kinda hesitant because I felt the per night price was high (over $800 a night for a Jr Suite), but I must admit, the place was a great value. Here are my highlights: The hotels beach front is beautiful. It is quiet and well maintained. The staff in all parts of the hotel are amazingly friendly and service focused. The butlers on every floor make taking care of any detail super easy. The food is good (not amazing, but it is good). The \"all inclusive\" really is..there aren't any gimmicks..you can upgrade things like better wines, but in general the room fee covers everything. We stayed during a very busy time and there were no hiccups...they handled max capacity just fine. The rooms are clean, modern and well maintained. We used the gym daily and found it to be well equipped and maintained. We also used the Spa and it was A+. We are a gay couple and were not sure how accepted that would be, but the hotel and staff were very welcoming and we met several other gay couples who also enjoyed the hotel. Final FYI - I was not sure how tipping worked in an all inclusive place and found that tipping staff is not required, BUT, you WILL want to tip because the service is honestly worth it (we tipped in US dollars) and the staff were very grateful.", "title": "Great Getaway Spot!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BrianSantaBarbara_CA", "date": "January 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148894235}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was our fourth Christmas (and first new year) spent at this fantastic Hotel!
