{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 315, "name": "BEST WESTERN Valley Hotel", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel for a family wedding. We were blessed with gorgeous weather and so the wedding was held outside. I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel even though I had read all the positive reviews posted by previous visitors. The quality of service and food during the whole weekend was excellent. Some of the rooms are a little on the small side but you get this at all hotels and it is a bit of pot luck unless you know the hotel really well. My husband and I were allocated a room on the ground floor that was fine, a little dark but comfortable enough. We decided to dine at the hotel restaurant on Friday night and had a superb meal together with excellent service from the young waiting staff. Breakfast was also very good and the hotel seemed to have everything well in hand for the wedding preparations and were very helpful and acoomodating. The wedding took place outside as the sun was shining and this made the occasion even more special. The wedding meal was again very good and I was impressed with the quality of the food and what was also very good was that the food was hot, no easy task when you are serving over 70 people. After the meal we were asked to take our coffee outside so that the staff could prepare the room for the evening. Once the room was ready an announcement was made and guests were asked to make their way back into the function room where the DJ had set up and tables had been moved to clear a space for the dance floor. The evening was brilliant and everyone had a great time. I really do have to complement the person in charge of staff training. The staff, particularly the waiting staff who are in the most quite young, are excellent and were always pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient - well done. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others, it really is very good value. The only reason that I have not given 5 stars for my rating was because one member of staff was a little over officious when speaking to my husband, daughter and partner when they were sat having a drink on the bar terrace. This was after the wedding meal and in the brief time before we were allowed back in the function room for the evening entertainment. An announcement had been made asking wedding guests to return to the function room but my husband, daughter and partner had not finished their drinks and preferred to sit on the bar terrace for a little while longer. The member of staff concerned told them in no uncertain terms that wedding guests were not allowed to use the bar terrace during the evening and could not use the hotel bar (there was a bar in the function room for wedding guests). Whilst I totally understand that the hotel has other guests and it must be annoying when wedding guests spill out and use other areas of the hotel I do not take kindly to this dictatorial attitude. Wedding guests are not second class citizens and in fact as we were staying at the hotel for two nights I think we had as much right as anyone else to use whatever part of the hotel was available to other guests. Obviously if this is not the case then perhaps the hotel should advertise the fact. I am sure it was just a case of a member of staff speaking before thinking but it was not a good advertisement for future wedding parties and rather upset everyone when they heard this. I am sure this was a one off and would not let it stop me form using this hotel again. Ironbridge is a delightful place to visit, so many museums, antique centres, lovely shops and of course the riverside with its wonderful bridge.", "title": "Superb venue", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Gemima", "date": "June 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 163479565}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned from a wonderful few days at The Valley Hotel in Ironbridge.We had DBB and the staff at the hotel made us feel very welcome right from checkin.", "title": "leisure break for Golden Wedding", "user": "George B", "date": "May 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161799456}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "We found the hotel very comfortable and the food in the restaurant was first class.", "title": "Very enjoyable stay", "user": "Skiathosrunningclub", "date": "May 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161738292}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "A mention should be made of the restaurant staff who looked after us so well, nothing was a trouble even though we were always last to leave at breakfast.", "title": "a good hotel", "user": "hellebore49", "date": "May 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161734537}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is in a wonderful position for all the nearby attractions of the Ironbridge Gorge, and also the Air Museum at Cosford", "title": "Great hotel in a beautiful location", "user": "truckersgirl", "date": "May 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161694342}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Everything was very good.The food and the restaurant service were excellent.The staff were not only helpful and courteous but also really friendly.
