However the meal here more than made up for it. We booked in the morning for the evening in the dining room, but the bar/lounge looked just as inviting. The food was first class and so was the service. The staff were very helpful and did not rush us at all. I would say it was value for money because most main course meals in the pubs in the area are around \u00a310 or \u00a311 and I think you pay for what you get and if that means good service and food then it's worth it.
