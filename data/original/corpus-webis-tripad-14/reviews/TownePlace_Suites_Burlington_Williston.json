The staff is EXTREMELY friendly and courteous. I had the studio suite. It had a full size kitchen queen size bed, sofa couch with pull out bed, full enclosed bathroom, sink not outside of bathroom like some other hotels. Free wireless internet, but weak signal. You can program your telephone for wakeup calls. TV has alot of station, and I mean alot. My room was facing the open field and was quiet. AC is controlled by thermostat. Hotel is located very near, walking distance to a very big supermarket \"Shaw's\", Best Buy, Staples, Home Depot, Marshalls, Toys R Us, Bed Bath and Beyond, movie theatres, Longhorn restaurant, Chili's and much, much more. Very close to onramp to I89. There is a small swimming pool and gym room. I did not have time to utilize any of those facilities. Hotel is close to downtown Burlington and the airport. I had no problems with parking. Overall, I felt like I was home.

Go to the front desk to ask if they have a plunger and the desk clerk says cheerily: \"oh, didn't you see the plunger right there next to the toilet?\" I probably would have noticed a plunger propped up next to the fresh towels. Back to the room and I did, indeed, find the plunger under the sink. Still wet. Again, not a good sign. I commence plunging. Toilet seems to lack water. Won't flush or fill. As I'm laboring over the toilet, the phone rings and I run to the bedroom plunger in hand. As I stand there talking to her, with a dripping plunber, it occurs to me that this is not the way hotel service should be. She offers to give us the room for half price. \"Half-price!!??!!
