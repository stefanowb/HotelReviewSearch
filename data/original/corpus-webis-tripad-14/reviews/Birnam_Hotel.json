Only a Caledonian McBrayne ferry cooked breakfast was worse than this!!

The room we were checked into was tiny with an extremely creaky and noisy door, the bathroom had a toilet and a bath with a shower attached to the taps and no shower holder, therefore, having a shower meant you had to hold the shower head and there was also no shower curtain.

It was nothing short of disgusting, the floor obviously hadn't been washed in quite a while!
