In order to help with the safe deposit box he slid the front compartment off (like a child's toy) and removed the batteries and stood there as we entered our safe deposit code. Then to the toilet. He proceeded to bang the flush button of the toilet around for 5-10 minutes and came out to inform us that the problem had been fixed. The problem with the toilet persisted for the whole week. What followed were a series of visits to the reception desk, once more on the same day, another fruitless visit from technical services, during which we were given a lesson on how to flush the toilet. (Push the flush side and then stop the flow of water almost immediately by pressing the top of the button inwards). This method worked for a little while, but by the next morning the toilet was not working again! Another trip to reception. Another visit from technical services. At one point we had three members of technical services crowded around the toilet. However, all of these visits brought only temporary fixes to the problem. We made yet another visit to the man at reception, who could not believe that the problem was persisting. This time he came with technical services to ensure that the problem would be fixed. As he supervised they took the cistern apart and removed a white piece which they informed us was the problem and would be replaced. The problem seemed to be solved, however that night we were back to square one.

However, we arrived at 3 in the morning and wanted to get water but all stores were closed and therefore asked reception but it was so much more expensive than the supermarket we later found close to the hotel. My advice would be to buy your water elsewhere and store it in the mini fridge. There were a few minor issues especially at dinner (we had half board) where you had to pay for your drinks, which i found was inconvenient since it is so hot and we assumed we were paying for everything including food and drinks (drinks were free at breakfast but not dinner). it should have been complementary at the least. If we were to be picky we would have liked the food to be at least covered at the buffet as they provide an outdoor dining area which attracted flies most of the time. The beach is more pebbles than sand however unless you are picky the beach is very nice and close to the hotel with many restaurants and shops down the road. the staff are very sociable and friendly (most friendliest staff i have ever encountered) in particular this 'cowboy' guy who always had a smile and called us the best couple which was very nice to hear everyday and made sure we enjoyed our day and had everything we needed :) the maids always cleaned our room and this one maid in particular was always jolly and made the effort to fold our covers into heart and boat shapes which was a great touch to our room. the only problems with the room was that it was smaller than expected and we did not really have a balcony (which we felt was the only room that did not compared to the others) but its big enough for the smokers. also the bed had very little covers which was not even big enough to cover the whole bed therefore with the air-conditioner on you got a little bit chilly. there was a convenient free shuttle to Gumbet (nightlife area) which was great because we did not need to take a taxi. the hotel in general keep sure that their guests are happy and well and will help with anything you need as soon as they could. for example our safe was broken and was fixed within 10 minutes we informed reception. the entertainment at the hotel was different every night and was very enjoyable. to be honest after reading some negative comments about this hotel before hand we were not expecting much but then when we arrived it exceeded our expectations. we would definitely return and recommend this to anyone, especially couples. it was an amazing holiday for us.", "title": "pretty damn good holiday", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "anastasia s", "date": "July 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 133660319}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "While the hotel looked very nice on arrival with its huge chandelier in reception it did not take us long to find just how poor the place was.", "title": "VERY POOR", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "19Gramps48", "date": "July 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133644361}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "For a 200+ room hotel to have only 16 sun beds around the pool was very disappointing and yes if you were not up at 6am you never got a sunbed by the pool", "title": "One of our best holidays so far!!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Ruth Martha H", "date": "July 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 133422088}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We have recently returned from a fantastic holiday at the Ambrosia Hotel, Bitez.

Prior to our arrival, we contacted the hotel requesting a quiet room with a sea view and were reassured that all rooms in the Ambrosia were quiet rooms. We arrived at 4am to discover we had a very run down room with a tiny bed (not even a double) that had lots of springs sticking out - we didn't get any sleep even though we were shattered. The bathroom was extremely pokey and there was a dodgy tube sticking out of the toilet so we were unable to use it. The air conditioning didn't work properly and was really noisy. We were next to a road so the room was far from quiet even though we were told all rooms were quiet. There was also a stain on the bed sheet. My Partner went down to complain the next morning and they said they would fix all the problems but he said we would like to change rooms - they were able to accommodate this for us but only had a ground floor room available. This room was much bigger but we overlooked the pool so had people on sunbeds directly outside our room so had to keep the curtains closed at all times. It was also very noisy in the evenings due to hotel entertainment so, again, being told that all rooms were quiet rooms was very far from the truth. We had to set our alarm at 07:30 every morning if we were to have any chance of getting sunbeds. You don't expect to have to do this on holiday. Food in the hotel was average - we only eat there twice, and had to complain as we went up to get our dessers and came back to find they had cleared the drinks from our tables! We had to kick up a huge fuss before they brought us some replacements - not what you expect from an alleged 4* hotel. We had a 4am flight home and the latest we were able to check out was 5pm which we found very shocking - we had to hang around from 5pm until 12.45 am which was when we were being collected to go to the airport and they also charged us 20 Turkish Lira per hour that we had the room - not very accommodating at all. However, there are some positives, the hotel is in a great location (even though the bar is open to the public), the pool is lovely and there are plenty of nice restaurants (Black Cat is definitely worth a try).
