The rooms are basic but clean and absolutely fine, and the breakfast is a nice self-service buffet, with cereal, porridge, bagels, bread, coffee, etc. The only downsides as far as we are concerned is that there is no restaurant and no pool (though there is a small hot tub, placed rather oddly right beside the lobby/breakfast room). There's no coffee-making facilities in the rooms, but coffee is always available in the breakfast room. There's no restaurant on-site, and no room service, leaving you to go to the Esso garage across the road for sandwiches or to the Sandman for a very ordinary meal. You can use the microwave in the breakfast room to heat food though, which was useful when we were traveling with a baby. It might also be worth getting something like a microwave meal and eating that in the evening, as the local food is very ordinary, very expensive or both, and the few restaurants that are in Blue River are often closed out of high season.
