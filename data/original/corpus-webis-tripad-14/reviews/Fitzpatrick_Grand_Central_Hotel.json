I can not speak highly enough of the staff, they constantly went out their way to help and always said hello and asked how your day went when you came back in to the hotel. The irish guy provided myself and my fiancee a good laugh when he had some banter with us. The people complaining about the lift is just stupid, the longest you had to wait was 5 mins. I would definetly come back to the hotel, as it was so central and easy to get everywhere. The room was kept clean every day, the housekeeping staff were lovely and always spoke to you.

My bathroom had cracked tiles on the floor and dated bulb lights, like something you'd put in your suburban house in the 1980s. The shower was hot, but water pressure was fairly weak. The room itself was clean and the bed was comfortable, but furniture was, again, dated: basically, the sort of Holiday Inn-style, fake-ish, dark wood furniture you'd expect if you arrived at a hotel in the 1990s. It's clean, but scratched up. Same with the A/C unit in my room: dated, probably circa 1990s and quite a bit noisier -- and less efficient -- than a more modern HVAC unit. The pub downstairs is good enough, but beer prices are high ($8/pint), even by Manhattan standards. Staff were friendly and professional. Location is convenient to Grand Central (about a minute away) and its many subway lines, but otherwise in a dead canyon of office buildings. I know NYC well (so this wasn't a problem for me), but I wouldn't recommend first-time visitors stay at this hotel: the neighborhood lacks charm that can be found in other parts of the city. It is, perhaps, one of the dullest locations in the entire city. While spending the night at the hotel, a British Airways crew arrived, and that's what this hotel seems to do well: providing a comfortable (enough), dependable place to stay in an OK location for business travelers or tour groups.

The hotel feels charming upon entry, and our room on the 7th floor was comfortable and very quiet, even facing the street (GST cuts off traffic on 44th so that helps with traffic volume and noise). The bathroom had a decent counter for all your toiletries and wasn\u2019t miniature like some hotels. The hotel staff in the lobby (desk and door) was polite and helpful but HOUSEKEEPING STAFF WAS A DEFINITE PROBLEM. We had to ask every day for an additional towel which got really tiresome since it seems that if there are 3 or 4 used towels, they should just bring 3 or 4 fresh ones instead of 2. (If washing towels is a problem, how about asking guests to indicate they want clean towels and sheets everyday as hotels do in California and Hawaii where water is more scarce and we always use the same linens for multiple days?) On the third day, a particularly cold and blustery one, housekeeping left our window open and when we returned from the UN at lunchtime, it was already freezing in there. Most days we were out past dinnertime so I can\u2019t imagine how cold it would have been in our room if we had returned late as usual. The coup de grace with housekeeping, however, is that they removed items on two different days that were NOT placed in or were even near the trash cans. These were empty glass and plastic bottles, some of which we intended to keep using everyday as we toured the city (to carry water) or to bring home as a souvenir (from a local NY dairy). I have never stayed in any hotel anywhere at which the housekeeping staff took any item that was not actually in or immediately adjacent to the trash can. I was absolutely shocked that a bottle lying on top of my suitcase or near the TV or on the bathroom counter would be snatched. I suppose housekeeping thought they were being thorough and helpful, but obviously that was not the case. After the second incident, I had to ask the hotel manager to come up to our room and discuss the daily-occurring housekeeping problems. The manager on duty was suitably apologetic and professional. The next night, we came back to find a complimentary bottle of red wine but, as it was already 11 pm and we were leaving the next morning and only one of us could drink, we returned the bottle to the desk and they offered up instead a complimentary continental breakfast which we tried. We had eaten breakfast at the hotel\u2019s pub earlier in the week as we received a $50 coupon towards food and drink upon check-in. Our impression was that the food was mediocre given the price and Midtown location. There are plenty of relatively inexpensive, tasty and quick food choices on two different levels at Grand Central Terminal \u2013 go there for breakfast items or a fast dinner on the way to the theatre. Having a room fridge was great for breakfast items like fruit juice and yogurt and for dinner leftovers. One last observation: I could not access the online reservation system for the hotel\u2019s website via Firefox or Internet Explorer; I had to call to make a reservation, and that was frustrating as I wanted to check different dates. I would recommend Fitzpatrick\u2019s Grand Central because the rooms are comfortable, decent size, have the options I desired and it\u2019s a great location.
