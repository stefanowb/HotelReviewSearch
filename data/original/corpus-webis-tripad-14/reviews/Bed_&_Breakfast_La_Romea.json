The owners met us at the entrance to Lucca and helped us park our car and drove us to the B&B. There are several stairs to climb to reach the main door, which could be difficult for some. The Red Room was nice - although not as wonderful as I expected (given previous reviews here). We left the windows open for air during the day and were kept awake most nights by flies buzzing around. We also could have used additional pillows - there was not anyone around to ask, except in the morning (we were out during the daytime hours). We did not like the floor of the shower - we bring this up because it has been mentioned by many previous guests - and after walking all day, it was hard to find 2 stones of equal size to balance on and sooth our tired feet.
