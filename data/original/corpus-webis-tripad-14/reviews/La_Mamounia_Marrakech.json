My husband and I visited for cocktails as it was our wedding anniversary. After a wander around admiring the gardens and pool we settled in the Churchill Bar for our celebratory gin & tonic. Within minutes of it being served and the waitress kindly taking our photo, I began to feel hot & faint (I'd felt below par all day). The waitress led me out to the foyer and sat me down. Water was brought and other staff including the manager offered to fetch a doctor. I felt this was not necessary and after a cool towel began to feel much better. A taxi was organised and we headed back to our riad. If non guests are treated this well I can only imagine how fabulous it must be for those lucky enough to be staying!

It is truly a fabulous property! We spent 4 nights there and loved every minute of it! Its simply sumptuous. The pools, the gardens, the rooms and the staff are all wonderful. Worth every penny we spent. I opted out of one of our touring days to lounge by the pools, use the fitness rooms, & to enjoy a facial. It was all great.One night we had dinner in the French restaurant, and that was delicious too! A nice respite from all the traditoinal tagines we had already eaten, in Morocco.
