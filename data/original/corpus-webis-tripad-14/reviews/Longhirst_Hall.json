The grounds themselves are nice but once you get past the reception area the hotel rapidly deteriorates. Our bedroom was very basic, dated and in desperate need of decorating, to be honest I have stayed in much nicer 'budget' accommodation. Being British I didn't complain, mainly because I didn't want to spoil my birthday! Breakfast was equally disappointing, it was served 8-10am yet when we arrived at 9am there was very little food available in the continental section and staff had to be constantly asked by guests to stock up fruit juices, fruit bread etc. Whenever I have stayed in similar hotels there has always been a good selection of bread buns, croissants etc where as there was only bog standard sliced bread available here. Whilst the reception staff were very pleasant I felt that the restaurant staff ( at breakfast) seemed disinterested and obviously didn't want to be there.

The decor was tasteless and needed bringing forward to modern times! The corridors to our room was like being in a rat race! Up and down left and right!

We only managed one night and even that was a struggle. Where to start with Longhirst. Firstly I'll list the positives, The grounds. They were very pleasant to walk around and i'm sure in summer it would be lovely to be able to pop out of your room and watch the cricket taking place. However, that is where my positives end. The staff, although keen on reception, seemed out of there depth and were confused when a couple like ourselves would arrive without a voucher. This should of rang alarm bells as any establishment that is requiring copious amounts of vouchers clientele to fill its rooms is obviously struggling. Our friends had booked us here as a treat and had even included our dog which was nice. However although the hotel accepted dogs we were placed in a room which couldn't of been placed any further from a door to the outside. Negotiating the maze of corridors with a dog while weddings are taking place near by is not a great experience. Once in the room itself things didn't improve. The bathroom had mould all round the floor, bath and shower. The suite itself had obviously not been updated since the building was put together and looked very dated. The walls in the bedroom were all scuffed and grubby, generally the room looked unkempt. On trying to make a cup of tea we discovered one of the cups had dirt/mould inside. Needless to say we kept out periods of time in the room to a minimum. We hoped the food would make up for the room so were looking forward to dinner. The menu read ok apart from everything is a supplement. You want potatoes, that's \u00a32 please. You want vegetables, that's \u00a32 please. Also as guests staying for 2 nights we would of expected more than 2 choices of starter and main. It would seem what you don't have the first night you would have on the second or repeat your first night! Again every table when seated were there on a cheap voucher deal as the waitresses busied themselves explain what each table had included and not included. The food on arrival was average. Flavours were a little bland and things should as pate should be served just chilled not straight from the fridge where what little flavour it had was killed by the cold. My main course of Beef was cooked well but the gravy over reduced and salty and the mashed potato overworked and like wallpaper paste. Once back in the room we settle down to relax to be disturbed by drilling on a lower floor at 10pm?! Only a short burst but very strange. When settling down to sleep the pillows were dull and lifeless and only 1 each. We were then woken at 1am by a wedding party being particularly noisy when heading back to there rooms. Not the hotels fault but on top of everything else led to a very poor sleep. On waking up we decided to head to breakfast. Our favourite meal of a stay away from home. Not on this occasion. On being seated we were told there would be a 20 minute wait on any hot food as the kitchen was struggling to cope. On surveying the 10 tables in the restaurant we were a little confused as to why serving this few they would be backed up but said no problem and headed for the continental table to pass some time. This lacked any real produce. A few mini boxes of cereal, bread for toasting yourself, a bowl of prunes and a few dried croissants was all that greeted you. Sticking with fruit juice we returned to our table to eventually receive our full english. My wifes arrived incorrect so had to be returned for another 5 minute wait. Once we were both able to tuck in it again was very average. The quality of the produce seemed to be lacking and generally again lacked flavour. After this final straw we decided we'd had enough and couldnt go through another day/night of the mediocrity on offer. This could be a good hotel if some investment was made but it seems content on being average at best and catering purely to the function rooms in the main hall. I'm sure the wedding services are better but as a guest of any wedding I would rather travel to a travellodge elsewhere.", "title": "Peace with Style", "user": "Geordiescots", "date": "June 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 164225463}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "We didn't stay at the hotel but called in for Sunday lunch.
