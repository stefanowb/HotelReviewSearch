I stay there for 6 days and I will never ever go their again even if its free. They have hidden fees if you invite some of you friends in you room at night, even if they stay for a few hours, the room are disgusting with fresh paint smells and you cannot open the windows because of the airplane noise they have lock the windows. Every 1 minutes a plain comes and go and the location is in the middle of no where. To top it all off they over charge me for a night, the internet prices are unbelievable high. I just hate that place so much if I was rich , I pay them to close that place. So you might get a good rate if you stay their but trust me , it does not worth the money.", "user": "hashmat_s007", "date": "February 13, 2010", "id": 55911526}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Had to stay overnight in Dubai for business purpose so I stayed in Deira Sheraton.

The Club room was kinda average that my mum stayed in. Decent breakfast. Not too good location but cheap taxis. They did that annoying thing where if you prepay they hold the money and then make you pay on departure. So you pay twice untill the release first payment. Plus, the exchange rate in the hotel was terrible so it was more expensive than the price I booked it in the UK. This was using their own site so be careful. Expensive food and drink but, hey, it's a hotel. Prostitutes in the bars and wondering about so maybe not a good idea if you are religious etc. I didn't find it too alarming but they did make my aunty feel a bit uncomfortable giving her \"dirty looks\" when she went in alone before we met her.
