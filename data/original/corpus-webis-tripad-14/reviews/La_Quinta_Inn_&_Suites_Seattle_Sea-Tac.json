We were standing there with a sick six-year old in the middle of the night, listening to the receptionist's comments and not knowing whether we would have a place to sleep. The proper way to handle this would have been to re-assure us that a room is available and that any problems with our reservation could be sorted out the next day (I had a hard copy of the reservation with me and the receptionist saw that it was already paid in full and it was for the correct date and La Quinta location).", "title": "Mixed experience", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "andy_alberta", "date": "July 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8123584, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Fast wired internet, clean rooms.", "disliked": "\u2014 Check-in experience."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "I also want to note that our stay was otherwise fine, I liked the free wireless AND wired Internet connection (there are some security issues with wireless access in some hotels), the day staff were courteous and tried to resolve the issues as quickly as they could.

I am a budget traveler and usually stay at the Red Roof Inn or the Motel 6, so that gives you an idea of my expectations and standards. We splurged on a Monday night at the La Quinta because we needed internet access and the Red Roof was full. I'm so glad we got to spend the night in comparative luxury. The La Quinta was renovated about two years ago and everything is new and shiny, from the tile in the bathroom to the paint in the hallways. Either it was deserted or the walls are thick, because we didn't hear evidence of another guest the whole time in our room. We heard airplanes in the morning, which is to be expected since the hotel is right next to the airport, but they sounded much quieter than they do from the Red Roof or Motel 6. High-speed internet was furnished via in-room cable and worked great with no passwords or connection fees required. The room was ultra clean. There was a blow dryer, shampoo, and a coffee maker in the room, as well as a desk, but no fridge or microwave--those would have been the icing on the cake. The front desk staff was friendly and solicitous--they even called when we'd been in our room a few minutes to make sure everything was satisfactory. There was plenty of parking and this hotel really is right next to the airport, though a few blocks' drive from the airport entrance. One small problem is that the wheelchair/stroller entrance is only on the airport-facing side of the lobby, so if you need to enter on wheels (or wheel your luggage in) you have to drive around to that side of the hotel, and it's not obvious that this would be necessary from the parking lot.", "title": "Great value if you can get their weekend rate!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "rockychocbill", "date": "March 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7246764, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Rate and free continental breakfast.", "disliked": "\u2014 Elevators"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel is situated on the \"hotel strip\" just next to the airport, and there are several restaurants nearby.
