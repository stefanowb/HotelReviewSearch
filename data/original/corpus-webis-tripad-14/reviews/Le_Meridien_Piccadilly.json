We used Starwood points for a junior suite and paid extra for use of the club lounge. On the positive side, we found all the staff we dealt with were professional and helpful, the lounge staff were particularly a pleasure to deal with. The Club Lounge had an excellent array of beverages and food available throughout the day in additional to the Happy Hour in the evening. As the location is so central it was a perfect place for a quick pick-me-up in between shopping expeditions or sightseeing. The pool was large and deep enough to swim in as well as being mostly empty. I didn't use the exercise room but it also looked well-equipped and the staff in the pool/gym area again were also very nice to deal with. Our suite was equipped with tea and coffee making equipment which was most appreciated and, even better, had some shortbread snacks which were restocked daily. On the down-side the first impression of our room was of a very tired looking couch and chair which looked like they should have been replaced years ago. It's too bad because they gave the suite a very drab appearance and yet the bedroom was quite well-appointed and bed very comfortable. The bathroom was another negative. I'm guessing we were in an unrenovated room because the plumbing was definitely from another era. The shower was really touchy on temperature and went from scalding hot to very cold and unfortunately because it was situated in a very high tub not easy to escape from when the temperature went renegade. The toilet sometimes flushed and occasionally didn't which made life very exciting and the heated towel rack never did heat up despite the little tag that warned about its heat. I think I would still return to this hotel though, I would just make sure to request a renovated room. Just one more thing, I know this is a matter of taste, but I found the 24 hour soundscape in the elevator very annoying and discordant.", "title": "mostly positive", "user": "rdabca", "date": "May 25, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 109869046}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Location location location!...

Nothing about it particularly stands out for extra praise, but the staff are friendly, the bedding unusually comfortable, the housekeeping generally very good, and (for what it's worth) the elevators prompt, which is a plus in a rather large property. There's also a large swimming pool and an unusually spacious, up-to-date, and well-equipped gym in the basement. It's only unfortunate that a tasteful and at times even arty redecorating job can't mask all the quirks of this Edwardian building. Our room was microscopic--so small that its awkwardly tiny work desk was dwarfed by its own chair. More awkward still was the smallish bathroom perched two steps above the rest of the bedroom--an obvious hazard if you happen to forget, in the middle of the night, that there's a set of stairs *inside* your dark, unfamiliar hotel room. Surely, this particular model of bedroom served as a butler's pantry when the hotel opened early in the 20th century, and it ought to be turned back into one. But those quibbles aside, it's impossible not to enjoy this excellent location, steps from the great shopping in Regent Street, a few blocks from the heart of the theatre district, and conveniently reached by tube from just about everywhere in London.

We booked the hotel for 200 USD on Priceline.

Within an hour they had a room for us. At the price we paid, it would be hard to do better! We had a King Size bed, marble bath, table and chairs, desk, fax machine, internet access and plenty of windows! Every night, they set out terrycloth robes, slippers and chocolate along with a printed weather forcast for the next day. In the morning, they left the daily newspaper and replenished our tray of Coffee, tea, hot chocolate and shortbread biscuits. My 2 complaints were ... #1.food prices at the hotel were beyond belief, don't eat there. We found a small deli-like place around the corner and a Pret a Manger down the street both had resonable priced meals #2. they don't have satellite TV, so you're stuck with 13 choices. Overall, I would put it on par with a higher end Radisson or Sheraton, but the location bumps up the star rating ... and in London, location is important! We were just off Piccadilly Circus, close enough to benefit from the many restaurants but far enough away not to be bothered by noise. The tube station is virtually yards away. (Be wary of hotels that say tube stops are a short walk away ... a short walk to Londoners could be a 1/2 mile or more. Now that might not seem far to some of you, but after a full day of walking the last thing you need is another 1/2 mile!) Where location really counts is after 12midnight when the tube closes. If you're staying further out from the center of things, you'll have to take cabs after 12 and that can get expensive.
