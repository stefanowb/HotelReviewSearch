The lobby/reception area is being moved and entering the hotel and getting to the elevators involves literally walking through a construction site. Ceiling tiles were missing with electrical wires hanging down and several workers present making considerable noise. However, none of this could be heard from the room and was only encountered entering and leaving the hotel. No internet access unless you bring your own laptop, but the Marriott next door will let you use their business center at a reasonable price (the AM Parkring directed us to an internet cafe which was many blocks away).

Despite the fact that the hotel is in a prominent position on the Ring we had difficulty locating it because its ground floor does not front onto the road and signing is poor. Whilst the reception is on the ground floor, hotel rooms are on the top floors of a 13 story block, which makes for good views across the city. Our room was spacious and well furnished, with a very comfortable bed and easy chairs, and was kept spotlessly clean. Breakfasts were high quality and the restaurant also, though quite pricey. Staff on reception were very friendly and always able to provide helpful advice.
