We returned about an hour before we were told room would be ready and it was already available. The room was a nice size for France and the bathroom was quite large. The hotel does seem a bit dated but it really adds to the Alsacian homey charm. Breakfast was great, offering much variety of standard European breakfast: cereals, cheeses, breads, croissants/pastries/baguettes, scrambled and soft boiled eggs. There is a bar near the front desk that is always empty. Since there is nobody attending the bar you just ask the staff at front desk to prepare your drink. They were always happy to do so and served them with a snack mix. The pleasant walk to the square and surrounding areas is 10-15 minutes. The walk is lovely and would choose it over staying right in the hustle and bustle.
