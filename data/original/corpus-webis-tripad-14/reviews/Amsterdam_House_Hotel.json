The location, friendly staff, and comfortable accommodations exceded my expectations. The hotel is located in the heart of the city along the Amstel, and being an old canal house, staying there was an experience in itself. Almost every major tourist attraction along with numerous restaurants and shops were within easy walking distance. For those that were not, we simply walked a block to the Muntplein station and caught the tram. Being so close to everything really helped cut expenses and made it convenient to stop by the hotel throughout the day to drop off bags or grab something from the room. The staff was extremely warm and friendly, including Moreno the cat who roams freely throughout the hotel. We were offered coffee and pie in the reception area upon checkin, and were also given plenty of tourist materials, maps, and information pamplets. On several occasions, the receptionists helped us with directions and made personal recommendations of things to do and see while in the city. The room was beautifuly decorated and most importantly clean. House keeping was convenient and thorough. No early morning knock at the door! The view of the city and canal just outside our window was breathtaking. The breakfast offered each morning is definately a must. Offering a wide array of food choices, it was both convenient and delicious.

Hotel Eureka has that in abundance. the rooms have a fantastic view across the amstel, with upper floors having balconies. the windows open right out too which would be fantastic in summer. breakfast was good the two times we had it and all the staff where friendly.

I would suggest the brown colored boat (with the red door) opposite the hotel is the best, but all the boats are amazing and are centrally heated which is important in Amsterdam in the winter.

The staff (Will especially) were really helpful and friendly and could not do enough to make our stay as good as they could. The breakfast was ample and it was great to be able to cook our own omelettes on the hotplate!!!

We were not disapointed. Arriving mid-morning following an early start from home we were treated to a comlimentary coffee and slice of apple pie in the lounge (these personal touches mean a lot and this was typical of our stay). We had asked for a double room but there was only a twin available and although the receptionist offered to change us the following day we decided to keep it for our 3 night stay. The room was \"unusual\" being long and narrow with the single beds end to end rather than side by side. The decor was also a bit \"tired\" and the furniture is best described as inexpensive antique. However, it was clean with enough space, had lots of character and a lovely view over the Amstel River. We also had fresh flowers on the coffee table the day after our arrival. Although Breakfast was not included in the price, the first mornings was complimentary and was good enough for us to pay 10 Euros each for the following days.
