We stayed in London, Paris and Prague and this was the most expensive hotel and the worst quality of all of them. We arrived early and as was to be expected, our room wasn't ready. The staff were pleasant, took our luggage, although it was stored in the public area with no security. In fact, we went to our bags a couple without anyone questioning us. The staff told us to come back in 3 hours and our room would be ready. Which it was. When we got to our room, it was a twin, not the king we had booked and it was obviously a smokers room, something we had definitely not requested. Rang downstairs and asked to be moved to a room with a king bed. Staff were very confused and eventually we found someone who could help us. Despite our voucher stating all of this as well as an upgrade, we had to constantly point this out. Finally got upgraded further and received a king room. Room was very tired.. In fact the whole floor was tired. Bed was very hard and uncomfortable.The carpet in the rooms and hallways have massive stains. Carpet definitely needs to be replaced. Bathroom was nice. Found unfortunately, the person staying in the room next door smoked in their bathroom, so our bathroom stank of smoke. Buffet breakfast was ok, but a lot of the hot food was luke warm at best. If you can, avoid the 8-9 rush, as this is when the business people are there and there are no tables. Overall staff are nice. Very average hotel, but great location. There are several other hotels nearby, Swisshotel Stamford and Fairmont. Maybe they are of a better quality. Wouldn't recommend if there were other choices available. Biggest disappointment was no wifi (forget that it wasn't free as it was in every other hotel we stayed in).
