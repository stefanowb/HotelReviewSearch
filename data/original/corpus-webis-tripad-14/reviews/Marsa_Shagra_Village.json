Both did courses (junior open water and junior advanced open water) and both instructors (Berry and Mahmoud) were brilliant with them. All staff were unfailingly helpful and friendly, facilities were clean and efficient and food was really good (and so much of it!). If you're after night life and cocktails though, this is definitely not the place for it. Plenty of people have a beer after diving, but it doesn't seem to go much beyond that and people turn in quite early. I have to mention how lovely the dive and restaurant staff were with the children -it made their holiday (though I would say that children need to be old enough to be relatively independent and aware of risks of being around heavy and expensive equipment). It's still definitely a dive/snorkelling centre rather than a typical beach resort, but that's exactly what we like about it. House reefs are excellent and healthy, saw turtles,baby sharks, morays, nudibranchs, blennies.", "title": "Excellent stay!!!

Our eco-diving concept has been internationally recognized as a model of tourism development and our villages offer you the experience of what has become known as \u201cThe Eco-diving Adventure\u201d. All aspects of the RSDS experience promote nature-based tourism and maximum diving enjoyment. Our villages were created in consideration of diving enthusiasts and our diving program covers more than 60 shore-based and off-shore dive sites. We offer our guests a variety of diving possibilities including; unlimited diving on our house reef, shore dives, night dives, and boat dives to world-famous dive sites such as Elphinstone and the Fury Shoals. Our operation consists of 3 lodges; Marsa Shagra Village, Marsa Nakari Village and Wadi Lahami Village. Our team also manages Pioneer Divers - Marsa Alam. Our villages are small because we maintain a minimal-impact policy towards the environment. Our guests take advantage of an exclusive experience in a nature based atmosphere. Our villages are simple with traditional eastern style domed architecture and every guest room enjoys an unobstructed sea view. Each one of our villages has a maximum capacity which is based on the carrying capacity of the house reef. Visiting our villages is more than just your typical diving vacation. By the time your holiday is over, you will leave with a new appreciation for the serenity and simplicity of our nature based atmosphere. Explore ancient ruins of long gone civilizations and learn about the long history of the Red Sea region. Take a trek through the desert to observe amazing wildlife and the Bedouins of the south. Meditate under the mutating colors of the setting sun and then fall asleep star-gazing under a moonless night."}
