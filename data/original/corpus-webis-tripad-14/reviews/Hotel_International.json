It is an hour and half on bus and last bus around 9pm, and thomson evening trip cost around \u00a350 per person. it cost less than this for bus, b&b, dinner and we had more time to enjoy Rhodes town. Found this hotel on trip advisor. Very happy with our choice for a short stay. Clean and comfortable hotel in a good location in a quiet residential road. close to beach, harbour, new town bars and restaurants, and a short walk to the old town. Very helpful and friendly reception. Breakfast, better than suggested by other reviewers, can be taken on the small terrace.", "title": "B&b in Rhodes town cheaper than", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "eiluvtravel", "date": "October 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 182444676}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled solo", "text": "Visited in October.
