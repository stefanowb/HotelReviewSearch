The location could not have been better, as we were a short walk from Gerbeaud cafe, the Basilica, Parliament and the shops and restaurants and bars. Even the castle was a short meander to the Chain Bridge, a pleasant walk over the river and then a hop on the funicular railway. We would also recommend the hotel's Sunday champagne brunch. The only disappointment was that the hotel pool and spa were closed for renovation, so we had to go next door to the Kempinski hotel to use their facilities (free of charge) rather than wander along the hall.", "title": "Superb location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TBUK", "date": "August 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8493542}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Le Meridien has the perfect location right outside a metro station and close to V\u00e1ci utca (street) a main tourist street.

I came back several hours later to be shown to my extremely small room. It took 30 minutes for them to bring the luggage to my room, eventhough there were plenty of hotel staff standing around with nothing to do. The bedspread in the hotel was old and very outdated. I tried to take a nap but was continuously disturbed by some drilling and construction taking place in or near the hotel. When I went to breakfast the next morning, I was told that I had to pay for breakfast, eventhough I booked a package that included breakfast. The front desk manager then came to my table to announce that I did not have breakfast included. Finally after breakfast, I went to the desk to show him my confirmation. Eventhough the confirmation did show that breakfast was included, it still took a lot of effort to convince the front desk that I should not have to pay for breakfast. In the bathroom, there was one bar of soap and one small bottle of shower gel. Once those ran out, they were not replaced. I had to take one off the maid's cart myself in order to shower. Finally, I asked the hotel for a TAXI to the airport. Since the guide books warned that taxis often charged whatever they wanted, I asked what the fee would be. The concierge said 7000 HUF. Since I paid 4100 HUF to get to the hotel I asked why it was so much more. The concierge then said he could call me a city taxi and it would be cheaper. Note that the city taxi ended up costing us only 3000 HUF, so I was a bit annoyed that the hotel would organize a taxi for more than twice the price.
