It lacked a little compared to the really slick operations like the Holbeck Ghyll where the wine is topped up without you noticing and they know what you ordered without asking, but it didn't spoil things. We were awoken by staff playing the guitar at 2am which was odd but no huge deal.

Your views on the quality of a meal can often be influenced by individual choices and simple bad luck. Although the quality of produce and presentation were excellent, the preparation left something to be desired. The starter of foie gras was the smallest by some way that I have ever had. The main course was one of those which on reading the menu you think that the chef must be a genius or trying too hard. Unfortunately it was the latter and I could almost hear the judges on Master Chef commenting on too many flavours on the plate.
