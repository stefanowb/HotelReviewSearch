Great spot right on the beach and walk to local park. Staff very friendly. There were two downsides to what could be a great review. First we chose to pay extra and selected a room with a view because it looked out at the beach. Would have been fantastic if we could see through the thick dirt on the glass. It appeared that previous guests had tried to rub some of the dirt off to see through (should have been a hint to the cleaner). Secondly there was a long wait for checkout which upset a number of guests standing around in a long line. This process does not match the status of the hotel star rating and cost for service to stay there.", "title": "Fantastic location disappointment with the room cleanliness", "user": "Bec12Sydney", "date": "September 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 44014627}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a great stay here. The room was spacious and clean with a great, great view. The staff was accomodating and helpful. They made us toast in the middle of the night since we were still jet lagged even though it was not \"supposed\" to be available. Everything was clean and good. I thought this was a three star hotel and I think it is excellent as a three star although it is expensive compared to everything else in the area. We loved the staff and were very happy here. You are paying for the expansive views. I would not pay the rate without such a good view. They are not equipped for full service yet. We needed a toothbrush and they did not have anything. They sent us to a closed restaurant for dinner and they were short on knowledge of where to find flip flops or an internet cafe and little things like that. They charge $30 per day for the internet and even if you go to the \"business center\" it is about $10 for an hour, I think. But you are paying for the location and the friendly staff and we loved all that. The pool was lackluster and the fitness center is small but adequate. We were there at the start of Aussie winter so we didn't expect to use the pool but we did swim at the heated university pool and it was great.", "title": "Excellent Views, Great Location, Best Place in Wollongong", "user": "Newburyport_MASheila", "date": "June 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 33398063}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I spent a weekend in this establishment to celebrate our anniversary. The location is spectacular as the hotel is sited along the beach. The hotel presentation is very Novotel .ie. bland and boring. The hotel claims to have a 41/2 star rating but i don't think it gets anywhere to this standard. I think the hotel management is trying to cut corners and thereby the service is really therefore below standard. Fore example I asked for a convenience pack i.e. toothbrush etc which I had forgotten to bring. I was told they ran out and would have packs available only after I had left. I find that this is remarkable for a luxury resort. We then asked for some bath robes. Again they did not have enough in stock so we did not get any. Then there was a conversation about where to have a good anniversary dinner. We were stunned by the lack of knowledge of the \"concierge\". Remarkably we were told the Outback Steakhouse was a good place for an anniversary dinner when the town of Wollongong has some really great restaurants.", "title": "Does not meet up to expectations", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "BloodDr", "date": "May 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 30768092}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The rooms were bland and boring although spacious.
