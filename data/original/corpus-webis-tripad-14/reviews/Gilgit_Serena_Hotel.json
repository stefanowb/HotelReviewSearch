However the rooms are on the small side and the bathrooms although clean and attractively lined with the local green stone are v small and in need of some updating. However there's no shortage of hot water and ample towels. (there are some recently refurbished suites which looked great but are much more expensive - Rps12-15,000 compared with Rps 6000 for a standard double)", "title": "Like a Thredbo ski lodge", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Intrepidtoo", "date": "March 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6908807, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location and views", "disliked": "\u2014 The eratic electricity, small bathroom"}}], "location": {"country": "Pakistan", "region": "Gilgit-Baltistan", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Gilgit"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 7, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 12}, "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333}
