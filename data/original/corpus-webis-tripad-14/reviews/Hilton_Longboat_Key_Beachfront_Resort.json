While the staff is provided by a private company, it was interesting to note that Hilton employees were everpresent, clipboards in hand to follow up on the overall work effort.

The hotel is beautifully located on the beach about mid-key among other resort destinations and private residences. The footprint is small so unless other land is acquired, such as tennis courts or other amentities will not be available even after a renovation.

This is an extraordinary lodging, primarily because of the longevity of both the staff and the guests. The hotel was built in the early seventies and its age is showing, hence its planned closing on August 31st for renovation. The facility can certainly stand some renewing, it has a little osteoporosis. But the people who work here as employees or outside contractors are just simply remarkable. And the guests, many of whom we have met and talked with during each of our stays, are almost all repeat guests......many times for 30+ years....they just keep coming back to this same property.....from Europe, from all over the U.S....they all express an affection, even passion for this property and its staff which is just surreal. These visitors come for weeks at a time.....and they all express a feeling, which we have also felt after only two visits, of being at home with your own family. If anyone operating another hotel anywhere wants to personally observe what real service looks like, they should come and stay here before its too late. The facility needs renovating.....no doubt about it....to compete in today's world of hotel competition.......the facility can be renovated......but I and everyone I have spoken with at this Hilton Resort, guests and employees.....to a person....believe when this property closes for renovation, they'll be attending a funeral. The employees and guests don't love this place.....they are in love with this place. The facility can be replaced but the tradition and spirit of this place can never be replaced. It's the end of an era.....the hotel business has changed.....and \"progress\" causes eras to end. I'm sure what follows will be more attuned to its own era.....but it won't feel like this.
