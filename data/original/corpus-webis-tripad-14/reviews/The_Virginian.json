The best you can do is turn the knob to dial in channels 2-13. We went to the office to ask if there was a way to get the dozens of other channels and they acted like they didn't know we couldn't get all the channels and nobody else ever had a problem with it. Then it turns out they offer wireless internet, but said you have to go down to their \"Saloon\" building to pick it up. Not too handy for our teenagers who aren't old enough to go into a saloon anyway, but then it looked like they closed that building down early so having failed to get enough signal in the room we gave up. The restaurant had been closed for some unspecified reason which wasn't a big problem. A new pizza place opened right next door a week before which had SPECTACULAR gourmet pizza, and the young owner was REALLY friendly and helpful. Their New York quality menu was totally unexpected for the area. . The swimming pool was nice and warm when I dipped my foot in, but after diving in we all immediately noticed the water smelled and felt like the old back-yard above ground pools you had as a kid... which didn't have filters or chlorination... after about a week. There wasn't even a noticable trace smell of chlorine so we all felt dirty after we got in. The room was spacious and quaint inside. Not dirty, not spotless, just cabin-like. Furnishings were older, but I don't have any complaints other than it was a bit pricy for something with a 1970's TV and no internet. We had a little dog, so there weren't a lot of options in town. Gratefully they do take dogs. We had a kitchen too but didn't need or use it. It's a beautiful area, and not a bad place. Maybe the price tag and the fact that we didn't stay in one of the cabins caused me to expect something a step above an old-fashioned cabin.", "title": "to much $ for to little", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "wcfan24", "date": "May 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 7710429, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 pet friendly", "disliked": "\u2014 price of room, the fact they would leave a pee stainded broken down couch in a room that they charged so much for.

I liked the decor and ambiance very much. There was no coffeepot in the room (or microwave or frig. and the TV was extremely small). The restaurant was open late - that was good - but they charged $1.75 for a cup of coffee in the hotel, then another $1.75 for take-out, $7.00 between the 2 of us for 4 cups of coffee for guests who paid $100/room. If we had been on the top level, or had a private cabin, or the place had been empty - with a new mattress - our experience would have been far better.
