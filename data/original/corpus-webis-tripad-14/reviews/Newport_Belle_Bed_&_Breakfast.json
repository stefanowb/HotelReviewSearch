This riverboat bed and breakfast in the South Beach Marina in Newport, Oregon was absolutely charming. The decor of the main living and dining areas is darling. Our stateroom was quite spacious and had it's own bath. The bed was comfortable and it was very quiet as well. Our host and hostess, Michael Wilkinson and Nancy Sims, couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming. They provided wonderful treats in the late afternoon (homemade cookies, wine, beer, chips and salsa) that hit the spot. They were a great source of information on the local area as well, providing tips on places to eat or visit. It was great conversing with them. They also allowed my husband to commandeer the TV in order to watch the USC football game being broadcast! Both mornings we were treated to a wonderful homemade breakfast. Nancy really went out of her way to accomodate my husband's quirky eating habits which we greatly appreciated. There were a number of other couples staying there as well and it was fun getting to talk with them. All in all, we had a delightful time and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying at the Newport Belle to anyone open to a totally different bed and breakfast experience in a lovely setting and hosted by two charming people!", "title": "Great stay at the Newport Belle", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JimandGina", "date": "October 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5933433, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 atmosphere, friendliness"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "My wife and I spent one night at the Newport Belle earlier this week.

I wish I could say that we liked it more, but we just didn't. But first the positives. I had made a mistake in booking and had actually booked the wrong day, but Michael was very gracious in accomodating us on the day we arrived anyway. (In fact, HE was kind and charming throughout our stay.) Other positives = mini-fridge in the lobby with sodas and a basket of chips and the like out at night, also fruit and a carafe with a small amount of sherry, if we were so inclined. Negatives, now. The place just needs updating to start with. We stayed in the largest room, I believe, but it just seemed warn and sad. Plastic flowers everywhere. No real theme to the decor. Pictures on the wall without glass. I hate to say it, but it's just a little on the tacky side, which is not what we look for. The price we paid was comparable to the prices we paid at far, far nicer establishments in places like Portland and Astoria on this same trip. It just wasn't worth it. Also, you have to drive over the bridge to get to the little village of Newport. Not a problem getting there but if you want to go out in the evening -- and really, you do, AND if you'd like to enjoy some of the city's fine brew or some of Oregon's lovely wines, then be prepared to not only D & D, which is not our practice normally, but to D & D over a MONSTER of a bridge. So, here's the deal -- if you are really into the B & B scene and like to linger and chat with folks (one of whom reminded us so much of Harry Schearer doing a bit!), AND if you aren't really into nice ammenities in the bathroom (tiny, but we expected that given that we were staying on, you know, a boat), AND if decor isn't important to you -- say, if you have plastic flowers decorating YOUR house -- then, go for it.
