Roma! The Palladium Palace was our home base for five nights--we were glad we chose to stay here since it was very near the train station (we rolled our luggage there) but far enough away to allow us a sense of peace and quiet. We had rooms (2) on the first floor, which of course in Europe is the second floor. Ours did not have a view, it looked on to a courtyard but we thought that a plus since the street in front of the hotel is very busy. We had quiet for sleeping, and delicious air conditioning in this very hot summer of 2006. The hotel is in comfortable walking distance of the Coliseum, a walk which we made on several of our days, and then from there it is not hard to wander in the direction of the Forum and the Capitaline Hill. The rooms were decorated in stylish shades of ivory with deep red accents--the tile work was signed by Armani--I meant to ask if he designed the rooms' decor but did not remember to do that. Our room had a pulsating shower that was a hoot--really powerful and a bit startling. After I turned it on, I was laughing so hard my wife couldn\u2019t believe it. The staff at the desk were very helpful--and there as in every other locale in Rome everyone spoke English and seemed very glad to have Americans visiting their lovely city. The top floor breakfast room has views of the campanile and domes of Santa Maria Maggiore. You do want to visit it while you are there. Also, the staff recommended the green line hop on and off bus for getting our bearings and we did that the first day. Taxis in Rome are very reasonably priced, so if you go to the Vatican or some other far away location, do not fret, have the desk call you a cab and you will have an enjoyable ride through Rome's fabled traffic. If you are looking for a nice restaurant with good food at good prices, try walking directly away from the big Corinthian column with your back toward the front of Santa Maria Maggiore, on the left side of the street, almost to the park. There you will find some of the best food and one of the nicest waiters in all of Rome. We ate there three times and by the second night, we were treated like family. There are several self serve laundries near by, if you are on an extended trip. All in all it was just the right place for us.
