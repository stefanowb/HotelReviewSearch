The people at reception were extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions, and the lounge area and 2 internet stations were helpful - often you have to pay at hostels. We stayed in a TINY triple - barely room for beds and one bag. Not really worse than many places in Europe, but don't come expecting to hang out in your room. There is a fan in the room for the summer, which helps. The location is great - a good walk from the train station but you can take the subway if you don't want the exercise. The area is safe. The Ritz is a block away if you want an AWESOME breakfast :-)", "title": "Friendly people, small rooms", "user": "pepoling", "date": "January 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 6566758, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Price, free internet", "disliked": "\u2014 Tiny rooms"}}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Catalonia", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 5, "very good": 9, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 29}, "aka": "Sant Jordi Albergue Barcelona, Catalonia", "slim_ranking": 0.119476268412}
