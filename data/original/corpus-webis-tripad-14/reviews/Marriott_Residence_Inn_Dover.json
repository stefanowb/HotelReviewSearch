Check in was quick and easy and when we opened the door to our room - a suite with a king sized bed, we couldn't believe how nice the room was. The decor was very attractive and the room was quite spacious. The bed was comfortable and we were happy that we could swivel the flat screen tv to face the bed and away from the living room area where we had our baby's crib set up. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful - a make your own belgian waffle station and plenty of other hot food options. We also spent the morning in the indoor pool which was clean and warm and very enjoyable. My only complaint was a little bit of noise -you could very clearly hear someone cursing and yelling at someone else through the vent in our bathroom. Also, our room overlooked the courtyard area, and there were a bunch of kids out there until at least 11:00pm. They were just talking and laughing, but the sound really echoed.", "title": "Would definitely stay again", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jjax", "date": "June 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 16952358, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Attractive decor, great breakfast, comfortable large bed", "disliked": "\u2014 noise level"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Home away from Home, very nice", "text": "We booked online before leaving home, stayed in a king size suite, with plenty of room, flat queen LG Tv, probably about 42 inches.
