From what I understand an investment company came along and bought the property (along with their sister property, the Best Western in Waterville that used to be a Holiday Inn as well). They have done a pretty decent job renovating this place in the last year or so, changing out carpets, wallcoverings, light fixtures, mattresses, replacing the old tube TV's with 32\" LCD's, and so forth.

Located just off Interstate 95 (Exit 112), the hotel was formerly a Holiday Inn property and it is apparent that under its new title, the hotel has experienced some recent refurbishments. Unfortunately, these updates don't hide the hotel's age entirely; the outdoor pool area is in need of some attention to bring it away from the feeling of a 1980s hotel. The rooms are in very good shape and high marks can be rewarded for the upgrades to the bathrooms (bright, clean and new!). The bed provides a comfortable sleep with renewed linen (duvet) and a nice mattress (I might suggest new pillows). The room's temperature controls are accessible and easy to understand; the air-conditioning was wonderful! Rooms are equipped with a small fridge and microwave, as well as the usually amenities (hair dryer, iron & board). Overall cleanliness of the room and facilities was very good and the staff onsite (both front desk and housekeeping) were very, very pleasant. Further kudos on the upgrades to the fitness center and the business center. One thing that struck me as odd was the layout of the hotel; much of the guest traffic seems to go through a side entrance, far from the lobby and there is no elevator near the lobby itself. Located a few hundred yards from the Civic Center, the hotel is in close proximity to shopping such as Wal-mart, Old Navy and Kohls (addition shopping is located just a short drive south off Exit 113 - Target, Sears, Lowes. However, apart from shopping and the few attractions of being a State Capital (State Library, Archives and Museum), I don't find much of an attraction with Augusta itself. And the lack of an indoor pool facility certain makes the choice of returning during the winter months easier.
