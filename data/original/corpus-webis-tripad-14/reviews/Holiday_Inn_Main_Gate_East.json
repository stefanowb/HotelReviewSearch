The bed was super comfortable and the A/C worked great. The pool was well maintained and hardly ever busy. I would reccomend going to McDonalds right next door for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is good but it's $10 per person. The shuttles only run once a day and our driver wasn't particularly friendly. I would reccomend renting a car while staying. A taxi to Disney is about $27 for the whole car ride one way. The shuttle only runs at 8 am for Magic Kingdom and 10 am for Epcot. Parking is only $15 at the parks! Bring your own stroller if you can it's $15 a day at Disney. I have no complaints about the hotel. It was very warm in the hallways but there is no a/c in the hallways so it is to be expected in a warm place like Florida. There was a few scratches on the wall and stains on the floor but that is to be expected at a well stayed in hotel of this rating.
