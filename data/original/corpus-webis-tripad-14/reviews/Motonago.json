It is located right in the heart of Higashiyama (eastern Kyoto) next to Kodaji Temple. The food was great, tastefully decorated and delicious. The room was very clean, it had a bathroom in the room, but you can also take a bath in a shared wooden Japanese bathtub (women and men bath separately). We paid about 50,000 yen for three people, and we found it reasonable for the service and the experience.", "title": "Excellent choice", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "goshan", "date": "November 15, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4117708}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed one night at this hotel while we were in Kyoto and were very impressed. The standard of the rooms etc was excellent and the dinner was well worth trying (even if we had no idea what we were eating!). The traditional style of bathing is a unique experience but well worth trying and makes for a good story! The only downside is the japanese breakfast isn't very filling and there isn't all that much to do in the rooms unless you can understand Japanese tv.
