Everyone went out of their way to insure that our every need was met, from the tour of the island with Chiefy, to the baseball scores given by Art, the amazing wait staff at every meal, and to everyone in the office. This was the most difficult place to leave because we felt so much at home.

The restaurant at Ottley's was exceptional and I have never tasted anything that even compares to what Ottley's served.

We were absolutely astounded by this place. From the moment we arrived until the moment we departed for Nevis we felt like we had been accepted into a family and were well cared for. We stayed at Ottleys as part of a tri-centre holiday: St Kitts, Nevis and Barbados. It was our first visit to Ottleys and had arranged our own trip, not through a travel agent. We had not realised that we had to let them know when we would be arriving. We arrived via Barbados, (not the conventional way Antigua) and arrived late. The hotel had made sure that there was somebody there at the airport staying for us until we arrived. The welcome cocktail from Marcus was gorgeous. We stayed in a villa with a plunge pool, which we would highly recommend. The bar was re-stocked daily and the maid servicing and turn down service was the most discrete and professional. Our villa had a wonderful view over to the ocean and on a clear day you can see neighbouring islands. The hotel is situate at the foot of the volcano and is in extensive and very, very well cared for grounds, with a spa, a tennis court and a forest trail. Try the couples' massage at the spa - there is an amazing view overlooking the rainforest. Also, watch out for the monkeys. Watch out for King Arthur, one of the owners and listen to his tales. All meals and drinks were fabulous. The fluffiest pancakes ever are at Ottleys. Make sure you are there on a Sunday for Champagne Brunch. We hired a car for a week, but with hindsight, this was too long as we were expecting better beaches and a little bit more to see on the island. The St Kitts scenic railway was good.
