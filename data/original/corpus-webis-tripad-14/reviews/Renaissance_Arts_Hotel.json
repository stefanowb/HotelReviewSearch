At one point, I visited the Business Center on the ground floor to print a presentation text for the conference. The printer seemed to be having issues, so I stuck my head in the business office for assistance. A wonderfully sweet and helpful woman named Erica immediately interrupted her work and came to my rescue, and using my flash drive, she printed the presentation for me on the computer in her office, all in a matter of minutes. A true lifesaver! On the morning of my departure, the Airport Shuttle failed to arrive to pick me up, and the crew at the hotel\u2019s front desk immediately took on the responsibility of calling the Shuttle office repeatedly until they got a response, demanding that the Shuttle come back and pick me up, all so that I wouldn\u2019t have to pay extra for a taxi. They were fantastic and made a potentially stressful situation very easy. Also, Renee at the front desk, who checked me in, was very kind, greeting me by name with a smile every morning.
