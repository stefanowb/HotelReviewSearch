However, nearly 2 hours later, exhausted from our 12 hour travel day, our room still was not ready. From here we found the staff to be unfriendly and almost stuck up. The front desk proved to be incompetent on several occasions and our room was not always made up. The conceirge was very helpful and kind however. I was not impressed by the rooms either. For nearly $300 a night I was certainly underwhelmed. I have stayed at many hotels in Chicago, and have never paid as much per night as the Sheraton, but have always had a better experience!
