When we arrived to our room in the late afternoon we found that it was incredibly hot. This was due to it facing west and had thus been subjected to a long afternoon sun. There was a fan provided and with an open window for several hours and having placed the fan to blow air in to the room things were bearable after the sun had set. However, we still all walked around in our underwear only. Unfortunately we could not keep the window open during the night as there are several noisy machines on the same side, thus it was an option of disturbance by noise or warmth.", "title": "In desperate need of air conditioning", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Gnopps", "date": "July 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 115426593}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I commented the problem to the receptionist and suggested they close the blinds when cleaning the rooms, that way the sun wont heat the room as much.

Built around 1950 and the owners has renovated it to look as it did, with all the beutiful furnitures from well-know archictecturs. It is a real pleasure to walk around the hotel and see all the work that the owners have done. Therefor we were suprised to notice that the restaurant didn't make us feel happy - at all. Overcooked vegetables, to much salt, meat that tasted like a bit of paper. Same with the breakfast. They served scrambled eggs made of eggpowder instead of real eggs....", "title": "Lovely interior but the food was bad", "user": "StockholmFamilyO", "date": "August 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 18757146}], "location": {"country": "Sweden", "region": "Smaland and Blekinge", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 10, "very good": 15, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 6}, "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "The Design hotel Scandic V\u00e4rnamo is centrally located within walking distance to nature, shopping and activities.There are good opportunities for recreation, fishing and training - walking in Store Mosse national park or take a round of golf at V\u00e4rnamo Golf Club.
