The neighborhood is safe day and night, close to metro stops, and walking distance to much of the action in this great city (we love to walk). Upon my early arrival, exhausted from flights, I appreciated how the manager finagled rooms so that I could check in early and shower. Our room was in the back with a lovely balcony overlooking an expansive courtyard; very quiet as I'd requested. Not a huge room, but nice art deco style, both practical and pleasing. The bathroom was large with a wonderful shower. Free wifi as well as free computer use (which I didn't find at other hotels throughout Spain).", "title": "Very pleased with EuroPark Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Dragonfly2", "date": "April 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 128993358}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We didn't eat at the restaurant, but found it spacious and attractive with a bar open throughout the day.", "title": "all round good hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "John B", "date": "April 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 128980902}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012", "text": "Restaurant tip: Romero Restaurante, around the corner at Bailen 115, is excellent: beautiful food in an intimate setting, and reasonably priced.", "title": "Hotel close to the action", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "westmoor", "date": "April 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 128912070}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is modern and very clean.

I can't pick any fault with this hotel as the staff were very helpful with directions and tended to our needs without hesitation. The hotel was within walking distance of 2 metro stations and not far from the hustle and bustle of las ramblas. I would easily recommend this hotel to any of my friends/family should they visit this amazing city. The roof pool/lounge area is a quirky addition to a superb hotel, a spot of relaxing in the sun after a busy day sightseeing and shopping is a must. Not a lot of sun loungers but I'm not sure the hotel was busy enough so this wasn't a problem for us. This might become a problem in the summer months when the weather is better and the hotel fills up.

My room was ready for me when I arrived at 11:00 AM along with some chocolates and the friendliest staff I've ever experienced (and I travel quite a bit). Te rooms are extremely comfortable, great bed and bathroom and I was in a superior room with a balcony facing Arago on the 6th floor. Everyti e I needed directions for a restaurant or the best way to navigate the metro or a, 'How do I get here' question, I not only received easy directions with a smile but a map with a highlighted path drawn on it. I never got lost. When I purchased some French cheese at an artisans market in the Ramblas and came back to the EuroPark, the staff at the bar on the first floor gave me a knife, fork and napkin to make the snack easier to serve.From making dinner eservations to suggestions when to walk and take the metro, they were so helpful. the location of the hotel is incredible. 3 short blocks to Passieg de Gracia shopping, a 15 minute walk down Catalunya to Las Ramblas and walki g distance to Sagrada Famillia (Gaudi). There is an amazing supermarket and fruit and bread market on the next block on Arago and many restaurants and coffee places in the neighborhood. The Geronia metro stop is a block away and connects one stop up at Plassieg de Gracia which gives you a choice of most routes.
