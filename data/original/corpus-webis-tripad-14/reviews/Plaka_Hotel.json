We were not thrilled with the hotel in general, but the price is excellent (100 euros/night in high season) and the location is perfect - in the Plaka neighborhood, the best part of Athens, right near the Acropolis and lots of tavernas. There is a roof deck with a fabulous Acropolis view and lots of chairs and loveseats. We enjoyed the view, but did not spend much time up there because there were always a lot of people smoking. We also had a room with a nice Acropolis view out the window, but no balcony or anything. I don't think I paid more for a view, so it may have been a free upgrade. The breakfast was adequate but nothing extraordinary. There were the standard continental pastries as well as some Greek food, but nothing American like scrambled eggs. I stuck to the croissants, which were decent. My husband had a hard boiled egg that he swears was rotten (he spit it out and didn't get sick or anything). The rooms, other than the view, were pretty hostel-like. Ours was clean but very small and had two twin beds. The hotel gives you an hour if free wifi to use during your stay, but thereafter it is 2 euros for an hour or 8 euros for a day. Not unreasonable but not a great deal. My biggest complaint is with the staff, who were really kind of surly. They gave us recommendations and directions when we asked, but always seemed kind of cold and it was impossible to get a smile out of them. I expected the staff to be a bit more friendly and welcoming. They also did not do anything to recognize our honeymoon.

Your view probably depends on where your room is, and ours looked over a city street, but it was nice. The area it's in is fun, too.
