Breakfast offered everything you could imagine and the restaurant served food all day although most people ate out either in small restaurants in the vicinity or in Capri town which is an experience not to be missed, particularly in the evening when the day trippers have left.

I've never even noticed towels at a hotel before, and these were horrendous. If I'd been sunburned, it would've been unbearable to use them. Thin, dingy, and scratchy.
