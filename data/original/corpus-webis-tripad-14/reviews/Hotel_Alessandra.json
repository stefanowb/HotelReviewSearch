He was extremely funny and helpful, definitely made our stay so much more enjoyable. He had so many great restaurant suggestions and had our museum reservation # print outs ready for us. We reserved a regular room on the quiet side. Our room had a king bed (2 beds put together), comfy european standards. Bathroom had a small shower with an oversized pedestal sink. Because this is an older hotel, you will notice the few things that needed repair. Room was kept fairly clean. Extra blanket in the closet. We were able to see all of Florence in 2 days because the hotel was centrally located. Walked to the ponte Vecchio (5 minutes away), Pitti palace, Toured the Uffizi (reserve tix in advance, line was very long!), had dinner @ \"Nella\" - 1 block away from the hotel (go when it opens at 7pm or they will send you away and make you come back 45 minutes later) This restaurant was not only recommended by Monty, I think it is also in Rick Steve's guide book. Afterwards, we stopped by the famous \"cafe Rivoire\" to people watch/listen to music, and ordered dessert. We had the panna cotta, yuck! I think this place is over rated. Waitor was indifferent.
