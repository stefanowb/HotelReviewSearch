We arrived at the Gable View Inn and asked for a nonsmoking room, only to find the room reeked of smoke. We asked management about this, thinking that we had been given a nonsmoking room by mistake. The woman in charge assured us that it was in fact a nonsmoking room and gave us an electric air purifier and suggested we run this and open the window to try to get rid of the smell (I am seriously not exaggerating).", "title": "Gross, Don't Stay Here", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "katecolorado", "date": "May 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 29879485}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Lexington"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 1, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
