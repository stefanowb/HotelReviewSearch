Had this been a three star it would have been about right but no way is this 4.5 stars. The pillows were small and hard and the linens on the bed too short. I did not sleep well the entire stay.

We walked to several restaurants recommended by the concierge (or found on Tripadvisor) and to a nearby church, we used the nearby metro stations, and appreciated the friendly but upscale atmosphere of the Renaissance. Our room was an upgrade, thanks to Marriott status and we were able to take advantage of the club level lounge, again based on Marriott status. There was an excellent breakfast buffet each morning in the club lounge and snacks were set out in the evening. Our room was spotless. The parking is expensive but we didn't want to drive in the city when it's much more convenient to use public transportation or walk. The staff was very friendly and helpful to us.

Once you leave the lobby you feel as if the care and attention to the hotel stays there. The rooms were basic, and in need of some TLC. Yes it was big and clean but the finesse was just not there. The main down side for me was the bedding. They still used blankets which is a bit dated but the fitted sheet on the mattress did not fit it. To me this is a basic for any hotel and something I do not expect to see. The corners kept coming off and the sides rides up exposing the mattress.

The airlines broke the pull out handle on my suitcase and the maintenance staff was able to get it pulled out so we could roll it the rest of the trip. The executive lounge host is excellent, and lounge is very large and relaxing. Our first room had double beds. The room was large, very nice with a tub and on the executive floor, but I prefer a queen or king.

When I had to go to Washington at the last minute in early November, I found that most of the downtown hotels were booked up due to a big medical convention. I decided to take a chance on Priceline, and got the Mayflower at a great rate. When I arrived, I loved the block-long lobby, and all the care that has clearly gone into this hotel. Visiting the mezzanine over the lobby, I saw the history of the hotel in pictures and objects, and I just loved it. Clearly this hotel has been welcoming guests since 1925, and is still a very welcoming place to land. Even though I booked through Priceline, the hotel desk staff could not have been nicer, and I got a double room on the 9th floor. I had read the reviews here, so I was not sure what I would find - but here is the truth: I had all the hot water I wanted from the Kohler showerhead, I had great towels and Aveda toiletries (loved that!!!), I had 2 bathrobes, and extra blankets in the huge closet. I also had a big, HD flat screen TV, and a little fridge. I could print my boarding pass for free in the business center, get free water bottles at reception, and the checkout was impeccable - clearly the hotel puts on extra staff in the morning so that checkout goes fast for everyone. I really liked the hotel, and applaud the staff for being among the best I have ever encountered. A couple of things would make this 4.5 or 5 stars - like having a room safe to protect valuables, and replacing the pillows. The beds are comfortable, and very clean. But I have never seen little square pillows like these ones. There are a lot of them, but they are still too small. Having even one regular-sized pillow would have been great. But overall, loved the Mayflower, the gracious staff and the great facilities.

Ten years ago, this room would have been called a Junior Suite and would have had a sofa and perhaps two easy chairs. This time, it had only one not-too-comfortable easy chair with a mismatched ottoman. Also, the bed, though very comfortable, had a fairly thin covering and there was no extra blanket in the room.
