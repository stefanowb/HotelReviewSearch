The rooms are bazzar, thaough some people might like them. The beds are place diagonally across the small sized room, which would be ok except it causes a constriction making it difficult to walk past the bed to get around the room. The beds are narrow, so foe double occupancy you really have to be friends. The room decoration is a wierd combination of pink and green.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Dexter48507", "date": "June 8, 2004", "id": 2171575}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Bingen am Rhein"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 16, "average": 41, "very good": 53, "terrible": 16, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "Nh Bingen Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.4}
