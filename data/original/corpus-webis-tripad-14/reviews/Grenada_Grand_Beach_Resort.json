Our room was a beach view and we could hear the waves at night while we slept which we loved. The hotel was fairly empty so we felt as if we had the resort to ourselves most of the days. The breakfast was delicious although it was expensive but worth it since there are not too many other options nearby. We tried to eat at other places most nights since the food was expensive at the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the front desk. They are in the process of updating the rooms. Our room needed some updating, especially the bathroom. We had some challenges keeping the bathroom door closed but everything else worked. The shower curtain was flimsy and the tub looked like it needed to be bleached. The room was very clean and our bed was comfortable. We would stay there again because the access to the beach is perfect. I spent several morning jogging or walking along Grand Anse Beach. It really is one of the most beautiful beaches.

However, I would not necessarily recommend this resort for regular price.
