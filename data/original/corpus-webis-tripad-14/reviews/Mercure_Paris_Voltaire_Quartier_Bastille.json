It's 30 seconds from the tube and a 20 minute walk to Place de la Republique, taxi ride from Gare du Nord is 15 euros. The rooms look newly decorated and are very smart and clean, and have excellent blackout-lined curtaisn for a decent lie-in. The reception staff were very helpful and will store bags on your departure day for as long as needed. Breakfast cost 16 euros so we went out - there are loads of bars and restaurants with a minutes walk for better prices. There's also a 24 hour bar round the corner where we sat and had a couple of late-night cocktails.

On my first night I did not have a room available so they reaccomodated me into another hotel. Not very nice, unfortunately but was upgraded to the Superior room for the remainder of my stay. There are a couple of niggles, apparently the air conditioner stops working when one opens the window and then never worked again for the rest of my stay. The hotel did not replenish my free minibar and then charged me when I asked for a refill.
