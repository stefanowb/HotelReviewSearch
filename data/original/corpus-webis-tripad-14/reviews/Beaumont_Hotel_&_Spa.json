The hotel was acquired by new owners a year or two ago and they have continued the tradition of excellence that has been the standard at the Beaumont since it was restored 12-13 years ago. Ouray is a favorite destination and we don't consider any other accommodations. We do miss the full breakfast on the veranda, but we understand the difficulties in operating a full breakfast restaurant in a very seasonal location. The continental breakfast is good; we ate at the hotel three mornings and one morning took a short walk to one of the excellent local bistros. The hotel restaurant is excellent--Ouray has a few top-notch restaurants, but our meal at the Ore House at the hotel was the best we had on this trip. Service is friendly and efficient, beds are excellent and the hotel is kept spotless. It is very well maintained. It is very quiet; as a couple in our mid-60s we appreciated the policy of not allowing children in the hotel--it would not be a kid-friendly environment in any event. If we have an opportunity to bring our grandchildren to Ouray one of these days, we will just have to find another place to stay, Overall, this is one of my favorite hotels anywhere and we highly recommend it.", "title": "Excellent choice in Ouray", "user": "WTexTraveler", "date": "July 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 135060296}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I know, most people like to stay in a hotel with hot springs when in Ouray. But you pay the price: accommodations are often substandard and overpriced, we've tried them several times. This time, a chance encounter in the Visitor's center led us to the Beaumont, a hotel originally built at the height of the Gold Boom, in 1986. I've often admired its imposing architecture on Main St, but avoided staying there, having had my taste of old hotels in bad shape. The tourist office lady, a local, told me that the hotel was closed for 40 years: the owner in the early 60's had a fight with the city about parking space, and when she did not get it her way, she closed the hotel, boarded the windows with plywood and painted the whole thing pink! Plus, she stopped paying taxes. For the next 40 years, while unpaid taxes accumulated (a deterrent to any potential buyer), the property went from bad to worse, an eyesore right in the middle of Main St. Until a couple ran into it and liked it so much, they bought and renovated it. They got married in the hotel and are now living in what was once known as the \"Presidential Suite\", because Teddy Roosevelt stayed in it once upon a time.", "title": "Beautiful Beaumont in Ouray", "user": "Oliver S", "date": "July 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133686047}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Beaumont now features all its ancient beauty, with multitude of Victorian details and restored original furniture, as well as all modern comforts, including a spa.

It had a great bar and the continental breakfast offered fresh fruit and eggs and yogurt and pastries. The well stocked bar was also very pleasant to look at. We made one mistake: we ate across the street, in the Outlaw, an old hangout of ours, which has gone substantially down since we last saw it.

Since we first saw the hotel, back when it was boarded up and pink, we have wanted to stay there. There is nothing bad about the hotel, but there were random things that just kept the stay from being worth the price we paid. Some mornings room service made the bed, others they just pulled the spread up, white pillows left on top of the spread. One day, they didn't leave coffee for the coffee maker in the room. Another morning there was not coffee in the third floor lobby. The bathrooms do not seem to be well equipped (we were in one of the two most expensive suites), there is no real counter space, there were no extra towels, you had two rather small towels each day which seemed inadequate and hardly what I would expect in what is billed as a luxury hotel.

The hotel looks great and beautiful! After reading the positive reviews we were curious. Everything looks great and the staff acts very friendly.

For example wipe your feet, don't use the stairs with your suitcase, do not lie on the bed with the drapes on it, don't open the window, and so on. I really understand this. It is a beautiful hotel and you must take care of it and use it very carefully. This is not my critic, but the manner how they tell you all this is not pleasant! You feel like a schoolboy; don't do this and don't do that. Of course I will be careful in a hotel or any other place. Second point of critic is the breakfast. They warn you not to expect anything of it, but this was nothing; the coffee was cold, there was not enough and nobody of the staff was really in charge or felt responsible. If you don't want to spend any attention to it, why should you present the breakfast at all?! The checking out was a bit the same. No eye contact and no real interest in me as a paying client.
