When I checked out their website I was sure this was going to be a really nice resort with all the great things going for it. Upon arrival we realized it wasn't really that. The staff is very average, the rooms as well. If you are paying an average of $500 per night you really should be getting better than average. The food in the lounge is horrific, don't order the paninis, the worst food i ever had for sure. The restaurant has an amazing view, however the food is nothing to write home about.

Our room was in the original building with a fantastic view of the beach and the ocean, the balcony completely private and though by no means large was big enough to sit out and relax with an eagle tree right in front of us. The bathroom was large with a seperate shower, large tub overlooking the ocean and Aveda toileteries. A note about the bed, it is one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. You can leave the door to the balcony open all night listening to the sound of the ocean as you fall asleep. it does not get much better than that.

She then parked our car, which we could call for at a moments notice. We were in the main building on the 2nd floor facing the ocean, rocky shore and beach with an eagle's nest in a tree above our room. An outstanding view - similar to that of the restaurant. We loved the Aveda spa supplies and had mineral salts in our double soaker tub overlooking the ocean every evening. I loved the decor - very natural and high quality. No, there were no white table clothes in the dining room, which offended some other reviewers here, there were hand-woven runners, hand-carved woodwork and candle holders made from sea rocks by local artisans. Decor that matched perfectly with the rain forest on the ocean setting and my husband's refusal to wear a tie on vacation. The chef's tasting menu was delicious and all of the serving staff were very good and informative. All service was professional and then they all took the time to say good morning or to engage in conversation and give advice about other restaurants and things to see and do. The free guided walk through the rain forest and on the beach was great, so were the bikes. The spa was exceptional! Foot soaks on the patio for both of us as we chatted with our therapists before our main treatments. I highly recommend the Sacred Sea thallasotherapy.
