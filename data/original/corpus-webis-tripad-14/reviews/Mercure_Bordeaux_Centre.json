It was clean as was the bathroom. The hotel is situated near the Meriadeck Shopping Mall, which is accessible by the Metro lines. Its area is like a financial district - a bit dreary. There are no good places to eat around the hotel. This is a big downside. The hotel's restauraunt had a small menu, with very little to chose from.", "title": "OK Hotel.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "capturedplanet", "date": "August 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3761549}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Aquitaine", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 31, "average": 83, "very good": 138, "terrible": 14, "excellent": 34}, "aka": "Mercure Bordeaux Centre Hotel Bordeaux", "slim_ranking": 0.308571428571, "description": "The Mercure Bordeaux Centre hotel is located in the central business district of Bordeaux, a short walk from the city monuments and historic areas classed as UNESCO World Heritage sites.
