(Even after waking them up at 1.45am because I had forgotten to take my front door key, I was still greeted with a smile) It is situated a little way from the centre and on rising ground but benefits from being quiet and secluded after the bustle of the day.

Balconies at front face down the valley, whereas hotel backs onto woods at rear. Family owned and run and always made feel comfortable. Very friendly to all guests. Food was good to very good, albeit often simple compared to \"sun and sea\" package destinations. Guests are treated over dinner on one evening to their family musical entertainment night, which is most enjoyable. Room was adequate in size and traditionally furnished, with good bathroom. The standard of cleanliness throughout was very good , despite their being many objects of interest in the corridors which could easily attract dust. Hotel has many regular clients who prefer a quiet location with such an amiable local family. However, for my wife and I , there was one great disadvantage and that was the 15 minutes walking distance up from centre of village. Hotel is situated in perfect spot for accessing the Rosshute funicular railway, but the arduous incline on return for dinner denied our returning to the village again in evening. On the morning it is an easy stroll down to the bus and train stations, the scenic lake and a super large village. Seefeld is a really great resort, with many hotels, but the Krinserhof offers more competive rates being out from the village centre. Would I recommend this hotel ? Well yes, certainly, as we much enjoyed our stay but on visiting Seefeld again we would probably seek to stay at an hotel which encouraged us to enjoy an hour of the evening festivities which all Austrian resorts have during the summer months.", "title": "Excellent Old Fashioned Tirolean Pension.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Haggos", "date": "June 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 114290329}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We booked this as a late deal wanting to return to Seefeld.
