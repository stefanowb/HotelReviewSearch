Sirmione is quiet at night however but bustling during the day. The Hotel Sirmione is in a lovely location and has a great breakfast service and helpful staff for arranging trips away. Nice pool and sunbathing but can be busy. One thing, the pool smells of sulphur as it is a sulphur pool - so a bit of an eggy smell. This I did not mind BUT I foolishly went in the pool with my jewellry on -silver bracelet and engagement ring and they turned black instantly. I could not get this off and had to have them professionally cleaned at home. I did not see any specific signs and was a bit annoyed although there may have been signs but I missed them or they may have been in Italian.", "title": "Brilliant Lacation", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Snedders", "date": "October 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5961321, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 smelly pool"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "Great hotel and great location and would definitley stay there again.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Bredin", "date": "September 19, 2006", "id": 5816693}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Staff very friendly except for reservations where they could have shown a little more interest in my questions.

Near the castle and small harbour the rooms, pool and garden overlook Lake Garda. The staff were all very polite and spoke excellent English. We stayed there for a week for our wedding in the quaint hilly village of Malcesine. Upon arrival we had a bottle of champagne waiting in the junior suite we had booked. The castle in Malcesine (where we married) has a stunning view of the lake and is well worth the ferry ride from Sirmione. The town itself is busy, but still has plenty of charm and gelati. There is a large gap in quality between Hotel Sirmione and the 5* Villa Cortine Palace, but also a large gap in price. So if money is not an issue I would go for the Villa Cortine. A must if you stay in Sirmione is the Ristorante Signori, with its unbelievably generous manager/owner Sergio. Altough you'll find cheaper places to eat, you won't find better quality food. The view, service, and food make this one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.", "title": "Lovely hotel", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "GG", "date": "June 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5357483}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "We have just returned from a weeks' stay in this lovely hotel. It was our first time in Lake Garda and we did refer to Trip Advisor before booking it. Firstly the location, in the centre of the \"old town\" was ideal - in the middle of the bustling (mostly pedestrianised) town, just opposite the castle (which looks stunning when the sun is setting). So easy to walk into the town to wander around the shops. Secondly the staff were top class - very professional and genuinely friendly especially in the restaruant.
