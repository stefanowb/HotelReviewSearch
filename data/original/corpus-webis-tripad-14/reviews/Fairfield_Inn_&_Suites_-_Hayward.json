The staff was very friendly and helpful. We only heard our neighbor's television slightly, and the hallway noise was blocked by the heavy door. The fridge and microwave were a nice addition. We booked at the AAA rate, which was $75 a night...more than a good price. Oh, and it IS in the middle of an industrial area. It was a quiet and safe area, with mainly concrete office buildings.

Breakfast was much better than the normal free breakfasts, with hot choices, fruit, yogurt, etc. I requested and was given a room away from the freeway, so noise was not an issue.

The lodging place is located directly next to the San Mateo bridge motorway. I mean directly next to the motorway - you could see the whites of the motorists' eyes. The lodging had a reception desk, two elevators and lodging rooms: no restaurant, no bar, no coffee shop, no vending machines, no room service, no newsstand, no bus stop and no taxi rank. There was no restaurant (fast food or otherwise) within walking distance, no mall nor strip mall nor drug store within walking distance either. The nearest BART station was five miles away, which required phoning ahead for a taxi. However, there was an ever-changing rota of gormless \"we could not care less\" young front desk staff who would benefit from immediate etiquette and hotel management training courses. There was a fridge, microwave and coffee maker in our room. Sometimes, when we had the coffee maker, the heater/fan ventilation and the shower on at the same time we could drown out the sound of the motorway. Alcatraz would probably have offered a better standard of accommodation.

Given that we had 8 in our family party and that we wanted a girls room and boys room (3 girls, 5 boys), I requested a roll-a-way for the boys room. We were told when we arrived that roll-a-ways were not permitted because of the size of the rooms. I protested and said that someone representing their hotel had already promised a roll-a-way, but I was denied. Consequenty, we had to purchase another room. We initially did not mind because the cost per night (with our AAA discount) was significantly less than anything in SF. They put our rooms in the same area in consideration of the age of our family.
