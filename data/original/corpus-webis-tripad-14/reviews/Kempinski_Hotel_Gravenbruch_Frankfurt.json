The hotel is a low rise and very big. I believe they just had a rennovation but I can see old things in the room like bathroom floor & wall tiles, furnitures. The shower faucet is terrible. Hot water comes and goes. I decided to check out and ask for a refund but they won't give any so finally they had to give me a new room.", "title": "Old, but not classical old", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ryota", "date": "January 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 6698913, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 too far from the city center and too old"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Anyway, It looks old but no senses of antique.

Tourists like us can possibly go nowhere. Though they have shuttle van to the airport but not convenience at all. The GSA staffs are OK but the concierge guy has attitude.
