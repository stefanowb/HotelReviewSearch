We wanted to do Disney on a budget and have a great time. I can not say enough about the Blue Heron and the people who work there. We were able to cook our meals, pack our lunches etc. This alone saved us a lot of money. Our condo type place was clean with a lot of space for all 5 of us. There were 2 really nice balconies to sit on too. I think people need to know it's not a hotel environment. The idea is you take care of yourself while you are there. The BH people provide services but they are not a hotel. If you go to the front desk they will give you whatever supplies you need. If you are looking for personal services go to a hotel and pay for it.
