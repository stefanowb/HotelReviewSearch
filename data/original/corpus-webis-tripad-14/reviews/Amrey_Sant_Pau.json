We loved the Amrey Sant Pau in Barcelona. We had to book two rooms because we were 4 people but it was a great value. AAA found the hotel for us. The staff were exceptional. They speak English and were able to help us in many ways. They are very professional. We loved the location near the beautiful Sant Pau hospital. The hospital is actually quite lovely. The hotel is a bit off the beaten path of Las Ramblas. However, we were able to walk to most places. The hotel is about 5 blocks from the Sagrada Familia. The breakfast is also excellent. Lots of choices with fresh fruit. They have one computer in the lobby that is free internet as well. We came from the train station and were shocked that we were charged one extra euro for each person and one euro more per bag. There was also an additional charge for coming or going from the Sants train station.", "title": "exceptional staff", "user": "wunderful", "date": "August 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 18865926, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the staff and the breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 It is a bit far from the center of town (action)"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I spent 9 days in the Amrey Sant Pau and can highly recommend it.", "title": "Excellent Hotel - Modern, Clean and very helpful Staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ScottthedotLondon", "date": "July 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 18453451, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly Helpful Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Quite basic rooms"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel is modern and very clean with quite basic rooms.
