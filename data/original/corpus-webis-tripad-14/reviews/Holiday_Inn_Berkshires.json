The hotel is right in downtown and we could easily walk to a number of terrific restaurants. It also has a sizeable fitness room with a pool, jacuzzi and even a steam room. The staff was very friendly and helpful in directing us to where we wanted to go providing us maps and lists of local restaurants. MA MoCA was right around the corner and we were just a short drive from Williamstown for the Clark Art. We got more than our money's worth with this trip.

The hotel lobby was small, but neat and clean. The rooms were very spacious and clean as well. The beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were very large and clean. There was a nice pool and hot tub in the basement that we used a lot. There was also a large and modern fitness center, but we did not use it. The hotel is a one minute walk to bunch of places to eat like Burger King and Subway. We did not eat at the restaurant hotel. We found the staff to be courteous. There are not a whole lot of parking spaces and some spaces are reserved for businesses in the hotel. We parked in them anyway. We would definitely stay here again.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "marc1976", "date": "November 11, 2003", "id": 1482293}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Bait and Switch at the front desk", "text": "Standard Holiday Inn.

It is a short drive to the college and extremely convenient for Mass MoCa. Some areas of the hotel are a bit shabby but our particular rooms, on the second floor, had fresh carpeting and new appointments generally, including excellent king size beds. The heating/cooling system was not perfect and we had to adjust it from time to time. Showers were average, with some adjustments necessary to get the right water temperature. Soudproofing is good and traffic noise was not a problem. We received a friendly welcome at check-in and were given $20.00 per room per day in breakfast coupons that we didn't realize were included in our reasonable room rate. We chose the Holiday Inn over some more charming properties in the area because of cost and availability of wireless internet.
