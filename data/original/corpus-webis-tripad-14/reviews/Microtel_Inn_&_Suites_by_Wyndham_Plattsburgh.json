Do yourself a favor and drive the extra hour into Montreal or convince your child that a different SUNY school would be a better choice. Despite a reservation guarantee, my room type was not available when I arrived in the late afternoon for check-in. Though I was given a non-smoking room as I requested, it was on a mixed smoking / non-smoking floor and the non-smoking policy was not enforced in the non-smoking rooms around mine. I requested a transfer as adjacent rooms were loud and smoke-filled (despite the alleged \"smoke-free environment\").
