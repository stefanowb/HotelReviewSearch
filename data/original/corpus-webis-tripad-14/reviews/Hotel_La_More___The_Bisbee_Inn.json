We stayed at Hotel Lamore and did'nt manage to sleep the whole time we were there due to no curtains at the window (nets only) no blind, nothing! There was also a window at the top of the door which let in light from the upper hallway ceiling light fitting which was kept on all the time. Our room had lots of natural light in the day time being right at the front but the rooms at the back had no natural light at all and were really dark in there. We had a nice room overlooking Brewery Gulch which was a mistake as we were to find out at 3am when all the bars empted out. A terrible arguement started up outside with loads of swearing and fighting plus the threat that if this person saw this other person round town he would shoot him! That was probably why there was a small notice on the door saying ring 911 if any disturbances are heard! Breakfast was ok, very much a do it yourself thing with juice milk etc kept in a big fridge in the kitchen. The staff only seemed to be there certain times so if you had a query it would be hard to find someone. Not the sort of place we would go back to or recommend.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Wonderar", "date": "September 14, 2006", "id": 5801002}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006", "text": "If you want to listen to loud live band music until 1:30 in the morning - this is the place for you.
