We had a family room with kitchen, enabling us to make our own breakfast. The location in Springdale couldn\u2019t be much better, and if you are just looking for a place to sleep after a day of hiking in the (absolutely spectacular) park, then this is a decent option. If you are looking for any hint of luxury or style, you should go elsewhere. All in all the rooms need some serious updating. The decor was very dated resulting in unappealing aesthetics (flowery bedspreads, dark green carpets...you get the picture). More seriously, the bath did not drain properly, leaving a 6-inch standing pool of water after every shower. The staff were very friendly, though a sign in the kitchen reading in capital letters \u201cdo not leave dirty dishes\u201d without so much as a please and thank you rather detracted from this (and I would have thought that cleaning dishes should be part of the housekeeping staff\u2019s normal responsibilities).

Four things I didn't like about it: 1 - the cleaning staff never cleaned the toilet which leaves me to 2 - the toilet didn't flush without forcing the handle down and holding it. 3 - The door, when closed and locked had about 1/4\" gap along the side near the bottom and 4 - the cleaning staff had the audacity to leave a tip envelope the day before we left.
