Also, we wanted sushi at night, and they brought that to our room as well. The drink service is wonderful too. The premium alcohol is a treat (compared to most resorts), but you have to ask for it.

I love food, and I\u2019ll eat pretty much anything. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we had some amazing meals. But I was disappointed in how rich everything was. My husband and I stayed at the Royale in January, and I did backflips over the food. But I think that has to do with the size of the resorts (the Royale is much larger, so there are more options). I just would have liked to see some lighter things on the menu, like more salad. After 5 days, we were ready to go back home and eat healthy (and we were craving Subway). We ate at the Japanese restaurant the first night, and we loved that. The sushi was good (even the 18 year-old liked it, and normally he is not a sushi fan), my veggie/tofu dish was mighty tasty, we got hot sake, etc. I haven\u2019t heard rave reviews about the Japanese restaurant on here, but that was my favorite. We did the Italian dinner at Sabores (with the soprano singer) the second night, the Italian restaurant the third night, and the Mexican dinner (with the mariachi band) at Sabores the last night. The menu for the Italian and Mexican dinners at Sabores was different than we were expecting, but maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019re used to Americanized Italian and Mexican food. We liked the Italian food at the regular Italian restaurant a bit better. The service at all of the restaurants was absolutely extraordinary. We tipped a dollar for each round of drinks at the bar and about $2-4 at each meal.", "title": "Our own slice of paradise!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "happyc0uple20", "date": "June 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 68962099}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Don't know where to begin describing this amazing place...........", "title": "Living the Luxury at the Maroma", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "GLC", "date": "June 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 68844778}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We arrived early in the morning , gave us champagne and wet towels, then they gave us a tour of the property (which is small) and said they'd have our rooms ready in about 30 minutes, which they did.
