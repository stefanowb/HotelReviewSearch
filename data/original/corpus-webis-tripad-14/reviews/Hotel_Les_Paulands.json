The duplex suite was horrible. We had the suite (two bedrooms) and now I know why there are no photos of the suite on the website. It was frankly depressing. It looked like some well meaning but rather useless do-it-yourselfer had tried to bring parts of it up-to-date but had failed badly. It had a bedroom and bathroom (no toilet) downstairs and a bedroom and toilet upstairs. The upstairs bedroom had an odd seating area with a televison set up on a platform that you had to climb a ladder to get to. The toilet was horrible. The bathroom was the only room that had been refurbished and on the whole it was fine except the flooring was made up of loose wooden decking style tiles which flipped dangerously when you stepped on the edge of one and the ceiling and walls were damp and badly damaged in some areas.

The location is great, as it is right at the border of Cote de Nuits and Cote de Beaune. However, after reading the reviews, I was a bit apprehensive. Perhaps because my expectations were already low, my experience ended up being a nice one after all. The hotel's management has clearly heeded the advice and made improvements. The windows in my room had double sheets of glass and it wasn't as noisy as people had complained. The pool was also nice and the kids enjoyed it. Still, there was one problem: it seems understaffed as there seemed to be only person who managed the front desk and also worked at the restaurant before doubling up as the person manning the vineyeard's cave. Be also forewarned: the rooms are not air conditioned (a common theme at many Fench hotels of its ilk), though the blade less fan in our room mostly made up for it.", "title": "Terribly disappointing\u2026", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Switz_traveler", "date": "November 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 120006785}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent 2 nights here with another couple.
