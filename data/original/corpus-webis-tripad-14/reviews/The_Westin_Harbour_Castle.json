We had a very comfortable stay at the Westin Harbour Castle for 5 nights. We got a good rate of $75 US from Hotwire. The room was large, clean, wonderful bed and linens. The bathroom was large with great towels. We were on the penthouse floor in the south tower with a good view of Lake Ontario. I noticed that on lower floors it looked like the carpeting and doors had been replaced and updated. The furniture and carpets were a little tired but not enough to affect our stay. We had a coffee maker and were furnished with Starbucks coffee. Our only criticism is that we came back to the room about 2 p.m on our last day and the room still had not been made up. Soon after we returned housekeeping called to ask when they could clean. They came immediately and we sat in the lobby. We found the location excellent. It was an easy walk to Union Station, the St. Lawrence Market and other downtown sites and good restaurants. We are good walkers and walked almost all over for 5 days. The trolley came to within a block of the hotel before going underground to return to Union Station. The lobby is spacious and very attractive, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.

I asked for double beds in each room. We received a king sized bed in each room. We had it switched with no problem, but it was just very time consuming and annoying. Upon arriving at the hotel I was called a \"liar\" by one of the valet attendants. He asked me how I was doing as I was taking the luggage out of my trunk, and I said fine. As I went to grab a cart for our luggage, he GRABBED me by my arm and told me not to touch the cart without asking. We then got into a verbal confrontation. Nice way to start a vacation. Very unprofessional. Once we arrived in our rooms, we found them clean, but very small. The beds were small but comfortable. The most impressive part of this hotel is the lobby. Valet parking was a little pricy, 30 dollars, and I paid cash for 2 vehicles. Good thing I kept the receipt, because upon checking out, the woman in charge of the valet told me that I hadn't paid. So this is when verbal confrontation number two happened. After producing my receipt, she just looked at me and then said, \"well we have no record of it, but I guess you did pay if that's what this says\". What kind of comment is this? Does she think I made a counterfeit receipt on Westin stationary? Unbelievable. How is it acceptable for ANY hotel to have their employees talk to customers this way. At Westin's in the past, I have had nothing but excellent service. This is definitely not what to expect at the Westin Harbour Castle. I would highly recommend staying at one of the DOZENS of hotels in close proximity with better rooms, service and amenities. I will not be staying at the Westin Harbour Castle in the future. Ever.

I was told basic information and only found out what happened the next day in the news. Regardless, the point of the story is that the hotel NEVER told me that it was safe to leave my room or ever even acknowledged what happend or tried to compensate me in any way.

My only complaint was that the air-conditioning could have been a bit stronger. Location was fine! Right on Lake Ontario (I had a nice view of the lake from my room). True, it's about 3-4 blocks to get to Union Station if you want to take the subway or train, but Toronto is a walker's city. Toronto's transit system is very easy to use, so once you get to Union Station you can get almost anywhere. And, there was always a line of cabs right in front of the hotel. There were two places to get breakfast or a quick bite to eat right across the street, and a convenience store a block or so up the street that was open 24 hours. Again, 3-4 blocks away were plenty of restaurant choices, plus the subway if you wanted to head into a different part of the city. Parking throughout Toronto is horrible, although definitely a bit pricier at the Westin (which was fine for me -- I actually returned the rental car that I had gotten early since I really didn't need it to get around the city). I would never pay the $400+ listed on the door, but for $89 a night on Priceline, this place couldn't be beat!", "user": "CWH3", "date": "August 2, 2006", "id": 5544682}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great location", "text": "We stayed at the Westin Harbour Castle for 3 nights at the end of a two week holiday in Ontario. The hotel is situated, as the name suggests, on the waterfront and we upgraded to get a newly refurbished room with a view of the harbour. For what we paid for the room ($270 a night) I don't think the hotel is marvellous value for money however the nearby harbour area is very pleasant at all times of the day. Staff in the hotel were friendly and knowledgeable - there was nothing that was too much trouble for them. The room we had was not the biggest but was adequate for our needs and the view was great. The leisure facilities are also good with an indoor pool, tennis courts and a decent gym. I would recommend the hotel for others and although there is refurbishment work taking place - we certainly didn't notice anything untoward during our stay. However, this may be because we didn't want to take any chances and paid extra for the refurbished room.", "user": "LyndsyStw", "date": "August 2, 2006", "id": 5540465}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "A pleasant enough stay, nothing special.", "text": "I stayed at this hotel in June 2006, as it was the venue for a conference I was attending.
