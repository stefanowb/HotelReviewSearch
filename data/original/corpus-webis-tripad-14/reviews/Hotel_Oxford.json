We chose this hotel as it was a BA recommended hotel, we were not disappointed. The hotel is situated in a good location just off Via Veneto and near to many of the sights you visit Rome for. The Hotel is in a old building, which gives it a lot of charm and history; the lift wasn't huge so we used the stairs a lot. Our room was spacious (we upgraded to a superior room and it was great). I know it's not good for the environment, but having clean sheets and towels every day when you've been walking around a hot and dusty city is very much appreciated. Breakfasts were continental style and there was masses to choose from....you won't go hungry. The staff at the hotel were very polite and accommodating to any requests we had. We didn't use the hotel restaurant in the evenings as we found a few local restaurants in the back streets which were frequented by locals and they are worth searching out as the restaurants on Via Veneto are very expensive.

We stayed for one night before heading back to the UK, and was impressed with the levels of service and the large modern room we were given. The room was of a nice quality and had a huge bedroom, looking at the floor plan it must have been one of the biggest in the hotel, and had a King size bad and a second bed for my daughter, both were comfy. The room also has a safe, mini-bar and flat screen Sky TV, although not much was available on English. The bathroom was large with bath with an excellent shower (the window was controlled by a switch on the wall which was handy). One of the main things I noticed in this hotel was just how clean it was, I don\u2019t think I have ever come across a room quite as clean as this, they must have excellent cleaning staff). The bar is nice (a little dated perhaps), and the staff are very friendly and accommodating, and the hotel has a restaurant although the menu looked quite limiting so we chose to eat out (which perhaps was a mistake, as the restaurant we ate at was not very good - see my review of Tempio di bacco).", "title": "Great Value for Money - Good Location", "user": "jb812", "date": "August 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137235294}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with family", "text": "One thing to note is that we were in Rome on a Sunday this has some clear benefits - The city is more quiet, and there is a more casual atmosphere, however there are also disbenefits in that lots of shops are closed, along with some tourist attractions (especially the Vatican is a no-go for obvious reasons).", "title": "Out stay at the hotel Oxford Rome", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "911Helen911", "date": "August 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136833120}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I booked the hotel via BA Holidays and was able to obtain a better rate than direct / via the large hotel websites, it is one of their top recommendations and I have to agree it would be were I would stay again with family to get an excellent value nights stay.", "title": "Suited us perfectly", "user": "Veronica C", "date": "August 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136592709}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "We recently returned to the Hotel Oxford fin Rome for 4 nights, this time with our two children.

Our sons appreciated that they didn't had to sleep in a sofa bed ;-) We were welcomed with great service upon arrival by Katerina who gave us a map and pointed out 2 different buslines and recomended a lot of things to see. We know that continental breakfasts in Europe is \"poor\" so we were positively surprised by Oxfords breakfast. It contained a lot (even fresh fruit) and was very fresh and the hostesses kept refilling cheese, salami and turkey meat as soon as it was coming to an end so that it would stay fresh all the time. All of us was satisfied with breakfast and the hostesses were very nice. We never tried the restaurant but one evening when we were tired and came back late and didn't fell like going out for dinner, the bar made us great sandwiches with help from the kitchen. My family don't mind walking so for us the position of the hotel was great. Also since we could rest our tired feet by taking the bus if needed ;-) We felt \"safe\" in the neighborhood that were a little more \"nicely\" when you looked at the buildings and surroundings. The hotel building is very charming with character thanks to its narrow corridors and stairways. After four days we picked up our rental car.
