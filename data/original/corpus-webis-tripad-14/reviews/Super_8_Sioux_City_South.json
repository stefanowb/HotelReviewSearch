I am a GM of a hotel, and know how hard it is to make sure there is no hair in a room, housekeeping is doing a great job!

When we arrived they would not honor the price, demanding we pay in cash an extra fee for the dog. We specifically had reserved a non smoking room as I have asthma. They refused to give us one because of the dog. The room was dirty and the smell was unbearable. Bottom line, we left. We had to get the refund through the booking cite we made the reservation through, since they refused to do so. And when I sent an email to Super Eight's main office, their attitude was each hotel is independently owned & operated so they didn't want to hear it, which put me off their brand entirely.", "title": "Worst Hotel Experience of My Life", "user": "Linda D", "date": "July 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 169822970}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled solo", "text": "New carpet, nice room.

The room was clean, spacious, and pleasantly decorated. The bed was quite comfortable and the bathroom roomy. We felt it was an excellent value. The only complaint I have is that there is a $1.50 charge for use of the safe and you must request that it be removed from your bill if you don't want to use the safe; they put it on automatically. I remembered the price I had gotten through my booking service and it wasn't quite the same. The desk clerk present when we arrived said, \"oh, yes, that's probably the fee for the safe - mention it in the morning. We cannot remove it until then.\" So I did - but the morning desk clerk was much more snippy about it, though she did remove it. So - if you are watching your pennies (and if you are staying at a Super8 and using Trip Advisor to look for good deals, you probably are) make sure they remove your \"safe charge!\"", "title": "Very pleasant", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Anita B", "date": "June 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 165173387}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We\u2019ve stayed at many Super 8 hotels and this one was way above average.

There is even an elevator in this one. The room was large and well decorated and smelled clean. The price was excellent too. I doubt whether you could get more for your motel dollar in town than this. An easy stop off the interstate. Close to shopping and dining. We were even checked in and out by Julie, the front desk manager. She did a great job and was very friendly, courteous and helpful, as were the rest of the staff. The only con I had was the small breakfast area and limited food selection. But it was adequate so that was a minor detail. The microwave, fridge, iron and ironing board, and the hair dryer made up for that. Unless you need a swimming pool, this would be your best choice.
