The Fairfield serves up a nice free daily breakfast. Never underestimate the saving of free breakfast! We stayed in a 2 bed standard room which overlooked Colorado Blvd. There was a little street noise but you had a view of the Rocky Mountains. Your alternative? Stay across the the hall for a little less noise and a view of the parking deck and Best Buy. I'll take the mountain view. For access to the main North/South highway of Colorado and downtown Denver the Fairfield Inn is a great place to stay and rest your head. You're in Denver!

You can take the SkyRide from the airport (AF Route - $7 each way) and transfer at Colorado BLVD to the public city bus (Route 40 - free transfer) which takes you right to the Fairfield.
