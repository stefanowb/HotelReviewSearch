Hotel is very well situated just opposite the Sheraton at the posh end of town (which I much prefer to the backpacker district) - most of the sights are within walking distance. Staff very friendly and welcoming as because this is a small hotel you get the personal service which is so often lacking in the larger establishments (reception manager booked me another hotel in Mui Ne and in general showed much appreciated commercial acumen). Standard rooms are a good size with all the facilities you'd expect from a hotel in this category. Breakfast buffet is good. Twin rooms are all windowless which is slightly disconcerting at first - but then again how much time do you spend in your room during the day anyway? And no window also means quiet and excellent for getting a good night's sleep (welcome respite from the traffic outside). Internet booking will secure the best rates here.
