As we had the advantage to choose our room, we can confirm some rooms can be dark, therefore, request a room without a balcony above yours (much of the 2nd floor proved sunny). Further, the rooms are clean and comfortable, the bathtubs bordering on small swimming pool (and frankly bordering on awkward if not taking a bath). The front desk and valet were friendly, save one woman who seemed to be somewhat of a sourpuss and couldn't be bothered. Otherwise, everyone was accommodating and thoughtful, helping us with dinner suggestions and reservations (Poggio's was wonderful, although service lackluster) to finding a road less traveled as we made our way to Sonoma. The continental breakfast and wine and cheese presentation while not extraordinary, were adequate and just enough to start and end the day. Sure it would be nice if the hotel rooms were larger, bedside tables more convenient, indoor seating more comfortable \u2026 but then again that's not why you (or at least we) stay here. It's a lovely hotel, albeit not amazing. Leaving the door open and falling asleep to the waves, reading a book on your balcony with a glass of wine and the sunset over San Francisco \u2026 now that's amazing.", "title": "Sweet Rooms and Spectacular Views", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ANGshire", "date": "April 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7332725}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007", "text": "If I hadn't been on my honeymoon I would have given it a lower rating.

The room was spacious very well appointed with a real wood burning fireplace with wood provided and kingsize bed and large jetted spa tub. The 2nd night as the suite was unavailable for more than 1 night, we stayed in a smaller room with a queen size bed at a $200 plus savings. The room while less opulent still featured a gas fireplace with the same lovely bay view and deck chairs to boot. Any way you go, breakfast in bed or no, rain or shine, the view is worth the price. This is the first time I have ever lingered until 5 minutes before the mandatory check out time just to sit and look out at the bay, take in the activity that goes on in and around the water.
