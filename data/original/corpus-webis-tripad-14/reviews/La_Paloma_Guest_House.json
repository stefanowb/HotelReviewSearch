We booked 3 nights with Diane. Diane is super, she is very friendly and nice. She picked us up from airport for a small fee and took us to grocery store. I would not recommend driving if you are from the states, they drive on opposite side and very aggressive. Her house is on a hill that has beautiful views of Atlantis. It is a ways from downtown area, but okay since we like being away from all the noise and daily cruise tourists. Neighborhood is quiet and nice, expect dogs barking when you are out walking. Nice cool breeze in rooms and out on balcony. We stayed in Coral Room, room good size for 2 people, rooms have a AC window unit, we usually only use at night. The bed, not so great, I am use to sleeping on a Temperpedic, so we felt like we were sinking in the center. Rooms and living room area very clean. Her housekeeper is very friendly and I believe lives onsite. Bathroom shows its age, but it is clean. Water pressure okay, she does have hot water in shower.", "title": "Older charming home, good location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kjshurbet", "date": "April 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 159204078}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My hubby used her kitchen to make breakfast, she keeps that area closed, due to her dogs. Her dogs are on her side of house. Internet works great in room. We walked to Green Parrot for lunch, short 10-15 minute walk. Okay place to eat. We did walk to the Fish Fry one night, to Gullies, not close, we would recommend taxi. We walked during day and we wanted too, but we had a taxi bring us back after dark. Diane offers rides when she is going places, otherwise you will have to take a taxi on Shirley to go downtown or go on Bay Street to take taxi towards Atlantis, unless you want to walk. We usually paid 10 bucks for a taxi. We came to relax and dive and this place worked perfectly, we would come back to La Paloma.", "title": "Dilapidated", "user": "MakoSharkEsq", "date": "March 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 156158005}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Inconvenient location on a steep terrain. Customs was suspicious and asked me additional questions about why I would choose that area for my stay. The room is clean, but because the property is run-down, the cleanliness matters little. The bathroom, for example, will make you want to wear flip-flops in the shower. The owner is very nice and polite though. If the measure of this rental were based on her pleasantness, it'd be top-rated. But there's a reason why 100% of payment was demanded ~before~ arrival at the property. That should've been a red flag for me. There are places for the same price right across the street from Junkanoo Beach (which is also right by downtown Nassau). Granted, these properties are likely in no better shape than La Paloma, but at least the location would be convenient.", "title": "Great Place for Relaxing AWAY from Resorts", "user": "Ruby M", "date": "February 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 152103169}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 1, "very good": 3, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 0}, "aka": "La Paloma Guest House Bahamas/Nassau", "slim_ranking": 0.272727272727}
