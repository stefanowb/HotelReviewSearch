It was through Apple Vacations and I was allowed a set amount and told I could go anywhere I wanted. My fiance and I decided on Hawaii, well she did. As we looked at the Hotels and using the Apple Vacations web page, we found nice hotels along the beach that would cover what we had to spend. However when we searched 2 blocks back, we found the Waikiki Sunset, it was perfect for us, as we were able to take her sister and brother-in-law along, and we split the difference 4 ways. I read the reviews and the comments, some where not so nice. When we go to Disney, we stay at the All Star Resorts, how much time do you spend in your room. Same here, if I want to stay in a room, I could stay at home. The rooms were \"Dated\", as one reviewer put it. To me they were vintage and added to my vacation. All the Staff were excellent, and I saw Security several times making rounds. I read a review stating the elevators were slow. Well 38 floors, transporters aren't availble as of yet, I thought they did pretty good. They do have 2 outside Weber gas grills, which were not only clean, but great for the steaks and burgers. We did not use the pool, as we have one at home, so we went to the beach. The water is that clear, you forget you are in the ocean until you get a mouth full or open your eyes. The way the \"Fish\" walls are constructed, I actually had Trumpet fish at my feet along with Nemo. These rooms are Condos and have kitchens. If you belong to a Sams Club, get your food there, and your other needs at Walmart. The ABC Stores are great and you will pay 2.50 for 1/2 pound of butter and 14.99 for a 12 pack of Bud. Finally the question is, would you return. The answer is, yes; and I am in 2 years. This time I will be bringing my son, his wife and 2 grand children along, and we will be at the Waikiki Sunset.
