However, I did walk along the beach outside the Paradise Beach Club and was very concerned to see an array of effluent pipes built into the sea wall, discharging a trickle of very noxious petroleum-based liquid directly onto the sand and into the sea (you could see the irridescent colours on the surface of the sand and the water). Although it was only a gentle trickle, the overpowering smell was very evident for quite a distance either side of the pipes, and made me feel nauseous for half an hour or so. I cannot comment otherwise on the Paradise Beach Club, but I would be very wary about spending any time on the beach or in the sea in that area.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "peterdu", "date": "February 24, 2004", "id": 1666421}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good place for grad trip", "text": "Got back yesterday, and all-in-all, a perfect place for 120 kids to spend a week together. Would never recommend this place to families or married couples, but that is my style. Rooms were OK, a little confusing to find your way in the dark (and after a few drinks). There was no hot water at times too, and no shampoo either. Drinks were really strong, the buffet got better as the week progressed, but we really liked Eden's restaurant. The casino was pretty ghetto too, not so sure that games aren't rigged, but we had fun anyways. Crazy moon was pretty crazy too, but make sure you pay using pesos or else they'll rip you off if you use American. And what's with the one key per room policy? Worst idea ever. Oh, one final thing, those d*** helicopters every morning early drove me crazy.

The weather was nice and hot, it rained 1 day that we were there. The staff at the hotel were amazing, they were so polite and very concerned about our enjoyment. The food was good. I mean if you go away you have to expect that your not going to get the food your used to at home but all and all the a la cart resaurants were great and the buffet had a lot of variety so there was always something you could eat. Just don't go to dinner to late or your selection will decrease. The animation team did their best consiering they seamed to be working on a low budget. The pool and the hotel facilities were well kept. We went on the horse back riding on the hotel bus. It was an interesting experience for someone who had never went. The disco played a lot of spanish music on the wednesday but it also played hip hip like 50 cent. On friday we went for a couple minutes when they were playing rock but we didn't stay bc we were leaving early the next day. For shopping go to the plaza down the street first to get an idea of prices, even after bargaining for ever it is hard to get a good deal on the beach. The beach was beautiful as well. You can get some really good deals on selloffvacations or sunholidays if your traveling last minute check it out!

Upon arrival, the English speaking clerk at the front desk provided us with our inroom security box key as requested, provided us with a bellboy to assist us with our luggage. We proceeded through the \"confused\" complex and up four flights of rounding stairs to \"our room\" -- in the ATTIC that is! As the bellboy opened the door to our room, my girlfriend SCREAMED at what she saw. An \"extremely\" narrow spiral staircase (90 degree would be my guess!), running straight up and down and consisted of approximately 3 feet in width! This was the first thing our eyes were set upon -- our noses were offered something altogether different, but just as awful! Had we been larger individuals I would question whether we would have fit in the stairwell at all! Then another door which had clearly been vandalized, as the lock and doorknob were existing by mere shards of wood splinters that remained in the doorframe (or maybe it was just \"rotting\" off/out of the door???). The room STUNK, it was dark (one lamp for entire room), the air conditioning was \"oozing\" some black \"stuff\" and it ran down the wall, not to mention the airvent was hanging out of the wall ready to drop at any moment. Two of the three windows did NOT possess glass -- YES that is correct ... no glass over the windows. So you can well imagine the \"fright\" we possessed at the sight of the vandalized door and lack of \"anything\" for window coverings... clearly anthing/anybody could have entered at their leisure! WE booked a standard room with two beds, we got a \"closet\" in the \"attic\". We requested to move, front desk clerk could no longer speak English and provided us with \"Nueki\". Nueki didn't give a hoot and clearly told us \"Too bad, that is the room you get!\" OUr story is an AWFUL one and long at best, but for anyone planning on the Paradise -- I strongly suggest you AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!! (P.S. There was a seniors group that booked rooms \"months\" prior -- the Paradise had overbooked and basically they got what they got -- Guess what they got? Four flights and a spiral staircase in the \"attic\" -- One gentleman was 87 years old, another lady in her 70's fell down the spiral staircase! - no attempt to have them moved!) - Travelled the Carribean, South America and many places for \"many\" years -- never experienced anything so absolutely horrible!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 2, 2004", "id": 1701364}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not a 4 star resort!", "text": "Visited Paradise Beach Resort from Feb17-24, 2004. My initial reaction upon entering the resort was, \"This definitely doesn't look like a 4-star resort!\" And further investigation proved me right. Our room was substandard, the bedspreads had holes in them, the sheets were threadbare and one of the beds had hair on the sheets, the air-conditioning wasn't working properly, and the bathroom needed a major facelift. This resort is in disrepair, it seems to have had no upkeep and it is showing everywhere you look. Paint is peeling off of walls, furniture is old and rickety, and it just wasn't an endearing place to be. The main buffet restaurant has all plastic chairs and tables, not what you would expect in a 4 star. The food was good however, and the service for the most part was also good. One thing that definitely needs improving is the seating capacity of the restaurant. At the busiest meal of the day (dinner) you would be walking around with your plate full of food and no where to sit! It seemed as though the resort couldn't handle the numbers. If you were lucky enough to find an empty table, it more often than not wasn't set, so you were off and running about looking for cutlery, napkins and the like. And to top it all off, there were 3 stray cats that wandered the dining area on a regular basis, looking to be fed. Some patrons didnt find this offensive, but I certainly did. I am not an animal lover, nor do I expect that I should be subjected to a cat rubbing up against my leg while I am trying to have a meal! Some people obviously didnt mind it, cause they were feeding the creatures food from their plates! The people working at the resort didn't try to shoo the animals away, so obviously it was okay with them. The best part of the place was the bartender Alan...........and his expertise at serving drinks with quite a flair. That in itself was entertaining. Speaking of entertainment, the nightly shows are a farce! Compared to the shows I have seen at other resorts, this place was laughable. One in particular, the Diva show, was sad and demeaning to women. All in all, I didn't have the vacation that I had hoped for. I definitely would not return to this resort, nor would I recommend it to others. I would rate this palce as a 3-star.....and that would be a stretch.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 26, 2004", "id": 1671946}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved everything!!", "text": "Just got back from Puerta Plata, went for 2 weeks, from 8th Feb 04 - 22 Feb 04. It is amazing out there. Beautiful beaches and scenery. Paradise Beach Hotel was excellent. The room was simple, but clean and spacious. The food was lovely, loads of variety and different theme nights. Hemingways in the Plaza was also a great place to eat american style food. All the staff were lovely, helpful and always happy and cheerful. You must definately go to Ocean World, we did the dolphin encounter, it was amazing being so close to the dolphins, dancing with them and kissing them. You can also do the dolphin swim, but i felt the encounter was much better and cheaper. Also, you must visit Paradise Island. The journey on the coach is a bit of a pain, but it is well worth it. You travel on a speedboat over to the island and prepare to be amazed when you get there. It is beautiful, golden sand, clear water and loads of fish which you can see through the water or you can snorkel. The monster Truck safari was a good trip. It was very interesting to see how the dominican people live, but also quite sad to see the children. Make sure you take some sweets to give to them. I do feel the trip was a bit over - rated though.
