We always remembered it as a tranquil, peaceful place where we could relax & get away from it all. Boy, have things changed! We could not believe how noisy it is there. There are constant leaf blowers going from early in the morning until the afternoon - even when we were sunbathing at the main pool! We actually called the front desk to have them stop because it was out of control. They complied but the next day the noise continued. In addition, there is a constant barage of construction trucks going up & down the main road so walking was prohibited except on the limited trails. We felt walking on the road was very dangerous.

This place was the perfect getaway whether in or outside of San Diego. The drive up through the grounds instantly sets the tone of a place of relaxation, and that it was. The staff was very attentive, accommodating, welcoming and knowledgeable. They certainly made us feel well taken care of with an above and beyond, but not overwhelming standard of guest service. The spa services are incredible, the staff is well trained and the relaxation room really makes you not want to leave. We are big on food and were pleasantly surprised to see some great sourcing from local farms with not only a creative approach to the menu but equally delicious, as well. The view during brunch was pleasantly relaxing. If there were any negatives it's hard to recount as the staff, grounds and amenities make every effort to ensure your stay is nothing short of exactly why you arrived there in the first place.

The hotel has one room only with 2 double beds which initially we were given however it is an accessible room with no bath tub and with a modified accessible shower with no shower door in order to accomodate accessible guests. When traveling with children you need a bath tub so we changed rooms after a few hours and received a king room with pull out. I did not receive, at least to my knowledge, an upgrade being a AMX Platinum nor Club 5C member; heck even staying 6 consecutive nights should have given us a better room upgrade in my point of view. I was hopeful the hotel would give us a two bedroom suite as an upgrade however they did not.
