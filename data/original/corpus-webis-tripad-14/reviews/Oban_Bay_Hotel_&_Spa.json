We booked DBB for 2 nights and the trip included bubbly on arrival, breakfast in bed and two spa treatments. The hotel staff were all so friendly, nothing was too much trouble (the only exception was the night-shift manager, who gave the impression he was the owner of the hotel. He strutted around clearing up glasses and candle holders and tried to put everyone off ordering more drinks). We had a nice room on the 3rd floor which had a view over the bay. Dinner is fine - people on the DBB package get the table d'hote menu but can order from a la carte for a charge. My only comment is that is would have been nice to have had our meals cooked to order but everything is pre-prepared for quick table turnaround. I would recommend eating later rather than earlier. On the first night we felt we were being served far more quickly than is decent. We ate at 19:30 on the second night and it was a much more relaxed experience. The luxury room service breakfast is excellent value - we got it as part of the package but it can be ordered for \u00a329 per couple and includes an excellent breakfast choice of breakfasts, cereal, pastries and you even get a bottle of bubbly. We didn't need any lunch and we left the bubbly until we watched the Scotland rugby match later on in the day. Only quibble over the weekend would be that we were in our room all morning on the first full day and therefore missed having our room cleaned. The spa treatments are excellent - my husband and I had an back, neck & shoulder massage and it was wonderful and the lady who does these (a New Zealander) was lovely. We also enjoyed the steamroom, sauna and outdoor hot tub (even though it was rather bracing outside) - lovely once you get in it. I would recommend this for a relaxing break. The hotel management have the right idea in offering good package deals to get people in the door - other hotels in the area looked deserted but this hotel was pretty full.

Breakfast was very good. Porridge excellent and scrambled eggs and bacon very good. Parking spaces had to be booked and paid for before arrival.
