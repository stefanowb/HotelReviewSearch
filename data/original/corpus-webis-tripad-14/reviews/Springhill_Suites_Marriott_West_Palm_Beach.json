Arrived at 2:45 and attempted to check in and the lady, Jessica, who was manning the desk informed us that check-in is at 3PM and the only room they had available was a handicapped room on the first floor. So we waited for the 15 minutes to get a room we reserved. There were about 4 other couples waiting in the lobby to check in with the same situation. 3PM came and there was a rush of everyone checking in, there was a different person at the desk at that time and was polite but quiet. He assigned me a room on the first floor and it was no big deal, but low and behold the room was the handicapped room. I wouldn't mind it minus the shower. I figured since I used a free night certificate they stuck us in that room because I was not a paying customer. I just wish they had given us the room in the first place had I known that it was going to be the same room as proposed 15 minutes earlier. Since we were there for only one night I didn't bother saying anything to the manager as we got back from the concert at 1:30 in the morning. The breakfast was okay but nothing to write home about.
