The location was awesome and was one of the prettiest areas of downtown. There was so much to do so close by. The price was exceptional for that area (averaged $199 per night), we stayed a sat and Sunday night. The room was clean and the shower was a walk-in with tile. We had a view of the river which was nice and could see the boats going by. The restaurant, Bella Bacinos was located in the hotel and had a great vibe. The drinks were pricey but it was expected considering where we were. We only had breakfast to go but it was good and priced ok. ($15 for breakfast sandwich (called panini but really was a mcmuffin) and 2 eggs bacon and hash browns with cheese). The food was fresh and hot. The staff was excellent and had a very welcoming attitude. We asked for wine bottle opener, beer bottle opener and a knife to cut a lime and they brought it to the room. The free fresh bottled water at every elevator was so convenient and refreshing. Thermostat was next to the bed and it was cold so we were able to turn the heat on before getting out of bed. Now the negatives....the room was the smallest I have ever stayed in and the bed was a concrete block with a sheet over it. Unfortunately, that is why I have to give this hotel an average rating. When we travel we are hardly in our room much but when we are we are exhausted and need a good night\u2019s rest. The lights from downtown poured in the room in spite of the blackout curtains, the bed was hard as a rock (tossed and turned, had to get out of bed before I wanted to cause my back was hurting so bad) and the we could hear a very interesting argument the neighbors were having outside their room and it felt like they were in the room with us plus the sirens every couple of hours reminded us that we were in the heart of downtown. If you can sleep on anything and through anything then this is the perfect hotel", "title": "Quaint.....but not my favorite", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Jennifer B", "date": "May 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 129556430}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Yes the room was small but it was very clean, which I appreciate more than a larger room.

At first we loved the location of the hotel and really liked the room. Then we looked out the window. Nothing but alley, dumpster and at night very loud. The tv was extremely small and so far from the bed it was hard to see and hear. The rooms was decorated from IKEA. Then getting in the shower in the morning. Wow!!!! I have been in some small showers in Europe but this was definitly the tightest. I am 5'9\" 160 and it was a difficult shower. On the second night a group of guys came rolling in about 4 am banging doors and very loud. It continued until 8:30 when they finally checked out. I called the front desk twice. I am not sure they did anything the first time. The mattress was old, flat and extremely firm. Pillows were old and used. Too many other hotel chains are upgrading the bedding. The point here is that you will not get a good nights sleep. The little bit of money we saved staying here was not worth it.
