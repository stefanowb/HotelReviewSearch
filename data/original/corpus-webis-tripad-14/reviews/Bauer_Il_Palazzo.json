However, a couple friends had heard of Bauer Il Palazzo, and I didn't find anything too scary about it, so we went with it, despite the hefty price tag. The hotel did not disappoint. From our arrival, the staff was consistently friendly and helpful. We stayed in a deluxe double suite, which had a large king bed and walk-in closet, a nice sized sitting room (which we never used), a beautiful marble bathroom, and a spacious terrace with view of one of the side canals. My only disappointment with the room were the sheets--for such an expensive hotel, I would have expected luxuriously soft sheets, and these were not. Also, we had ants on the dresser in our room, but the staff immediately came and dealt with the problem when we notified them. The breakfast buffet, which was included with our stay, was pretty good, but the view from the rooftop terrace where you have breakfast was absolutely beautiful. You can reserve the rooftop jacuzzi with champagne and strawberries for one hour for a fee of 60 Euros. If you want to do this, book it in advance. It was completely booked both nights of our stay, but we were able to schedule an afternoon time, which ended up being perfect because it was about 80 degrees outside and sunny.
