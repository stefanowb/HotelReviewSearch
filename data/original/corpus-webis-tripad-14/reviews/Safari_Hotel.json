The staff are very friendly and helpful and reception always well staffed. Free safety deposit box service, lockable wardrobe section in your room and plenty of security. I was travelling alone and it all felt very safe and friendly, unlike some of the guest houses which people on my tour felt were not so safe. There is a decent sized pool with plenty of sun loungers and a pool bar service for drinks and snacks. Couple of nice restaurants also which are fairly reasonably priced. I stayed in the business class room which was spacious and had all the comforts you would expect from this class of hotel and much appreciated air con! It's also easy to extend your check out time and arrange for airport transfers. I made good use of the free shuttle service which runs in and out of Windhoek centre every 30 mins and only takes about 5-10 mins to get there. Definitely don't let the fact this is not in the centre put you off, it's cheap and easy to arrange taxis to restaurants etc at night and even the places closer to the centre recommend taking taxis after about 8pm anyway.
