My primary complaint is that the rooms and lobby are so focused on \"design\" (and I use quotes sarcastically) that comfort and function are not really even considered. For instance, in the bathroom, there are no towel rack and no countertop to put toiletries on (just a lone-standing basin sink). The shower and tub controls were about as cryptic as I have ever encountered. The rooms have many lights to accommodate many moods -- but this comes with a tradeoff: about 14 light switches I counted in our room. Very annoying. The lobby seating was better suited to Great Dane dogs rather than humans. If sitting one of their couches for less than 10 minutes can cause a back, maybe they should reconsider? Minimalist design need not be confusing or uncomfortable. Unfortunately at the Straf, it is both.
