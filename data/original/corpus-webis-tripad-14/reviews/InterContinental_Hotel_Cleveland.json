The hotel location is great within the Cleveland Clinic and a short drive from downtown Cleveland and nice restaurants at little Italy and Cleveland heights. The hotel is very grand with granite everywhere and very well appointed, clean and spacious rooms. Only downside is that parking is valet only and the pillows are extremely soft to the point where you wake up with neck pain every morning. On the positive side, the separate shower and tub in the bathroom is great! The best part though is the main conference room. It is just the best for either a review course or CME meeting. It can get pretty \"rough\" in some areas not far from the hotel, so if you are not familiar with Cleveland, always check with concierge or take a taxi to where you are going before wandering around on your own. I've seen significant improvements around the city over the past few years and Cleveland does have many nice places and a recent modern and progressive vibe to it, especially the University circle area. If you are on a budget just try eating at the hospital cafeteria which is just a short walk across the skyway on the 3rd floor and opens until around 11:00 PM.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Poogie2", "date": "June 11, 2009", "id": 32136029}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled with family", "text": "If you have reason to be at the Cleveland Clinic, then strictly for convenience sake, this is a good place to stay.
