On checking in at 20:45, I found that the room allocated was a tiny single. On returning to reception, the friendly and pleasant receptionist, with whom I had dealt with on 2 previous visits checked my confirmation e-mail and a surly male receptionist \"took over\". He took 10 minutes to check the computer system, and then informed me there were no non-smoking double rooms left. (so why did they allow me to book one in the first place?) I then said I did not mind a smoking room, and asked politely for a complimentary upgrade as it was their mistake, it was nearly 9pm and I had been kept waiting around for some time. He condescendingly said a complimentary upgrade was out of the question, if I wanted to upgrade it would cost me \u00a370. His manner and attitude were both appalling. I can only assume that as the booking had been made through an agency at a cheap rate, I deserved substandard service. I accepted the smoking double on the third floor. On arrival I can now see that he had allocated this one out of spite. The room was very small, the gap between the table and the bed was about 12 inches. But the bathroom was so tiny!

The visit did start with our worst nightmare \u2013 they had no record of our booking; however, after a short delay whilst we retired to the bar and having been assured there were rooms available, the problem was sorted and we were allocated a room the 3rd Floor. Whilst clean, well prepared and nicely decorated, it was not the biggest room we have had in a 4* hotel and the bed was just a standard 4\u2019 6\u201d double (most hotels of a similar standard have at least a king size these days we find). The en-suite had a combined shower and bath which could be difficult for older guests. The weather was warm and so we had to use the air-conditioning, unfortunately it was quite noisy. Typical of too many hotels, there were no coat hooks for wet outer garments (not an issue for us this time). We were disappointed with the lack of storage space which would be a problem for an extended stay and the fact that there was only one armchair. We did like the provision of an empty fridge rather than the usual exorbitantly expensive mini-bar. The public areas were generally well decorated throughout, with the entrance being quite spectacular. As pointed out by other members, there are steps in some corridors which could be hazardous for the old or unwary. Also the corridors have just plain walls which reduces the luxurious feel of the place (see photos). The view from our window was fairly open with roofs nearby and trees in the distance, not too bad for central London we thought. Just below our window was the \u2018Friend at Hand\u2019 pub, very convenient considering the hotel bar prices - we paid over \u00a340 for a couple of drinks and two rounds of fairly ordinary sandwiches. Breakfast was good, but be aware that a Continental Breakfast only is served in the bar with a full service standard being available in the Dining Room. Our last point concerns the lifts which seem to have a capacity problem, whilst the notice says 8 passengers (545 kgs) can be carried, the overweight warning went off whenever more than 3 people stepped in \u2013 a bit embarrassing for all concerned!! Notwithstanding the minor issues related in this review, we would stay at this hotel again mainly because of its superb location close to many of London\u2019s tourist attractions; for example Covent Garden and many theatres are within walking distance and Russell Square tube station is on the doorstep.
