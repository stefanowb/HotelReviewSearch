It's fine location and amenable staff made our Thanksgiving holiday even more pleasurable. The rooms were comfortable - on the small side - but amply furnished; the bathrooms large and very well-maintained. Very good restaurant recommendations nearby. Located one block from the metro (Piazza Barberini) and Via Veneto; five minutes from the Trevi and walking distance to all. Well-priced off-season rate which included a buffet breakfast.

This hotel was everything we had hoped it would be and more. The hotel was very comfortable and tastefully decorated. Our room was quite nice with a balcony. It was also a good sized room with a good sized bathroom. The hotel was very clean. We returned every night to a nice clean room, thanks to the housekeepers. The buffet breakfast had a little of everything, something for every taste. It was a good breakfast to start our day. The hotel staff was always very helpful, providing us with good tips for restaurants and arranging transportation for our outings. They were always cheerful and friendly. We stayed at peak season so it was a bit expensive but comparable in price to other hotels. It is a quality hotel. We were very happy with our choice and would recommed this hotel as a great place to stay in Rome. I must also say it is walking distance to the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain and most other top sights.", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 20, 2004", "id": 2769462}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We were really pleased with the Barberini", "text": "2nd visit to Rome, but 1st time at The Barberini.", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "Silver traveller from Cornwall", "date": "August 26, 2004", "id": 2496148}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Barberini Hotel is Perfect", "text": "My wife and I liked everything about the hotel.

If you are a walker, the location is perfect ... 10 minutes from Trevi, top or bottom of Spanish Steps, Via Veneto. 10 minutes more gets you to Via Corso, Villa Borghese, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, etc. And the hotel staff couldn't be nicer. Quiet location, good breakfast. The rooftop breakfast terazza opens in May, so we missed it .. but it is beautiful up there. Would stay here again, or recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Pricey, but so is all of central Rome. Only if you have your heart set on staying in a particular location ...

In some countries, like Austria, the U.S, or The Netherlands, it's really easy to find a good hotel, but in others as the UK, france or Italy, it's recommendable to look after the choice with special care. Rome is one of the most marvellous places in the world, ideal for a few days-off. My girlfriend and I planned our trip to this ancient wonderful city with so much illusion that we didn't want any little thing to be disgusting or annoying. We made an in-depth search on the web in order to decide the best possible option. Finally, we decided to go to the Barberini Hotel, due to its beautiful appearance, it's unbeatable location and the great reviews we read about it on the Internet. Since we entered the lobby for the first time and we checked-in, we felt at home. The place was absolutely wonderful, roman-flavoured, warm and charming. The hotel staff were very friendly and gave us great (and personalised) treatment. Our room was really cozy and impeccably clean, the bathroom was a whole other world, sensational breakfast buffet was included... all pros with an only con: the aconditioned air wasn't available, because it only is in summer season. Anyway, we solved this easily by opening the window for a while to get some fresh air. So: extremely nice hotel with extremely nice rooms, really kind, customer-oriented staff, and one of the best possible locations in Rome (just a few steps to Barberini square, a five minute-walk to Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain, and to subway stops to Termini railway station).
