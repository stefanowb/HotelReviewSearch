The hotel highlights on the website that the pool is closed but does not mention anything about the gym (so called sport center). I went there in the afternoon and was surprised to see that the gym is also closed for refurbishment. What a disappointment - but on top of that (when I entered the gym) the contractor yelled on me \"get out, get out, get out\". I felt like a cow chased from a field. What kind of behavior is this? Every two star hotel treats guests in a more polite way. Another issue is the security in the room. My door did not close properly and I told the housekeeper on the floor that there is a problem. She promised to send somebody from engineering, but nothing happen. After one hour waiting I called reception and asked for engineering to come to my room. The guy came instantly but decided to spray the door only instead of re-aligning it as I suggested to him. Of course the door still did not close properly and I had to slam the door heavily every time I entered or left the room, in order to get the door closed. Although the door was closed after I slammed it....it does not feel very safe to close a door like that. Later I learned that the guest in the room next to me had to close the door in the same way. Imagine the noise level and the affect on the door condition. In summary it was not worth spending all the money for being treated like a cow from a contractor and staying in a room and feeling insecure.", "title": "Misleading website statement", "user": "cicu087", "date": "August 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 74547063}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great!", "text": "In the website stated closing the pool for maintanance from 8-22Aug but actually awhole sports club.When I try to enter i 've been shouted and chased out from there like a cow not realising they paste a piece of paper infront of the entrance.So..if u thinking of doing a workout..pls forget about it or else wasting your time bringing your gear", "user": "xbojanx", "date": "August 9, 2010", "id": 74412608}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Frankfurt"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 66, "very good": 112, "terrible": 19, "excellent": 55}, "aka": "Maritim Hotel Frankfurt", "slim_ranking": 0.362264150943}
