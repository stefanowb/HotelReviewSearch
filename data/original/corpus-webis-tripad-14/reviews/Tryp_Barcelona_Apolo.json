The room was at the back, so nice and quiet. The TV only had BBC world news as an english speaking channel, and whilst you don't go away to watch TV, the night it rained heavily it would have been nice to order a film. The safe took a while to master, but once we had figured out you have to hold the door shut until it stops whirring, we were fine. Room service was generous, and came quickly. The hotel iself is ideally placed for the metro, and I recommed you get familiar with it as soon as possible. I didn't until the thrid day of our 6 day stay. Its literally outside the hotel and will make all the difference for your sight-seeing activities. Beware, the road leading to La Rambla, where the Palau Guell is situated, is in a red light district. It was fine, loads of people around, but an eye-opener for my 15yo daughter! This is a 4 star hotel, yet it didn't feel that far removed from a Premier Inn to be honest, but the basics - clean room, comfortable, well located - were there. Service is slow and the staff, apart from Ryan, were quite brusque and did not crack a smile, but apart from that, this was a good place to lay your head at the end of the day.", "title": "very good hotel & location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "minasmith", "date": "July 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133496985}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My boyfriend & I visited Barcelona on the 11th of june for 5 days.
