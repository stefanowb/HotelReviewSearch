Someone I work with recommended this hotel because it was away from the tourists, and it was quiet. Yeah, dind't know it was 2 hours away from where we landed in Punta Cana! The hotel was not the cleanest. Lots of grime in the bathroom. The bathtub leaked, and the if you wanted to take a shower, I was told take it during the day because the sun will make the water warmer!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tazmaniac930", "date": "March 10, 2008", "id": 14162250}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 6, "very good": 3, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 0}, "aka": "Calypso Beach Hotel Dominican Republic/Boca Chica", "slim_ranking": 0.625}
