This vibrant and authentic neighbourhood beats the socks off any other part of this city. Why anyone would choose some chain hotel down on the coast is quite beyond me. If travel is about new experiences then Pelourinho has to be the place to stay - don't even think about the predictable tourist, coach party hotels down on the front. Sure, at night the neighbouirhood does feel edgy, but there is no need to wander too far and the place really is safe. It has a genuine buzz which goes along with some run down residences. Do not expect Disney chic here, it can appear a bit raw but this is its appeal (I would not call it charm). I can see what the government is trying to do with this area and it hope that it works without the place becoming a disinfected, gentrified tourist trap with MacDonalds and Starbucks.
