This stay was for 6 nights. The Islander met all of our needs and is a teriffic bargin. Comfortable beds, clean remodeled rooms with Wi-Fi Internet, continental breakfast, parking space right outside the room, courteous staff, close to Disneyland. We picked a suite with 2 rooms for a small additional fee. Great to have the kids in their own room. Brought our portable DVD player and hooked it up easily to the room TV with RCA jacks. Staff is exceedingly friendly and well informed. We had a low tire with a nail in it Sunday morning just before we were going to make a day trip to San Diego. I figured the whole day was shot, but they directed us to a place that was open Sundays, only a couple of miles away. Half hour later the tire was fixed and we were on our way. Next time we go to Disneyland, we will make our reservation early to be sure we can stay at this place.", "title": "Great Value - Highly Recommend", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "Bobcat10", "date": "October 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6014650, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 suites", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "The Islander Inn and Suites was excellent for our stay, clean and comfortable.

It's a full 15 minute walk from Disneyland if you have kids in tow; there are 3 signals to get through. It's clean and attractive--nothing fancy. We stayed for four nights. Morning, afternoon, and evening -- I always saw two or more parking spaces available. The parking is free. The pool is average sized with shaded areas and lounge chairs; I've been to 3 star hotels with smaller pools. The pool offers privacy, and is just a bit on the cool side. The staff was pleasant. There were plenty of towels. The complementary breakfast is great in a pinch: apples, OJ, coffee and danish. There's a soda machine and ice machine onsite. We stayed in a family suite with two rooms. Each room had a TV that got a few local channels and HBO. The bathroom was clean and average-sized. There was plenty of closet and drawer space. A microwave, refrigerator, and coffee machine were in the room. We were able to come back to the room each day at noon for our young one to take a nap alone in a quiet room. The housecleaner was even kind enough to work around our schedule. The walls are a bit thin, but this is a pretty laid-back and quiet hotel.
