The resort is located a few hundred feet above Lake Geneva creating a magnificent vista for sunrises. The grounds and gardens are grand and well tended. The service and dinning was respectable and professional. The hotel seemed a bit empty but this might have something to do with its high end prices during a global recession. If one cycles there are many day by day tour options to choose from in exploring the local mountains and villages.

The Royal was celebrating their 100 birthday. I am sure that this hotel was quite spectacular when it was younger. However, the rooms are very old and haven't really been refurbished. The service was good by European standard but by Asian standard quite average. Their buffet room essentially served the same food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Evian over the Christmas/NY break is very quiet so most restaurants were not open and as a result we ate in the Buffet room alot because it was the cheapest of the restaurants at the Royal. The hotel is very overpriced for what you get.

On top of that, our experience was terrible as both my husband and I both got food poisoning on the second night after eating the hotel's food exclusively.

We were with our 5 month old baby who I could not breastfeed anymore because of my ilness, when I finally did try to feed him, my baby threw up as well.

Last of all, we were on a voucher that allowed us to stay for 1/2 price. They made point a couple of times about us being there on a \"coupon\" which appeared to give them some excuse for poorer service. I get it that we didn't pay full price and that the hotel would like cater to the full fare guests first but to make it a point throughout our stay was very unprofessional and strange - especially for a hotel of that caliber. However, even if we did pay full price I am not sure if the service was much better. For example, there was no staff working the exterior area on a beautiful sunny day.
