Tucked away on a leafy little side street right on the edge of the Harvard campus, this wonderful bed & breakfast is the best of both worlds--strolling distance to everything in the heart of Cambridge, yet quiet, home-like and welcoming. I stayed in a spotless room with a queen-sized bed and a private bathroom, flat-screen tv, free wi-fi--this is an older building, but has been beautifully updated and renovated without sacrificing the details that give a house some character. Breakfast is varied and plentiful--a serve-yourself assortment ranging from cereal to eggs, organic milk and yogurt to fresh pastries, cheeses, and fruits. Really excellent coffee, too. Irving House also has a varied collection of read-it-and-take-it books--another of the gently quirky but endearing qualities that make this place so special.", "title": "Like staying at the home of a good friend", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "kctraveler21", "date": "August 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116302068}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed at this B&B for a three-day business trip.

Nice, cozy, homey and in very close proximity to Harvard University. The room on the third floor (305) was rather small but I did not feel claustrophobic at all. It had 3 nice, large windows, a desk, private bath, and even books to read (which you could even bring home, if you like). The bed was also comfy. Since I came here to visit some old friends, fellow Harvard alumni, I was only at Irving House during night time. I would have loved to just sit and relax at the nice, homey living room on the first floor, or sit on the porch while drinking tea, or read a book, or write something, as the atmosphere was so nice.
