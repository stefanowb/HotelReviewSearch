The hotel is right off a main highway in the northern part of the city, but since Fairbanks isn't that large, it's still easy to drive to any place you'd like to go. The hotel is fairly new and everything is well maintained. The breakfast offerings vary each day with different types of eggs and meat offered. Our room was one of the accessible ones and it was spacious; the tub had five different safety bars and my mom felt very safe there. The room was quiet and restful, the beds and pillows most comfortable! The desk had multiple plugs that were easy to reach that allowed us to keep our electronics charged. The free wifi was very reliable. The room also had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker--all of which came in handy. There was a large shopping center across the highway that contained Walmart (which had a food department) and restaurants. There were two sets of washers and dryers (a dollar for each, plus a dollar to buy the soap from the front desk.) I would definitely stay there again.", "title": "Comfortable, stress free.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kelpster", "date": "April 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 60132263}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Comfy new construction, kind staff", "text": "I often travel to Fairbanks on business and this was my first stay at the new Hampton Inn.
