It was also a plus that the girls could be put to bed and our son could come into our room to spend the evening with us, while knowing that his girls were safe, just through the door. The rooms were clean and well appointed, the beds comfortable. All the staff we had contact with were very friendly. Our oldest granddaughter had her 11th birthday while we were staying and all staff wished her happy birthday and enquired after her day. Breakfast was amazing, a huge selection - the girls loved the pancake making machine. We also enjoyed an evening meal in the dinning room and two evenings ordered room service. The pool and spa were also a big hit for us. Our son is a platinum card member and will no doubt be using the Holiday Inn chain again.
