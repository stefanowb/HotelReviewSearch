The building is was built in the 15th century and it has very impressive public areas. The hotel rooms themselves very greatly in size and features. While we had a modest double room, our traveling companions had a triple room with vaulted ceiling and frescos on the walls. The location of the hotel is excellent for visiting the Vatican and Rome. Being so close to the Vatican did have a disadvantage however, the streets around the hotel are closed to vehicular traffic for the Wednesday general audience of the Pope. Of course, that is the day we arrived and had to tote our luggage for two blocks. If you appreciate historical buildings this hotel is right for you. If you prefer all the modern convenience of 4 or 5 star hotel, this may not be the place for you. The hotel has only one small (4 persons max) elevator that did break down while we were staying there. They had it back in service the next day but we did count 96 steps to our floor. Also the air conditioning is very poor running intermittently and never really cooling the room. The hotel serves a breakfast for 15 Euros which we did not try. There are several cafes nearby that you can get coffee and breakfast foods. We particularly enjoyed the Gran Caffe Borgo on Borgo Pio.

There are not many interesting restaurants or cafes or even bars nearby. The A/C was not strong enough to keep it very comfortable in the room as many other June travelers noted. They also told us they only turn the A/C on 13:00-16:00 and 22:00-02:00, which made it tough when we returned to the room at 18:00 after visiting the Vatican and having dinner with nothing else interesting to do in the area to find the room still sweltering. The room was huge (we had a triple) as was the bathroom though the shower itself smaller but not bad for European standards. The building is a 15th century monastery with tons of character and with that comes some of the musty smells, lots of stairs, and other issues of such an old building.
