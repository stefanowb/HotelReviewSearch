Quite literally a stunning vista every which way you turned from all the hotel rooms and public terraces overlooking the Caldera. Away from the main hub of Thira, the hotel is still near enough to walk there with gorgeous tavernas and cafes en route to stop off at to enjoy the view with a bottle of great Santorini wine. What has to be mentioned though is the truly unbeatable service - the staff knock the spots off most of the worlds best hotels despite being a small hotel with only 16 rooms. They were discreet yet always nearby if you ever needed anything, a cold drink or just your sun lounger moving a few inches. This hotel is Greece's best kept secret and I cannot recommend it enough. You are treated like a princess from the minute you arrive till they wave you off to the airport. Forget the old days of simply Greece, this is simply luxurious with fine wines and fine dining food that puts most London restaurants to shame.

Eventhough the hotel was half occupied but I hardly see anyone which made it so peaceful and calm. Secondly the staff is very attentive and friendly. They will make sure that you have everything you need. Last but not least, the music that they play around the hotel and pool area is excellent, very chill out, very relaxing.

As busy as he was, he took time to stop and inquire as to our needs, and in the evening he was interested to hear about our day time adventures. He was quick to smile, and would offer suggestions of places to visit, or where to stop for a light snack.

We ate at the hotel one night and commented to Achilleas the next day how much we enjoyed the Greek music and wanted to purchase the CD.

This was truly special - for him to take the time to burn a CD for us certainly shows the level of commitment that he has to his guests!

Overall I'm glad we stayed there, but if we came back we would stay in Oiai as there was a little more choice of places to walk to, eat at, and soak up the atmosphere. The hotel was beautiful, the pool was immaculate and the service flawless. The owners were really helpful in recommending places to eat and knowledgeable about the area. On the downside though, the beds are rock hard. Very uncomfortable as they had absolutely no give to them. The owner said that they were orthorpedic mattresses and good for your back to be hard. That only applies if you're sleeping on your back, not your side as most people do. My husband is a chiropractor b.t.w! The other thing that I didn't see anyone comment on in the other reviews is that the food really [---]. They do not serve a lick of Greek food in the restaurant. Not even a Greek salad for lunch. We had just come from Tuscany, and didn't feel like eating pseudo Italian food cooked by a Greek chef. But everything was very expensive and what we did try was mediocre at best, although the service and ambience at the restaurant was nice. We tried having lunch by the pool and ordered burgers medium rare, thinking you can't go wrong with that. But what we got was 2 dried up patties approx 1/4 inch thick in a bun with lettuce and tomato. It meant that we had to leave the hotel for lunch and dinner which was inconveneint with a small child.
