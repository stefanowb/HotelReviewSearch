We arrived earlier than check in time and they had our room ready for us. We were handed an envelope, which included our itinerary during our stay. This included our spa and dinner reservations. Eric took us to our beautiful bungalow in the 'golf' cart and explained the features of the gorgeous room. The Coliseum Grill's and Andrea's service and food was outstanding. Mom and I walked around the pristine property all the while looking out to the blue Pacific. We also took the complimentary coach to nearby Fashion Island, which leaves the resort at the top of the hour. This complimentary coach also picks up from Fashion Island every half hour...extremely convenient and impressive, I thought. The rooms are quiet. The bath amenities are of high quality. You can leave your shampoos and lotions at home. The night before our departure, hospitality service called our room asking if we needed any assistance and they were able to print out our boarding pass and leave it at our door the next morning. Mom didn't want to leave, but we had to via cab, which picked us up right at the steps of our bungalow. The attention to detail was not lost by the service, building and landscaping architects.

It proved difficult to find such a place at least if you don\u2019t want to pay exorbitant prices, so we were lucky enough to come across the Pelican Hill. Of course it isn\u2019t a bargain but you get value for money there. The hotel doesn\u2019t lie on the beach but it\u2019s situated in the hills above the Crystal Cove State Park. Nonetheless, you have expansive views of the Pacific Ocean and there is a coach service from resort lobby to Crystal Cove where you get a chair and umbrella set up from the Beachcomber attendants. The grounds of Pelican Hill are vast und pristine. As the hotel didn\u2019t accommodate three persons in a smaller room we opted for the Garden King Suite which is very impressive. There are two large rooms with two spacious bathrooms and a large terrace (with a not so spectacular view on the Coliseum Grill\u2019s front entrance) This suite offers all the luxury you can think of, it\u2019s probably one of the most beautiful accommodations we ever had and we widely travelled! We used neither the spa/fitness room nor the golf course and are therefore unable to comment on these facilities. We twice had breakfast at the Coliseum Grill which was okay but nothing special. Personally, I don\u2019t like the d\u00e9cor of this restaurant, it\u2019s a bit bland but that\u2019s a matter of taste. Once we had dinner at Andrea, the resort\u2019s upscale restaurant, and considered the evening as a good experience (we liked the atmosphere and the food). One comment to the resort\u2019s architecture \u2026 All is very Italian, almost a bit too much so it\u2019s overkill but maybe I feel this way because I come from a country bordering Italy. Never mind, a lot of things are nice to look at, e.g. the circular swimming pool, very impressive! As far as staff is concerned, generally speaking we were satisfied with the service although it wasn\u2019t flawless. Several times, employees weren\u2019t attentive enough, but it wasn\u2019t too bad.

I stayed in a two bedroom villa that was bigger than my house! The place is grand, but not in a cheesey Las Vegas way, quality construction, furniture, bedding, etc. The service is first-rate, yet casual. I think our butler would have given us the shirt off his back if we asked. Did I mention, whenever you want to go to the beach, golf course, or restaurant, you just call you butler and he is there within minutes to drive you. Also, no extra cost to park, internet, use of spa or fitness facilities which was nice for a change.
