The pool is clean and unheated but in 40 degrees of heat the water certainly isn't cold. There is a deep end which is a change from the norm but the shallow end is safe for children. The food served at the pool bar was limited but tasty and good value. The rooms are small and I do mean small. However they are spotlessly clean. They are cleaned with fresh linen and towels every day. Maria the cleaner doesn't stop. Also you are supplied with loads of toilet rolls, hand soap, washing up liquid and a clean tea towel every day.

A couple of minutes from the local shop and bakery or alternatively about a ten minute walk to the larger co-op which will give you a lift back to you hotel with your shopping if you ask. Again a couple of minutes walk to the beach and tavernas. The sea is gorgeous but the volcanic beach is black and gets very very hot. You will need shoes to walk on the sand/grit! Loads of places to eat along the front. From the end by the mountain please try the very small italian. Fresh food cooked as you arrive. It is delicious. Further along is a pizza restaurant which again is brilliant. Fish restaurant wasn't great. On the main street which runs just behind the beach try Cyclades (the only place we got vegetables) and Scirocco. Both excellent food. Local bus to Thira is 2 euros and ends in Perissa so you can't get lost. Change at Thira for Oia, Kamari etc..

Tea towels are provided along with washing up liquid and sponge and also handwash in the bathroom ,which smells lovely .The pool area is perfect with good quality beds with foam cushions (not what you would expect from a 2 star) ,pool was cleaned every morning by Georgios before he went to work at his main job .Bar area serves hot and cold drinks and light meals ,the Greek salad using Georgios home grown tomatoes and cucumber was the best i tasted in all Santorini !!! the frappe coffees are lovely too.I think the fact that this hotel is run by a lovely Greek family only adds to the experience ,make time to talk to Georgios ,Anna and Jacob who like nothing more than having a chat over a glass of Georgios special wine on a night time.If you are lucky enough to sample one of there Greek nights round the pool its money well spent ,it costs 10 euros per person for unlimited barbequed meats ,salads ,potatoes .. the list goes on ,and also live Greek bouzouki music ,well worth the money i would even go as far as to say they need to charge a little more .Room 4 is a lovely triple family room on the ground floor ,overlooking the pool with a nice little terrace of your own .Thanks again Georgios ,Anna & Jacob for welcoming us into your lovely hotel ,and Anna hope you are practising those Mojitos hahhaha ,hope to see you again .xx", "title": "Fabulous phevos", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "torsal", "date": "June 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131205736}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I can only say that anything you have read about this place which was negative, either through this site or any other is complete rubbish.
