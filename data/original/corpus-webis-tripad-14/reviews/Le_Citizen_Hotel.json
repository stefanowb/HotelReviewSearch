The entire building is amazingly narrow, but the space is very well appointed. The hotel goes above and beyond many others and anticipates guests needs. There are even ear plugs in the room if one is bothered by the sounds outside at night! The staff are excellent and they are helpful and informative.

The breakfast was good, with a big window for when we could come down and remarkably friendly service. Our room - one of their smallest - was certainly small, but we knew that going in and got along just fine. We also really appreciated the snacks and drinks, which they refill in your room every day (things like a bottle of beer, cans of soda, a bottle of ice tea, a granola bar, etc.) and don't charge you for separately - though those obviously factor into the overall cost, it was nice not to feel nickled and dimed.
