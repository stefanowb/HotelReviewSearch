{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 183, "name": "Hotel Ristorante Giardinetto", "reviews": [{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great view, poor service , average food", "text": "We have stayed for 4 nights at Giardinetto and we've made the booking through 'Neckermann'. Excellent reviews about the room quality in this hotel refer most probably to 'superior rooms'. The same applies to all pictures you see on the internet about the room example in this hotel - it is about the 'superior' room. First 2 nights we have stayed in a 'standard' room, which I can qualify at max 2 stars. We had to change it and the whole situation has spoiled our first days there and our mood. So, make sure that you book a 'superior' room and not a 'standard' one, because the difference between them is huge. Overall speaking and comparing with other locations, 'great value for the money' IS NOT applicable for this hotel, because the rooms are quite expensive for the comfort it provides. We were also badly impressed about the fact that we've been the only young-middle age couple in the breakfast room, the rest being seniors and retired people. The quality of the breakfast was poor and especially the cleaning of the place/dishes was not so good. The last but not the least , the lady at the reception desk, a young person having black glasses , without badge and having a stiff behavior, was one of the most unfriendly person we've met during our travel around the world in the past years. She was heavily simulating politeness and 'professionalism' but was being harsh and unfriendly in reality.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 5, 2005", "id": 3993542}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "The hotel restaurant is very well appreciated in all travel guides. We had there our dinner, during the first evening but we were not impressed at all, except the wine, that was ok. If you want a 'cuisine' like restaurant , go to the village, where the restaurant \"Vecchio Forno' is located. You are going to see there what an excellent Italian cuisine is and what professional service means. We had our dinner there for all 3 remaining evenings and took advantage with great pleasure of all recommendations which the brunette lady owning the restaurant gracefully made to us each evening.", "title": "charming owner/wonderful staff", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "npglf", "date": "October 2, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3984225}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "Had a delightful stay, everyone so friendly.
