Rita the cheerful proprietor of the Vondel View Bed and Breakfast will lend you her limitless insights, advice on what to do during your visit and an umbrella too. The Vondel View B&B is immaculate and furnished in contemporary style furnishings blended perfectly with traditional touches of old world Dutch hospitality and grace. Rita will arrange your transportation to and from the airport and see you off with a smile every day. Her breakfasts are fabulously prepared and cheerfully delivered each morning (sometimes accompanied by Jongen her equally friendly cat) to your room. Vondel View B&B is located on a quiet side street within quick reach of the tram line, restaurants and shops on Overtoom in one direction and the grand Vondel Park the other. Either way you turn from 14 Gerard Brandstraat you are a short walk from Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and classic canal architecture of old Amsterdam. We must admit however, all of this would have been lost to us when searching in cyber space for accommodations in a distant country had it not been for Rita\u2019s reassuring, kind, and thoughtful correspondence. It left us with no doubt, and now with the experience, that Vondel View B&B is the best B&B in the Netherlands period.

We were really imprest with how the house and the rooms are well maintained. Breakfast was excellent and most of all came with special personal care that Rita provided. The location couldn't be better where all attractions are within walking distance. I am highly recommending this wonderful establishment that beats any 5 stars hotel in my opinion.
