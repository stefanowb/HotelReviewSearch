The owner, Angelike and her staff go out of their way to make your visit as pleasant as it can be. The hotel is spotless and full of homely touches. The breakfast is organic and you can tell. Your breakfast is by appointment so your eggs arrive freshly cooked. On leaving I asked for a flask of hot water to make coffee. I got coffee. I cannot praise this hotel enough. Ask for a riverside view, when you reserve your room.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Dexter48507", "date": "June 6, 2006", "id": 5314560}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Mettlach"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 2, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 5}, "slim_ranking": 0.25}
