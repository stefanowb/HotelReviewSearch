This was very convenient because the Marta makes stops throughout the city, which allowed us to sight see in different areas without having to drive.

He was especially helpful. We had breakfast in the dining room each morning. Words can't describe the quality of the food. Everything is locally grown and extremely fresh. The staff took the time to remember our likes and dislikes from the day before. Just a nice, friendly touch not found in many hotels.
