The location is just gorgeous, as it overlooks where the Russian River intersects the Pacific Ocean. Although the cabins are very cozy, they are a little basic and run down. We stayed in cabin #2 which conveniently had a parking spot right next to it. Inside the cabin was one king sized bed, an oversized leather chair, a leather love seat and a fireplace all situated in front of two huge windows so you can take in the great views. The bed was unbelievably comfortable and I had a great night's sleep. The shades that cover the windows are the old vinyl roll up ones and they were actually a little tricky to use. They should be changed because they really cheapen the rooms, as does the dark brown carpet that makes the rooms look dingy. My biggest disappointment was with the bathroom which seemed more like a summer camp's bathroom than a $150/night cabin's. The extremely dated formica countertop was separating from the wall and there was water damage on the trim along the wall. The counter is also very low, abnormally low. There is only a shower, not a bath tub and anyone taller than 6 feet would be hard pressed to fit in it since the ceiling is low and slants down toward the wall as well. The bathroom is equipped with a small mini fridge, hairdryer, and coffee maker with complimentary tea. The toiletries are Bath & Body Works ones which were very nice. Since our group stayed in multiple cabins, we got to peak into the other ones and cabin #2 actually seemed larger than the others. Our cabin had more floor space which meant an air mattress could comfortably fit on the ground in case you need to sleep more people, which we did. Something of note is that River's End is meant to be secluded so there is no phone in the room, no wi-fi, no TV, and no cell phone service, so plan accordingly because this makes getting directions, planning meals, etc impossible. In summary, the location is above average but the accommodations themselves are just average.

Loud conversations and frequent walking across the wood-slatted patio area above the room by late-dining restaurant patrons was very annoying. After the restaurant closed, employees made even more noise, as they completed their work by what sounded like dropping heavy objects on the floor and lumbering up and down the stairs within the two-level storage and preparation area. The noise finally stopped at 11:30 p.m. It was in the bathroom, however, where the greatest deficiencies were evident. Dust/dirt was caked everywhere along the edges of the bathroom vanities where the natural wood paneling meets the wood edging just above the tiled backsplash. The tops of all bathroom switchplates looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in years, one of the vanity lights was burned out, and cobwebs were attached to portions of the wood paneling. The bath towels were worn (one was frayed at the edges) and the closet area contained no clothes hangers. The most disturbing problem, however, and a real safety concern, was the shower. Water temperature fluctuated wildly from warm to icy cold to scalding hot --- instantaneously. Showering was, essentially, impossible. So severe was the evening showering experience, that my traveling companion chose to forego a morning shower.
