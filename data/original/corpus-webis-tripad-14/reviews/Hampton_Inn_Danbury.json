The bed is comfy and the duvet covers are changed after each guest assuring cleanliness. Clean and well maintained all around no complaints at all. Pool was larger than expected after seeing the pictures online although not big it's good. Hot tub was clean and hot, the front desk staff was polite for the most part and accommodating even supplying forgotten items such as toothbrush, razor, shower cap. There's always complimentary apples and fresh brewed coffee, choice of teas, real cream etc. The breakfast was quite good the first day, waffles, breads, muffins, eggs, sausage patties, yogurt, fresh fruit salad, bananas etc. The next day there was ham circles not as good and sausage links ditto, but still good free breakfast and very good coffee. The restaurants are indeed within walking distance, Friendly's in the parking lot and Chili's, walk to Walmart, Marshall's, liquor store, Dunkin Donut, Taco Bell. We were surprised that on Sunday night we couldn't find a beer in the state of Connecticut no alcohol sold, not sure about the laws but check on that if you find yourself without wine etc. Plenty of parking in the back also so don't limit yourself to the front, the handicapped parking is around back and real close to lobby.
