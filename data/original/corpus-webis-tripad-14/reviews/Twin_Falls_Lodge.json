Our room was very clean and appeared that we may have been some of the first people who had stayed in it. The park has many activities throughout the year and we were there for the Annual Lumberjackin\u2019 Bluegrassin\u2019 Jamboree. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The only con that we could find was the restaurant in the lodge. It is the only restaurant around for the lodge guests unless they want to drive a considerable distance and it was always busy. The food was decent and the wait staff friendly but the service was chaotic. They were turning people away because there were no available tables but there was no organization to bus the tables and speed the serving process along. One night the restaurant was hosting a group for a birthday party that took up a good quarter of the restaurant. A banquet room for groups like that would be more efficient. Note- If your cell phone provider is Verizon, expect not to have service at the lodge.", "title": "Very nice lodge but restaurant needs help", "user": "Steeler_Pens_fan", "date": "November 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 186173646}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I completed a three night stay in one of the cabins, while attending a Conference.

First of all, our reservation (which was made well in advance), was for a three bedroom cabin. Upon check-in, we were assigned a two bedroom cabin. Nobody at check in seemed to consider this an issue. I even provided a copy of the e-mail confirmation. The clerk made a copy of it? There was no attempt to try to find another cabin. To here credit, she did supply us with coffee, soap, shampoo, towels, etc., as our cabin had none of these items. When we went to the cabin, it had not been cleaned. Towels on floor, toilet not flushed, trash in cans. The cabin smelled of must. Exterior structures (decks, porches) are of extremely poor quality. We tried to change to the lodge, but no rooms were available. We eventually traded cabins with another group to get a four bedroom cabin. This cabin was better. However, there were some glaring deficiencies in the cabin. At least one location in one of the bedrooms was missing a receptacle cover, the TV is very outdated and reception was poor. The only things that can improve these cabins is to demo, and start over. Very old, outdated, and not taken care of! All in all, I find it embarrassing to Twin Falls and the State of WV", "title": "Lodge was comfortable, Cabin was not", "user": "Don W", "date": "September 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 177459503}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "While attending a funeral, because of our large family, we booked both a lodge room and a cabin. The lodge room was very comfortable, overlooked a pretty courtyard, and was clean and well-appointed for the money. The two bedroom cabin, on the other hand, was very dirty. My mother actually purchased bathroom cleaner and cleaned the shower prior to using it and my children's socks were black after being there only an hour. The windows had newspaper over the wooden sash and the glass was filthy. We stayed in the large, three bedroom cabin two years ago, and it was much nicer and was very clean. I would give it a try again, but would shy away from the two bedroom cabins.

While attending a funeral choices were very limited so we decided to give it a try and my entire family (a lot of us) stayed here... Staff, food, pricing were all excellent. My family loved the serenity of the area and peacefulness it provided. Rooms in the new lodge were very comfortable everything you need is right there. You could spend a wonderful vacation at this lodge and not even leave the grounds -- abundant wild life, pioneer farm to explore... plenty of activities - outdoor pool, indoor pool, dinning, room service etc etc the list goes on. It is a little off the beaten path about 45 min off of 77 north however it is so worth the visit. Abundance of hiking trails We just loved it!
