There are no coffee pots in the room, but complimentary beverages are brought to your room each morning at your specified time. To me, that is much more enjoyable and definitely more sanitary than the cups and pots that are never cleaned in other hotels. The one thing I would suggest is to begin a renovation of the appearance of the hotel. Walking down the hall to our room, the doors were badly marked up and dirty looking. It just looked very worn. Our room was very clean, but was beginning to show a lot of wear. The tub had been \"patched\" where the porcelain had worn off and the caulking was beginning to look bad. Even the telephone looked very old and discolored. This is a great hotel in a great area. It is at the Epicenter and there are lots of excellent restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel.

A tip: sign up for the Omni Select Rewards program -- they don't require much personal information and member benefits include free in-room wifi at Omni hotels and complimentary coffee/juice delivered to your door in the morning. Both are nice perks (especially the room-delivered coffee - you specify the time & they just drop it off outside your door with a friendly knock). I expected a modern flat screen given the level of quality throughout the rest of the hotel, but the room was equipped with a perfectly functional (yet clunky) 27\" CRT. Frankly, it was more surprising than anything else. Another tip: The number 5 Sprinter bus from the Charlotte Airport (CLT) will take you directly into downtown and drop you off literally in front of the Omni Hotel in the event that you would like to avoid a car rental. It is a short ride and only makes a few stops on the way. It was perfect for us.
