The room was just okay but my husband found a hair (not his) in the bed...ugh. The worst part: I was flabbergasted to find they charged me a $200 fine for smoking!!! It was a no smoking hotel where our room stunk of cigarettes and then they try to charge me for smoking? I don't smoke, my husband doesn't smoke. After 7 (seven!!) calls trying to get a manager that could help me, he said they would show me proof of smoking. Of course they couldn't show proof because we DIDN'T SMOKE!
