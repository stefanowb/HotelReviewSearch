It was very clean, modern and very tastefully decorated. The top 4 reasons that anyone going to Montreal should consider staying here are 1) The location is great! It's right there in the Latin Quarter on the rue St. Denis, near great restaurants, shopping and the Metro. Rue St. Denis runs by the university and is brimming with life. 2) Albert, who owns the hotel with his brother, is warm, generous and made us feel very welcome. Just a genuine, sincere human being. 3) The bed and linens were so comfortable, it was hard to get up in the morning. That is saying a lot as we are typically early risers. Which leads to the last point. 4) The incredible rainfall showerhead combined with above-average water pressure (apparently, a major consideration when the hotel was being renovated) made it just that much easier to drag ourselves out of bed. By the time we finished our showers, we were energized enough to run a marathon! Seriously, we are now trying to figure out how to recreate that shower at home.
