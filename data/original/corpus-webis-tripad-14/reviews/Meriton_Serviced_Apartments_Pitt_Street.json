The units are very spacious with TV & ensuite in the main bedroom, TV- lounge-dining area as well as a washing machine & dryer beside the full kitchen. We had a small problem of a leaking dishwasher & contacted reception & within 5 minutes the maintenence man was there to fix the problem. Excellent location with Woolworths just around the corner for all your food supplies. We caught the airtrain from the airport to Town Hall Station and the Hotel is just around the corner, no more than 150m to walk. We had 4 adults staying & it never felt crowded. It's a real bonus to be able to do your washing in the comfort of your own unit and not have to worry about coins or the dramas of a laundromat.The units were a little noisier than I thought they'd be even with the windows & doors all closed up and with the air conditioner on you could still hear sirens going all night, the second night didn't seem as bad. The other small issue was with the air con, it is set to only run 4hrs at a time, so who ever got up to the bathroom first in the night had to turn it back on again. But both these issues were minimal compared to the great value & service at the Hotel. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay & would gladly return.", "title": "Sensational Great Value Hotel in a convenient location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "OutbackAussie", "date": "March 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 58685774}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010", "text": "I stayed here with my adult daughter for 3 days.

Only downside was cleaning - we realise this was a serviced apartment and not subject to the full cleaning expected in a hotel but after 4 days we had to ask for the floor to be vacuumed.
