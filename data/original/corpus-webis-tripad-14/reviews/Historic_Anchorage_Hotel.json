I can't say enough about the staff at the hotel.

The hotel was very clean and very centrally located for all of our needs. The weekend market is just steps away and the train depot is very nearby. You can walk to so many locations which makes it alot easier due to difficult car parking situations. The only negatives that I found are the rooms are not air conditioned but there is a fan and I would recommend that you request a room away from the main street due to being very noisy all hours of the day and night.
