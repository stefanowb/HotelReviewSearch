It's on the River Ilen. There is an old disused railway bridge beside the hotel that holds the beer garden/outdoor smoking area. I looked over the bridge on a sunny Sunday and could see loads of salmon swimming underneath. The hotel itself is lovely. The atmosphere is very relaxed. The rooms are old style, with lock and key. We had a comfortable bed and the decor was very nice. We attended a family wedding in the hotel. The meal was amazing. The staff couldn't be nicer. We had a wonderful breakfast on the morning of our departure. The lady in reception was incredibly friendly. She really was interested in us and asked us loads about where we were from etc. I am so impressed with the place that we are going to go back very very soon.

Recently refurbished, this small town hotel has now a modern feel in the lounge, a good bar (with sofas- great for smallies!), lovely restaurant (huge portions though), very friendly staff from reception to restaurant. Breakfast is very well stacked for continental (fresh croissants, etc), and huge selection of cooked breakfast as well...you won't go hungry in this hotel! The best part for us was the room - best we've ever stayed in for our kids (4 and 1 years). Room 23 was a huge room with a partition wall in the middle, so one room had a huge double bed, cupboard, coffee facilities and TV for parents, and the other part of the room had a single bed, cot, another press and TV for the kids. This meant they could sleep while we could still read or watch TV after 8pm! Heaven for parents of young kids everywhere! Crisp white linen and fluffy towel, while it is not a very luxurious hotel, the right room IS a luxury for parents with small kids.. located right in town with lovery coffee places (Riverside Cafe), and Voyage Restaurant, both lovely food AND very child friendly (restaurant starts serving dinners at 5.30pm!). The only thing I would say is that on a Wedding week end, the hotel could probably get a bit noisy...but it is down to the guests, not the hotel.
