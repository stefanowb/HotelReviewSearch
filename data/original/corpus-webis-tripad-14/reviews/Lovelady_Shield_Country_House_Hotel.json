What comes across here is how well they have chosen their staff and most of all how much they genuinely want to make you as comfortable and as welcome as possible. It is a small hotel. Staying here is a lovely mix of infomality, as in not having to dress up too much for dinner and formality, for example guests waiting in a separate area with a drink and canopes, not rushing, however hungry, and savouring the whole pre dinner experience, waiting to be called so that their food arrives perfectly cooked without wait in the dining area. Peter brings his skills and experience of a lifetime to the fore in this place and of course his passion for food and drink is obvious. The wine menu was just amazing. The house champagne is better than most places I have ever been. Our advice would be , if you have any problems at all, just ask and they will sort it out for you. Also, when following the hotel directions, remember to drive through every town they say, before moving on to the next instruction. Would suggest to the hotel that they get some updated leaflets from around the area on local walks/walks in The Lakes with maps as they are a little out of date and nothing we could easily take away.

This is a true elegant, small country house, with opulent rooms and wood-panelled bar etc. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a superior room, which probably helped, but we like the hotel - and its gorgeous setting - so much that I'm sure any room would have been fine. As we had our small baby with us we understandably weren't allowed to eat in the restaurant so I can't comment on that, but we were allowed to have him in the bar with us in the early evening, and could have a sandwich there. The boardgames in the library were also a great touch. The staff were also great, especially the breakfast staff (and we loved the actual breakfast, too). We will definitely be back. The only possible criticism we could make would be that there should probably be more food options than the taster menu.

Hotel cozy and secluded. Nice to get a way for a quiet get away. I would not recomend it for a romantic night if you are younger than 60. I am 40 and a young 40 and thought the rooms were old looking, room 14 had damp on the walls and in the tiny bathroom a tiny bath and a shower that came out as a fast trickle at best. Temperatures were hot and cold and had damp around the bath. Central heating was so noisy when on you could not sleep. Road to the hotel was full of deep pot holes. Food was very nice indeed but what you would expect for \u00a350 a head. Hotel grounds are beautiful and this was the high light. If you are over 60 you will love the hotel as its OLD. Staff are very good but felt there were not enough staff as we had the one member greeting us, taking orders, pottering, running the bar. I really could not say that these rooms were in anyway worth what they are charging and unless you are 60 or over please do not bother. Might explain why there not booked up for the next 2 months. Even on a groupon deal we ended up spending over \u00a3200 for a one night stay with a meal. Ps the fire was great if they could leave a log to light it.

The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The wine list was very extensive so of course we had to sample a couple of bottles to compliment the food.
