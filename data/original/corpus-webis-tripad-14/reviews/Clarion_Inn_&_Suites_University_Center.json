I can only say that this is the worst hotel/motel that we have ever stayed at. We had to pack our things in the middle of the night and find another room at the Hilton Garden Inn and Suites. We were booked for 2 nights and only stayed 1. The rooms were filthy. Lights didn't work, phone didn't work, toilet ran for at least one half hour after flushing. However, we decided to stay since we were only there for 2 nights. The final straw was Friday night, the night before we were supposed to be leaving for our drive back to Pittsburgh the next morning. There was a huge party in the parking lot outside our door. I'm talking a ton of people. Driving in and out of the parking lot with their souped up basses blaring!! Apparently, they frequent the nightclub Benji's at this motel. When my husband went down to complain at the front desk, he was told that there was nothing they could do. He asked for a refund which was given but not gladly, and their reply was they make 1500.00 on a Friday night which was nothing compared to our 75.00. My husband told them that they should warn travelers that they will not get any rest here and you won't, at least on the weekends.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 4, 2005", "id": 2974403}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled solo", "text": "This is a former Days Inn.
