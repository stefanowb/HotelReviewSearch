However, we are quite reluctant to praise this magical place as we really want to keep it as our 'secret find'. This wouldn't be fair on Aziz and his wonderful staff, who really deserve a huge amount of praise. Our 5 night break turned into 14 nights due to the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud and we still didn't want to leave at the end of our extended trip. We felt the luckiest people on earth to have been stranded in a place like this and Aziz made what could have been a nightmare for us into a dream!
