The outdoor pool and recreation area was spacious, but it was too cold to use. There were both hot/cold breakfast and hospitality in the evening. The Hospitality time in the evening almost could be used for dinner as it contained a potato bar and chicken fingers. The rooms were clean and the internet access worked great.

The hotel accepts dogs for an extra $100 fee. The hotel is very close to two malls, countless restuarants and Starbucks, and about 10 minutes from downtown using local roads or the highway. Also, there is an Aveda salon and spa across the street, and the hotel offers grocery service. They have a well-managed hot and cold breakfast --- with clean buffet stations and bus service. The wifi is fast and logon is easy and there is no shortage of outlets to charge your iPhone or run your laptop. Since this is a business traveler's hotel, kids and non-purposeful guests are sparse, allowing real work to happen --- my business partners and I were VERY glad for this and sincerely thank the staff for operating this Excellent facility free of non-sense. If you are discerning travelers who usually stays at pricier hotels for their service and quality you won't be disappointed here.
