This will save you in the long run, we got off at Zattere which was a 4 minute walk to the hotel (excellent). Hotel very friendly on arrival, room spacious and clean, shower brilliant 5 heads,1 on top and 4 down the sides, although toiletries sparse, no small bottles but hair and shower gel (together) in container (take your own). Takes about 20 minutes to walk to St Marks and Rialto Bridge. Research restaurants as all seem expensive due to weak pounds. Would highly recommend Dona Onesta in Dorsoduro excellent , friendly and reasonable. Took up the complimentary Muriano trip from the hotel, good trip but can be daunting as the glass is expensive and you are shown around it with the guide, just be honest if you don't want to purchase and then look around Mariano Island.

I have stayed there several times and would never stay anywhere else.
