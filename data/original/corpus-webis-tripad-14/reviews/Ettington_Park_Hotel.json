We booked this hotel for our 1st Wedding Anniversary and it was perfect, we couldn't believe how the staff are genuinly nice and are all so helpful and just nice all the time but not over the top. When we arrived at the hotel we could not beleive our eyes, this hotel is haunted which is one of the reasons we picked it, the hotel had such a nice feeling about it. We had an excutive room which was lovely the best hotel room I have ever stayed in and I use too work for a hotel company so I have been to lots of hotels. The standard rooms are also very nice. Look on a website called hand picked hotel.com and you will see this hotel and realise what I am talking about. The food is wonderful, we had dinner bed & breakfast, the dinner was so nice and the breakfast was wonderful too as you had every single thing to choose from so you would never be stuck on what to eat, the service was out of this world too.
