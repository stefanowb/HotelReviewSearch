This hotel was perfect for our needs. What I look for in a hotel is: cleanliness, comfortable beds; good location; and a clean bathroom. this hotel had all of the above. The location was very good just off the Kenai Spur Rd with a really nice Wal-Mart behind the hotel. We had a room with 2 comfortable queen beds and had plenty of room for 3 large suitcases, a cooler etc. There were plenty of pillows and towels. It had the standard amenities- a refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer etc. The only negative is that it does not have AC which we didn't need but the temperature never got above 65'. It did have a fun which was sufficient. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. The breakfast was an extra plus. There were scrambled eggs & bacon as well as the standard continental breakfast items. We stayed here because we had Choice Hotel Points but I would definitely stay here again when in Kenai even if we didn't have free rewards. The location is perfect for a base.", "title": "A good choice while in Kenai", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bbeerbower", "date": "August 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173514215}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013", "text": "tip: Wal-Mart behind the Quality Inn is a great place to buy souveners", "title": "NO Air Conditioning!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Tyler A", "date": "July 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 168494076}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Eat dinner at Louie's in the Uptown Motel just up the road on Kenai Spur for dinner", "title": "BASIC at best", "user": "Bruce K", "date": "July 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 168357697}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Stop by the Kenai Visitor Center", "title": "Very accommodating!

No air conditioning in this hotel! It is 85 degrees outside and they only provide a fan and a low dangerous window next to a parking lot. When we went into the room the heater was on in July! The pool and spa are nice. The breakfast is huge! Free waffles, cereal, bagels, donuts, scrambled eggs, breakfast sausage, bacon, toast, yogurt, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, hot apple cider, orange juice, apple juice, cranberry juice, and milk! There's also a fitness center and a business center. But I will not stay here again just because of the heat hitting you when you open the door.
