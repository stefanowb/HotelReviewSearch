There was a regular shower/tub with a wooden seat that could fold down. This young lady is in a wheelchair and cannot walk. No way was she to get in that shower. Thank goodness I had the good sense to give her a shower at home the night before. A queen size bed and a pull out sofa bed for 3 of us. That was ok when I made the reservations. Upon getting ready for bed I pulled the sofa bed out to sleep on it and there was no mattress. I ended up folding it back up and sleeping on the couch with my feet hanging over the side.

Next when my daughter took a shower the water would not drain out of the tub. Called the front desk at 10:20 PM. They said they'd send someone up. They call us at 10:40PM that the maintenance guy went home. Told us that they'd send up the front desk person who was going on at 11PM to take a look. At 11:20PM still no front desk guy. Called down to the desk, waited 12 rings..no answer. Tried again at 11:30PM...10 rings no answer. Wife called the external number, one ring, instant pickup. This is great. Guy named Jeremy won't do anything for us...allegedly called the manager...nothing. Two showers this morning - 8\" of water still standing there in the tub.

It was one open room but I did see that they have suites that are two rooms and some even have fire places. All the appliances in the kitchen worked and made our stay very enjoyable since after a long day of driving we were able to go to the Co-Op Grocery across the parking lot and get food to go and cook and or warm up in our room. The room was very clean and there was no noise that could be heard from any other rooms or guests. My husband had stayed at this hotel before and said that wasn't always true. We were on the third floor so this may have made a difference. The only complaint I had was at breakfast on Sunday morning we arrived at approx. 7:30 AM and all the food was demolished by families with numerous children running wild and sticking their fingers in everything.
