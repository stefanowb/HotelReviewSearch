The architectural detail of the old place has been carefully maintained. The bedrooms are actually in little cottages which are linked to the main house by a footpath through the garden. The bedroom in our cottage was fine but the bathroom was just plain weird. It looked like someone tried to create a bathroom in a rock grotto. The shower was in the middle of the room. The sink was set in a pedestal of more rock. The floor was some sort of hardwood planks. It was strange.", "title": "One of the oddest places I've ever stayed", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jbullock47", "date": "April 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 27242659}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "So-so", "text": "Dinner was delicious but the portions were actually too large. By the time the fish course was finished, I was full. But there was still the main course, dessert, and the cheese course to follow. I couldn't make it and had to skip dessert and cheese. The food was very tasty and the price very reasonable for the quality. There was just too much of it. Breakfast was equally bountiful but it was a buffet, so I could control how much went on my plate.", "user": "Dassie&Bunny", "date": "January 7, 2007", "id": 6560628}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "After a long journey from Prince Albert we arrived at the reception which was like a scene from a ghost town.
