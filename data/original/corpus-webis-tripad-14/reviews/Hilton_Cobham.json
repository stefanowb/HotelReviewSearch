When we discovered our error we decided that as it was a leisure break, we would continue with the visit. It turned out to be one of the best mistakes we have ever made. The hotel is superb in all aspects. We were made welcome from the time of our arrival at Reception to the time of our departure. The hotel is within a few miles of Junction 10 of The M4 Motorway, within a reasonable distance of both Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. Hampton Court Palace and Kingston-on-Thames are within approximately ten miles and well worth visiting. The hotel has a large free car park, and is reached after leaving a main road, travelling along a lane into a rural paradise. It is situated in 28 acres of wonderful grounds, much of it left as natural habitat. For the use of guests there are Tennis Courts, a French Boules sand pit, outdoor table tennis, outdoor chess, and an indoor swimming pool situated in the well equipped Living Well Club where the staff are full of enthusiasm. For those of some wealth there are facilities for the landing of a helicopter, although the helicopter area does not to be well used and therefore there is little noise.. There are ample meeting rooms etc for corporate guests. Nature lovers will enjoy the vast array of trees and woodland, combined with the rabbits and wildlife that scamper in the grounds. Our room was well decorated, spotlessly clean and well furnished. Unlike some modern hotels we were delighted there was an array of drawers for storage in our room, although we were told by a member of staff that some recently refurbished rooms in The Cobham Hilton have unfortunately been adapted to the perceived current trend of sheer lunacy currently infecting the Hilton Group in the failure to have any drawer space whatsoever in the rooms. There is of course no reason as to why potential guests should not demand a room with drawer space at the time of booking. The general presentation of the hotel is excellent. There is a well furnished and comfortable lounge, and the restaurant is superb. We found that all of the staff are friendly and highly professional, they bend over backwards to look after guests. Our room cleaner (Room 542) was Tricia an excellent ambassador for The Hilton Group. Her customer service is second to none. We just mentioned places we wished to visit, and within an hour printed literature was to be found in our room. My wife has a strict health diet to which she has to rigidly adhere. Tricia ensured our facilities room tray was compliant to her dietary requirements. She insisted on assisting us with our luggage. Rohit of the Bar Staff had boundless energy and also gave us great assistance in general requirements during our stay. The Restaurant Managers, Mr Bala and his colleague whose name I am unable to recollect regularly checked with guests that all was to their liking. The Hungarian Chef on duty in the restaurant on the mornings of 13th and 14th June 2011, constantly checked the standard, quality, and presentation of the food available. There was a large variety of choice of food at the breakfast buffet, although I did note that for some peculiar reason that unlike other hotels in the Hilton Group, that of the vast array of cerials - Weetabix (a favourite cerial of many people) was not on display. However The Chef will happily provide them if asked. The porridge at breakfast is superb. I have named just a small number of staff, but every member of staff at The Hilton Cobham should receive a pat on the back as their dedication to excellent service is outstanding. I understand the Hotel General Manager is Mr Stephane Weit. He should be highly commended on running such an excellent highly motivated team. For those who wish to indulge in excellence combined with the available solitude of a country experience then The Hilton at Cobham Surrey is the just the place for you. If there is one matter I would hope may be rectified, it is that there are a small number of guest rooms allocated for smoking. Sadly the smoke wafts through the corridors and finds its way into non smoking rooms as happened in our case. As many hotels now insist on non smoking anywhere on the premises, I hope The Hilton at Cobham soon adapts to such a policy. Smoke is proven to be most unhealthy and guests should not be subjected to it and its inhalation. There are 28 acres of grounds outside of the hotel building for smokers to use.", "title": "Hilton Cobham - a Name Synonymous with Excellence", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Frederick32", "date": "June 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 113911017}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011", "text": "On arrival and booking in we were booked in with the wrong name even though I was wearing a clear name badge as part of an Alvis car touring group, also I had signed a form in front of the receptionist in two places handed my credit card in with my name on it, and queried the booking as it was given as 2 nights instead of the 3 we had booked, none of this picked up by the receptionist. not a good start.", "title": "Too many careless mistakes made by staff, better training needed", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Marilynjs", "date": "June 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 113687464}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "There was no lift to the first floor to our room and we needed help with luggage which was given both at the start and end of the stay.", "title": "Just Terrible", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Pathooly", "date": "June 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 112908169}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Relieved after reading some of the comments!", "text": "On the evening of the Gala Dinner we ordered wine for the table but as we had no table plan this was proved difficult to sort out with many others trying to do the same \u2013 not very well organised.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "red118", "date": "June 7, 2011", "id": 111952320}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "When getting drinks prior to the meal only two bar staff for a large party in the main bar so long queues we went to another bar in the dining room where the person in front of us was refused to put his drinks on his room, we were then also refused being told we had no credit.
