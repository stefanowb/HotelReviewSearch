The hotel was right on the Centennial Trail, so we could walk to just about everywhere we went. The staff was very friendly and kept the place spotless. We only had two complaints. First, we felt the staff could have been more accommodating of our request for a room with a balcony, especially since it was the primary reason we selected the property. Unfortunately, they appeared more interested in attracting new guests rather than accommodate existing ones. Second, the rooms could use more comfortable seating. We had one straight-back dining room chair and one swivel desk chair. Okay for a business traveler, but not very comfortable for a week-long home away from home.", "title": "Great location, well maintained and very clean, but...", "user": "Keith D", "date": "August 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117476706}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "It was definitely one of the better \"chain\" hotels we have stayed at, but left us longing for the \"vacation resort\" feel some of the other properties offered.", "title": "Great place", "user": "eastsider66", "date": "August 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117323737}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Great service.

It is new, has comfortable beds, pool and hot tub open 24 hours, cookies upon arrival between 4 and 6 and the breakfast included is the best anywhere I stayed. It has 2 waffle makers (which taste good), 2 hot items daily, fruit salad (the real fruit), cereal, milk, coffee, yogurt, muffins, toast, bagels, english muffins, etc..., hot chocolate, juice and more. The seating area is comfortable and spacious and clean. It is located in the newer area of town with some stores and restaurants close by. One thing to keep in mind is there are no safes in the room. A suggestion for the hotel to add. They do have a few safes in the lobby if you ask to use but not ideal. We enjoyed our stay that we wanted stay longer but the hotel was booked. I know why. Definitely a place we will be going back to.
