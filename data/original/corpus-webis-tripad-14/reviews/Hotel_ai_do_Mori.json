We made the choice because the room has a fridge, tea and coffee making facilities and a large terrace which overlooks the Basilica, Campanile, two moors tower and rooftops of Venice. It is a charming, romantic room with wooden beams. The room was clean and quiet, the staff are friendly and helpful and the location truly is a winner.

You are in the middle of restaurants, museums, close to a vaporetto stop. The room was very clean and reasonably quiet for being right on the shopping street. This is a modest hotel, not luxurious, but everything you need for a stay in Venice. Luca was very helpful and put a kettle for hot water, coffee and tea in the room.
