A lovely set of apartments, very clean with someone coming in to clean and make the beds every day. We booked a one bedroom apartment with kitchenette and sea view and we weren't disappointed. Very spacious with all our needs catered to. The only thing I can really say negatively would be about breakfast, this is served from 8am until 10am, but if you want to ensure there's anything left other than sliced bread for toast or cereal, arrive early!! Skala is a quiet little town which suited us and if you're looking for somewhere for your evening meal, I would thoroughly recommend Siroco Restaurant on the main street. Fabulous food, very reasonably priced and Andreas and Karen are excellent hosts - we ate there every night and our only wish was that we were staying longer than a week.

The balcony itself was large and the view was spectacular. Air conditioning, pool towels, safe, internet computers, pool table and satellite television were all included in the price. There is an outdoor restaurant at the hotel which serves food from 08:00 - 21:00 we ate here a few times and it was very nice and reasonably priced. Costas does 2 trips in his minibus per night into Skala town (18:00 and 20:00) we used this service most nights. We didn't walk into town at all because it was far too hot but I think it would take best part of an hour and the money saved on air conditioning and safe helps towards the cost of taxis. Pool area is lovely very uncrowded with a good selection of music in the background, bar serves some very nice cocktails and beer comes in frosted glasses barman very friendly and nothing too much trouble. There is a weekly BBQ which we went to (10 euros adult, 8 euros child) very good value plenty of meat, salads, breads and a lovely desert they have a pianist and singer on BBQ night who play traditional Greek music at the poolside which was really nice - it certainly wasn't a show but more of an accompaniment to the food.", "title": "Can't fault it!!!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "jebeto", "date": "July 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 133879621}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "This was a really outstanding holiday and we have all been pining to go back - we are definitely going to book this hotel for next year but for a fortnight!!!", "title": "An amazing hotel for such a good price", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "BTC1980", "date": "July 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133750967}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The design of the hotel was modern and well considered.

It is in a beautiful situation on the hill overlooking the sea with zante over the other side..the accommodation was very good, apartment was on the corner with one of the best views, very clean, very spacious with kitchenette, with very helpful staff. It was so relaxing and quiet at this time as they closed for the winter the day we left, but we did enjoy 32 degrees all week and it was a couples dream at this time if you were wanting a chilled week together ..You do really need a car, it is a good 45min walk to town (skala) going down hill but a much harder walk back. Costas (the owner) does have a mini bus which goes into the town (skala) every night (except sunday) at 6pm and 8pm free of charge, you just need to get a taxi back approx 6 euros.. We went for a day trip one day to poros, sami, and upto fisckardo (fishing village) where we had a fabulous fish lunch and came back down to asos (stunning) and myrthos beach...(WOW) so glad we did that trip.. We paid for breakfast at the hotel, which for the money was excellent.. cereals, yog, fruit and jams... toast, hams, cheese, toms and hard boiled eggs with tea, coffee, juice etc but we eat out every night in skala... Our absolute favourite was the \"scananavian\" as the locals know it, the food was amazing... i can't tell you how much kefalonian meat pie i had there.. which you couldnt get at many of the restaurants, but we tried 5 diff dishes, and all were top dollar.. The captains bar is great for cocktails and music and \"my way\" bar is good for any of you sports fans for the tv. I really think you would struggle to complain about anything here...
