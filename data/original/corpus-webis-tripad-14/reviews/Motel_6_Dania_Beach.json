Lauderdale. The room was very smelly and the service was terrible. One day I came back to the room without any towels and the front desk people refused to deliver any. The room was never vaccumed once during my stay. One night the people staying next door were fighting inside first and then went outside shouting. The worst was the following: while I was loading my luggage on the last day and my car was parked right outside my room, someone ran into my room and stole my purse. Because my room was at the end, the person ran out and turned immediately. I could only see the back of the person. The police came and could not help much.

My wife and I consider it our home away from home when we visit Florida. We've been coming every year or two for the past twelve years and have stayed here every time. Considering the outrageously priced accomodations with not much better locations in the Ft. Lauderdale area this place is a gem! It is only a mile or so from the beach and airport and walking distance or a little more to great restaurants and shops. The pool is immaculate. The staff is helpful and friendly. Parking is easy. The city of Dania Beach is great and a destination in and of itself, a laid-back alternative to neighboring Ft. Lauderdale and Hollywood. Real easy to set out and enjoy these places from here though. We've used this location as a convenient base of operations to visit all over south Florida including Miami, Miami Beach, the Everglades, Naples, Ft. Myers, the Keys, etc. Keep in mind that tons of cruises leave from Port Everglades just a couple of miles away. We recently took a day trip to Freeport, Bahamas. Sometimes we think we should keep this Motel 6 and Dania Beach our little secret but the negative comments on this board are not justified and need to be answered. It is budget priced but it is clean and is certainly better than basic.

The front desk crews act as if you are interrupting them with requests, and they erased the room key daily, necessitating long walks to the desk to get it reprogrammed.
