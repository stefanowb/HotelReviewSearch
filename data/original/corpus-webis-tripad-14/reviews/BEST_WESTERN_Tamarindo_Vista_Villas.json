The kids were alway so exhausted by the end of the day that they crashed and mom & dad got to enjoy more - like the party at the Monkey Bar. We had two ocean facing rooms and contrary to what I've read in some other reviews, our rooms were clean and every thing worked. The pool was clean and the beach and ocean too. I surfed everyday and taught my son to surf, as well. The staff was very nice and they all spoke English but tolerated our gringo Spanish with good humor as well.

Everything a family could need is right at your fingertips we were able to surf with the boys and all we had to do was walk across the street. The rooms had a kitchen so we were able to enjoy an ocean view and save on restaurant costs, and the restaurant at the hotel also had a very kid friendly menu when we did not want to cook. My friends wife was able to get a manicure and a massage in house, and my buddy even got his teeth whitened while he was here for only 200 bucks.

The included breakfast was more than adequate. The location was ideal and you can not beat the price. The food and drinks were good and my son and I especially enjoyed the Hawaiian pizza. The staff and service was far above what you would expect from a hotel in this price range. The staff - Trevor was in the breakfast area most mornings and went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying our stay and that we were happy with our room. He made many great suggestions for things we might enjoy and even drew us a custom map to get to Playa Conchal for snorkeling. His advice was spot on and we experienced many beautiful uncrowded beaches. I also must mention Fernando. He would have delicious fruit smoothies made for my son before he could even have time to ask for one and he loaned us his personal boogie board for my son to use on our last day so we didn't have to rent one. Our housekeeper Maria was also great. She recognized a flip flop after noticing my son only had one in the room and she returned it to us. She also did a great job cleaning our room and made it so comfortable to lay in a clean bed after being in the ocean and covered with sand all day. The Friday night party was awesome with great music and great drinks. My son and his friend really enjoyed jumping off the waterfall at the pool also. We enjoyed the sunsets from the All in all I would definitely stay here again if I travel back to Tamarindo.
