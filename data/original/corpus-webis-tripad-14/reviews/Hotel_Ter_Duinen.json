Although Bruges is such a magical place that almost any hotel would suffice, Ter Duinen stands apart from the crowd because of its beautiful location and its wonderful proprietors. The hotel is a short walk from the crowded center of town, which means that you can enjoy the gorgeous canal view without being crushed by tourists. In addition, there is a real sense of care and attention from the staff (who seem to be one family as far as we could tell). The best example of this is the free breakfast every morning. Instead of a continental buffet with runny scrambled eggs like you'd find at most American hotels, Ter Duinen offers a gourmet meal with everything you could ask for, including fresh-squeezed orange juice and soft-boiled eggs delivered to the table within seconds of sitting down. It's above and beyond, just like everything else we experienced here.

The very considerate and hospitable owners made our 2 night stay most pleasant. Our room was on the ground floor, street side and was large for a European hotel room. The beds were comfortable and we heard little to no noise from the street because of the double windows. On the first night we could not get the rolladen, outside shade, to come down on the window and this, for me, was not good because I cannot sleep with light coming in. We called the desk and Marc, the owner came right away and was able to get the shade down. It was stuck from the outside. I asked about using the air conditioner since we could not leave the window open because the room was on the street. He brought the remote control right away and we had a very cool and pleasant night's sleep. Many have written about the breakfast and it lived up to all the reviews. Very lovely dining room and a wonderful variety of foods for anyone's taste. Fresh, hot coffee with a second pot on request was appreciated. Brugge is a charming city and a place I would recommend. I would definitely return to Brugge and the Hotel Ter Duinen. The only downside was that there was no shower curtain. I asked Marc about it and he said that there was one before but that I had not been replaced and that he would see to that.", "title": "Really Charming and Comfortable Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "atlast5", "date": "August 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116711573}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at Ter Duinen for 3 nights for a mini-holiday. After many hours reading reviews on trip advisor, I plumped for this hotel, even though it was a bit more expensive than we would normally pay. We were both very happy with my choice! The best things about this hotel are definitely the friendly and helpful staff and the breakfasts which were wonderful and one of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had (the other being a 5 star luxury hotel in Delhi). They put so much effort into presentation and quality, which I really appreciated; little individual fresh fruit salads, and a plate of prepared fruit delivered to your table, such as strawberries and the biggest cherries I have ever seen! An excellent selection of breads, and very good quality meats and chesses (I don't usually bother with these, but the brie was too good to miss!) Cereals, yogurts and good selection of teabags too! The hotel is very well located on the canalside, and the main square is within 10 minutes walk. You can catch the bus from the train station quite easily, and it drops you off right opposite the hotel. I paid a little extra for one of the recently refurbished rooms. If I am being totally honest, I was a little disappointed with the room and this is the only reason I have not given Ter Duinen 5 stars. There was not that much natural light, so it was a bit dark, and rather spartan in terms of decoration - a few pictures on the wall might help. It wasn't a room I wanted to spend that much time in beyond the necessities. That being said, the bathroom was lovely with an excellent shower - big cubicle and powerful. The bed was also very comfy and the bedding clean and of good quality. The TV had lots of English channels so were were able to watch BBC news every morning! Some coat hangers and hot drinks tray would also be welcomed.
