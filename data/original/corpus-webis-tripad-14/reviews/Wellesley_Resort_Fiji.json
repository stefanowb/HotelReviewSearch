He also stopped at a supermarket so that we could pick up beers and water for our room (worth doing as it works out way cheaper than resort prices).

Upon arriving at the \"resort\" (after a 2.5 hour car ride from Nadi airport) we discover that the resort is situated off the road, down a track that only a 4wd can navigate. I soon realise that this is by design, as they want you to be cut off from everything and rely on their disgraceful offerings to get you by. Knowing that bottled water will be a necessity to sustain our planned 10-day stay, we asked to buy some.... none here sorry. No worries, where can we get some, is there a shop nearby? Sure, we can take you to the road to meet a taxi--at $40 fijian and an hour trip each way! We head to our room, only to be greeted with a strange pungent smell, we ignore this as our main priority was checking the fridge for refreshment options for our stay. Inside was a barely cold jug of water, which had a grimey lid, even some food of some sort on it. We check out the bathroom to find that the shower fittings are rusted and hanging from the walls. The T.V. was small and far away from the bed area- this did not bother us at all because we weren't there to watch tv (at least until we discovered that this is one of the only things to do at this place!) We attempted to relax and hungrily awaited dinner. We get to the dining room/bar area and realise we are the only couple there and it is dark and uninviting. We sit and order from a menu that looks quite decent. The food arrives suspiciously promptly and its resembles reheated leftovers, servings were measly and tasted no better. This had no bearing on price however, as main \"meals\" were over $25-$30FD. During our meal, an equally bewildered looking couple sit down to a meal and look just as confused as we did at their offerings. Deflated, we retreat to our room to contemplate our decision to stay at this place, called it a night and watched T.V. (kind of like we do at home...for FREE) We awaken, stomachs rumbling and a bit thirsty and head to breakfast. I order eggs on toast and pay extra for bacon, cannot wait to eat! It arrives and the eggs are pale and dry and the ONE PIECE of bacon looks sweaty and microwaved despite having frying marks on it, was it reheated!? Enough was enough, this was our honeymoon and it was completely destroyed by this place and its purposeful isolation from anything that we went to Fiji to see and do. 2 days into our 10 day stay, we had to leave and headed home with a literal bad taste in our mouths.

He makes sure u are vey comforatable and answers any questions u have and offers stops alnog the way to get anything u may need. The owners Gail and Ray were thee to welcome us back and went out of their way to assure our stay was as good as it was last yr. They are a little rough around the edges but thats fiji life. We got eveything we expected from our previous stay. The staff is vey laid back and friendly and are happy to accomadate ur needs. While er wer there a stomach virus spread through for a day or 2 but we were very well looked after and were offered anything we needed to make us feel better and gail made sure she asked after each of us many times during the sickness to make sure we were ok. This resort may be vey small and vey laid back but at least you are not treated like a number, they treat u like a friend. Both visits now we met extrodinary people and made friends for life. The resort is far removed but thats its charm. Pure seclusion and relaxation. Dont go here if you want alot of activities, you have to make your own fun here as we always do. If you stay here walk away with the positives and not the negitives. Its not a 5 star resort but for the small pricetag u pay here u get alot.

If you are looking for some action, you can walk 15 mins down the beach to the only neighbouring hotel Crusoes, it's slightly bigger and has a few more activities going on.
