The service is very good. Check in could use a bit more staff during the busy times but they do have a nice can do attitude at the front desk. The common areas are a bit small but are adequate. The gym is open 24 hours a day and is nicely equipped with views of the ocean. The outdoor fire pits are really very nice, it seems that it is always pretty cool here with wind. So bring warm clothes. Just the fact that there is no outdoor pool suggest too cold to be outside swimming. The spa is nice with very nice locker rooms, steam bath, cool and hot plunge pools and nice common area with a large hot tub. The food is pricy but very good. Overall, the views are spectacular, common areas fantastic, food and service excellent, the rooms are a bit pricy but you are paying for the location.

I thought the breakfast was OK at best, but it was a fortune. $6.50 for a glass of generic OJ (not fresh squeezed)? That says it all. The atmosphere was good though. Perfect for a night away.
