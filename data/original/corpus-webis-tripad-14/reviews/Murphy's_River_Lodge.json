We stayed in the 'C' room, which is above and a little behind the office. It required climbing some narrow stairs, but that wasn't a problem for us. One nice surprise was when we checked in, the lady at the front desk informed us the owner had dropped the price after we made our reservation the previous week, so we got the room at the lower rate, saving us over $40! The room was very clean and spacious. The fridge and microwave came in handy. The free continental breakfast was adequate with several choices including cereal, pastries, hard boiled eggs (a little undercooked for my taste), oatmeal, etc. Downtown Estes Park is a short walk away, so you can even walk to dinner from the hotel if preferred. The day we arrived to check in, there were several elk right on the property and across the street, which was a nice surprise!
