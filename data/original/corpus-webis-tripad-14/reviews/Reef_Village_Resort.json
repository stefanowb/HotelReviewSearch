I have been a timeshare owner in the Bahamas for 22 years and this was the first time I utilized Interval to trade. I am sooo glad I chose Reef Village. I have a 3-bedroom/3-bath villa and my reservation confirmation from RV was for the same. When we arrived, they put us in a 3-bedroom/2-bath, which just wouldn't do. I went to the office and told them that I was very unhappy and they immediately transferred us to the most beautiful 3-BR/3Bath villa. It was very spacious. The decor was beautiful. Our maid, Elena, came every day and did an outstanding job. The food at The Palm was delicious and the service was excellent. I tried to eat all of their coconut shrimp -- soooo good! Just sitting on the veranda with the glorious view was worth the trip! Carla in the office was very accommodating and wanted to make sure you received only the best service. I gave the place 4 stars instead of 5 because of two things: (1) there was a critter in my bathroom (which they promptly handled) (although I don't do bugs, I understand that we are in the tropics and this will happen, BUT, I still don't want to see critters -- EVER!); and (2) as upscale as this place is, i don't understand why they don't have dishwashers. I certainly don't go on vacation to wash dishes. Of course, they say, the maid will do the dishes, but we may eat something at night time and I'm not the type of person to leave dishes in the sink overnight. Other than those two things, everything was PERFECT. Barry the bartender was great and very personable.

Pros: large rooms, nice pool, nice staff who go out of their way to help you, fairly nice views. Cons: too far from town (mainly because of road conditions and toll bridge), bugs, including cockroaches, in rooms, tiny bathrooms, yellow water, construction and loud workers everywhere, construction debris all around, making views less favorable. I would love to tell you to stay here, but I really wouldn't recommend it. If I had it to do over again I would have stayed in town or south of town. Also, don't count on Wi-fi, it literally works 10%of the time (and only around pool area).
