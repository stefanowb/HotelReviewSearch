It is brand new, and maybe they just don't have all the kinks worked out yet. The bathroom was big and BEAUTIFUL and that was the plus. The downside was the room itself....very ecclectic and not warm and iniviting whatsoever. Stark white walls.....not a scrap of wallpaper or border anywhere.....and not even an art print. Granted, hotel art is not exactly museum quality, but there needs to be something on the walls! The corner chair for reading was the most uncomfortable ever. Not the typical roomy, overstuffed chair with an ottoman here. A small, straight upholstered chair perfect for an 8 yr. old, and without the ottoman. The desk chair was more comfy! This would be a perfect place for a business stay, but not our choice for a relaxing trip.", "title": "Nice, new, and noisy", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bessiedear", "date": "June 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 66976523}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Oklahoma City"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 12, "very good": 17, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 19}, "slim_ranking": 0.419117647059, "description": "110 spacious guest rooms with king or 2 double queen beds, non smoking hotel.
