Pillow top mattress and a down comforter. Each bed had three pillows on it (I had a double queen room) and a neck pillow. I had the hardest time getting out of bed the next day.

We appreciated how hospitable the front desk clerk was by not only offering to let us check out the rooms but also she made the effort to give us rooms next door to each other. The rooms were clean, beds comfortable, & the pool area was well kept. The breakfast was a nice surprise! Biscuits & gravy, eggs, cereal, fruit, danish, yogurt, muffins, & beverages.

The room was clean, big, non-smoking, as I requested, and all for $64.00 (with AAA discount.) The front desk was extremely nice and was able to point me to nearby attractions the next day (the County Seat of Canton has an old Courthouse and many movies have been shot in the town square). I was happy that I stayed here (on the outskirts of the big city of Jackson, MS) as when I drove the rest of the way to Tupelo the next day I realized this was the last hotel for miles. I picked up a Hampton Inn directory and it said that this hotel just opened in the 1st quarter of 2004 and I believe it because it was so nice & clean.
