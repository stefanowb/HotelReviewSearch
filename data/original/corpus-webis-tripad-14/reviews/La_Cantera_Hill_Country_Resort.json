We also encountered the activities manager by the name of Mercedes Sanchez and she was very helpful in giving us a tour and making sure our stay was enjoyable.

It cost a little more to stay on that level, but with 2 children ages 5 & 6 years old, it is nice to crawl out of bed and go down the hall for breakfast. The is a happy hour at 5:00 pm with appitizers and low cost beer and wine. The pool has a water slide and a park of bounce houses to keep the children entertained all day. There is also a Kid's Club that will watch the kids if the parents want a quiet afternoon by the pool or a game of golf.

The views were great, I enjoyed the exercise bike and other equipment, and the room was awesome. I had an 80 minute Swedish massage at the spa that was excellent. I get regular massages and Irish was phenomenal. The only downside is that they automatically add gratuity. While you can add more $, I find this practice insulting and will never include more money if the gratuity is automatically added. Too bad, because Irish would have received a 25% or so tip from me. Housekeeping was superb. They were the only great service at the hotel. I opted for the \"green\" stay and they were really sweet about letting me have some extra coffee when I needed it. My burger at the casual restaurant was excellent and the service there was pretty good also. Breakfasts and one of the lunches served at the conference were tasty and nicely served.

I arrived very early and wanted my luggage taken to my friend's room. I had the room number and explained that I needed it shortly (there was no other hotel guests there, it was just after 8) as I had to work to do. Also I did not want my makeup and other items melting in the already hot sun. After about 30 minutes, I called and asked when it would be delivered. They lied and said it would be right up (which is what they originally told me). About 10 minutes later I went down and got my stuff, still sitting on the cart in the hot, hot sun. No-one stopped me so - heh thieves - great opportunity to rip off hotel guests. Then I asked to be called when my room was ready. Now they did give me a great room and they did let me check in early, but when I came by to check, they were like \"it's been ready\", well - where was the call? The front desk staff tended to act like a \"deer in the headlights\" whenever I asked a question, good thing I found maps and other information - they were pretty useless. Then when I went to get my car from valet parking, first they ignore me and take the claim check from the guy behind me in line (he was taller?!), I finally get the guy to take my claim check. I watch them and I'm finally next in line\u2026. Then I overhear the valet tell one of the guys to get so and so's car and load in their luggage. Now I may have misheard him, but after the other guy got to cut in line in front of me, I spoke up - heh! I'm next. This is when he got really rude - I did not say that. We will get your car, just an ugly attitude, I'm pretty sure he would have slapped me if he could. I finally get my car and move it off to the boondocks. The other misses was the raw, gristly steak lunch one day at the conference - it was mooing on my plate and I had to go buy something to eat. And the pools were filthy.
