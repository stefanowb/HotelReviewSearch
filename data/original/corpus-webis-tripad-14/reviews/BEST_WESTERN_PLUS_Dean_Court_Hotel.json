Well, wonder no longer. We wouldn't go further than the Dene Court Hotel for any future visit. Literally, right next to the Minster and in such a central position that restaurants and shops were close to hand. The room (No 20) was nicely furnished with the biggest bed (one of those 'Super Kingsize' jobbies) I'd slept in. Honestly, it was like sleeping on my own, there was so much space! The en-suite was large, with a wall separating the wet room at one end (shower [including a seat and handrail for the disabled], toilet and washbasin) and the bath at the other end. The decor was nice but not terrific, going for the contemporary look but somehow not quite pulling it off. A moot point though. This hotel is great. I particularly loved the staff. They were so helpful. The valet parking (I object to paying for parking, but \u00a38 we thought was cheap for the city) was a great service.
