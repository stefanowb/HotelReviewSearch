Ringing the bell at promptly 4:30 PM, we were greeted enthusiastically by Rachel, who efficiently showed us around the guest areas of the house and ultimately up the two storeys to our room\u2014the only one on the top floor, and actually providing two bedrooms. A dish offering our favourite--York mint patties--was a very welcome treat and the little fridge was stocked with cans of assorted soft drinks and juices. Atop the fridge were glasses, a corkscrew and, in a protective bag, a cutting board with sharp knife for preparing fruit, cheese, or other snacks. A digital clock sat on one bedside table. Rather than taking up room on the little tables (perfect size for the spaces), reading lamps were positioned on the wall to each side of the bed headboard. The pillow-top mattress and two-each full-sized pillows provided deep, refreshing sleeps. Each of Weathervane's rooms has a TV on the wall for reliving a Twilight saga on DVD or watching the news of the real world. The squeaky-clean bathroom was attactively but not fussily appointed and well-stocked. Particularly helpful was having a mirror in the bedroom as well as in the bathroom. (For a future stay, we would also consider trying the spacious Cedar Room at the front of the house on the second floor.) Once out of bed, one of us would sneak in dressing gown down to the dining room to bring back mugs of coffee from the carafe on the sideboard. Breakfasts, prepared by Cheryl, were delicious, not over-the-top, and just the fuel we needed to embark on our all-day explorations; seconds were available along with bottomless coffee. Many hours later, we returned to gratefully boost our energy from the assortment of cookies, fruit and snacks as well as much-needed coffee set out for guests (along with many teas and hot water). The lounge on the main floor sports two enveloping recliners and a TV. A nearby bookshelf displays two rows of video movies. Miller Tree Inn is on the less-traffic end of Division Street, but within easy walks to most of the restaurants and shops in town. For Twilight fans, this eye-catching house has apparently been designated as the Cullen family home. Although some of the other guests were on pilgrimages, as were drive-up fans content with exterior shots of themselves against the backdrop of the picturesque house, we did not feel out of place. In fact, Miller Tree Inn was the perfect base to begin our several-day exploration of the beaches to the west\u2014the focus our vacation. Although we would have liked to meet the owners, Susan and Bill, they were out of town; nevertheless, Cheryl and Rachel were excellent representatives.", "title": "A Must-Stay B&B in Forks", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Catwhowalksbyherself", "date": "June 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 164444029}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "First trip to Washington could not have been better and that is due to the decision to stay at the Miller Tree Inn.
