The rate is always at least $40-50 per night more than the Hampton Inn across the street and there is no reason to stay at the Residence Inn unless you must have a kitchenete and can't get a studio suite at the Hampton. We did not find the hallways to be clean and the pool was an even bigger disappointment. There were no towels remaining (and this was not remedied even after I asked), the water was murky, and I found hairs wrapped around my fingers after each lap that I swam. We had a basic room, which was quite cramped and had a poor layout. The air conditioner did not have an adjustable fan speed and the vent blew directly at the bed. The bed was located in such a position that barely six inches existed between it and the window wall on one side. The furniture in the room was worn and in need of repair or replacement, even though the property is relatively new. We only stayed here because the Hampton Inn was unavailable on Saturday night, but we cancelled the second night of our stay, moved to the Hampton on Sunday morning, saved $45 on the room rate, and had a much nicer, larger room in a hotel of the same age that is still in pristine condition.", "title": "Distinctly Inferior to Hampton", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DCRE", "date": "June 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 165207229}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Rooms are very comfortable and well laid out for an extended stay.
