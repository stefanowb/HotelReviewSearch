The staff at all three Sandals have been incredible, so friendly and helpful, but I think overall the staff here was the best. Tasha at the swim up bar at the main pool made the BEST Dirty Bananas and was always smiling and pleasant. The resort is gorgeous with actually 2 sections to it, one down by the large pool which is fun and very active, and the other quieter area is up the hill on the bluffs with the beautiful views and sunsets. The restaurants were all great, although I think Piton's was our favorite. Our room was nice, clean, with an ocean view in the main building, but we had been spoiled at Royal Caribbean last year when they upgraded us to the River Suites. The only complaint we had was there weren't enough umbrellas at the pool if you wanted to escape the sun (and it was very hot every day with an ongoing drought). People would go down to the pool by 6:30 a.m. to reserve a good spot with an umbrella, and some days it was hard to find a chair anywhere. The beach was rough with the red flag for many days, so we only spent 1 or 2 days there. Overall though, the resort is beautiful with a wonderful staff, and I would definitely recommend it, and we may try Sandals in Antigua next year.

To: Ana-Faye our renewal of vows coordinator who has a beautiful smile, sweet personality, and who never seemed to miss a beat when changes in our schedule conflicted with the plans she had. She was attentive to detail and just rolled with what most of us would find an inconvenience. THANKS for making me feel as though we were friends and for such a special day!

We really made you work hard (not easy to teach 10 people to follow directions) with no signs of exasperation ; ).

I will say that the differences from our first stay there 10 years ago (when we stayed in a room on the bluff) to this stay (with various levels of room on the resort, but not the butler serviced ones) were very few. The weddingmoon 10 years ago included everything, but this time what was included back then are now considered \"extras\" and needed to be paid for if wanted.

We do our fair share of partying since we live in Manhattan and enjoy the bars and nightlife at least on a weekly basis, but for our honeymoon we were looking for something more private and relaxing.
