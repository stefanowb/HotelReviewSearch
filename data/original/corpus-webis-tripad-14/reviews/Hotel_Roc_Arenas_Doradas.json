The resort is a perfect size, not so big that it takes a mile to walk from the beach to the pool, but just big enough to have the lazy men in speedos far away. There were mainly Canadians but there were also some French, German, and Italians. What made the trip amazing was the staff. The chefs, cooks, and maids were all so friendly and helpful, it made me want to stay another week. The food was really good and I didn't get bored or anything. Each night two men playing guitars sang at different tables - they are extremely talented (Duo Bis-Sol). Never before has an entertainment staff been so warm, welcoming, funny, and good-looking! They can dance like nobody I've ever seen before. Not only are there daily dance lessons by the pool (highly recommended) but during the nightly shows that include dancing, the entertainment crew dances with the audience, making the night that much more enjoyable. The disco was completely empty each night, but when you're with friends, it can be fun. The pizzaria open 24 hrs. was a godsend. The waiter/chefs there didn't mind making us a snack at 3:00am but we felt guilty so it only happened once (or twice!) The pool has a bar and the Piano Bar in the lobby has the best drinks ever. Going to the clubs in Varadero is something that you have to do at least once, taxis only cost around $8, club entrance $10, but get this - unlimited drinks inside! All in all, I had one of the best trips ever.

The hotel itself is amazing, well kept grounds, nice rooms, which are kept very clean by the maids. The beach is to die for. Nice long white sandy beach with blue, green, clear terqois water. The drink selection is good and very generous. The sunkin pool is awesome which has a bar in the middle. There are 4 bars altogether, one in the lobby, one in the disco, one at the pool and one on the beach. The only complaint, like most people from cuba, is the food. Its good for about the first 4 days and then you start to become sick of it. But, they do have a 24-hour pizzaria which is very good. Only complaints I have about this place is the food selection(its like this everywhere in cuba)and only the lobby bar is open after 7 pm. Besides that, this is a great hotel with great staff. but LET ME warn you, it is not a place to go to party. As a matter of fact, varadero and cuba in general is not a great place to party. More of a place to relax espcially with a partner. Mexico(Cancun) or dominican is way better to party and pick up chicks. But overall, i think this hotel holds up to its 4 star rating.", "user": "VancouverPimp", "date": "April 24, 2004", "id": 1834794}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2004", "text": "We recently returned from 2 glorious weeks at Arenas Doradas. The staff are extremely gracious and accommodating. We were well treated and enjoyed our stay immensely. The beach is beautiful, long and sandy- you can walk for a couple of hours up and down the beach if you want. The pool is a good size with a swim-up bar. See Lisset and Milie there. Ask for an Arenas Doradas - p'apple juice, orange juice, rum and banana liquer - very good. The people there are very appreciative of the things we take for granted, like basic toiletries and supplies, as well as the occasional tip. The food is basic , from which you can pick and choose. If you don't like something, leave it on your plate and get something else! There is a good variety and it does have changes so as not to be bored. There are some staples available every day, like omelets for breakfast and ice cream ( 3 flavours ) every lunch and dinner! The resort is nicely laid out and easy to find your way around.", "title": "A great place to Stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "teddifax", "date": "April 19, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 1793278}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Would never go back to back to Arenas Dorados", "text": "For anyone going there, I can send pictures as well as describe the layout of the resort- the buildings are numbered counter-clockwise from the main building, over to the entertainment bldg (Disco), then starting with Bldg 100 and working your way in a sort of circle back to the Main building, finishing with the 1100 block.Depending on how busy the resort is, you may be able to preview your room and possibly change your room to a better view - we were able to do so twice until the third room - which was just seconds away from the pool. The grounds were immaculately kept. There is an Internet room , 30 minutes access for $3.00 US- sign up for a hotmail account before you go and you can keep in touch with home.The free shuttle into Varadero is great. As far as we could tell, no other resorts had this feature, which meant paying to get into the downtown area. It is NOT a walkable distance from the resort. The shuttle will drop you off next to a small craft market, however, there are at least 3 more on the same street ( 1ST Avenue ).If you turn to your right past the market,onto 1ST Av & continue a couple of short blocks, there is a really large market with at least 100 vendors.We found the prices for the crafts extremely cheap.Also take the trip into Havana. We paid extra to take a guided tour with lunch.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sharlena", "date": "April 8, 2004", "id": 1769319}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2004", "text": "Havana has to be seen. The buildings are constantly being renovated and are amazing.The cemetary is incredible.If you get a chance take a Coco Taxi-just $10.00 US from downtown Varadero to the resort. I know you can get the free shuttle back, but the taxi is a real hoot-just big enough for 2, along with the driver who sits up front. You can't miss them, they look like yellow football helmets! Enjoy your time at the resort and one thing we have learned is that a trip is what you make of it. If you go and are negative, then that is what you are going to reflect back on your trip.
