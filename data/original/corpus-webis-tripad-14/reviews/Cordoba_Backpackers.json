The main lobby seems to be that of a typical HI hostel, loud music, young travelers, drinks for sale, computers with internet access, and Wi-Fi. We stayed in the annex across the way which has a large kitchen and is somewhat well equipped but other travelers make it a little dirty. The room we stayed in was in the kitchen area and we found it to be loud, stuffy (it lacked windows but had a fan), and very dark. We met some travelers also in their late 20s that stayed in the room next door. The guy counted 80 bites on him after staying at Cordoba Backpackers. His room was infested with bed bugs and it seemed that the Hostel knew of the problem but essestially ignored it. We were on the look out for bugs after this incident and killed 2 small black bugs that were filled with blood on subsequent nights. 2 days later, my husband's feet were covered with tiny bumps. I can positively say that we found the bathrooms to be spacious andsufficient in number. We never experienced a wait. The shower stall is very large and had hot water for every shower. The excursions that the Hostel offers are expensive. We were not HI members which means we paid even more to go. We heard that the hikes were well worth it but felt we could do the trip to Villa General Belgrano for cheaper. The Hostel is well located in the city. It was about a 20 minute walk to the bus station. Breakfast is very good and offers tea, coffee or hot chocolate, 1 bowl of cereal, a pre-packaged muffin and some toast with jam and butter. If we didn't have the bed bug issue, I would recommend it for a budget traveler.", "title": "Beware of bed bugs", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "May 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 29160427}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled solo", "text": "This hostel is in a great central location, and is really friendly and welcoming. The common area is great, with 2 computers and free internet access - people tended to stick to the time limit too so it was easy to get access to the computers. The hostel is really clean, the dorms are pretty comfortable, if not that big, and the breakfast is good. The main downside is that there are not enough bathrooms for the amount of people the place accomodates. It wasn\u00b4t full when I was here, but there were still plenty of people waiting for the bathrooms in the morning - there are only 3. Other than the bathroom issue, it\u00b4s a nice place to stay with a good atmosphere.", "title": "Lovely welcoming hostel but not enough bathrooms", "user": "geo_82", "date": "September 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 19909928, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 not enough bathrooms"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled solo", "text": "Standard HI hostel. I stayed in the private rooms across the street. The rooms were ok. The shower doors never fully shut but it was never a problem. There is a pool table and bar there but for some reason the people in the hostel did not interact much. The staff was really nice and they have a cute dog too.
