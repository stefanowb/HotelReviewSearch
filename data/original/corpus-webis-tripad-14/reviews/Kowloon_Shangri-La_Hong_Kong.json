Though, my business was mostly in Central, I chose this hotel as it was cheaper in Kowloon then in Central. The location is a good if you like to see the Harbour view. Choose a room with a full harbour view and you will not repent. The hotel is like any other Shangrila Property which is top class and the breakfast was very nice including good vegetarian choices. One strange thing however, was the absence of a bath tub in the room. The room size is big so I dont think the size of the room was an issue. The service is very good. Even if you have work around Central, then it makes sense to live here as going to Central takes around 20 mins in the morning by cab and costs around HKD 150 including the tunnel charge.", "title": "Nice hotel and good vegetarian hot breakfast and very good location", "user": "babla75", "date": "May 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 160153757}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I have just returned from a holiday in Hong Kong.

We felt very connected with all the activity on the harbour. The two rooms were well appointed and all the staff were helpful and polite. Included was an office/study in our suite. My husband actually used this area as his dressing room and he enjoyed the extra space. A welcoming pot of tea and fresh fruit was a nice touch. We have previously had a suite at Shangri-La, Singapore and the comparison was easily the same experience. The Horizon Club is not quite as big as Singapore, but in a way it is more exclusive and intimate, and the view is fantastic as the Horizon Club is their top floor.

Would have been easier downstairs......first night in horizon club on 20th floor was made to feel like a second rate citizen, apparently I didn't exist so why was in the horizon club? Even though they took 2 passports on check in....they screwed up on the room dates and the card stopped working after 1 night so had lengthy trips up and down 20 floors....

We booked 2 nights in a horizon club room on points, were literally 10 points short of a 3rd so booked a basic double for the last night rather than paying the rack rate...any other hotel in the world with a jade card would have just extended the room, but no we moved...
