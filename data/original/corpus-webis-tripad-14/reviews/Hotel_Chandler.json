The room had black out shades-WHICH WERE FABULOUS! There is a turn down service each night and the complimentary products are Aveda. The staff was wonderful and helpful and there is free on site internet and a hotel computer to use. Overall we would definitely stay here again. We loved the location and had a great time. The hotel offers complimentary tea and coffee and apples in the back bar area all day and the bell staff is phenomenal!", "title": "Perfect Boutique Hotel!!!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "M8shaw", "date": "August 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8374960, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location was fantastic for us!", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing was bad enough to remember."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel Chandler is a nice, clean hotel with a very friendly staff. If you arrive early for check-in, you can have your luggage stored at no charge (which is rare in NYC). The free wireless internet is great. There is a turn-down service which includes shutting the blinds and shades. I have three complaints about the hotel. One, our mini fridge never got cold even though it was plugged in, so we were never able to have cold drinks and there is no ice machine in the hotel (which is a definite negative in the summer). The bathroom door could not close all the way (the door literally didn't fit into the frame). Most importantly, the hotel is a little out of the way. The only major attraction close to the hotel is the Empire State Building. So, as long as you are comfortable with taking the subway everywhere, you will be fine. The majority of the restauarants around the hotel serve sushi, Thai food, and curry. Overall, the hotel was a great experience, but I would have preferred to be in more of the heart of the action.", "title": "Excellent Hotel...A Little Out of The Way", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Brandi715", "date": "August 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8282904}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Better than Average!", "text": "We stayed at the Hotel Chandler for 4 nights.
