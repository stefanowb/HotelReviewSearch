I was truly bowled over by this wonderful Team, who could not do enough to make sure we had a wonderful stay. OK - the hotel is quite old in decor and the restaurant on the roof is over priced. But it shows that they are making do with what the company have given them and are certainly ensuring that guests leave, having had a great experience. The location is superb - close to the Spanish Steps and Villa Borghese, in a elegant part of the city. The hotel is historic and although rooms are a little dated in decor, they are however in good condition and offer everything you would expect from a five star experience (complimentary WiFi, Bose Stereo, Hermes Amenities in the Bathroom etc...). There is a great Bar/Restaurant on the roof - with stunning sunset views over the city. Pity the restaurant prices are ridiculously high. Breakfast is served in the lower ground floor and is an excellent selection (but you pay Euro 30 for it). If Sofitel invested in an update to the decor, this would be one of the best options in Rome.

The hotel service levels, from all manner of the hotel team, were exceptional, helping to book tickets and having macs to use in the hotel lobby. We decided on our first night to use the rooftop terrace restaurant, which we later found out had just been voted the best rooftop terace in europe. Prices in the restaurant were a little on the heavy side but we chose the 7 course extravaganza which was exquisite, and after all we were in central rome.
