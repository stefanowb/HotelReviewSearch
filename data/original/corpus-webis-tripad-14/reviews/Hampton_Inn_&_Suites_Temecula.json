This is a very nice property, newer and well maintained. They have a new program about their bed, something like \" The Very Fresh Bed \"? which states that in addition to the standard laundering of all sheets and pillowcases, they also launder everything on the bed, including the duvet / comforter, any blankets and all pillow coverings after each guest. I must say , the linens all smelled extremely clean and I did not hesitate to pull the comforter up close since I knew it was just cleaned as well. This bed is even comparable ( almost) to Westin's \" Heavenly Bed\" . The lobby is nice, a gift shop with items for your microwave and refrig which are in the room was very convenient. I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for a lot of value in a very safe location with guaranteed fresh, clean and very comfortable beds!", "title": "Loved Hampton Inn!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "orsanmichelle", "date": "December 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4301218}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "My husband and I spent one night at the Hampton Inn during the second week of December. I was impressed as soon as we entered the lobby. I liked the decor and the front desk staff was very professional and friendly. They were very helpful in several instances, such as finding the address of a restaurant complete with directions, arranging for taxi service, and quickly providing band-aids when I cut my thumb with a razor. The night clerk actually pulled a package from the hotel's concession area and gave whole thing to my husband. Actually the hotel staff as a whole were friendly and accomodating. Even though the hotel is located next to a freeway, you wouldn't know it because the rooms are well insulated from the sound. We stayed in a two bed queen room which was nicely decorated and comfortable. It was also very clean and well maintained. There was an easy chair to relax in and a lumbar support pillow for sitting up in bed, which I did while my husband and I watched a movie. High speed internet was included with the room. It was easy to hookup and there was plenty of room on the desk to work. The large breakfast room was bright and cheerful. There was a wide selection of items available in the complementary breakfast, including hot items like eggs, waffles, and sausages. We didn't get a chance to explore the area much beyond going out to dinner, but passed through old town to get to the hotel, which was right down the street. Maybe we'll go back and check it out some time. If so, I will certainly be staying at the Hampton Inn.", "title": "I give the Hampton Inn two thumbs up!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "DebbieDoo", "date": "December 22, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4255555}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "This was our first time to Temecula and we came to experience the Grape Harvest and Wineries. We chose the Hampton Inn based on reviews we read and our limited choices since this was a last minute trip. I was concerned when I read it was located near the freeway and that Trip Advisor did not have a photo of it. Well, I did find a photo, (see end of review) and the traffic was not a problem. I would hear an occasional motorcyle and then it was only a muffled sound. I get more noise at home.

From the venetian plaster in the lobby, to the wall covering in the rooms. The room was tastefully done in a neutral color palette. We stayed in the 2 queen bed standard room. Expedia was the best price at 139.50 with AAA card. My husband loved the leather recliner to relax in. We were surprised by the large size TV and free hi-speed internet. There was also a large refrigerator and a microwave. This would be great for families, since kids are always hungry. The bathroom had a single sink with granite counters and the shower/bath had the curved curtain rod which we loved, this gives you more space. PLUS, the shower curtain which was made of canvas had a \"vinyl\" horizontal panel at eye level to allow light in and for me, to create a more open feeling (I can feel clostrophobic behind an opaque shower curtain). We also liked that the shower head was high, being tall, its no fun to duck under the shower head. Beds were very comfortable, pillows fluffy and the air conditioner worked great. The pool and jacuzzi were basic but not crowded. One reviewer stated there was no privacy at the pool, well there are now vines growing on the rod iron to create privacy. The free continental breakfast was nice. There was quite a variety. Bagels, mini muffins, pastries, croissants, biscuits, wheat bread, oatmeal, cereals, fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee, hot chocoalte, sausage and eggs. The eggs could have been better. However, as you can see, a good selection.", "title": "Very nice hotel", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Mike100", "date": "August 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3760440}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Elegant hotel", "text": "Wineries were great. Our personal favorite was a new upcoming winery called \" Leonesse Cellars\". We enjoyed the Meritage wine. It did cost $8 to taste but you tasted 7 out of 8 choices and you keep the glass. This was also the nicest glass we got. Be sure and try the Port WIne, then you get french chocolate truffles! mmm. This winery seemed more personal while others had a very commercial feeling.
