I was staying here as part of a group attending a conference and the hotel was booked for us. I arrived with a visually impaired colleague and his guide dog, the reception staff were very helpful, but told us they were overbooked and that some of our group would have to share - reading other reviews it seems that overbooking is a problem here. However, my colleague and I were the first to arrive and were able to get single rooms.
