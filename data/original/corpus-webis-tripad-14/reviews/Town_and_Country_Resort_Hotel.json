It would have been nice to sit out there to sip coffee or read. The upstairs were we stayed was like any other hotel room. The room was clean, well maintained and nicely furnished. Our room cost included a daily breakfast buffet which was really great. The trolly is located at the rear of the property. The trolly can go north as far as the San Diego Misson and south to the TJ border/Mexico. There were at least 2 grand malls, Gaslamp district, Seaport village and Old Town San Diego accessible by this inexpensive trolly. We took a cab to have ocean view dining at Pacific Beach.

There was a sink in the actual bathroom area & an additional vanity/sink right outside the bathroom - it was handy having 2 sinks. Our room was large & our air conditioning worked fine . All the rooms in the Royal Palm Towers have balconies - most look out at the resort but a few just look at concrete walls. We were on the 2nd floor & enjoyed our balcony a lot because it was shaded by the ground level trees. Parking is definitely a problem but because we never got back in the late evening, we could always find a decent parking space. We ate breakfast & a couple of dinners in the attractive Terrace Cafe - food is ok. The nearby mall (walking distance) has a food court and several popular chain restaurants: California Pizza Kitchen, P.F. Chang's, The Cheesecake Factory & Uno Chicago Grill.

It was like a little secluded place. The food was ok...not the greatest but a not horrible. There is a great spa which is very elegant inside. All the staff were very efficient. And worked in a fast manner to measure up to our needs. The grounds are beautiful with palms, bird houses and gorgeous gardens and gazebos. The only real turn off to me is that the trolley is right behind the hotel and just random people can get off the trolley and walk right into the hotel and use all their facielities. I thought there should be guards and key cards for you to get into the pools and buildings. Our san diego experience was very good....although it may be a little to much of a convension center it still made our vacation meet our expectations", "title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "UFTAMU", "date": "July 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5503949, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Cost of on-site parking"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled on business", "text": "We were vey skeptical of this hotel due to the number of negative comments but had no other choices since all other hotels under $200.00/niight were sold out for our weekend travel date.

We had wonderful garden rooms, and spent Friday evening enjoying the live entertainment at Trellises. It is a bit of an older crowd, but who cares. Some people complain about the price, but some of the lesser hotels around the Hotel Circle area are just as expensive.

It is rather nice. The service of the front desk is wonderful and efficient. Instantly the property is pretty big in parameters. The decor at the front desk needs updating. They have security which is nice for parking etc. Parking is very limited though. They have construction and renovations that are taking up the parking spaces so that was a hassle. Great for the renovations not so great for parking! Our room was nice and spacious but the decor again has got to be updated carpet and all - whew! Not sure what design theme was colonial ? something don't know? Felt like we stepped back into the 60-70s. The bathroom shutter door (which limits privacy) stuck to the floor. The bathroom is very spacious. The wallpaper has to go. There was mold and water buildup around the showers and the sink was multiple cracked. They had a really nice linen closet for extra linen/towels etc. The bed was wonderful great pillows. Sleeping was good! They have multiple pools on the property which ducks enjoy too! Our room was centrally located to restaurant/cafes and near the convention center. Not good when it rained though. The restaurant was really good. Breakfast was excellent! Service was excellent! Dinner/late night eating had unlimited options for late dining but very limited service and wasn't sure we'd get our food but once we did it was good. We ate only at the Terrace Cafe. They have multiple levels of eateries sitdown table cloth, family cafe, deli to go. Which was really nice. Had room service one morning only - it was horrible. Everything was cold! Overall this is a average good hotel/resort it was very, very convenient for shopping there is a mall maybe 5 mins away. Grocery store 5-7 mins away including post office and other conveniences. Restaurants very close 5 mins (Cheesecake factory, Joe's Crab shack, a bunch others worth perusing) Its location is very central to all your needs. We can recommend this property for accommodations but they really need to look at updating their location. Check them out! This is great for couples and families with kids!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "carribeanfreak", "date": "March 15, 2006", "id": 4625938}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice Hotel", "text": "Town & Country is overpriced for what you get.
