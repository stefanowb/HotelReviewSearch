All the staff was polite and professional. My double room was huge and well equipped. There was a nice swimming pool in the garden, very useful if you want to chill out after a long journey. I reserved on line and the fare for the room was a bargain: 86 euros per night. On the contrary, the restaurant was a bit expensive: 43 euros for two caesar salades and two bottles of still mineral water...it looks to me exaggerated (probably they keep high prices, taking advantage of the isolated position). The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere: only Eindhoven Airport is very close (approximately something more than a mile).
