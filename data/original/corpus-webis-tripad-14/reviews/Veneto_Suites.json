This is a great place with a very friendly and welcoming staff. It has a great ambiance and is full of interesting textures and objects from its long history. It is beautifully placed in the old part of Rethymno - an easy walk to the old harbour and to all the places in the old town. Like the other reviewer below we stayed in Room 106 and it was terrific. There is another room which was part of the old monastery, all in stone with arches, but it was being renovated when we were there. Also: in February, the rate was not nearly as much as suggested elsewhere on this site - we paid 70 Euros a night and it would have a bargain at twice the price.

Travelling is about immersing yourself in the culture and beauty of other places and we found this the moment we walked into the enchanting foyer with mosaic tiled floor of this unassuming hotel. Once a monastery and parts of is dating back four hundred years, the Veneto is one of those places you wish to share with everyone but secretely hope no one else finds. I could have sat in the foyer for ages just soaking up the ambience of the fountain, subtle lighting, stone walls, and enticing entranceway to the hotel's private cellar. Our room was delightful and included our own terrace and balcony, small kitchenette, ensuite (small) and centrepiece table with a few candles. The terrace overlooked the courtyard filled with flowers and hanging baskets. The courtyard doubles as a breakfast area (included in the tarriff). As it was winter, the restaurant was closed, which gives us a great excuse for returning. Although only planning to stay one night, we returned to the Veneto two nights later (hotels on the more remote southern Crete were closed). We arrived drenched from the rain, and were given a small bottle of raki to drink while staff quickly prepared the room we had previously stayed in before. It doesn't get much better than that. It was a priviledge to stay here.
