I looked all over Seattle and the surrounding areas and even the \"bargain\" chains were astronomical! I was in shock! Apparently the streets of Seattle are paved with gold starting the last week of May all the way thru til' fall!!! Anyway, found an incredible deal on Hotwire, where we had to book without knowing which hotel we were booking until after we paid the reasonable price. To our pleasant surprise, we got the Hilton Bellevue! What a beautiful, upscale hotel! We were VERY happy with the beauty, quality, and cleanliness of our room! I would stay here again in a heartbeat! We got a king bed room and it was sooooo spacious, and included a small loveseat as well! It was perfect for our trip as we were traveling with our two kids and needed the extra space for them to sleep (one slept on the loveseat and the other on an air mattress on the floor) MY ONE TIP: Breakfast is NOT included in the price of your room so be prepared to either buy breakfast at the hotel restaurant (pricey) or go eat breakfast elsewhere.
