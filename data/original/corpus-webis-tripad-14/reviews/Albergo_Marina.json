It was such a nice place and a beautiful place to be! We were there in April so the touristy season hadn't started up much. There weren't many other people there with us. The lemon garden was not open when we were there but we could walk out there and it seems like it would be pretty in the summer. The hotel staff was nice and friendly and the breakfast and lunch buffet were great! The room was pretty big by Italian standards so was the bathroom. It was quiet and comfortable too. It was great to be in the old part of the city. It felt like real Italy, not the touristy part. Albergo Marina is very close to the restaurants and shopping.

They have free luggage and 1 person pick up from the train station, afternoon snacks, cappuccino any time of day and as much as you want, a good breakfast with eggs if wanted ,made by Alessandro who is very nice and works hard. Eraldo recommende a nice Pizza place down the road which makes perfect pizzas and calzone and wont break the bank. It's very close to the beach where you can fo for drinks overlooking the sea, and they even give munchies with your drink.
