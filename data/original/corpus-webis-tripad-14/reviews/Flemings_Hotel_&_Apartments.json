We had stayed previously and had a few issues which we put to the manager. We were invited back to stay with the managers assurance that he could change our mind about the hotel. He was right. The room was a lovely, large king size room with a sofa area and was airy and bright. On our previous stay, the noise was very much an issue but this time it was extremely quiet - the management had obviously taken on board our point about the soundproofing and allocated us a room accordingly. The bathroom was also very spacious and everything was extremely clean. We were welcomed with a gift of fruit and on our last night were given a gift of pastries and fruit as a thank you for staying with them. Not sure if everyone gets this or we were just treated extra special but it was certainly a nice touch. Breakfast was not up to much unfortunately, hard poached eggs and burnt sausages, but there was lots to choose from and the second morning was slightly better as we knew what to avoid! All in all, this time round our stay was great, the staff are very friendly and efficient and we would not hesitate to recommend it to other travellers- you cannot beat the location and it is head and shoulders above the Hilton Green Park which is directly opposite the hotel, where we stayed on our last night - so if anyone is thinking of going there - dont!
