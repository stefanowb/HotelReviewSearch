We stayed in one of the cottages rather than in the main building and the room was large and had a double and a single bed. It was very clean with stylish d\u00e9cor and windows with what would be great views overlooking the Himalayas. The lack of views on some occasions is made up for by the great garden area, that is obviously well cared for and full of flowers in pots and flower bed areas \u2013 I spent a lovely morning here eating breakfast in the sun and taking loads of photos.
