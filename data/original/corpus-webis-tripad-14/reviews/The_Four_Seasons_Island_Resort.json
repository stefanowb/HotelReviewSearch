The waitress apologized for the long wait and did offer us a free drink, but we just wanted to get our food. With that being said, the prime rib I had was one of the best I've ever had.

Steve, the front desk manager, was able to put us in a regular room, which was awesome with coffee on the balcony overlooking the bridge and golf course (sunny side, which felt good on a semi-chilly morning.). We went on to our destination, where we had planned to stay 4 nights. After one day seeing the island (which was fun, but city accommodations not) we decided to return to the Four Seasons--we had told Steve we'd be back, but he probably hadn't expected us that soon! Got our same room and it was a perfect end to our trip. Also, I wanted to have the Bazinga Shrimp a couple of more times! All meals are first class and you can go casual. Witnessed an emergency ambulance situation at the front desk and Lloyd, Michelle and staff all pitched in like the family they are. The gal involved was able to mention that she had promised us a tour of one of the luxury suites as she was being wheeled out--how dedicated is that??

The Four Seasons is a wonderful resort. We brought our bikes and thought it was great to be able to ride our bikes into Michigan. The front desk staff was very helpful. They even drew us a map to help us get to Morgan Park to see the waterfalls. The room was lovely with a full kitchen and fridge. I did notice that there were very few dishes so if we had actually used the kitchen and cooked a meal it might have been an issue, but we did not. The hot tub was under construction while we were there, but we enjoyed the pool. We rented a canoe and paddled around the island which was very fun. We will return for sure. We all had a great time. We have a four wheeler and next time we will bring it with as the trails are right on the other side of the bridge. What a wonderful scenic relaxing resort.

I had heard good things about the place from friends and the Trip Advisor reviews had been great but I was still surprised at the level of service and natural beauty of the Resort. We don't play golf but after seeing the course even my husband wants to learn how to play! Both dinners at the Steakhouse were just amazing. It was so nice to sit in the glass enclosed porch and look out at the golf course. The staff is top notch and attentive to our every need. The food was perfection. The chef is sooo talented - it has been a long time since I have had food this delicious and it was so much more than just the usual selections of steaks and shrimp. Our room was a hot tub suite and was spotless and very comfortable with a kitchen and living area and a walk out patio overlooking the golf course. The pool was wonderful. so often hotel pools are closed in and gloomy but this huge pool area was brightly lit with large windows with a patio with wicker chairs and chaises just outside the door. We did spend both nights after dinner in the Lounge and the entertainment and ambiance was perfect - lots of fun. The grounds were totally immaculate, neatly trimmed and cared for. Even the Pro Shop was lovely with a great selection of clothing and very friendly and helpful manager. but of all the staff we encountered - and they were all outstanding - our favorite was Tyler. He is certainly a credit to the Resort and goes way beyond what is needed for everything. I have learned that you can tell a lot about a hotel or resort by looking at the staff. When it is obvious that they love their job then you know this is a place you will enjoy. The location in the river was so quiet and restful and I LOVE the old railroad bridge you cross to enter the grounds. This is the perfect place to come for a getaway, a golf outing or fishing the river - whatever you want. We did get to see some of the business facilities and they are just like the rest of the resort - top notch and suitable for just about any corporate event. I still can't believe this place is here and that it has taken me this long to discover it! We are looking forward to another visit as soon as we can get away.
