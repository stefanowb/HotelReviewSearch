Although our room wasn't large, it was well-appointed, with a balcony that extended the length of the room and bathroom, overlooking the hotel courtyard, which was quiet and serene. We were on the 6 floor and just passed the elevators was an outdoor roof area with tables and chairs and a panorama view of the city. The staff and concierge were friendly and helpful. We are IC members and turned in points for one free night, which really helped against the euro. A wonderful buffet breakfast was also included with our membership. IC membership is a great deal, offering several nice perks, along with lovely hotels in prime locations throughout the world.", "title": "Delightful hotel!", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "sandy31", "date": "July 5, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3636016}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved the hotel", "text": "This hotel has the best location in town.

We were a little concerned about arriving after midnight , but Pino, the concierege, arranged transportation and everything went like clockwork. We looked forward to breakfast in the mornings and our room was fresh and clean. Being located at the top of the Spanish Steps is a great plus, as you get some fresh air and escape a little of the smog/fumes that accumulate in the lower streets. We considered staying closer to the Piazza Navona, but to be honest, we are glad that we didn't - again fumes. I note this because my husband and I are great allergy sufferers and found that we were very comfortable where we stayed. The area of the Spanish Steps is definite walking distance to all locations as we walked to most of the central areas of Rome and to Vatican City (about 20 min). Our only complaint was being initially placed in a room on a smoking floor when we had specifically asked for a non-smoking room and confirmed that. Also, we were booked into a deluxe room and the first room was not. We merely rang the front desk and they showed us 2 other rooms (this is at 1AM), one of which was exactly what we had booked. Once I showed the reservation details of the room specs from the internet, we had no problem. We were also given a 4 PM checkout. We would definitely stay here again.
