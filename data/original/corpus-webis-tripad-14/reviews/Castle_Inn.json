Before I even got there I wanted to write a grand review. Varsa handled my reservation and was also on duty for the 3 nights me and my boyfriend stayed there, and she was extremely helpful from the first time I called to the time of checkout. We did not experience any problems while there. In fact, on the first day we returned to our room and the cleaning staff had left our window open to air the room out (screen was closed, though), so we went to the front desk to request that they not do this (just our own preference), and it was immediately put on the cleaning staff list of special instructions. Needless to say, the window was never left open again. The accommodations were perfect. If you're expecting rose petals in your bathroom and a foot massage with bon bons upon awakening, you a) may be spending too much time in your room anyway, but b) should look elsewhere, because these accommodations are great for people who want a good, safe, convenient location with good service (the fridge and microwave were a definite plus). If you're looking for the latter, then book here. The free parking was EXCELLENT. Buyer beware - if you think you're getting a \"bargain\" at some of the other hotels which do not have free parking, think again. You could pay upwards of $25+ per day for parking alone, and even more if they don't grant you in-and-out access during the day. Do the math and in most cases you'll probably come out dollars ahead if you stay here instead. There were some great restaurants in the area (Aroma Cafe and the Bagelry are worth special mention...and you MUST go to Firefly which is all the way across town but well worth it), as well as a Walgreens literally just around the corner (at the time of this review) in case you forgot something. For those who might be a little swayed by the one unsatisfied reviewer who complained that this hotel isn't as close to the Wharf as advertised, I'd say this -- downtown San Fran is not like Manhattan...it's pretty small and everything is fairly easy to get to. It took us about 20 min by cable car, including the walk from the hotel to the stop and the trip down to the wharf. Plus you get some great photo ops (including Lombard's one crooked block) that way! And in terms of being told to hold it down, the sign for quiet hours is clearly posted...I'd want a hotel manager to do the same thing if there were guests disturbing my sleep even if they didn't mean to. Again, this hotel was fabulous. Thanks to Varsha and Sy for a wonderful experience.

This hotel is right near bus routes 47 and 49 and not that far from the starting point of the California Cable Car Line (California and Van Ness). If you ride the cable cars and buses a few times each in a given day, buy the all-you-can-ride day pass. Varsa (owner) was very helpful on the phone when I made the reservation. She wasn't there when we stayed, (would have liked to chat with her in person), but the husband and wife team working helped us with restaurants, maps, where to avoid, where best to catch the cable cars, etc. The room is decent size for the city. It was fairly quiet, and very clean. The elevator worked well. It was nice having a fridge since we were leaving early for the airport on our 2nd day. I'd recommend stocking up on food from the Real Food organic market just around the corner on Polk St (kinda pricey, but aren't most organic markets). Breakfast at this hotel was skimpy but I never expect much from continental breakfast. Good coffee could also be had around the corner on Polk at the Royal Ground, and 1/2 way decent bagels at the San Francisco Bagelry (Polk as well). The 20 something crowd would like the proximity of this hotel to the bars. Perhaps not as ideal for families with younger kids (no pool, no green space to run around), but this is an urban area after all.", "title": "A solid choice with very good location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "BP_Traveler_39", "date": "August 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8444427, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Skimpy breakfast"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Perfect place to stay!", "text": "Found the hotel in the AAA book.
