The hotel is in an excellent location, about a 10 minute walk to the bus or train station. It is far enough away from the crowded St. Mark's area, yet not a long walk or vaporetto ride from that or any other area in Venice. We opted for the canal view room this time after having a garden view room last time. I'm a light sleeper, but I found the canal view room to be a quiet option with a great view. I'm not a big breakfast person, so I found the offerings to be sufficient. Rolls, ham and cheese, and yogurt, along with juice was fine with me. People looking for the big American style buffet breakfast will be disappointed in most European hotels, as that is not how they do breakfast. The hotel staff is helpful with recommendations for dining or sightseeing, and they even offer a water taxi to Murano in the morning for guests. We didn't take advantage of that service, but my understanding is that you must get yourself back on your own. Still, that is still a very generous service to provide for guests. There is a computer in the lobby for guests, but you must purchase a card to use the computer. That was unusual, as any other hotel I've stayed in offered free use of a computer for guests, but it was not a show stopper. In closing, the hotel is very clean and full of character.

The breakfast is often talked about on tripadvisor, it consists of cereals, fruit juice, various crossants, which were ok, an interesting mix of sugar, marmalade, chocolate, not in the same one, but the French do make the best not the Italians. There is Ham, cheese, hard boiled eggs and desserts!! Breakfast is not the most inspiring but its ok, I have heard from others that it sounds typical for the area. I had much worse in Spain once. There was an occassional smell, its Venice it does. Room sizes do vary a lot, but its an old building and not uniform. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. We had a room overlooking the canal, it can be noisy, with boats, its venetian traffic in the early morning, people are going to work, deliveries are being made. If you want to sleep in stay at the back of the hotel overlooking the garden. The Hotel could do with a bar for evenings, being such a quiet area at night there are restaurants near by, and only 1 small very typical venetian bar next door, but its small and for us it was too cold to sit outside in the evening.", "title": "Great Hotel in Quiet Area", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "lizrob09", "date": "April 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157698117}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Lovely 4 night stay with my husband in April 2013.

Also only a 5 minute walk from the bus/train station and you can easily walk even with a roller case. Stayed in room 226 which was very spacious and always spotless. This room only has a shower which we didn't mind. This was an inside room with courtyard view so not much light, however we had only paid for a classic room and were very happy with this. We were always out all day so canal views were not important to us. The room was extremely quiet. I noticed some rooms were extremely small so best emailing the hotel and asking for a specific room if possible. Breakfast was continental. Pastries, cereals, meat and cheese, coffee, tea etc. It was simple but a good start to the day. The breakfast area flooded one day when we were there, but this is Venice so to be expected especially at this time of year in some ground floor areas.
