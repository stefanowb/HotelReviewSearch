Firstly free wifi, this was limited to 20 mins a day but you had to log in and if you didnt you don't accumulate it you just lose it and acting for it was expensive. We thought this a little strange ESP as its pretty standard now, even in places like India, even Asda has free wifi in its stores! Clearly it doesnt cost the hotel anymore. Second issue, breakfast on the first day was v busy and the staff were really good at dealing with everyone. My husband was asked if he wanted a coffee, my husband said yes assuming it was part of thebreakfast buffet we had paid for. The waitor brought him an expresso and charged us for it, we didn't realise until the following day when he asked for one and they told him they would charge for it. This came up on our bill at the end of our stay and I queried it but the staff member wouldn't take it off.", "title": "Lovely hotel centrally located but not free wifi", "user": "redsoniahelen", "date": "March 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155124709}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Apart from the bed, which was one of the most comfortable I can remember in any hotel, the rest of the experience was distinctly average.

The rooms themselves are pretty great and, unlike many other Wellington hotels, come with an air-conditioner. The rooms also have fridge, toaster and stove-top (though cookware must be requested). That said, small things stop this from being a five-star hotel. For starters, the laundry service is prohibitively expensive ($6/article). It is possible to do a traveller's wash but why you should have to in a hotel at this price is beyond me. Other small annoyances on my trip include the toilet becoming quite pungent after flushing and a 2% surcharge on credit card payments. That said, it's a fine hotel for sleeping (especially in summer) with some great package inclusions.
