It is a bit far out from the centre, about a 30 min tram ride, but this gave us the opportunity to see the sights of Amsterdam that we would have otherwise missed, also the tram ride is reasonable at a couple of euros and transport is very frequent. The hotel is very clean and tidy and the reception staff are helpful. We even received a complimentary upgrade on arrival to a superior room as we were celebrating our anniversary. As we stayed during an unusually hot period, the air conditioned room was appreciated. This is a pleasant reasonable hotel in a quiet location and the only negative comment I could make is that it is a bit of a distance from the town centre.", "title": "clean and tidy hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "t.i.n.a.31", "date": "July 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5523559, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 location"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Out of the way", "text": "So far from the center of Amsterdam you might as well have stayed in Kiev. They don't tell you that when you register. It was a 30 minute tram ride--right past cool restaurants, beautiful canals, pretty architecture..............not one of which I could visit because the tram just kept on going until I got to this hotel. If you like \"institutional\" to describe your hotel then you will be pleased as punch at the Golden Tulip in West Amsterdam. On the way to scope out my room (past cinder block walls, YES, CINDER BLOCK WALLS, you read right--now sit back down) I conversed with the reception agent. She related that this place used to be a nursing home, which explains a lot. The actual interior of the rooms is ok and fairly clean (no safe which is weird for a 4-star). The food at the restaurant (a mint green-colored metal box that was probably constructed in the '70s--they do not tear anything down here) was mixed. Great Thai soup and apple strudel but the rest was just ok. The service is, well, European, and profoundly slow. If you tire of the smoke drifting in from the the \"gerrymandered\" smoking section that envelopes you you can just wheel yourself out to the patio and watch the birds until naptime.
