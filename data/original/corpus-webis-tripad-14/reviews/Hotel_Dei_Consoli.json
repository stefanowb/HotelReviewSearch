My room was small (average size for an older hotel in a city), but very nicely appointed - wood paneling, fantastic crown moulding, beautiful wallpaper, and soft sheets. Even though my room faced a busy street, it was very quiet, probably due to triple pane windows. The cable was good - several channels in English. Also, the breakfast was spectacular - I wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to leave and could have enjoyed it more. The only problem was that the front desk attendant on duty for most of my stay was very cranky. He spoke English, and I'm sure would have helped me if I'd asked for anything, but would just be sort of surly about it.
