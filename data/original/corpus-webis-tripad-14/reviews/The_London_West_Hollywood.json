The hotel is lovely, clean & modern with nice big spacious rooms & bathrooms but our stay was completely marred by the treatment at the pool by one of the attendants. On arrival were asked if we had 1 room or 2 when we said 1 we were told we (my husband & I)could have a lounger but not my son as it was 2 loungers per room - ARE YOU SERIOUS?? My son spent a few minutes sitting at the bottom of ours but then went back to the room as he was totally embarrassed. To make matters worse the pool area was fairly empty so there were ample loungers available!! Then to add insult to injury a single man arrived with his dog about 20 minutes later & he got a lounger for him & one for THE DOG!!! UNBELIEVABLE!! After seeing this, I called my son to the room told him to come down & take a lounger however we stayed a short while & didn't visit the pool again for the duration of our stay. When asked on checkout if everything was Ok & I started \"well not really...\" it was obvious that the clerk didnot want a complaint & swiftly interrupted \"I mean't with your bill\". In hindsight I should have made more of an issue when it happened or on check out but I'm generally not one to complain & didn't want to further embarass my son at the time. Aside from this incident - which DID ruin the entire stay - check in, valet, bell hop & service staff were very polite. Breakfast was fairly good with a nice choice. Dinner in Gordon Ramsey was quite possibly one of the worst meals I've ever eaten (will review seperately). Valet parking $32/day.

Breakfast was good for the first two days then it was all the same n we all got fed up of the quiche etc a bit of variation would've been good, we did eat on the roof terrace one night n ordered the burger which had blood streaming out of it so we sent it back to be given the same again so we were not charged for it my husband ordered fish n chips which was two tiny bits of stinking fish and six crisps for 40 dollars cmon Gordon get a grip hence we never ate there again , the pool area was very nice but avoid the cabannas they quote you 250 dollars for a six hour stint but after tax etc the bill was 360 dollars not worth that and we were only allowed two sun loungers between 6 of us as the pool area was busy so basically 4 of us had to sit in the cabanna all day,,, the pool was a magnet for celebrities when we were there Justin beiber , selena gomaz,nicki Clark,and Hugh hefners bunny girls were all staying there n probably lots of others that we didn't recognise. Over all a nice hotel clean throughout.

It it was indeed very nice 3 day stay. Room are very nicely appointed (I wouldn't call them suites tho) with all amenities possible. Loved the toiletries and the softest bed ever. Also, the sheets have a little scent which we liked very much (but some some people might not). The staff is very nice, however one can perceive them a little snobbish at times. The Lobby is nice while corridors get very stuffy over the day (bad ventilation). Also, they tend to have a lot of private events on the roof (where the pool is). As a compensation they offer free cocktails at 5. If you want to use the pool, plan on doing that in the morning. Oh, and their bathrooms aver very very nice and spacious (bathtub for two, double shower, ...lots of towels, bathrobes,) - very good.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "hwoodhills", "date": "August 4, 2011", "id": 116271003}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "Concierge: incompetent.
