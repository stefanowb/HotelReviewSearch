They were very disorganized at check in, we had to wait for our room even though it was after 1400. Once checked in, the Glockenhof was fine, nice room and very clean. Good location in Zurich, close to everything. We were going to stay here for our flight out but changed to the Hilton at the airport since our flight departed in the a.m. The Hilton was great and we were very happy with that decision.", "title": "Decent enough place, good location", "user": "LGTripper", "date": "October 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10058702, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nice and nice room", "disliked": "\u2014 check in"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in the BW Premier Glockenhof on the first night of our arrival in Zurich from the States. We had a room with a double and a single and it was extremely large. The pictures on the hotel website are right on -- and the rooms are comfortable, large and well maintained. My husband wasn't thrilled with the bathrooms, which are very modern and include a separate shower, bath and toilet area -- the only glass that was frosted was the toilet area and the rest of the area, including the shower, could be easily viewed from the main sleeping area. We had a bit of trouble operating the lights upon arrival due to a combination of jetlag and too many switches, but we finally got the hang of it. Nice sitting area -- with leather chair and loveseat and table. Room was literally huge and very comfortable. Also included were robes and slippers which made the hardwood floors much more comfortable.", "title": "Beautiful Hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Roofie", "date": "August 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 8370589, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Rooms and garden cafe", "disliked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006", "text": "The hotel also had a lovely garden cafe with great service.

I took me ages to find out how the lighting system works, was even afraid I would have to sleep with the lights on. The hotel should absolutely provide an explanation of how it works. Also, I would have much preferred wall-to-wall carpeting instead of the bare wooden floor, but I presume it is more hygienic. Otherwise everything fine, it has some nice touches like a Nespresso coffee machine and capsules. Travelers please take note that most Swiss hotels still have not understood that air-conditioning now is a must - this hotel has it. In Summer, this alone justifies the quite steep price (a good breakfast is also included).
