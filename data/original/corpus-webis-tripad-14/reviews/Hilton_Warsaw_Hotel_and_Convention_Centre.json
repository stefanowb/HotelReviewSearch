Wonderfull room with separate shower and tub. Could have skipped the Plus thing since I was I no need of a working area in the room but the price difference is next to nothing. Impeccable service at reception and in bar and restaurant. Hotel is almost next to new occupation museum but to far from city center to walk. Taxi to center is only about 20 zl. What else is there to criticize? A hotel like this is stylish - not cozy. Parking is to expensive 100 zl/night. I parked in the street without paying without any problems. Carpet in room I stayed had some stains but was otherwise very clean. Prices in restaurant and bar is a lot higher then in the city in general (but quality and service is very good), The provided slippers and bathrobe are to small for me. There is nowhere to smoke indoors unless you get a smoking room, and I would imagine it will quite cold smoking outside on the terrace in the winter. However my biggest complaint was that the channels on the TV in the bedroom are different from the channels on the TV in the bathroom. Having lowered my body into the bathtub preparing to relax with a gin and tonic I found to my horror that most of the channels in the bathroom were German or Polish.
