We rented A4 (found it on VRBO.com) on the second floor of the building closest to the beach and pool and hated to leave. The 2 BR 2 bath unit was perfect for four people and Roberto and Selene were wonderful hosts. The view is fantastic and we spent most of the time on the veranda or in the clear water swimming, snorkeling or just lounging. We enjoyed the walk on the beach to town (10 minutes+), of course we usually had to stop at Sarah's Beach (sp?) Bar (100' away) or Ojo de Agua (5 minutes). If you want something in the condo before you get there (we wanted tequila, ice and red wine) Roberto and Selene will be happy to accomodate you.

I stayed in Casita De Arte, which I am convinced is the best unit, as the view was extraordinary! I woke every morning to a view of the crystalline Caribbean sea. The view of the pool, just steps from the porch, also added to the experience. All around the beautiful and meticulously maintained grounds, there are coconut trees, flowering plants and bushes, and overhead, exotic pelicans fly. It feels unreal, so be prepared for it to take a few days for it to sink in that you are not dreaming. Inside the unit, it is very tastefully decorated, as art abounds. If you appreciate fine art, this is the place for you. The unit sleeps six comfortably, so it was more than enough space for my friend and I. Though there is a kitchen with all the amenities, we found the local food so delicious and reasonably priced, we just decided not to cook. Day trips to Playa Del Carmen, Cozumel and to Mayan Ruins are easily doable, even for the not-so seasoned traveler, because there are a number of kiosks in town that offer 'packages' to various attractions. The oddest part is that I lost 5 pounds on this vacation from all the swimming, and walking to town...which can be done by way of beach, or on the street. Either way, the walk is neither too long, or too short.

We absolutely loved it there. It was an easy walk to town either on the street or down the beach. There are so many restaurants to choose from in town that you never have to eat at the same place twice. Our room was cleaned once while we were there. There were some things of value that were left out and nothing was touched. We felt very safe here. We really liked going to the town square in the evening and just people watch and enjoying the beautiful weather. The view from our balcony was exactly as shown on VRBO.com. The last morning we were there we saw a gorgeous sunrise. It looks out over the pool then right onto the beach. A pool is usually a must for me when on vacation, but we never used it. We cooled off by swimming and snorkeling in the ocean. There is a lot of seaweed that washes up on the beach, but a tractor came by every morning and cleaned it up. My fianc\u00e9 had a lot of fun snorkeling right from the beach even though there is not a lot to see. He did find some great shells and sand dollars on one of his snorkeling ventures. There is a little bar right on the beach, just south of the property, that was open most days. Roberto was very nice. He helped us take our luggage up to our condo when we arrived\u2026this was very much appreciated after a long night of travel. He also gave us suggestions of good places to eat. This is the type of place we like to stay when on vacation. We stayed the 2nd half of our vacation in Cancun at the Ritz Carlton.
