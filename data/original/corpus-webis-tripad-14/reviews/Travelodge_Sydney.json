After reading all of the other reviews, we decided to try this place out and we are glad that we did. The staff was very helpful and we did not have any issues at all with the room. Our request for a specific room was granted and they were very nice about giving us our room a little early. After flying from the US, being able to go to our room right away was a very nice and unexpected touch. The room was very clean and the towels were changed every day. Our only issue was with the shower, the water wasn't always consistent. Several times we had to get out of the flow because it would change to really hot or really cold for a minute or so. Other than that we didn't have any issues. The kitchenette was a nice touch too. We were able to save a lot of money by keeping leftovers and buying some snacks at the stores in town. The hotel is also in a nice location, easy walk from the Museum station. When you arrive, book the shuttle service back to the airport, it is cheaper than paying the station fee from the subway and it is nice to have door to door service.

The rooms were acceptable, clean and had the facilities I would expect - TV, tea making facilities, iron. There was also a fridge and microwave if you are staying for a while or on a budget.
