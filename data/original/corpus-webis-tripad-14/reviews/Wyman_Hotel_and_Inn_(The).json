The Wyman is a lovely hotel, beautifully restored, clean and well maintained. We truly enjoyed getting to know the owners, Rodger and Tana Wrubilk - they take a personal interest in their guests and strive to provide the best service possible. Their breakfasts are not your run of the mill hotel breakfasts - Rodger and Tana put on a full 'french cuisine' breakfast in a beautifully appointed side-room. They also have a wine & hors d'ouvers / tea & snacks reception each afternoon in the lobby at 5pm. It's a great time to socialize with the other guests, get to know people and generally relax.

The good down duvets in each room provide a comfortable sleeping temperature, but make sure your thermal layers are next to the bed when you want to get up.
