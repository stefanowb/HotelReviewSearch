The room we stayed in was not out dated, the furniture was a bit old but the bath and the bed were great. We did not use the pool it was to cold also as for parking it seems every where we drove in the inner city parking was expensive so I think there parking fee was in line. We took a cab up to the gas lamp district $6.00 cheaper than parking in that area. the Hotel is walking distance to lots of attractions and dining", "title": "Great Location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Paul C", "date": "July 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166183199}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is nice and the staff very good and helpful. We slept in and often had a problem getting the room cleaned later in the day but they did respond with coffee and clean towels when called. Restaurant was good and close to others that are good, The bell service very good and the shuttle to Horton Plaza and the Zoo helpful. We had a top floor Ocean View most expensive room and the wireless internet was very poor there. The acknowledged they knew this but had no fix and they did not have a range extender. We often had 1 or 2 bars and it made Skype work terrible. I did not see the small type on the phone that said long distance is billed and not free. First Wyndham I have been at that charged. They even charged for the local area code 858 and 760 changes but removed those when questioned. Still because the wireless was so bad and Skype was not working well that I ended up paying $83.00 in long distance. So if you are going to need internet book a cheaper interior room where internet is good and sadly lose the ocean view room. We are from South America and did not have a US cell phone so we had to use the hotel phone. Also Outlook will not send out of their internet supplier and it took 5 calls and 3 days before they could get someone to get the right codes to send out email. Otherwise the hotel was very good. If they fix the bad wireless, do a better job of informing on phone calls billed and know what to do for outlook they would be excellent and have 5 stars.", "title": "Good hotel, nice staff, a few problems with internet service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mounque B", "date": "July 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166103345}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed three nights after the conversion to Wyndham brand. Previously a Holiday Inn. The change took place literally two days before we arrived so the only difference was the signs. Check-in was a breeze and the staff is very polite, friendly and helpful. Hotel is in serious need of a remodeling. Rooms are large, roomy but pretty beat up (see pic). Everything is clean, just worn. The price we received as a flight crew was very reasonable for the class of hotel. Because the occupancy was light, they gave us bay view rooms, with a beautiful view. If you can't stand airport noise, you will not want a bay view room. The jet traffic is loud with your sliding door open. The airport shuts down after 11:30 PM but starts up again at 6:30 AM. I don't mind it, but late sleepers will not. Bed was firm, and reasonably comfortable, pillows were just OK. Bathroom was fine. The sink faucet had really low water pressure, though the shower was fine. WiFi was weak, but useable. I wouldn\u2019t count on streaming video, but works fine for general surfing. No microwave or fridge. No safe. The balcony rails for adjoining rooms are not walled or blocked in any way. So someone could easily jump the rail and loot your room. I would be careful to lock the sliding door when you leave. No free breakfast, but the Elephant and Castle Pub in the lobby has excellent food. The staff there is super and the prices are moderate. There are two fitness rooms, each across the pool from each other. A little odd. One has cardio equipment, 3 treads, 2(?) elliptical and a couple of bikes. The other has REALLY dated weight machines. Many of which need overhaul or replacing. The bushings in much of the equipment is worn to the point that the movement is jerky and bordering on useless. There are a couple of benches and dumbells too. Pool seems nice. Moderately sized. Never saw anyone but kids swimming, but it looked clean and the area around the pool was well kept.", "title": "Dated, but good value.
