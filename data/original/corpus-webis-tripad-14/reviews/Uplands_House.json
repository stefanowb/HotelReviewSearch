My main gripe is that during our stay the hotel was used by people that I can only describe as 'odd'. As soon as they had a drink in the evening noise levels went through the roof, this increased into the early hours as we were trying to sleep yet all we could hear were people rampaging through the corridors shouting out obscenities. A colleague went out to investigate what all the noise was about and all he could see were male guests wandering around obviously highly intoxicated. One guest was seen numerous times during the early hours just staggering around in search of someone. I would like to think that in future the DeVere group either have a more rigorous policy on serving alcohol or they turn away groups that contain undesirables.", "title": "Business trip ruined by other guests", "user": "Homecountiesman", "date": "February 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 56484568}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We managed to book this hotel at the bargain rate of \u00a329 a night; we have paid much more than that in this area for poor quality bed and breakfasts.", "title": "Good value for money if you get a deal, very helpful staff.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HackenbushCyprus", "date": "February 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 55012485}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "excellent hotel", "text": "The first room we were given was at the far end of the hotel, was very small, and wireless access did not work.

We got a rate of \u00a319 in the De Vere sale so we really cannot moan. The location is beautiful and tranquil. We had a ground floor double room that had patio doors which opened out on to a gorgeous garden. The room was dated but the bed was comfy it had a large wardrobe, hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities and the bathroom was fine. The shower was over the bath, good pressure and plenty of hot water. The tv was tiny and a small fridge would be handy. We did not eat here, the venue is more suitable for conferences so there was a large group in the restaurant. It also looked quite expensive but I cannot comment on the value. I found the staff really helpful and there is free wifi and a terminal in reception. The car park is a little walk from the rooms but I have walked further in other hotels. The hallways are open and the fact that they are tiled makes it quite noisy when people walk past or are wheeling cases. The hotel is in a remote location and is about a \u00a37 taxi fare from High Wycombe station.
