What I didn't expect was the dated look and feel of the hallways, rooms, and executive lounge. The gym and pool area was Excellent! There is a seperate gym for cardio and for weights.

My husband and I look forward to the hot shower and comfy king bed every time. We request an Easton View and always get it. Customer Service is superior and check in / out is always fast and friendly. Saturday my 7 year old daughter and I went to the lobby to enjoy the warm fire and live music.
