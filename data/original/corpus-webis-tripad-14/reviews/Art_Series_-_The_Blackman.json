Great room on 16th floor, with awesome views. Fantastic amenities and very comfy bed, but we felt a few more instructions on where things were located and how some things work would be handy. I also think that the lighting in the room could be much better. It was hard to even read by. Guest experience staff were always helpful and friendly, however i do feel that i must point out some shortcomings that you wouldnt expect from a 5 star hotel, that need to be looked at. I was offered a choice of 4 newspapers, from which i chose three. Normally in other hotels i have stayed in, these were left outside your door before 6am. I had to chase these up, and never received 3 papers at any one time, and none at all on check out day. Milk and sugar was not replenished, and we also had to request more dishwashing liquid as well, so the hotel is being let down by housekeeping. This should not happen ever in a 5 star hotel in my opinion. Also, as i had paid for my hotel & flights in full through Expedia, i was alarmed to see that on my hotel bill that you could access on your TV screen, that each day we stayed was showing in arrears. I had to sort this out with them, which was something i would also not expect to happen. These things aside, The Blackman is in a great location, with trams virtually at your door, it was really quiet, but so close to all Marvellous Melbourne has to offer, and once they iron out some teething problems, will always be a popular destination to stay at.", "title": "Very Good Location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Bearcat30", "date": "October 18, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 84006535}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a great weekend at the Blackman.

WifFi/Broadband was $9 a day in room. The lovely balcony with table and chairs had views across the city and was perfect to sit on with a glass of wine at the end of the day. We did a number of long trips so getting up early and watching the sun rise from one's bed was a little luxury. We got a deal online at $169 a night and at this price the room was amazing value. Most other hotels I looked at of equal quality were well into the $200's easily. Location wise The Blackman is well situated as it sits almost halfway between the City and St Kilda's and the Tram is right outside. We didn't use it as we had a hire car - and there is secure parking directly under the hotel. This was $20 a night which is a tad on the expensive side but fantastically convenient.

Checkin staff were friendly and helpful, the room was gorgeous, so many unique touches. The mini kitchen was amazing..although we only made tea and coffee. I think the bed was the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel. It was great having a balcony and being able to open a door to get fresh air. We had breakfast in the cafe downstairs every morning - fantastic quality, value and service.", "title": "Loved everything about it", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Louie67", "date": "June 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 112100062}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific", "city": "Melbourne"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 15, "average": 63, "very good": 221, "terrible": 17, "excellent": 652}, "aka": "Art Series - The Blackman Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0280898876404, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "With a contemporary, boutique interior and an enviable St Kilda Road location, just a stones throw from Melbourne\u2019s CBD, The Blackman Hotel will inspire Melbourne\u2019s imagination.
