The service was prompt, the staff were friendly. But the real joy is in the rooms itself. We booked the lowest rate ($255) so we were not too high up (7th).

The bed is one of the best beds I've slept in. The shower and bathroom are very modern, although my wife was embarassed at using the shower because some of the windows aren't frosted so anyone looking up can totally see you if they're paying attention. Maybe thats part of the reason that people want to stay here: watch and be watched.

Based in the Lower East Side, you couldn't get much hipper. everything, and i mean everything you could need is on your doorstep-bars, resturants you name it. It was such a major effort not be lazy and wander to yet another fabulous little abode for our evenings entertainment. On arrival we did have a slight quibble as there was no doorman and the reception area isn't immediately obvious(it's on the 2nd floor). However this was instantly dismissed when we were greeted by very friendly and helpful reception staff. Our room...well it was amazing. If you like contemporary furnishings , and neutral tones , with amazing views then this place is for you. If you like , more traditional/or floral decor then this will not work for you. The bathroom was a delight-views from the bath can't be missed looking out over the city , you just can't beat it. Oh and did i say the tub is definitely big enough for two.The tempur bed makes every nights sleep dreamy...There was nothing wrong with our room in the slightest , however our neighbour smoked and we could smell this in our bathroom.Not being smokers it made us feel a bit sick .After a quick chat with the reception staff they moved us (i mean literally ) to another room without a quibble to another room with amazing views of city up and downtown.A free breakfast included in the price, nothing fancy . However if you want to push the boat out the food in the hotel is AMAZING! And if your lucky enough to be there over the weekend then maybe you'll be served by Giles the lovely waiter. That said , i found the level of service not on the same level as that in the hotel.I felt that some of the waiting staff were more concerned with networking than the job they were being paid to do.If you're feeling tired though, the hotel bar is the place to be, the music rocks, the cocktails rock and thre is a really eclectic crowd to observe.Oh i forgot to mention free internet use if you haven't remembered your laptop.

The staff we dealt with were uniformly nice and tried to help, but the hotel seems pervaded by a sort of cluelessness (many of the other reviews have noted this). Favorite example: while checking out, the woman at the counter kept me waiting a few minutes while she dealt with a customer complaining about food-poisoning from the room-service breakfast, and then chatted with her colleagues about what to tell him... really not something to do in front of another client! (We also ordered room service and had no problems.) All this is really vastly outweighed by the hotel's many charms. The vews of New York through the full-wall windows are just unbeatable, and the Rivington has the benefit of being the only tall building in the area (something you can't get in midtown, no matter what the price). The curtains and shades retract at the press of a bedside button. The beds are top-notch though a little strange (tempur-pedic memory foam). The bathroom products are excellent. Free WiFi that works seamlessly. Great minibar. Very reasonable rates. The neighborhood is my new New York favorite, close to all of downtown (SoHo, East Village, Tribeca) with a real culinary renaissance going on right now, lots of exciting new restaurants and clubs within a few blocks.
