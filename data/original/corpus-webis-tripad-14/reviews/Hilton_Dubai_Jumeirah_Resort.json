I'd recommend going to the Burj Al Arab for drinks in the \"sky bar\" but you have to pre book. Also go to the Dubai mall and the emirates mall, the Dubai mall is better though as it has an aquarium inside with sharks in.

(we were with Emirates). Not happy but was eventually sorted out by Michael the assistant manager,who was great.After an hour though,did have to go and find our luggage. Rooms of a good standard but had a flood of water coming from the base of the bidet in our room and waited twenty minutes for maintenance to come,we had stemmed the flow with our towels,which they did not replace until asked for.Service at breakfast in Oceana was very slow around peak times with people often to having to wait in lounge until called and breakfast was a bit chaotic.Lunch & dinnner better but again service could be quite slow for things like ordering drinks.Biggest criticism would be that service around the pool was a bit slap dash with the staff often just messing around with each other.On one day ordered two orange and lemonades (7 Up) and the barman refused to give me what was left in the can,even though I'd paid for it! Said it would be re-used ?? Upon checkout and settling my room bill in cash,was even short changed! Like I said,not a bad hotel but not a five star service,which is what you are paying for.
