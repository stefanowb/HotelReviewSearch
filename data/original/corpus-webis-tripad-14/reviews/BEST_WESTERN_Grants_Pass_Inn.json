We stayed on the second story of the hotel, and because it is built \"motel-style\" (room entrance from outside), every time someone walked up the stairs or opened the door to their room, the sound was suprisingly loud in our room. This jarring noise continued late into the night and we all found it hard to sleep. Otherwise, the lobby area, continental breakfast and pool is nice. I would try to find alternate accomodations if I was going to stay in Grants Pass, but from the looks of the other hotels we saw going into the town, we might be forced to book here again.", "title": "Nice Hotel but Noisy", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dogbone1002000", "date": "August 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8510838, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The rooms were clean and the staff were friendly", "disliked": "\u2014 The little soundproofing in the rooms"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Value and convenient", "text": "Grants Pass is a convenient stopping point on the way to Washington state and upper Oregon.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 3, 2005", "id": 3986691}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Grants Pass"}, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 20, "very good": 41, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 48}, "aka": "Best Western Grants Pass", "slim_ranking": 0.421052631579}
