Our room had an amazingly large bathroom with a great tub, the only downside is that my husband is very tall and prefers showers. The other slight negative is that the stairs were very very loud as the stairway has no fabric to buffer the echoes and sound, this wasn't a big issue since most foot traffic was during the day.

Breakfast was very pleasant in a nice dining room, shared with the other guests. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this B&B to other visitors. It was both our birthdays and Xavier very kindly looked after us. Brussels is no Rome or Venice, but do not be put off; its a GREAT city to explore and experience. There is not the 'artificial/commercial' tourism you get in other cities; what you get is real Belgian life. Enjoy a walk, and stop a while for something to eat and a beer. You can eat something very nice for c.15 euro per head and a good beer will cost you c.3.50 euro. Brussels also felt very safe to walk around,even late at night.

Everything is within walking distance right between the upper and lower sections of central Brussels.
