The 3rd day my room was 31\u00b0C and I insisted that they move me. If you can, ask for a corner, exterior room which will typically be cooler. The room they moved me to had a door to a balcony and also a window on the other room. Within a few minutes of both being open, my room new room was a frigid 15\u00b0C and the heat was much welcomed.

We travel each year on vacation for 6-7 weeks so we are experienced travelers staying at best hotels. The Ritz has an impressive lobby area, a very friendly staff, and an excellent club level with 5 presentations. But if you are a tourist, not business traveler, there are problems staying here. First, it is far from all tourist attractions which are near downtown. It takes 25 minutes by taxi ($20 with deluxe taxi and $10 with regular taxi) without traffic and 2 to 3 times longer with traffic. Second, the immediate area is not for tourists. There are no department stores, national type restaurants, cafes to people watch etc. The area is called an entertainment area, but really for young people hanging out at subway station. Third, the hotel has no real conceige, has little tourist information, doesn't even sell postcards. Amuch better choice of hotel would be the Westin Chosun in the center of downtown. Other problems staying here are the very hard beds (Korean beds) which may be a problem at other hotels. They will add a comforters on top of the mattress which helps. Other problem is to be sure you stay in the renovated rooms. The unrenovated rooms air conditioning system is terrible. Also they have the old 1990 type TVs as well as furniture.

Some parlour suites have bedrooms with no windows and others have large windows with impressive views (although Seoul is such an ugly city...), depending on the room configuration. I like the parlour suites best because they feel less like a hotel and more like cosy retreat to relax and enjoy life. I have only stayed in an executive suite once, and the style of the rooms was much more glass and modern.
