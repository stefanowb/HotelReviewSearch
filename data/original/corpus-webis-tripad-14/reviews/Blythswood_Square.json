We arrived cranky, and jet-lagged after travelling non-stop for over 24 hours. The staff were kind and efficient, and we were quickly shown to very nice room on the Mezzanine floor. The room was large and comfortable, with cute modern furniture. As it was Boxing Day, the thermal spa was available for hotel guests to use all day. Relaxing in the spa was the perfect way to recover from our flights. We had the continental breakfast the next morning, which was included in our room rate, and it was quite good. The hotel is in a great location, overlooking a charming square. Great value for the rate we paid, and we would definitely stay at the Blythswood again.", "title": "A great stay in Glasgow", "user": "glamtart", "date": "December 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148468791}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Blythswood is one of my favourite venues in Glasgow both for dining and cocktails however I continue to be frustrated by the inconsistency, particularly in terms of service, that is offered.", "title": "Lovely - but not a 5 star experience", "user": "Caledonia_14", "date": "December 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 148150562}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My last visit on 18 December 2012 was to have a pre-Christmas meal with friends.

We ate in the restaurant and chose from the festive menu, which featured interesting touches such as lettuce ice cream. I had the seam bream as a main course, which was tasty, with a lovely crispy skin. The portion sizes were,perhaps, slightly on the small side, although after cheese instead of dessert, I was sated.

Our room was on the second floor and was really pleasant, with a huge bathroom (and a great shower!), a very comfortable bed and a separate space for the luggage. The only thing that could be said against the room was that the view was rather dull, but this did not bother us. The spa is available for hotel guests for free every day between 6am-9am and 6pm-9pm and was well worth a visit!

It was a pleasant surprise to be told our room was ready. We booked a classic room again and were given a room on the 3rd floor. Our room was on the 5th floor last time and I have to admit that I preferred being on the 5th floor. I have absolutely no complaints about the room though and the bed is still one of the most comfortable I have slept in. On our last visit I mentioned that I was disappointed by the breakfast service, not the case this time.
