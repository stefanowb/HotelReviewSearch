When we checked in we found they had overbooked their double queen rooms. The staff immediately asked us if we would mind an upgrade to 2 rooms, both king with a jacuzzi for the price of 1 room with 2 queen beds. Since it was 2 moms/2 daughters we accepted. It was nice to have them offer this BEFORE we had a hassle with them. The staff has been trained well in customer service. The 2 rooms we were given were very large and well kept. They each came with a mini fridge/freezer (yes mini freezer!), coffeemaker. The rooms were well appointed. They also serve a nice continental breakfast in the lobby each morning. For the price, the service, and accommodations, I would definitely stay here again.", "title": "Wonderful Customer Service / Great Rooms", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "sunidlite", "date": "August 16, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3778647}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good and Cheap", "text": "The Phoenix Inn in Wilsonville is a pretty good hotel outside of Portland on I-5.
