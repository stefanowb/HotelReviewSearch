Let me just start by saying I booked through Hotwire. Beware if you want 2 queen beds, Hotwire books a king by default. When we checked in we asked for 2 beds. The front desk clerk said that the hotel was pretty full but she would check. I really wish I would have gotten her name because our room was fantastic! We ended up in a suite with the 2 queens. We ordered room service one morning, the staff there was amazing also. They removed the dirty dishes immediately from the front of our door. All of the staff was always helpful and freindly. The beds were SUPER comfortable. Our room was right by I-64 and we couldn't here much noise from the traffic. We did occasionally here noise other guests but it wasn't a big deal. There were other events going on that weekend so it was to be expected. I would stay at this hotel again. Especially if I'm going to and event at Scottrade Center. It's within very short walking distance. There were a few little things that irritated me. Like one of the beds had a blanket and the other didn't, the fire alarm going off on Friday night (its not like the hotel had control over this), and the parking garage can be a little frustrating. If you come back to the hotel later in the evening its not easy finding a spot. But the good outweighed the few minor irritations.
