Their 4-star rating is definitely below the Scandinavian 4-star rating, probably 3 stars at the most (but hey, that goes for most German hotels). The staff are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was really good, so was their coffee. The rooms are clean and tidy and have everything you might need. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations, also the tram stops are nearby. It takes only 10-15 minutes to get to Alexander Platz from there.
