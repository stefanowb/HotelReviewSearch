I, being used to enjoying luxury at its finest, was hesitate on the entire experience but, afterall it isn't always about me when you have four children! My husband was certain this was the place for us and boy was he RIGHT!! We all had the time of our life. It was rustic as you would want and expect but certainly comfortable and clean. The entire staff has to be thanked for their hospitality and sharing of 'life on the range'. Larry was a most entertaining host. Our two oldest loved the trail rides and searching for arrow heads. Our 18 month old twins even had plenty of ground to explore. I can assure all, this will not be our last visit to Rancho Cortez!", "title": "Wow!", "user": "MommyRof4", "date": "October 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0}, "id": 84108899}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with family", "text": "For a bunch of City Slickers from Philadelphia, PA, we enjoyed ourselves so much we are planning a longer stay next year because we only spent the day on the ranch. The establishment is owner/operated - you will get the \"real deal\" from Larry Cortez (the owner). If you are concerned for younger children's safety on horseback, then Larry will ensure a teaching segment in the arena is conducted. We did this and it was worth every penny to watch our 9, 11 & 13 year olds learn equestrian knowledge, skills & abilities. My hunch is you will not want to leave the ranch.
