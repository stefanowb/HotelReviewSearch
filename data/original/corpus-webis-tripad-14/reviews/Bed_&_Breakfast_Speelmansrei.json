Located on a quiet street just a few blocks from the main square, it offered both the convenience of location and seclusion from the noisy crowds. More like staying in a close friend's house than a hotel, this bed and breakfast offers only two rooms. Both are very large with private bathrooms. We stayed in the room overlooking the garden and canal. It offered a king size bed, wonderful bedding and an immaculate and well appointed bathroom. Kees was a perfect host, unintrusive when you desired and extremely helpful when asked questions. Breakfast was served in a quaint room on the first floor between 8:30 - 9:30 and provided a perfectly substantial start to the day. It included: eggs made to order, toasts, pastries, meats, cheeses, juices and as many freshly brewed coffees as you desired. We will definitely be back.
