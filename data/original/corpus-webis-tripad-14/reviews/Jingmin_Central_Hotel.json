The carpeting in the room is old, the furniture is plain and old, this is not a new first class room. Bathroom tiles and counters are from 15 year old ago era. If you look at back edges of carpeting, behind sofa and beds there is lots of built up dust. The room was not terrible, it is adequate, and I suppose in China you can get alot worse... but this was no 4 star hotel room. My local vendor who I had appointments even asked why I stay at Best Western, they put their guest up at Marco Polo, or Sheraton just opened 4 months ago. I cannot vouch for these, just repeating what locals told me.", "title": "Showing Its Age- Only 3 Star, Not 4 Star", "user": "gtpatton", "date": "October 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 6020603, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Internet Access", "disliked": "\u2014 Age of hotel, cleanliness"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Hotel", "text": "One plus to the Best Western is that they give you a bunch of meal coupons, apparently the room not only includes a huge breakfast spread, but also dinner with free beer.
