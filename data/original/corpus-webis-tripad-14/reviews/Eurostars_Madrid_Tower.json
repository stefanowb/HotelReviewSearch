It is a business hotel catering for conferences and business travellers. It's not really a tourist hotel. The superior skyline rooms offer you a great view. The rooms are clean but functional and very dark with a modernist theme. The five stars rating is simply because of the spa and gym. The bar in the basement is awful and very expensive as is the breakfast if it isn't included in your room charge. We had a problem with the air con which was a bit annoying to get fixed but that isn't the reason for the poor score. You could use your money and find a much better place to stay if you are on a weekend trip, Madrid is such a beautful city and there are plenty of hotels to choose from. It is also a fair way from the centre and there isn't anything to do nearby.", "title": "Business Hotel with Good Views nothing more nothing less", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WozThere", "date": "June 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 132870091}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "If your on business nearby go for it I am sure you couldn't go wrong with this hotel and you can charge everything back anyway.", "title": "Groupon Getaway to Madrid - Great experience in Eurostars Madrid Tower.", "user": "cityrocker3000", "date": "June 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 132723312}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Otherwise look elsewhere.", "title": "As like the first visit, great!", "user": "Dutch_TA", "date": "June 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132665864}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed 1 night in this hotel using a Groupon. The hotel is between the airport and the centre of Madrid. I didn't mind being a good 10 min taxi ride out of town (10-15 EUR), due to the spectacular view from our skylight room on the 27th floor. The room was not large but had a huge bed and nice bathroom with full bathtub and separate rain-dance shower with jets. The shower leaked and set the bathroom a little underwater - wasn't much of a problem though. With our Groupon we got some nice Lindor chocolate truffles in the room as well when we arrived. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Didn't try the SPA, but they had some nice treatments, although quite pricey.

The room had safe, minibar, flat screen TV and free and problem free WiFi connection. My air conditioning was very noisy but after a phone call at the reception a person came within 10 min to adjust the ventilation level. I also ordered room service and the food was very good and well served. The only problem was a vanity bag in the bathroom: all necessary goodies thrown in the beautiful black and gold bag with the ribbon. You have to first spend your time on removing the ribbon and throwing out the contents of the bag in a search of you soap, shampoo, conditioner etc. The liquid products have fancy plastic tubes that do not want to stand especially after 2nd use \u2013 very bad idea! There is no tissue box, so convenient but a pack of tissues \u2013 another mistake.
