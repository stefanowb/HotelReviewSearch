The rooms are a bit dated and the furniture was worn. I think we stayed in the Belle room. There was a little cooktop stove and mini fridge in the room. I would have liked for there to be tile floors. Carpet in a beach town just doesn't seem sanitary to me. When we got our room there were no towels so we had to request them. The hallways and common areas are narrow, but they do provide 2 plastic chairs outside your door. The elevator is extemely slow and hot! The pool area was crowded too with the loungers all around. They do provide pool towels. The curtains in the room do not provide any sort of darkness. Hard to sleep in with the blarring sun shining through. The beach is right across the street. Like all of Wildwood, the beach is very wide, but there are wood platforms about halfway to the ocean to make it easier to walk. The southern begining of the boardwalk is about a block or two away. The rooftop deck is nice with hammocks to relax on. They should put a little bar up there. We had breakfast in the cafe and the pancakes were huge!

It was freshly painted, the beds were comfortable,the furniture was nice, and the kitchenette was newer and very clean. The bathroom was incredibly tiny and could have used some updating to match the rest of the room, but it was clean. Aqua Beach offers a closet with beach equipment like umbrellas, chairs and boogie boards which is really helpful if your umbrella breaks. Their pool was kept clean, which is tough when you have a lot of people using it on a hot weekend (if you're not a big fan of kids splashing around you might want to avoid the pool). They also have grills and covered outdoor seating for cooking on site. And the rooftop deck is really nice, especially at night. Lots of hammocks, lounge chairs and potted palms under pergolas. Maybe could use a little more shade is all. My only advice would be that if you like quiet during the day as well as at night, choose a room that isn't facing the pool. I chose a room that faced the parking lot with a beach view and I was glad I did. We were pleasantly surprised by the Aqua Beach and will definitely go back again.
