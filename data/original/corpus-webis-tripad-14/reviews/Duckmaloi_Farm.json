This place is a drive past all the usual tourist traps. It is situated in the country about 15-20 mins drive from Oberon. We stayed in one of the cabins. It is set overlooking the mountains, the views are terrific. The cabins have everything you might need and if it isnt there the Patersons will try to provide it. Mr & Mrs Paterson were very friendly and helpful. We bought our food from the supermarket in Oberon (they do great hot cooked chickens!) and the Patersons are happy to lend a cooler box to take out a picnic.", "title": "Fantastic experience, beautiful, peaceful surroundings", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "tulip", "date": "March 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14673425, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Quiet and peaceful, spectacular views and wildlife.", "disliked": "\u2014 I cannot complain about anything"}}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 4, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 16}, "aka": "Duckmaloi Farm Oberon, Blue Mountains, Australia", "slim_ranking": 0.4}
