We had arranged our visit with Megah Travel Services in Sandakan and can recommend their professional and well priced service in arranging this leg of our trip. Thanks to Patrick (our tour guide) for his great knowledge of all things Sabah, including his wildlife 'spotting' along the banks of the river. We were the only guests staying at the resort, which made the experience even more special. The staff are genuinely warm and gratious.
