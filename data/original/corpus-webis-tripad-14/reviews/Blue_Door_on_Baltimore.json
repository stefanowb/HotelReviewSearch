We were in the enormous Washburn room, which faces the street and has a large bathroom attached. The room itself was lovely. \u201cCasual elegance\u201d is the perfect description for this Inn. Since it just opened a few months ago, everything felt very new. The king-size bed was fabulous. I especially loved taking advantage of the new claw-foot soaking tub in the bathroom. Our room had a small flat-screen television. Bottled waters and sodas were provided, which was nice.", "title": "An Oasis in the City!", "user": "mcb1979", "date": "May 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 16084498, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The rooms were top notch.
