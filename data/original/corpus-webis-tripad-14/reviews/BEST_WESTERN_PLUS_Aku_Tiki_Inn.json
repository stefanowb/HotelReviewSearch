From the moment we set foot in the beautiful lobby we were treated like family. The staff were so nice to not only my wife and I but to both my children. The rooms were spotless (even the bathroom!!). The breakfast was my kids favorite (a close second to the homemade pizza they make in their kitchen). Susie made sure we had everything we needed poolside and I must say I have never seen a pool as big as the one there not even at the country club. We were sad to leave and can not wait to go back. You sure can't beat the price for everything you get. I hope we can stay 10 days next year!", "title": "What a Wonderful Place", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tubemasta", "date": "August 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 18508582, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Staff friendliness and cleanliness of entire property", "disliked": "\u2014 having to leave"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Another great vacation at the Aku Tiki!
