Had to dig to the back of the cooler to find something that was not expired. My co-worker was not as lucky, he grabed a milk and drank it. A few minutes later he became ill. I told the attendanyt, she said nothing, just walked over to the cooler and started removing the milk. The next mrning we made plans to eat somewhere for obvious reasons. But I stopped and check the mikl in the cooler, most was expired by at least one day. As I was looking at the milk I heard a mother tell her young child not to eat her cereal because she could smell the sore milk. Someone is going to get very ill if they do not straighten this out.
