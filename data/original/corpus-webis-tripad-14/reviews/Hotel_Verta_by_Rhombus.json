Having read some of the reviews we were a little apprehensive, but by and large it was a decent stay. Check in was smooth and the concierge offered to take our bags to the room. That was helpful as when we got to the room the card wouldn't open it. so the concierge let us in and then went to sort it out. One of the nicest aspects is the fact that everything is new and shiny. We enjoyed the pool and spa facilities, with the stainless steel bottomed hydrotherapy pool and fabulous sauna and steam room. Although we opted for a city view room, they allocated us a room with a partial river view which was good. And as the building is circular the room was a nice shape rather than the usual corporate box. Massive TV in the room plus one in the bathroom! Couldn't quite work out the lighting in the room, and we did find it a tad hot even though we had turned it down to 17 celcius. Bed was massive and really comfortable. Had a drink in the bar but only looked at the prices afterwards - \u00a38 for a glass of rose wine, although this was slightly eased by the fact they knocked 25 percent off as we were staying at the hotel. Breakfast was pretty good - we enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere in the bar area, although some of the food was just lukewarm rather than piping hot. Drawbacks? Well, it is true the hotel is bit far from the centre. We got a cab from Clapham Common tube and it was about \u00a315 a pop each way. And both times we ordered a private hire cab from the hotel the drivers didn't really have much of a clue where they were going. The first time we were going to the London Studios at the South Bank complex, which is pretty well known, and the driver had to phone his office and in the end I had to go online on my mobile and give him a postcode. And the service, while OK, was a bit hesitant. Every member of staff seemed a bit unsure of themselves and a bit nervous. It was almost as if they were still in training with no previous experience. Overall though, taking into account the facilities, it was good value as we'd have paid at least \u00a3150 more per night for the equivalent in the centre of London.", "title": "Pretty good for the price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Peejdj", "date": "December 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 147080704}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I studied the reviews and pictures on trip advisor and made a decision to book this hotel after extensive research.", "title": "A complete disaster, 0 star service.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Deehop87", "date": "December 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 146967384}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I had tickets for \"Warhorse\" fifth anniversary, so a special night was awaiting us.", "title": "Luxury London hotel but not at London Prices.", "user": "julesbirdie", "date": "December 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 146952909}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Upon check-in at 3pm we were informed that the room was not ready....no big deal.

It is comfortable and pleasant and offers a range of services. It claims it's a five star, and has some of the facilities of a five star (24 hour cooked room service meals, valet parking, and a spa), but lacks a restaurant, and lacks the quality fittings and general service and customer care one would expect. While offering value for money hotel rooms, this has to be considered against some of the draw backs. The location is remote from public transport and amenities, but can be managed. You would do well to bring your car, but park it in the streets nearby, such as near York Gardens, rather than pay the \u00a325 a day to park in the hotel. Be aware that the street the hotel is on is not attractive - it's a former industrial site that is being developed, and walking around can be a little awkward, especially as cars will park on the pavement blocking the entrance to the hotel. However, the hotel itself, while having a modest entrance which is difficult to pick out, is pleasant enough once you are inside.", "title": "Fabulous hotel but allow time to get about", "user": "JemmaB", "date": "November 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 146512236}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The customer service, though, needs working on. The staff are pleasant people and are very well meaning. They want to please, but most simply appear not to have had the training or experience to provide the quality service they and you would want. I had been concerned when writing to the hotel beforehand to confirm if my booking included valet parking. The reply was poorly written and contained several spelling errors, but - worse - was unclear on the rate. On asking for clarity, I got a different reply, so I was left unsure if an overnight parking stay costs \u00a325 or \u00a350. On arriving at reception there were three staff at the desk. Two looked up at us, then returned to the person they were dealing with, the third was busy with paper work. We were not greeted or acknowledged or smiled at. We waited a considerable time. At least five minutes. With three staff at the desk, and only person in front of us, this seemed odd. When a receptionist was free I offered my receipt from LastMinute which gave details of my booking. The receptionist said she didn't need it, and just asked for my name. Fine. The booking in took some time, which I assume was due to the receptionist being new. She then had to turn her back on us to go get our room card from a different room. This appears to be standard procedure. Whoever designed the booking in system didn't seem to be considering the impact this has on customer service. It takes a while. And you have been abandoned before the welcoming process has been completed. Anyway, fair enough. We were informed where our room was, where the lifts were, and where breakfast was - in the bar. I checked that. Yes, in the bar. I asked if there were proper tables and chairs in the bar. Yes, was the reply. We weren't offered assistance with our bags. We didn't want assistance, but for four star quality - let alone five, such an offer should be made. We had paid extra for a river view. Our room looked at the building opposite. Back to reception. Still three people behind the desk, two staff dealing with three quests checking in, third doing paper work. A porter noticed we had returned to reception with our bags, and asked if we needed assistance. We explained we had the wrong room. He asked us to wait. So again we waited. Finally got to see a receptionist who took a while to check our details. The check in software they are using must be slow or inefficient. We were offered a corner room. It didn't sound ideal. I asked if there was anything better, but that's all they had. So we got a room with mostly a view of the opposite building, but also, just about, a view of the river. Having just checked, this is not what they call a River View Room, so I will be complaining.", "title": "Nice but.....", "user": "TestConsultant", "date": "November 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 146459289}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "So you walk into the room and the first impression is good.
