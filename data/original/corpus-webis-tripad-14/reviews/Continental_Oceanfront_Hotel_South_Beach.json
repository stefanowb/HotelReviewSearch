Needless to say, the entire hotel smells of mold and mildew. I would never stay at this hotel again. I BEGGED for a refund and the manager stated, \"IT\"S NOT MY PROBLEM THAT YOU ARE NOT HAPPY.\" Out of all the years of staying at hotels, I have never in my life seen such a poor facility and level of customer service. While staying in the hotel I learned on the second day that two doors had been kicked in and a female was raped. The hotel is a nightmare and in fact you couldn't pay me to stay there ever again.
