The food in the restaurant is a little pretentious, served in very small portions which I would describe as far from what Italian hospitality is. My time in Tuscany was made very special by a local taxi driver called Fabio Sacperrotta whom by the end of my time in Italy became a very dear friend.

Fabio drove us all over Tuscany, taking us to food festivals, wine tasting, historical trips, open aired theatre at the top of Montepulcianno, recommended superb rustic restaurants and local foods. This may seem like an advert for Mr Scaperrotta however if you are staying at this hotel or anywhere in Tuscany he will ensure you leave Italy happy and fulfilled. Thank you Fabio.

We started our trip in Italy at a Relais and Chateaux hotel, Il Pelicano, in Porto Ercole which was truly 5 star (too expensive but still i would highly recommend!). I had similar expectations for Amorosa. We drove through the absolutely beautiful Tuscan countryside, through towns like Montelcino, and expected the hotel to be in a similar setting. I was so disappointed when we arrived as the hotel is in the area of Sinalunga that is much more industrial feeling and there are busy, loud roads right next to the hotel. I expected to walk the serene, quiet country roads through beautiful vineyards... The vineyards around the hotel were completely dying out and not maintained at all. So i was sad and immediately tried to think about how we could move to another hotel near the picturesque wine towns without losing our money! However, the Amorosa started to grow on me. The rooms were very nice (not 5 star, but very nice), the grounds were kept very nice and clean, the cleaning staff was great, and the front desk people were super helpful recommending wonderful wineries for tours (go to Poggio Antico and Poliziano) and truly great restaurants in the area. The restaurant at the hotel was very good too. The breakfast spread was just okay and the wine bar wasn't exactly as i was expecting.

On first impressions I thought I was a bit disappointed with the hotel but it really grew on me (and we had just come from somewhere that had been styled very differently). We have never had any maids clean the room as well as the ladies here did - it was such a treat. The pool area was nice apart from the standard loud Americans (sorry to say it chaps but why do alot of you speak at a level so we all have to listen to your tales!). I agree with the earlier review that the food was pretty awful though and if you dont get to order lunch before about 2.30 pm you are going to go hungry!! On the postivie side, the hotel had losts of charm, history, the staff were very helpful and I would definitely recommend it.

It is an outstanding place with all the comforts you can imagine. The staff is wonderful and attentive. The maid service comes around before the evening hours and asks if you need fresh linens. They also folded, and hung up some of my husbands shirts.......they are very professional. The restaurant is top notch and has a lot of ambiance. While we were there, it was crowded every evening with people staying at the hotel and other couples out for the night. They have a complementary buffet breakfast that is delicious and an evening wine bar where you can taste some of their wines. We didn't get a chance to swim in their pool as it was a little chilly and we didn't have time, but it was in a very nice location on the grounds and had an awesome view of the surrounding countryside. Athough our room as one of the less expensive rooms that they offer, it was still a four star experience... Nice views, clean, comfortable and spacious. It is a fabulous place to stay for a wonderful vacation in beautiful Tuscany.
