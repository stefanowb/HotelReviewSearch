With affordable prices, we can explore the best places in the area. For some reason, the most attractive places to be are located a little bit far from downtown, specially in Punta Ballena. Villa Toscana was an amazing surprise. If you are looking for a small charming place with all the comfort and privacy, that's the place to be. Anna, the owner, is fantastic. Always ready to support you in any need, or just for a chat, she is restless. We have stayed in the NewPoirt suite, very large and comfortable, pictures are fair and reflect exactly what you are going to find there. If you don't take care, you will buy your own piece of land and build your home there, in the Club del Lago, as Anna did!", "title": "Wonderful place to relax in Punta Ballena", "user": "Pianta", "date": "June 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162786550}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "OMG is all i can say.....being a travel agent i have slept in an abundance of hotels and i can recommend Villa Toscana as the only place to stay for your visit to PDE. It is a mere 10minutes drive to the center of town. Anna is an amazing hostess. She really goes the extra mile. From the rooms that she has personnally decorated to the breakfast she makes you feel like you own the villa yourself, including inviting us for dinner one night. Lounging around the pool we felt we were staying in a private villa in Tuscany for a fraction of the price. I cannot say enough about this wonderful villa.
