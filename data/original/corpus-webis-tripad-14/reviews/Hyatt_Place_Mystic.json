The staff was wonderful from the front desk, to the pool attendant. The pool is a little small but clean and was just the right size for us since we have small kids. The Mystic Aquarium is within walking distance from the hotel. The Seaport is just a short drive from the hotel (5 minutes). I would stay here again. The rooms were clean, the beds were very comfy, the rooms were spacious (especially with kids), they had almost a second room next to the bedroom which was the size of a living room...Clean, clean, clean. They actually allow pets at this hotel which I found odd, however it appeared that this area was a big pet lover population. In regards to the pets, we heard a dog muffle a bark and that was it.

After having to ask two other people working at the hotel, I was told that they did! Great. When I called the day of to tell them that I'd be needing the shuttle back from the casino, they told me that because I hadn't taken the run to the casino on the shuttle (I'd gone there directly), there would be no shuttle back from the casino. They also told me at this point that the shuttle was $15, which hadn't been mentioned to me previously. This wasn't the coolest thing anyone has ever done, but it's not the end of the world, either.
