The pool was smallish but clean. The staff are engaged and friendly and were willing to help with suggestions on local attractions. Casa del Mar has some great partnerships with different groups providing sight-seeing and adventure trips. One tour that visitors shouldn't miss is the mangrove tour. Aida our guide from Dev's Adventures on this tour was a storehouse of information and went out of her way to make us comfortable. Also, a trip to the famed cable car and the bridge is worth it. Several restaurants dot the street just outside the hotel and the food is reasonably priced and of a pretty high quality.

Lovely, clean rooms (we were upgraded), and warm, attentive service from friendly staff without being intrusive. The hotel has only 30-something rooms (so book well ahead), but it is not so small that there is a lack of privacy. The amenities are superb: a gorgeous pool, small but nicely decked out spa, fabulous restaurant, and a well-stocked library area that is a nice haven. The little touches by the pool were lovely: cold towels, fruit plates, little ice creams. The beach is steps from the hotel and is cleaned every morning. Other people have noted the water was not the turquoise one finds in Thailand, but it was clear despite quite windy weather, warm and swimmable. The hotel staff are knowledgeable and will arrange or provide guidance on any trip or activity, with the minimum of hassle. It's true that if you walk out the street side, you are taken to \"main street\" Pantai Cenang with various touristy shops and stalls, but there's also plenty of interesting local restaurants (recommend The Padi Cafe, next to the paddy fields across the road from Casa del Mar; the Indian-British chef from Wales cooks amazing chilli and curry dishes, and is equally skilled at western food). All part of the Langkawi experience. Last but not least - the hotel GM's wife is a designer and will create a made-to-measure dress for you in a day or so, using beautiful fabrics she buys from around Bali.

I would recommend the spa, where we both had a full body massage and facial and it was amazing, the spa staff are charming and very good at their job. We also went on the castaway picnic which was great fun, you are brought to a fresh water lake first and their are loads of monkeys their so we got great photos. Then we were brought to the island where our tent was set up with a picnic and it was very romantic. Our boat driver was a lovely guy, he even waved us goodbye the day we checked out. The pool was lovely and the sunbeds were so comfy, the beach was kept lovely and clean as was the pool area. Beakfast was great, lunch was great and we had dinner one night and it was very good quality food, I would recommend the fillet beef!! We also went to Bonton restaurant and it was beautiful. there is also a great chinese seafood restaurant down the road, it was very busy, a good sign, and the food was very tasty. We had two stormy days, which we spent at the waterworld, its worth a trip if the weather is bad, beautiful seals and penguins there. I didnt find the duty free much good, some things were good value but I found most things to be the same price. We absolutely loved langkawi, its not over developed or too touristy which is great and the people are so friendly and lovely. The Casa Del Mar is a great place to stay, its intimate, quiet and you really feel spoiled during your stay. Theres also free internet access which is brilliuant for keeping in touch with home.
