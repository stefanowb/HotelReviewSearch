It is brand new and is beautiful! They have a great breakfast area. The rooms are a good size and the bathrooms are very nice. The King rooms have cubby holes in the bathrooms for your \"stuff\". Everything is very clean and brand new! I would stay here again and would definately recommend it to everyone. Springfield is about 25 minutes from downtown Nashville, TN.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CosmoMaui", "date": "October 2, 2003", "id": 1374409}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Springfield"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 8, "very good": 24, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 29}, "aka": "Hampton Inn - Springfield Hotel Springfield", "slim_ranking": 0.5}
