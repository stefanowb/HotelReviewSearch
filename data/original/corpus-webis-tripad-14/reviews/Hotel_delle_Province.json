Room fine, beds comfortable, shower room surprisingly good, but slightly disappointing buffet breakfast. The only major complaint is the distance from main tourist areas, but you get what you pay for... The concierge helped greatly with advising us to use Bus No.63 which runs from the nearby metro close to most major sights, and on to the Vatican. Never needed another bus!

We found it quite difficult to initially find the hotel.

The porter that was sent to us to show us to our room, did not even offer to carry our luggage. Topped off by the fact he could speak very few words in English which was very difficult to communicate with him.

We were apprehensive before we went because of some negative reviews we had read but found all criticisms unfounded. The rooms were lovely, the breakfast was good, the staff were courteous and spoke good english. The area is not a bad area it is about a 20 min walk from Termini and on a major bus route so very easy to get to all the sights from. Also there are plenty of restaurants/pizzerias within a 2 min walk. A particularly good restaurant we went to was an Eritrean restaurant around the corner on the main road (Viale Ippocrate) called 'Sahara'.
