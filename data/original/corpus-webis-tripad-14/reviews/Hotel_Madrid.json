The location is perfect within walking distance of most of the main attractions. The staff was great (all spoke English), very helpful with questions. The room was perfectly clean, a newer bathroom with tub. The rooms were quite large by European standards. The morning breakfast on the top floor sunroom was great, full breakfast, very well presented. There are only two small negatives: 1) the elevator is very small (2 people max), a large person could probably not fit in it. 2) It can be a little noisy at night. Rome is a lively city 24-7, so there are always cars going by, music, people talking loudly, etc. Overall, we would definitely recommend this hotel!", "title": "Fantastic hotel in heart of Rome", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "srpablo25", "date": "March 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14290796, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 a little noisy"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel Madrid is a wonderful clean hotel in the center of Rome.
