The rooms are bright, large by Euro stds and very well equipped with IKEA accessories and Icelandic woolens. Robes are included. Kitchen is especially well equipped down to scizzors and cutting boards and a desk that folds out to dining table. Breakfast makings are supplied daily, as is fresh fruit, whole cartons milk and juice and plenty of tea and excellent coffee. Rooms are cozy due to geothermal heat and large soaking tub with pillow. Only complaints are 1) not enough hooks for towels, robes, toiletries; 2) no facecloths (though all the good restaurants provided them for hand drying) and 3) because of bus lines and skylight on the main drag, traffic noise is bad in the morning (despite reports here) and 4) handheld shower and no screen, so floor got soaked regularly. Breakfast includes meat and cheese and vegs, a wonder considering the cost of fresh stuff in IS, but was not large enough for my spouse. Grocers nearby make supplementing this easy. Restaurants in IS are VERY expensive for our taste ($50 lunches???). The female staff on duty on our arrival and departure was surly but the rest of the week friendly.

Every day, you get a breakfast plate with bread slices, butter, jams, cheese, ham and crudites to start off the day (very basic but much better, imo, than the typical continental breakfast of croissants and sweet danishes). There is a kettle and coffee pot with ground coffee and tea bags for that first caffeine jolt of the day.
