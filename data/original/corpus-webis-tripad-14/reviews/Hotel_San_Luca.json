Hotels can be difficult to source in Verona during the opera festival (especially a half decent one that is located closely to the centre) but we really hit lucky online and got a booking for Hotel San Luca for 2 nights. It's location is superb - just a few steps from Piazza Bra and the Ampitheatre. The rooms are a little outdated and 'chintzy' but so are a lot of Italian hotels in my experience. The hotel itself is calm and peaceful. We would definitely return here again when we come to Verona. I can't fault it on location or comfort although the breakfast is mediocre. However, because of it's location, it's so close to so many eaterie's that you will find lots of places to choose from so close to the hotels doorstep.", "title": "Excellent Location,", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sharon00", "date": "March 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125995436}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "I really liked this place.
