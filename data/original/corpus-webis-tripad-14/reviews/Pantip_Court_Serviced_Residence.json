The apartment was so big, quiet and the beds were really comfy - a huge king and two double beds. It had a kitchen and fridge stocked with softdrinks ( you had to pay for these) complimentary bottles of water. There is roomservice, a restaurant, gym, great pool, and make sure you try the Thai massage. Would stay here again. The only drawback is the location - it's a bit out of the way. We managed to get a taxi to MBK shopping centre - about 10 minutes away. Great shopping if you don't have a lot of time. Also just downstairs on the corner is a very modern Thai restaurant called Pandanas. Great food, decor and interesting menu.", "title": "HUGE APARTMENT", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "linlu65", "date": "August 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37898126}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We instantly felt at ease in this beautiful enormous suite.

Check in was pleasant and efficient and in no time we were in our suite. And what a suite - must be the largest 2 bedroom place I've ever stayed in. Massive lounge and 2 big bedrooms. Kitchenette small but since we didnt plan to cook or eat in, no drama. Pool was nice and daughters used the gym daily and liked it. The apartment decor and fittings are not modern but still acceptable. The king size double bed could have slept 4. Minor concern was the height of the balcony railing - I'm 5'10\"ish and it was just below my waistline, so a wee bit scary on the 17th floor looking out/down. You'd need to keep smaller kids well back. And the satellite TV service was grainy, but I've found that everywhere I stay in Thailand.", "title": "The Family Bargain of Bangkok", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Scotsmaninmalaysia", "date": "July 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35628599}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Fab little restaurant open all day just across the road to the right (forget the name, but its the only one). Easy walk to Suan Luam night bazaar where there are plenty more good eating places and interesting stalls. I read that it may close down and looks like half has already been boarded off for \"re-development\". A real shame if true. Close to underground station too, but underground and skytrain really dont go near main tourist sites - only offices and shopping malls. Plentiful taxis cruise by hotel and we found them very good - never failed to put the meter on, took us where we wanted to go, clean and youngish Toyota cars. Didnt pay more than 100baht for any trip - for 4 people, cheaper than using public transport.", "title": "Made me feel like an executive", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Roamingx", "date": "April 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 28990967}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We have just returned from our trip to Thailand and our first stop was a few days in Bangkok.
