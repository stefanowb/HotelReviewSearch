The food was of a very good standard and the chef took the time to ask us after each meal if everything had been ok and joined us as we were ordering to discuss the items on the menu and advise us as to the ingredients and cooking style. Through no fault of the staff or the hotel we found ourselves sleeping next door to someone who should challenge the Guiness books of records for snoring, we were moved to a better room without fuss and with great courtesy.

As we turned off the main road, we realized we were in a very upscale neighborhood of beautiful homes overlooking the bay -- very impressive. We found the Porth Avallen easily and although the outside looks just \"average\" (meaning not very deluxe and a bit old fashioned, if not \"worn\"), we were optimistic because of the neighborhood. We were greeted warmly by reception and ended up getting a lot of good information about the area, especially advice about a walking path that leads down to Charlestown, a cute little fishing village with a few places to eat lunch.
