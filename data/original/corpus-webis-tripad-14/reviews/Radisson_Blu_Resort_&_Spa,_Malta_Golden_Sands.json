The reception staff, particularly Jenna, are exceptional and make you feel very welcome. The spa offers great treatments - we sampled 2, although the staff there need some serious training. I completed a comment card and 2 of them tried confronting me and wanted me to discuss it with them! All handled in rather an intimidating way. I said I would be happy to discuss with the management - but they never called (these 2 said they were the management, so I am not surprised!) Aside from this our stay was most enjoyable and I would recommend the resort and deserted swimming bay nearby for a rejuvenating break prior to Christmas.
