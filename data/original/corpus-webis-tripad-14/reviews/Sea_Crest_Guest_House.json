The owners, Peter & Sheila were extremely friendly and helpful and did their best to make sure we had a pleasant and comfortable stay. Every little detail had been thought of - we booked 2 rooms, which they booked next door to each other for us and in the larger room they had put a large tv and 2 armchairs so we could relax and watch tv together in 1 room if we wanted to. Rooms were spacious and clean and in good condition (curtains and bedding looked new and there were some new fittings). Showers were good in both rooms and the rooms were also nice and warm. Breakfast was tailored to us and served at a time that suited us and both mornings our juice (for me) and tea pot (for mum) were ready and waiting for us at our table when we came down. The cooked breakfast was very nice and not at all greasy - egg, sausage, bacon, tomatoes and plenty of toast. We could also have had juice and cereal to start if we had wanted but we declined both mornings as wouldn't have been able to fit it in!", "title": "Friendly, clean & great location", "user": "FayeW", "date": "March 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154194626}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Peter and Sheila were great in recommending local attractions, restaurants and bus routes and timetables for the local area. If you ask a question, they will give you an honest and unbiased opinion as they really want you to make informed decisions about where you may choose to go. We took their advice and got a bus to Chichester (about 20 - 30 mins away) for the day and it was lovely. Brighton, the South Downs and numerous other places can be easily reached from here. The B&B is in a quiet, residential area just back from the main beach promenade (about 2 mins walk). There is a lovely Italian cafe / restaurant 2 mins walk up the hill and a nice local pub 2 mins walk down the hill on the beach front. We ate at both places and the food was lovely and good value at both. There is also an Indian restaurant or 2 in the area and plenty of fish and chips joints and cafes on the beach promenade. The location is ideal as you can walk straight down to the beach, but are away from the noisier town centre end, so you get a peaceful nights sleep. Can also recommend the crazy golf course about 10 mins walk down on the beachfront - great fun!", "title": "near the sea", "user": "whippe", "date": "August 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137887950}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
