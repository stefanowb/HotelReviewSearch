So kind & helpful! I had booked a hotel room for my parents who would be visiting me during my travels in Ahmedabad. I must admit I was initially quite dubious about this hotel as it was relatively new and there wasn\u2019t much information available at the time of booking. I had purely booked it for its location. However, management allowed me to visit the hotel beforehand to ensure I was happy with the room and services provided which reassured me no end. I also requested an early check-in, which was instantly granted. The hotel was clean & the food was great! The room was spotless, spacious and had an especially nice shower with all necessities available. It was a calm retreat away from the busy hustle and bustle of city life, yet only a doorstep away. The quirky art deco around the hotel also brought a smile to my face. Above all, the food was more than adequate - especially for someone who isn\u2019t used to the traditional spicy Indian menu. They catered for all tastes and we didn\u2019t have to worry about the typical things a foreigner would when eating out in India.", "title": "A Citrus Delight", "user": "Priya10", "date": "November 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 22089805, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 service with a smile", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Expect a quality finish worth every penny you pay for.", "title": "Pleasent Stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dnp10", "date": "November 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 21980611, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Rooms and Hotel Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 None"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Best about Lemontree ahmedabad is they always say yes for everything you requires.", "title": "Ahmedabad's Best New Hotel", "user": "yakko14", "date": "November 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 21508979, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 It was brand new & therefore incredibly clean"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "great theme, no frills, simple but caters to all the needs of business travelers", "text": "i asked for early check in as i was arriving in ahmedabad at 5.30 am in early morning.my both rooms are ready with smile.even they have arranged dormitory place for my driver free of charge.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "basibr", "date": "October 5, 2008", "id": 20652802}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008", "text": "I am not sure where to start.
