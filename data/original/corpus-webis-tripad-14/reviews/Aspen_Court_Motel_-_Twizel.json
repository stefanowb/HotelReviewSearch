We stayed in the Aspen Court Motel for 1 night in November 2010. The room was a good size, clean and well equipped. The kitchen area had a hob, microwave and fridge, and plenty of plates, cutlery etc. The room had a very powerful shower and spa bath. Double doors led out to a table and chairs in the garden. The TV signal was good (mix of local and national channels with Sky Movies), and there was a DVD player. The bed was comfortable. There was plenty of room to hang clothes and put cases. All the rooms had parking spaces. It was only 5 mins walk into Twizel (if that!). We opted for beer and burgers at Hunters. Burgers were excellent, and beer was cheap thanks to happy hour!

Lovely hosts, who gave us information on what to see on our way to Dunedin. A very pleasant night's stay. Couldn't fault the place. The motel is situated in front of a golf course, there is a garden at the back of the motel room and even though the town is newly established, a lovely place to stay.
