We found it quite hard to find reviews for places to stay in Pokhara and decided to stay here quite randomly as a result of booking our porter for a trek in the Annapurna region through the 3 sisters travel agency. We met quite a few people on our treks who were disappointed with their Pokhara accommodation, so this place is a real find. The rooms are basic but spotlessly clean, have an ensuite shower and we liked the fact that the guesthouse is in north Lakeside so you actually overlook the lake! (this does mean a 10 minute walk to the busy Lakeside centre but we thought it was worth it). The staff (especially Nicky, one of the sisters who run the place) were all very friendly and helpful, and the porter they engaged for us on our 6-day trek was a very nice and knowledgeable guy. Best of all, it's $10US a night to stay there. We were almost reluctant to recommend it in case we can't get in next time we go back!", "title": "Excellent place to stay in Pokhara!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "R&SLondon", "date": "January 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6564812}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We ended up staying here for 6 nights around our trek. The guest house is run by Dicky and her two sisters and the ethos of their organisation is to empower women. We did our trek with them as they train women to be guides and assistant guides. Gita and Ritu were ours on our five day Poon Hill trek and they were both brilliant. I have nothing but admiration for the people who work in the Himalayas especially the weight that they seem to effortlessly carry around (I wonder why people need that much stuff, but anyway). The good thing about the Three Sisters is that they limit the weight that the assistant guides can carry to 12kg for both mine, my partners and Ritu\u2019s own stuff for the trek. She also carried it in my rucksack, which looks much more comfortable and safer than carrying it by a strap around the head. They also have good clothing, including suitable boots / shoes. Gita our guide was brilliant, very chatty, interested in us and looked after us at the teahouses. She even looked after me whilst I was quite ill on the trek, including popping off for 45 minutes to find me a horse so I could continue with the trek on our second day. Having your own guides and maybe women guides was also a good way to find out about the Nepalese culture.", "title": "A great ethos that should be supported", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Samkirk9", "date": "April 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 28572202}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Comfortable stay", "text": "As for the hotel, this is very good value, clean and comfortable accommodation.

The staff were really helpful, breakfasts one of the best we had in Nepal and Dicky was a kind natured helpful host who arranged a few things for us including a driver from Pokhara to Chitwan.
