It is centrally located close to all Williamsburg attractions and restaurants and close to Jamestown and Yorktown too. The location is also very quiet. It looks likes the rooms have been newly remodeled and were very clean. There is a stand up shower only, no bathtub. They have a nice lobby and a roomy breakfast area. There was the standard continental breakfast food. I especially liked the fresh fruit. They also had a inside pool and fitness center that both looked nice, although we didn't use them. I would definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone!", "title": "Left after 10 minutes, never gave us a refund for the night", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Marriedin06", "date": "December 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 6440751}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Frederick"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 20, "very good": 31, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 15}, "aka": "Sleep Inn Frederick", "slim_ranking": 0.52380952381, "description": "84 Rooms.
