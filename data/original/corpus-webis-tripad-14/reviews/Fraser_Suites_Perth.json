When booking, I asked for a room located away from the elevators and was pleased when on check-in I was advised that this request had been honoured. When I stepped out onto the 15th floor, I walked about 5 to 6 metres from the elevators and there was my room, facing the elevators. I thought there had been a mistake and was about to go back to reception until I studied the floor plan hanging on the wall and discovered that this Hotel is a rectangle shape and the elevators are in the middle of the Hotel. All rooms are therefore situated around the elevators. This will not be an issue for many, but I am a very light sleeper and found the \u201cding dong\u201d of the elevator bell, plus the voice system in them announcing the floor number to be very annoying. Around midnight a couple of very noisy guests got out the elevators and made their way back to their room, waking me up. I had just got back to sleep when another group of very noisy guests came out the elevators laughing extremely loudly at 12.45am because someone had lost their access key card and couldn\u2019t use the elevator. The loud discussion, constant laughing and ensuing phone call made it impossible to sleep. I realise that loud inconsiderate guests are in no way the fault of management, but this is the main reason why I prefer accommodation where you are not right next to elevators. The rooms behind the elevators are probably a lot quieter, but studying the floor plan, these seemed to be the more expensive one bedroom apartments rather than studio rooms. The other problem was the very high pillows. I had glanced and seen 4 pillows on the bed when I arrived and thought one would surely be suitable. However, when going to bed I found they were all very high and I don\u2019t know why Hotels do this. It is extremely uncomfortable to sleep with your neck kinked at a 90 degree angle. By the time I realised no pillow was suitable it was 11pm and I was already in my pyjamas, so was too embarrassed to be calling anyone at that stage and just put up with it.", "title": "Nice Hotel, but away from Everything", "user": "Woodbury729", "date": "May 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 161810725}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed a couple of nights after a friend's wedding in the city.", "title": "Delicious dinner and gorgeous accommodation at Fraser Suites", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lovecat", "date": "June 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 163236539}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "We had a fantastic experience and can't really fault anything!

We arrived and were told there was some trouble with their system, a few mins later we were able to check in, the room was lovely and clean just really cold. So we tried to get the air con to go up a few degrees had no luck so called reception to be told \"just turn it off and the room will get warmer\" so we tried to do this. Still no luck so called down to reception again and asked if someone could perhaps come have a look at it was not even switching off! we were told \"we can send you up some more blankets\" it was only 5pm!! We also asked if we could have the champagne and chocolates that were promised in our package and were told they would be sent up. 40 mins later with the temp dropping below 18 in the room we called and asked if we could move rooms if possible as it was freezing! we were told they would give us a call in a few mins if this was possible. We waited about half and hour and thought we would go down stairs for a drink to warm up, as we got out of the lift an attendant advised he was trying to call us and had arranged for us to move rooms. We were moved to a bigger room on a lower floor which was really nice, we tried to switch the air con to heat but it would not change but at least we were able to turn the air con in that room off which did make the room slightly above freezing being covered in blankets was hardly romantic! We never received the Champagne or chocolates promised in our package.
