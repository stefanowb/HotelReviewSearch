Yes, the hotel needs an upgrade in terms of the wallpaper in the bedrooms and the lack of flat screen tv (who goes to a hotel to watch tv?)... However, we had excellent and attentive service from the receptionists to the concierge, not to mention the staff in the bistrot at breakfast. Children are really welcome which is not the case in all 4 star hotels. The value for money is excellent for a family of 4 (check out the week-end deals).

When we arrived we learnt that in fact the hotel only occupied a few of the floors of the building so we waited for the elevator to the 32nd floor or something. The reception is probably the best part of the hotel. The room was shabby and outdated. There were cracks in the walls and ceiling, paper peeling away in places. The TV was and old style portable from 80's/90's. The bath was stained on the bottom. They didn't even provide a kettle, I don't think I ever stayed in a hotel without a kettle in the room. The worst part was the stench of cigarettes and lack of sufficient ventilation. We slept we the AC on and we both woke up feeling fluey the following day.
