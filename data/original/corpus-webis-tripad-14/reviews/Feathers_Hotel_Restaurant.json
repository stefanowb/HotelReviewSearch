The first was the 45 minute wait for our food, we had arrived whilst the restaurant was fairly quiet, so expected to be served swiftly. The second disappointment was that as three of the four meals were being delivered to the table we were advised that the fourth meal (turkey, bacon & leek penne pasta dish) would be served without leeks as they had run out... However the meal wouldn't be charged for. Unfortunately when the dish arrived at the table the creamy sauce had split during cooking and left a dreadful oily scum over the whole dish. Another of the dishes ordered was a cheese omelette, it's usually good to have cheese in it!!!! The vegetables served with the other 2 dishes were microwaved and overcooked. As we were off to see the Thursford Christmas Spectacular, we didn't have time to send the dish back or complain. Other tables around ours were also sending food back to the kitchen. Definitely won't be returning.", "title": "Disappointed...", "user": "claris74", "date": "December 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 146948487}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited November 2012", "text": "We have visited The Feathers a number of times over the years but visited for the first time in a while at the end of November.", "title": "Tasty meal with efficient service!", "user": "WillowBee77", "date": "December 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 146715536}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited October 2012", "text": "It was very busy but there were enough staff in all areas to ensure that the waiting times were kept to a minimum.

Rooms need sorting out and was dated and of various styles which was let down by poor quality of toiletries/toilet paper. The grey lino in bathroom and suite also needed updating with a poor functioning shower. There was nice white sheets and pillowcases and bed was comfy. The valentine meal was good but they could of put a red rose on the table or even a few red hearts on the menu card - or some red balloons somewhere. The whole place was void of romance!
