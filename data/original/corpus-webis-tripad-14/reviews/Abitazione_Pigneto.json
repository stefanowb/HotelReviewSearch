If you want to sleep well, good services, hospitable hostes and a real italian atmosphere and you want to pay a very good price, I hardly reccomend to you Abitazione Pigneto! It is not in the centre of Rome, but from there is easy to reach all the hot points to visit in Rome.

The owners, who live on the same floor, were very accommodating but also gave us our space. The room and bathroom were VERY large and decorated according to their local tastes. They also run an antique store next to the apartment. They very generously washed our clothes for us and we could nominate what time we desired breakfast. What hospitality! We were a little confused as to whether we were allowed to use their computer or not but snuck in a short session or two on the internet late at night. We did find one of them in the apartment one day, which was not a problem after the initial shock as we hadn't been introduced to that co-owner. The area is easy to navigate by tram but since we did clearly witness pickpocketing first hand, we would suggest you don't carry your wallet in your back pocket! The area is multicultural and probably safe.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "xelar8", "date": "October 26, 2008", "id": 21214794, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 homely feel", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled on business", "text": "My husband and I stayed in this B&B for five nights in July while my husband took a mosaic class around the corner.
