This hotel is very accomodating to guest with young children. The hotel restaurant has high chairs and they brought hot water to our room when asked (free of charge of course). After snoozing and freshing up we headed out. The hotel location could not be better. You are across from the Prado and Thyssen, a 10 minute walk to the Reina Sofia and right in the middle of a neighborhood known for its old school tapas bars. Everything is within walking distance from the hotel, even Atocha Station (15 minutes). So, if you have to pay a little more to stay here, it's well worth it since you'll save yourself a bunch of cab fares.

From the moment we arrived I felt like I was part of a special experience.

The Heavenly beds were indeed heavenly....so, so comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful with nice toiletries, plenty of hot water and comfy robes. Our room was on the third floor and beautifully quiet: no outside or inside noise at all. A prior reviewer mentioned the room being far away from the elevator but that's exactly what I always request: always! The farther away from the elevator, the smaller the number of people passing your door which gives me the extra peace and quiet I want. The fitness center was well-equipped and I wish I had been able to experience the Asian restaurant at the rear of the hotel. I heard the food was delicious but they don't begin serving until 8:30, which is later than I like to eat. The location of the hotel is absolutely unbeatable: in sight of the Neptune fountain, walking distance to Plaza de Cibeles, across the street from the Thyssen-Bornemisza (great Impressionist/post-impressionart art) and the Prado, and a very, very short walk to the Reina-Sofia museums featuring art by Picasso, Dali, etc. The Thyssen was my favorite of the three and you can grab a bite to eat there too if you are totally enthralled with the art as I was. The Edward Hopper masterpieces alone are worth the price. We purchased Madrid tourist passes online prior to the trip that saved a lot of money but primarily lots of time since you get to skip the lines. This included numerous attractions but one we particularly enjoyed was the Palacio Real Madrid with its fabulous collection of stringed instruments for my musician husband to ooh and aah over. (Madrid Card holders enter in a separate entrance).The palace was close enough to the hotel to walk and enjoy the sights and sounds of Madrid along the way, including Plaza Mayor. Since we stopped so frequently, I'm not sure how long it would take to walk to but probably around 30 minutes or slightly more. Plaza Mayor was fun and believe it or not, Elvis Presley is alive and well in Madrid! We also enjoyed the Parque de Retiro, a very short walk from the hotel as well. The park itself is beautiful and if you love to watch people, this is a great opportunity to see a little bit of family life in Madrid, particularly around the water. If you're interested in flamenco, tap as fast as you can to Corral de la Moreria. (We took transportation since the show starts late at night). I did a huge amount of research on which flamenco show to attend and came up with this one, bought tickets online before the trip and was so glad I did. The talent at this show is unbelievable and not to be missed. When I mentioned to the concierge that we were going to see flamenco, he immediately stated that the best in Madrid was Corral de la Moreria but unfortunately they were sold out and would be unable to get us tickets, so I was ecstatic that I already had purchased the tickets. The place was indeed packed but what a fun experience that we will never forget! The area close to the hotel seemed very safe and we felt very comfortable walking around.
