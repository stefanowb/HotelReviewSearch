We walked to all the festivities throughout the weekend and even to the beach. It is right across from the Hemingway House, which is a big attraction with its six-toed cats. Key West is hot and oppressively humid in July. Coming from LA it was very apparent, and the rooms just couldn't get cool enough. Probably because I could see the sun shining in through every corner of the front door, and the bathroom wasn't temperature controlled so every time we took a shower it was instant sweat. Also the shower head was weak, and the pressure only got a bit higher if you were wiling to take a hot shower. The pool was warm and perfect, and our bartender at the pool bar, Peter, was a great guy and always made us feel like part of the family. There is also a shady area to play Cornhole, which was actually quite fun for a group of friends. For over $250 a night, I just don't think it was worth it.

The property is in a great location across the street from Hemingway House, center of Old Key West but far enough away from the craziness of Duval Street. The staff is very accommodating, knowledgeable of the area and friendly but the property is a little worn and run down. The pool is small and looked like an overstuffed bath tub when we arrived. The Mojito Bar is convenient for a drink by the pool but expensive. The hotel has an outdoor continental breakfast daily with limited choices but great strong coffee. As for the room, it was dated and in need of new furniture, paint and carpet. The sheets weren't very soft and seamed cheap. The maid staff uses the top sheet for the fitted one and it comes untucked from the mattress.

There truly are no parking spots at all... so seriously do not plan on parking close by! We got room E7, and it was amazing! The room seemed newly renovated. The only odd thing was this step in shower. It seemed like it was more for a Las Vegas suite, but it was still pretty neat. The bed was comfy. We couldnt hear the roosters at 4 am from our room.
