The rooms have a refrigerator stocked with water and pop which costs 130 pesos or $1.30. This property is quite a walk to the heart of PDC so if you are not into walking then this is not for you. With your room you also get a continental breakfast, toast, coffee and juice.

The price to performance ratio is very high here. The room was clean with air-conditioning and TV. It has a small but nice clean cool pool. The staff was outstanding! You even get a basic breakfast of Toast, OJ and Coffee no charge but due tip. Also, on the counters there are some Mexican pastries. You can order a bigger breakfast off the menu (very reasonable) They also have a PC w/Inet access. It's only one block from the end of 5th Ave. Which is the touristy area. There are lots of restaurants and shops on 5th Ave. We found some good cheap eats just down the road past the soccer field and a few blocks down I think it was 30th Ave. It\u2019s a short walk to a beautiful beach with a small reef a stone's throw out. Bring your mask and snorkel! Mamita's beach club is affiliated with the hotel and you can get decent drinks with chips and salsa for around $10. There's even a shower, pool and clean restrooms at the beach club. Everyone seemed nice and we had no problems with banditos. We did have some friends to were pulled over in their rental car and had to pay the police $40 to forget the allege traffic violation. On 5th Ave. there was a police information center and you could lodge a complaint against the police if you wanted. We had no problems with the police or anyone else. There are also many fun things to do in the area or close by. Just outside Play Del Carmen there\u2019s a great eco park call Xcaret. It\u2019s an all day event that\u2019s very fun if you like to snorkel, enjoy the natural tropical environment and animals and Mayan ceremonies this is a must do!", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 19, 2005", "id": 4034020}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "We spend 11 nights at the Riviera Caribe Maya in March and loved it.

We had a standard plus room on the ground floor where we could walk out to the pool, which was wonderful. Room had a safe, fridge, fan, ac, small tv.

I finally decided on this hotel after nearly a year of research on trip advisor for a good spot for our honeymoon. We got married in the morning and planned on leaving for Cancun Int'l in the afternoon. HOWEVER, Hurricane Emily was planning on landfall on the Mexican Riviera the NEXT DAY. We were quite nervous about flying head on into a major hurricane but we did it anyway(only around 20 passengers on our flight!!). After we arrived, on Sunday, there was a meeting for all the guests at the hotel (16!!) concerning how we were going to ride out the storm there at the hotel. Management provided us with some sandwiches, bottled water, a 5 gallon bucket of water for flushing the toilet, and a downstairs room during the storm. We stopped at a small store that afternoon and bought some chips, chex mix, and some muffins not knowing how long we would be without electricity,or food for that matter. The storm approached that afternoon with its worst fury between midnight and 2 a.m. We were without electricity from that point until Tuesday. Mexico sure is a hot place without some a/c and a shower!! And, we were without food by Monday night. Found a little place on 5th Ave. that had a propane tank hooked up to an oven to make pizza. We were so hungry by this time that we didn't care what it tasted like. It was a little strange to a girl from the Midwest--jicama, onion, and tomato w/some kind of white sauce. But, hey it was food!! The electricity came back Tues. morning. The staff at this hotel immediately started cleaning up after the storm was over. There was quite a lot of debris throughout Playa. But, the locals worked tirelessly to get their town back to normal for the tourists. Only a couple of days and you hardly knew that a major hurricane had just been through the area.
