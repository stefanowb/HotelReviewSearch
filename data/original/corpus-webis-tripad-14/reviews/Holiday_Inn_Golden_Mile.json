I agree with what other reviewers have said about this hotel. It is well placed for various shopping malls selling luxury European goods in fashion, cosmetics and Swiss watches. It is a couple of minutes walk to two stations and about 10 minutes walk to the Star ferries. I skipped eating breakfast and just had a coffee or a tea in my room, with some fruit, or bun bought in a supermarket the day before. The hotel charges for wi-fi, but across the road in the i-square mall you can get it for free, there is also a Starbucks open until midnight. You can also get free internet at the airport and around the ferry terminal and maybe elsewhere, but it is a bit patchy. What makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the quality of the staff who are incredibly helpful and courteous. Whatever the problem, or question that I presented them with, they had an answer and solution. I had a problem with the door lock not opening, a member of the front desk team came up to look at it straight away and immediately called an engineer to fix it, which was done within a few minutes. In between I was invited to go to the bar and have a complimentary drink. Now that is service. There is a discrete security presence on the main entrances and inside the lobby. I am not sure why, but certainly on each corner walking along Nathan St, I was repeatedly asked if I wanted clothes made up by a local tailor, or to buy fake watches and while they are not aggressive, they are a constant pain. One treat I enjoyed was getting the South China Morning Post in a little black bag placed on the external door handle every morning about 7.30. I have been to other Holiday Inns in Europe and they usually quite good, but this one seemed to me as being especially good and if I found myself in the same circumstances, I would certainly go back to this hotel again.", "title": "Above normal standard for a Holiday Inn Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Mephestophiles", "date": "December 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 122170425}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled solo", "text": "This is a great hotel, right in the heart of the Kowloon district in Hong Kong.
