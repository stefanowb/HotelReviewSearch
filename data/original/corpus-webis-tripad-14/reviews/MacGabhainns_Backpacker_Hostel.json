Bed was comfortable and there was an electrical outlet at my bed so it was easy to plugin a laptop. The room was ensuite and I enjoyed that managers paid attention to such details as an air freshener in the toilet room. Basic breakfast was included; tea and coffee available at any time; milk in refrigerator. There shower was great, no need to press button every 30 seconds.
