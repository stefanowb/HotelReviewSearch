Definitely not what I expected based on the website, the \"look and feel\" of the rest of the building, and the Loews name. The dominating color was light pink and the carpet was stained and old. Dated furniture and art. The bathroom was much better, large with black marble and deco feel. Except the shower curtain had a huge stain on it - Gross! The staff was attentive and nice.

The building, location, and common areas are fabulous, but I was very unimpressed with the room. I had a room on a the 24th floor with 2 doubles. The first thing anyone will notice in such a room is the view, which is absolutely stunning through the wall of windows. However, I found these windows to be quite drafty as there was a chilly wind blowing in Philly that day. The room had a rather cold and institutional feel to it with bland peach walls and very little to decorate them. The high ceilings are nice in some ways, but with nothing to \"bring them down\" they create an un-cozy atmosphere. The bed was comfortable, but uninspiring, especially in this era of every hotel's \"signature\" bed with top-end linens and down all around. The bathroom felt old, and other than the countertop, seemed in need of a facelift. The curtain was a challenge to close as it easily got caught on the track. But worst of all, the hotel was loud. There was very little to dampen sound echoing from the hall, and the slamming doors woke me throughout the night. I was also surprised at the amount of \"city noise\" from such a high floor. With hotels like the Ritz and Sofitel nearby, I would not recommend staying at the Loews.", "title": "Great views; everything else just OK", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mdp_az", "date": "December 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 6437992, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Views, Historic art deco building", "disliked": "\u2014 Guestroom"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I LOVE this hotel -- stayed here Christmas day one year when our kids went to the X's and we were sad -- what a way to cheer up!
