The room was beautiful and the bathroom was enormous and well appointed, but that is as far as the royal treatment went during our stay. Upon arrival there was no grand welcome, just a lock box on the front stoop to get your house key. Upon entering the house it appeared we were actually in the owners living room, not private common areas. We went to our room which was lovely, but there is no lock on the door so you have to hope your valuables are safe when you leave the B&B.", "title": "Stayed in the Royal Treatment Room.....Our Stay Was Everything But", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "dessertinajar", "date": "October 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 21031571, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Jacuzzi Tub", "disliked": "\u2014 Service"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary at Cherry Valley Manor in the Royal Treatment room. The name of the room couldn't have been more fitting. The walk-in closet is enormous. The bathroom is extravagant with its expanse of marble, dual sinks, and jacuzzi tub.

The decorating throughout the house beautifully combines a traditional European style with a contemporary feel. The house has only two guest rooms: the one we stayed in was downstairs on the far side of the house, the somewhat smaller one was upstairs. We shared the house with another couple for one night and never saw or heard them.

You can tell they take a lot of pride in their establishment. Julia, Stan, and Yana were very friendly and accommodating; always being available when we needed something but somehow disappearing otherwise. They even brought out a garden bouquet of flowers to my wife at our first breakfast for our anniversary. Speaking of breakfast, the food was bountiful and delicious. Julia prepared crepes, fritattas, homemade jams, pork tenderloin, potato pancakes, fresh fruit salad, bagels, cereals, etc. It was like having breakfast at your grandmother's house.", "title": "Friendly, accommodating and feel special", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Richard4444", "date": "August 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 37311962}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The $195 a night we paid was an absolute steal.

The perfect place for a honeymoon or a celebration of any sort. Can't get closer to the outdoors, but farther from it all. Treat yourself to a weekend of utter relaxation! Wake up to a quiet rustling of leaves and the smell of a gourmet breakfast. Walk out from your bedroom onto a terrace to enjoy it. Get lost on the five beautiful acres surrounded by tall trees and rose vines with a good book, a bottle of wine or a board game. Spend the day sunbathing by the pool. Have a picnic or grill your lunch in the backyard. Lounge around in the elegant wicker rocking chairs and hammock. Bask in the sun and take a refreshing dip in our heated pool. Find bliss and serenity in this beautiful establishment tucked away on a quiet hill, yet easily accessible from a major highway."}
