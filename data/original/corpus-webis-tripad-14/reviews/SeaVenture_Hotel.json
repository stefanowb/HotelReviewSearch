Over the last 10-12 years we have celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, and just took romantic getaways there. The experience was always wonderful. This year it was a nightmare. It started with the blood on the pillow, that I had to ask be changed twice, before it was done. The pillows seemed a bit rumpled upon check in, but I dismissed it as perhaps the pillow cases being left in the dryer to long. I did not notice the dirty pillow UNTIL the next morning! We slept in a dirty bed. I was so grossed out. But Housekeeping assured me that it was just an over sight and that the bed had been changed before we checked in. Now, I rather doubt it. If that was not gross enough, the next thing will gross you out as well. Our beautiful ocean view room had a nice new looking jacuzzi on the enclosed deck. The first night we went in for about 5-8 minutes, since we were feeling romantic and my husband does not really care for jacuzzis, we got out. The next day we were just to busy to use it again. The day we were going to check out, we decided to go in for a fun morning dip. When I removed the lid, I noticed a swirl of some brownish looking stuff on top of the water. At first glance, I thought it might be sand, (how sand would have gotten in I don't know, but it was a thought) so I took a wash cloth from the bathroom and skimmed the top....it was not sand, but some disgusting \"stuff\". It took 2 skims to get most of it. I took it down to the front desk, showed it to them and informed them of my extreme disgust. The Housekeeping Manager, said that it was probably just our body oil. Hello, we were not in the jacuzzi all night. The few minutes we were in, could not product that much \"oil\". They asked me what they could do to make it better...NOTHING would, the trip was ruined. I was so upset that I went back upstairs and packed to leave. I looked at the jacuzzi again, and it had another large swirl of \"stuff\" on top. I skimmed it off and left it in the side of the jacuzzi for them to see. As we walked passed the front desk, no one said a word. When my husband went in to check out, he was given a discount of $100.00 and a $50.00 gift certificate.

We've always enjoyed the on-site restaurant (although a bit pricy), the balcony hot tubs and the in-room breakfast. However, we've found customer service to be slipping lately: inablility to honor requests for specific rooms or even general location within the hotel, some of the staff have been less than friendly, and there has been a definite decrease in the level of cleanliness and overall facility maintanence. Finally, and this isn't the SeaVenture's fault, but the balcony privacy of most of the spa rooms was ruined by the construction of 3-story condos next door. Really a shame. Will probably give the SeaVenture one more chance next year, but they're really going to have to step it up.
