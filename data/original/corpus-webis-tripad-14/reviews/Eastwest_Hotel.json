We reserved our rooms through Expedia, and got an amazing room rate. Some hotels automatically put the pay-in-advance guests in the unrenovated rooms, or the ones overlooking the railway tracks. Not so the Eastwest - when calling to extend the reservation, they enthusiastically recommended I go back online to take advantage of the Expedia rate which they could not match! The room was vast by any standards, and luxuriously appointed - bathrobes are standard in many hotels - but Eastwest also supplies flip-flops. Every hotel provides shampoo and conditioner - but Eastwest adds body lotion and shower gel - and lavender-scented pillow spray personally delivered with a fresh-baked cookie to your door every evening. The minibar has both milk and dark chocolate. The shower has both a wand and a rainshower head. The bed has a full range of pillow firmness choices, and is a bona fide European featherbed. The bell staff is unfailingly polite, and genuinely happy to see you each day. And breakfast? Yes, others may say it is too expensive - but you get what you pay for. The eggs are perfectly scrambled. The bread is as fresh as if it were baked behind the bar for you. The cheese tray is unparalleled, and a virtual commercial for that Swiss delicacy. The juice is undiluted, the coffee properly and fragrantly brewed....and the wholesome cereals individually packaged for maximum freshness. The front desk staff are refreshingly polite, direct, helpful and professional - you are their main and only focus whenever you appear. Any one of these little things may be what you would expect to find in a good establishment - but when you combine them all, you can see why this hotel is consistently rated number one by TripAdvisor contributors. Frequent travelers can spot the difference. Do yourself a favor and stay here next time you're in Geneva.

The bakery across the road did a 5 franc breakfast, and there was a posher bakery further down the road. There were lots of good places on the street for lunch or dinner, and it's very handy for the lake-front and the central station (Cornavin) - if you don't fancy dragging your bags up the road, the No 1 bus will take you the short journey from door to door (it's a bit less convenient when you arrive, because of the one way system - but it's not far to walk).
