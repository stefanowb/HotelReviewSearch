Especially for the price that was paid for the room. Over $450 a night for an ocean view. All white rooms with concrete floors makes anyone feel like they are in an insane asylum. I did not feel like my room was priced accordingly to my accomodations. I would have much rathered stayed at the Loews South Beach. Would not do it again.

Do not stay here! The rooms are anything but comfortable and welcoming. The floors are cold, damp, grey, grey cement. The rooms smell like mold. My shower had a TREMENDOUS leak and no one ever came to fix it (and I was there for 7 nights!). The water trailed out from the bathroom, into the closets and out the front door. It was ridiculous. The hallway floors from the elevators to the rooms are also the same grey cement, so when trendy girls in their high heels tromp back to their rooms after a night of drinking, it echos throughout the entire floor. To make everything even worse, the staff was rude. Not even indifferent, but just plain rude. For example, I called the front desk and asked them to please connect me to another guest. I gave him the name of the guest and he acted like I was totally putting him out. He said in a very exasperated tone, \"Do you know the room number?\" I did not (or I would have just dialed it myself) so I said, \"No, I'm sorry I don't, but I know he's on the third floor.\" And in one of the most sarcastic, snotty voices I have ever heard, he replied, \"Oh, that really helps- NOT!\" Ok, so I just ignored this guy and figured I got a bad seed. Not the case. I had bad experiences with about 5 other staff members. And the valet parking guys sometimes just, \"Forgot to get the car,\" and they'll even tell you that in a very unapologetic way after you inquire because you've been waiting for 20 minutes. I could go on and on, but I will just say that this is one of the WORST hotel experiences I have had. Nobu, the restaurant, is great, and the nightlife in the hotel is very cool, espcially by the pool area, but this is somewhere you want to go out, not stay. And, just so you know, 5 of my co-workers also stayed here, and we all had the exact same thoughts and complaints about this place. I assure you I am not being high-maintanence or picky. Thankfully, I was on a business trip when I stayed here, so my company payed for the hotel, but I would have been so upset to have spent my own money on it. For that reason, I am writing this review because I would hate anyone to waste their money on it- as it is not cheap and TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!!!! Please do not stay here.", "title": "Rude staff.
