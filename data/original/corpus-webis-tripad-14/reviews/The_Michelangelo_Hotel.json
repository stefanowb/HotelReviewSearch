After staying at numerous other hotels in the area over the years, and after reading all the great reviews of the Michelangelo on this website, I decided to give it a try. The hotel staff is professional and very courteous, check-in was a snap and I too was upgraded to a great, huge room (an anomoly in NYC). Great view and the windows had heavy blinds which could be pulled down for deep sleep. Room service food was prompt and delicious. The bathroom was enormous and I really liked the toiletries offered. Quiet, relaxing room, nice turndown service and complimentary NYTimes every morning. Housekeeping attended to every need in a quick and efficient way. Lobby was classy with wonderful, live classical music every evening. Close to 5th avenue shopping, Radio City Music Hall, all the Broadway theatres. Overall, a first-rate hotel and a first-rate experience. I love this hotel.

After reading all of the positive Tripadvisor reviews, decided to stay at the Michelangelo months ago and made reservations. We stayed in Room 737 (deluxe, king suite). Hotel graciously upgraded us for my birthday. The room was HUGE by city hotel standards. Every request (extra pillows, clean towels, room service) was instantly satisfied by the cordial staff. Early check-in was seamless. Many wonderful complimentary services (daily paper, turndown service with chocolates, shoe-shine, delivery of any \"missing\" toiletries, light breakfast each morning). My only negatives were that our room's A/C unit was rather noisy (ear plugs solved the problem for sleeping) and our room faced out on the street (city traffic noise all night long). An interior suite would probably have been quieter. Otherwise, the Michelangelo was exceptional. Lovely public areas (small lobby bar with nightly classical music). Perfect location.

I not only e mailed the hotel of the reason for our travel but I called them before we left the U.K. to check they had my message. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite and the whole NY experience began it's magic from that point. The staff were very pleasant, the accommodation was superb and I'm sad to see someone wrote a review saying they'd had a not very good experience, as my partner & I are both rather well travelled and our stay at the MichaelAngelo will remain in our memories for a very long time to come for all the right reasons. The hotel will always be a place I'll rave about and recommend to anyone who will listen but judging by the other reviews, we weren't exceptionally lucky, the guy who gave the 1* rating must have simply been very very unfortunate. I wish he'd had the fantastic memories my partner & I will keep forever. The hotel had a beautiful ambience and incredibly comfortable feel to it.....

I booked this hotel for a girls long weekend - 6 of us. The hotel gave us 2 rooms adjoined by a common foyer with 2 king size beds in each room. It was perfect for us. The rooms were large, spotlessly clean, and were beautifully decorated. The beds, pillows and linens were superior - my back pain which has plagued me for months disappeared! We were on the 3rd floor and we heard very little noise from the street, if any. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. We had coffee sent up to the room each morning rather than going down for the continental breakfast but we did pick up muffins and pastries as we ran out the door. I had a great cosmopolitan in the piano bar one night but it was a little pricey - $14.00!! The hotel is in the perfect spot for theatre goers and is a short walk to Madison and 5th Avenue, Central Park, and Rockefeller Center.
