The fridge is stocked daily with snacks, soda, and beer, which was great to use on our daily outings! One of my favorite parts of the kitchen is a small water station. Bali is a hot, humid country. I brought my water bottle and was able to refill there at the hotel and not waste money and plastic on buying water bottles all day long. Very thoughtful and green of The Ulin! The space was great, comfortable and not cramped like other Villas we stayed in. The bathroom, outdoor shower was great, huge and very private. They even made us a flower bath when we asked for one.

I appreciate the company wanting to know your opinions but right after a massage you just want to chill and we were staying there and could have done it any other time. Also, the bed. I am a smaller person, 5'2\" and my face kept slipping through the face hole, it made the entire face down part very uncomfortable, and I think did more harm to my neck then the massage did good. The idea of getting a massage in your villa was terrific, however the face rest in the beds were even more uncomfortable than the actual spa, even my boyfriend found it uncomfortable. Also, we finished so relaxed we would have loved to have just laid there and relaxed or just chilled. The ladies had us get up and fill out another customer satisfaction card! Then my boyfriend took a shower and they made us tea and waited till he came out to finish the client card before they left.
