The rooms are large and include nice artwork on the walls, a small couch and fridge and microwave. Continental breakfast seemed fresh and included make your own waffles, fruit, pastries, muffins, yogurt, bagels, juice, coffee, cereal & milk (no eggs). That's where the good review ends. Nothing special about the service, hotel is older, pool and hot tub were closed for repair. The toiletries include a combination shampoo/conditioner in a packet that was hard to open instead of having it in the typical bottle. One of our two entry cards didn't work day one, and day two, when we came back, neither worked. There aren't many options in this area and the hotel is okay.
