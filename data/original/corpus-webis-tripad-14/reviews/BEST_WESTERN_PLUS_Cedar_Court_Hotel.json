Excellent location and hotel has ample free parking which is a bonus! The building is lovely from the outside but very typical of an average hotel on the inside. Adequate but nothing special. Reception staff seemed to have had a personality bypass and as usual were eastern european wich I have nothing against but to have a language barrier problem as soon as you arrive at a hotel in your own counrty can't be good! can it? The room was clean and the beds extremely comfortable. Sound from ajoining rooms was particularly annoying at times but didn't last. Didn't eat there except for breakfast which was in the large room to the left of reception. Unfortunately it seemed they simply couldn't cope with the amount of people wanting breakfast, maybe due to the wedding party that were in. Tables were left dirty, requests for tea/coffee politely answered and then ignored, food simply wasn't replenished quick enough and overall cleanliness of the dinning room was poor with the ceiling peeling in large areas as well. The breakfast itself was just fine with lovely sausages/bacon and big wedges of black pudding, certainly set me up for the day. Overall a brief stay so can't really say much more but I think on the whole I would return if I had to. One last point is that this hotel is no stranger to the 'milk every last penny from the guest' with beer coming in at nearer \u00a34 than \u00a33, why do they do that! didn't bother me though cause simply went out to dine and drink in one of the many places available within 10min walk!", "title": "Average hotel but couldn't cope at breakfast!", "user": "needawee", "date": "October 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 81853076}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "My wife and sons and family stayed here for 2 nights and had lovely ensuite rooms and good meals.

We were given a private dining room overlooking the Stray and a team provided us with prelunch drinks and then a really excellent meal. I cannot speak too highly of this and the excellent chef who we later met and thanked. Later a number of us stayed for an evening snack meal (lots of choice) in the delightful lounge.

The hotel is in a good location although I arrived right on rush hour and the traffic was really busy. The postcode does not give you a very accurate location on sat nav and I had to drive around a bit until I found the hotel. Reception was friendly and efficient and I was allocated a ground floor room with an unimpressive view to the rear of the hotel. The room appeared well appointed on first impression but closer inspection revealed peeling wallpaper behind the flat screen tv and general wear and tear. I was only staying the one night however and the room was more than adequate. I needed internet access and a quick call to reception gave me the security code for the hotel wi-fi which worked perfectly. I had booked a table in the hotel's Brasserie Restaurant and found the food and service to be excellent which is more than I can say for the breakfast the next morning. I was on a fairly tight schedule and although the breakfast is buffet style I waited an age for someone to bring me a pot of coffee to the point where I nearly got up and left without.
