As you can guess, the inn was located on a vineyard and the setting was spectacularly beautiful. Lots of green rolling hills - hidden away from the main road. The site was located near the ruins of Governor Barbour's home designed by Jefferson of course. Instead of staying at the inn, we rented one of three cottages. We drove down a single country lane to the cottage - a little white house divided into two rentals. Our rental was basically one room (more like a studio) with a working fireplace and a small kitchen that was stocked with food for the next morning breakfast. Upon arriving we also received a bottle of red wine from the vineyard and local cheeses. It was very quaint and very quiet. We never saw any other guests (not that we spent the day much there) and we knew that other guests were there due to the two other cars parked near us. We sincerely felt like the place was just for us ........... We did walk around the property on trails through the vineyard for a bit. All very beautiful. Our stay there was a nice reprieve from our crazy busy lives. I would absolutely recommend staying there if you need a get away.", "title": "Vineyard Paradise", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bbjj0827", "date": "December 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121379890}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Barboursville"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 3, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 16}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
