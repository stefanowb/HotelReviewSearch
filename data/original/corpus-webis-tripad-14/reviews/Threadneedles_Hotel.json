I have mentioned before that I hate staying in London as you are generally served by Eastern Europeans throwing your food in front of you and expect you to feel grateful. This hotel was the exception it was fantastic. We had about 25 rooms for our guests that came over from Germany. We personally had a studio which was felt very spacious and modern. There was also enough room for all my bridesmaids to get changed. Nothing was too much trouble they helped and made us feel welcome at a very stressful time before the wedding. The breakfast was also fantastic for the UK there was a very big selection from smoothies to a fry up whatever you wanted. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London. The downside maybe is that you are in the City but at a weekend in my opinion this is luxury as it\u2019s not as busy as during the week. You are about a minutes\u2019 walk to Bank station that takes you to Oxford Street in ten minutes.

The room was lovely- 3TV's (and only 2 of us) a seperate shower and bath. Lovely warm towels, great toiletries. A 6 foot bed. We had a lovely dinner on the Friday in the restaurant (Bonds) and bar meals on the Saturday (the restaurant is closed over the weekend). The cocktails are many and varied. This area of London shuts down at weekends so its beautifully quiet. Shops, bars, restaurants are only a short bus/tube ride away. We walked to the Guildhall to see the Roman amphitheatre and the art gallery, to St Paul's (and a nice lunch) followed by the excellent Museum of London. All walkable. And for us the magic continued with snow. Breakfast (included on our deal) was very good. If you are on a deal you have a choice of continental or cooked. I was slightly disappointed that i couldn't have my usual cereal followed by poached egg- but never mind. All in all an excellent weekend destination.
