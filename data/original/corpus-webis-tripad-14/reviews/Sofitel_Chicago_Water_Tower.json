Once you are in Chicago, cab rides are fairly inexpensive within the city and it was great not having to deal with the traffic, getting lost, and finding parking or gas involved with driving into the city yourself. We arrived to the Sofitel Water Tower very early and I was worried that our room would not be ready, but to my suprise, we were able to go straight to our room on the 32nd floor (top floor!) right away at 9 am. We had an amazing view of Downtown Chicago and even Lake Michigan. The bed was extremely comfortable, and with the curtains tightly closed we were able to sleep in late, very comfortably. Steps away was the luxurious bathroom that I am missing already, only 8 hours later! We spent a lot of time just relaxing in the suite and enjoyed the large LCD tv. We had sushi delivered from Kamahachi and it was great. Not as great as our favorite sushi place, but great that it was delivered right to our suite! The Sofitel was a nice walk from Michigan Ave, and with a pleasant suprise in warm weather, in the 30's, we were brave enough to shop a bit. I can also recommend the restaurant Caf\u00e9 des Architectes as a great place for breakfast. The french toast and fingerling potatoes were perfect! Room service breakfast the next morning was just as perfect as it was downstairs. I can see why this hotel is rated as #1 and I will probably always stay at this hotel when I return to Chicago. In fact, I will be sure to check for a Sofitel Hotel in any other city that I travel to.

After having visited, we can fully understand why this is the best rated hotel in Chicago. The wonderful experience starts at the lobby, which manages to pull off a rare blend of sleek design and decadent comfort. If you ask for a room on the high floors, you'll get a good view of Downtown Chicago and may even glimpse Lake Michigan. However, the views are not the high points of the rooms. The bed was quite simply the most comfortable one I remember sleeping on! So much so that we ended up spending much more time in the room than out and about. The bathrooms are great - spacious, luxurious and bright. The Sofitel is located only a few minutes walk from one end of the Magnificent Mile, and is an excellent starting point for a walk around Chicago. Oh, and if you visit in winter and don't want to brave the elements, the room service menu is actually quite decent. We will definitely be coming back to Chicago and will, without a doubt, stay at the Sofitel again.", "title": "Nice Hotel, Great Location", "user": "lmb814", "date": "January 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 12767438, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The bed", "disliked": "\u2014 The noise in the wall"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Chicago"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 21, "average": 81, "very good": 460, "terrible": 19, "excellent": 1337}, "aka": "Sofitel Chicago Water Tower Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.078313253012, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Sofitel Chicago Water Tower bids you welcome with world-class downtown Chicago hotel accommodations - minutes from the Magnificent Mile, Michigan Avenue, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Art Institute, and trendy boutiques.
