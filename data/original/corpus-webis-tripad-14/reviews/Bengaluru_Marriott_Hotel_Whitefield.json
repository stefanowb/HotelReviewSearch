I have used it both for business and for pleasure. I held a very important business meeting at the Marriott several weeks back, and I was blown away by the level of service I was provided. The room was exceptional and the service was top of the line. We had everything we needed and were very well taken care of throughout the day. Several of my colleagues said that this was the best offsite experience they have had in Bangalore. If you are looking for a place to hold your next meeting, give the Marriott a try. I thought we got great value for the money and a great location for the team to get our work done. In addition to the business aspect, I have eaten at the Marriott several times, including Sunday Brunch and dinner at the new Italian restaurant, Alto Vino. Both have been great experiences. The food is always good, and the service has also been exceptional. We have lived in Bangalore for two years now, and hands down, I have had the most consistent and pleasing experiences at the Marriott in Whitefield.", "title": "Top Notch Hotel ...
