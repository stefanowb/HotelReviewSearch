Our room was in an old wooden building opposite the main reception and restaurant area. Convenient parking immediately outside the rooms which was accessed by a flight of wooden stairs. First observation was a musty smell from corridor carpet which could have done with a deep clean. Room was a good size with a view of trees and shrubs. Furniture old and rickety rather than quaint and period and poorly matched. No safe and no fridge which for the price in this day and age was poor. Room was very warm and no air conditioning so window needed to be opened to cool room. Two comfortable Queen beds and bedding clean and ironed, always a plus. Bathroom and wash hand basin in separate rooms which was a bit strange and the bath/shower was complicated to operate and water continues to come out of bath tap when shower was on reducing shower pressure. Plumbing very loud! Very little room round wash hand basin and you have to compete with coffee maker balanced at edge of sink and the wardrobe immediately behind. Daft arrangement! No laundry facilities, though laundry bag provided? TV old and poor picture. Bar was chaotic with pressured unsmiling staff, efficient enough when you forced way through bar stools to get there. Restaurant good quality for price. Friends with us asked to move to another room but were told nothing available, so we didn't bother. Would not stay again but will tolerate for two nights.", "user": "Norman W", "date": "September 13, 2012", "id": 140167946}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Please be warned the pictures of these rooms posred on hotel website do not match the reallity, there is a point in time when shabby chic, just becomes shabby, dirty walls, carpets poor furniture.", "title": "Please do not book a standard room", "user": "petermac21", "date": "September 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 140162556}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Sadly by the time we had talked to staff at reception, they had moved so many others we had to stay with our allocatted rooms.", "title": "Family Oriented Retreat", "user": "charkee", "date": "September 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140121804}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "The almost resort", "text": "My husband and I stayed here to enjoy a clan gathering for five days over Labor Day Week end.

We originally had regular reservations & the staff was more than happy to lower our rate & include dinner & a bottle of wine for each night when the special package became available. We had other plans one evening so they gave us the bottle of wine to take home. That's the best & most accomodating service we've had anywhere! The Superior Rooms were lovely, quite large and current, with a nice deck overlooking a wooded area where we could photograph lots of different birds & our Border Collie watched several deer saunter by. The Large Suite's furnishings were a bit older but it was clean, comfortable & just right for our group of friends wanting a quiet place to catch up & reminisce. The included breakfast has great variety, with everything from fresh fruit to yogurt & cereals to eggs, potatoes & sausage. Their muffins are wonderful! Their dinner menu is competitively priced & the food is very good. It's a short walk into one part of Cambria with lots of shops & restaurants, & just a few minutes drive to the other part of town & the beach areas.
