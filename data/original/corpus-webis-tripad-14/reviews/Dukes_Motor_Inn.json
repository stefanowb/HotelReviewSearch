This motel is very basic. We were in an executive room which is to the side and rear of the motel. We asked for a rear room to try and avoid traffic noise from the highway-this was not too bad. The room was large, much larger than other motel rooms I have stayed in, was very clean, but is in need of refurbishment. There were cracks in the tiles in the entry way and bathroom, rust type stains in the toilet and the furniture has marks on it. The cost of $125 for the night was, we felt, a bit steep for what you got. Breakfast was continental style (not included in the tariff) and delivered to the room the night before (the bread for the toast was frozen).
