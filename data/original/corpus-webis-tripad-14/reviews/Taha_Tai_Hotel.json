Rooms were decent size with colorful, cheery bedspreads and were very clean. Despite the tropical nature of the island we only saw a couple of very small bugs in our room during the entire 5 nights we were there. Maid service was very good. Some of the reception desk attendants were certainly friendlier than others. The location was very good, only about a 10 minute walk from the center of town. The breakfast buffet was limited but delicious, with wonderful pies every morning. We know hotel choices are limited on Easter Island, so for the price we paid we were happy with the Taha Tai and would recommend it.", "title": "Nice little hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "travelbuff68", "date": "October 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 20965679}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Okay", "text": "We stayed at the Taha Tai for 4 nights.
