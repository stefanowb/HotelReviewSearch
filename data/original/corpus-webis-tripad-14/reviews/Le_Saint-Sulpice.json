One, we were travelling with a dog, and Saint Sulpice accepts dogs; two, the location in the heart of old Montreal; and three, it was billed as a luxury four star hotel. The room we were assigned was on the fifth floor and looked out onto the street. It was undoubtedly a \"dog\" room, as the carpet was dirty and full of stains. I would definitely recommend asking for a room overlooking the inner courtyard, and this side of the hotel is extremely dark, and because it overlooks the street, it was very noisy at nightime, particularly between midnight and 2 AM, when the bars are closing. Because we were there on the weekend, when we stepped out on Saturday, and again on Sunday, there was vomit on the sidewalk, a little ways down from the hotel, which I only narrowly avoided stepping into. This mess was still there a few hours later when we returned from lunch. The room itself is very large, with a separate bedroom and also has a tiny kitchenette. The room had evidence of the previous person, with grime on the sink and a dirty table. The outside door was covered with dust. The most difficult part of the room was how gloomy it was, we left all of the lights on all of the time, and it still felt extremely dark. We ordered room service our first night and had guinea fowl and shrimp. The guiney fowl was tough and tasteless, and the shrimp dish was so salty it was inedible. Heavily salted dishes are often a sign of the use of powdered stocks, so anyone allergic to MSG should avoid this food, as I had a bad reaction to it. We had tremendous difficulty getting our room cleaned. It simply didn't happen the first day there (although we were out from 12-3). On the second day, I called and requested a specific time to have it cleaned, which it was. On the third day, I called and asked to have it cleaned while we were out, and was told that it would not be possible to ask for a specific time for cleaning, although their literature suggests that one can do this. Sure enough, when we returned after being out for 3 hours in the afternoon, the room still wasn't cleaned, with no evidence of the housekeeping cart even being on our floor. We called down again, and again had to make arrangements to leave the room for an hour and a half, and when we returned at five, it had finally been cleaned. We asked for a new hairdryer as the one in our room wasn't working, but it was never replaced. We appeared to be the only people on the fifth floor, perhaps this is why we were forgotten. Although the hotel web site suggests the hotel has a dedicated concierge, when we went down to the front desk to ask the concierge a question, it was the same young man who checked us in. While he was very sweet, he wasn't very informative. We asked him if there were any outdoor restaurants where our dog would be allowed, and he replied that there had been a huge \"crackdown\" on dogs on patios, and there were no restaurants that accepted dogs. This turned out not to be true, as when we went around and asked, there were several outdoor restaurants that accepted dogs. The breakfast itself was included with the room and was a continental style buffet, with a four dollar surcharge for the hot items. We ate there once, and it was pretty awful. The bacon was rancid (I've never had rancid bacon, so it must have been very old), and the bread was dried out brown and white wonder bread. At 9:30 there was only one slice of brown bread left, and it was not refilled during the time I was there. I guess I was expecting a bit more than economy hotel type food. The coffee was tepid and served with milk instead of cream. The service was surly, at best, and it took forever to get a bill. There is a very sweet little breakfast place around the corner, I would recommend avoiding the restaurant at all costs. I spoke French the entire time I was there, thus we were not given indifferent service because we wen't making the effort to use the language. We asked for a room with a balcony, and although the hotel was quite empty, we were not accomodated, no doubt due to the fact we were travelling with a dog, and there are only a few doggie rooms. There appears to be a shortage of staff, perhaps because we were travelling in the off season. If you are travelling with a dog, there is wonderful green space just steps away from this hotel, down by the water.
