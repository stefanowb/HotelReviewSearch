The staff tried the best to make us feel comfy. Very strange that they have not fixed the road up to the resort. But the beach and the pool was fantastic. We liked our four nights here.

We stayed in two separate lagoon houses. The setting was very pretty with a private Japanese garden with frogs and water lilies. Each house had a private pool and sun deck facing the ocean and the common pool. Rooms were pretty, although the mini bar could be better stocked up. Our cleaning girl obviously didn\u00b4t think we needed any chocolate or snacks, so she just left that part out. Hmm. The common pool is big and good for play and lap swimming (20 m). There are two more pools beside it, 15 respectively 10 meters. No fitness! Not even a treadmill:( The breakfast was basic but fresh and the staff was polite and helpful. A few nights the hotel arranged barbecue on the beach. The beach is about 700 meters long. Unfortunately for us the tide was unusually low when we where there so it was not possible to swim in front of the hotel, and the talked about reef 100 meters out was above water. We walked to the other end of the beach to swim, but it was still just knee high all the way until there where coral and sea urchins. On the positive side, if you had shoes on you could walk all the way out to the snorkeling, but better rent a canoe. This beach is secluded, meaning there is hardly anything around except other resorts, and no shopping close by except for sunscreen and beach games and some basics. Big mountains behind this beach seems to hold moist so it was not fully sunny until around 2 -3 pm. We did our own excursion to some water falls. It was fun.
