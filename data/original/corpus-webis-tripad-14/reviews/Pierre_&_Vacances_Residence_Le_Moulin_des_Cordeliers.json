The apartments are spacious - for a \"single room\" I actually got both a bedroom with a good size bed and a kitchen/living room with table, chairs, couches, etc. - really great for having people over and hanging out, which is not always the case with these types of places. Kitchen had all necessary implements (except dish soap and sponges - had to buy these). Bathroom was fine, coat closet, etc., everything you'd need. You have to pay 1.50 euro per day for internet, which wasn't a big deal for me - but for that price, why not just make it free?? Charming view of the river/town. Decent pool but I never had time to check it out.

The interior had acceptable finishes (about 3 star in the US) and the bathroom looked renovated recently. Like most rooms (except those in the mill or moulin) our room had a patio with a table and chairs for eating. The kitchen was well equipped including a fresh cutting board and utensils such as sharp knives, wine openers (of course!), an oyster knife (wow!), and a fresh cutting board (they provide a new one for each guest).
