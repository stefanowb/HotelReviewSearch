Based on reading other reviews I did not expect this to be a typical Hilton and it was not in looks or amenities BUT I will say that it is clean, comfortable, located in the best spot and has an extremely friendly staff which all made this a great stay. I actually arrived a day early and they were able to accommodate me into a room with a nice view (I agree with other travelers, you need to request above 8th floor facing the pier and marinas). This is really a great place to stay, I booked with points so breakfast was included each day ( I would not have paid the price for it) and it was good, everything you could want is within walking distance - especially the beach which is right out the back door and has the nicest sand, tiki bar, great lounge chairs and drink service on the beach.
