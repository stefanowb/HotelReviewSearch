The bar has a contemporary feel to it. The bar was very busy; standing only and very noisey. There was an overall lack of friendly atmosphere. I asked for a bottle of champagne to celebrate my arrival and was stunned that the young barman said I was too drunk to serve. I hadn't even had a drink and couldn't figure out why he was saying this. I can only put it down to my strong Glasgow accent and he didn't understand me!! Anyway, he asked the doorman to ask me to leave - my friends asking him to understand I was not drunk. I asked to speak to the doorman alone and after seconds of talking to him he said 'your not drunk', he then spoke to the barman and I was served. What a rotten welcome to Sydney, rotten attitude from the young lad. I will not be back here and would choose the many other bars in the area for better prices, atmosphere and service.", "user": "flyby21", "date": "February 4, 2007", "id": 6744774}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the hotel as the first stop in Australia on our honeymoon.

The We booked a side-view room for about $160 US per night ($240 AUS) from November 25-28, 2008, on www.wotif.com. The whole experience was fantastic from check-in to check-out. We got here a tad early and were cheerfully allowed into our room. The room was enormous, by boutique hotel standards anyway, well-appointed, and had with balconies and a side- view of the beach and complimentary bottles of Voss water. The bed linens were pristine white and the furniture dark wood. The bathroom was sparkling white and included a tub (the longest hotel bathroom tub I have ever seen). The bathroom was pretty simple and won't win any design awards but anyone who faults it is just being fussy. Plus, bonus points for a floor so clean that you can eat off of it. The room was perfect. The hotel is literally across the street from Bondi Beach and very easy to access from central Sydney or the aiprot - just take the subway to Bondi Junction and then either the 380, 381, or 333 buses - the buses stop right by the hotel. The only con, I guess, is the noise - the hotel contains a lively bar and restaurant and is facing a busy street, so if you need pin-drop silence to sleep you might be annoyed. We didn't mind it at all, though - it's a small price to pay for being On. The. Beach. Plus, when it's quieter, you can actually hear the waves. The rotating cast of young front desk clerks were uniformly friendly without overdoing it and extremely helpful (shout-out to the adorable night clerk who went out of his way to help us). No attitude to be seen anywhere. The first night, we ate at a little Greek restaurant on Campbell parade called Nikos that served the best spaghetti with clams I have ever had in my entire life. Incredible. The second night, we headed out to the Flying Squirrel tapas bar a little further out - also excellent. The final night, we splurged at Ravesi's restaurant, which was outstanding - we booked beforehand and were given the best table ( corner, facing the ocean) and faultless service. We were a little unlucky with the weather during our stay on Bondi, but still managed to have a great time, probably because we stayed at Ravesi's.", "title": "Ignore the so-so reviews!
