Although in a very old building in the historical centre, the inside of the hotel is top modern. A very small hotel, as the designation \"boutique hotel\" suggests with very friendly and helpful personnel. Beside the remarkable design, the small room with high ceiling was equipped with all kind of electronic devices. Otherwise, there are no \"frills\". Anyhow the room was situated in the basement directly adjacent to the Melchor Ocampo street , but the window absorbed almost all noise from the street, and there is not much traffic. Room was very tidy and clean. It might be embarrassing that the bathroom including toilet is open and somehow quite indiscrete. The king-size bed was extremely comfortable but small for two persons. It needs some expertise to switch on the television, CNN is available but BBC not, the hotel receptionist was really helpful to switch on the TV. All the utilities worked without exception, the water pressure of tap was remarkably high. The light concept in the room was impressive. As smoking not allowed in room, had to go outside - that was a bit a hassle.There is no restaurant, but breakfast is served in an almost private atmosphere on the rooftop terrace in a relaxing atmosphere. The location is superb, as in midst of historical centre but still quiet. We travelled per bus, so no need for parking. It didn't look as if there was much parking space in the vicinity. Choosing this hotel means you get a state of the art design room with immaculate utilities, but there is nothing to remind you that you are in an old Mexican city, except the view from the terrace.", "title": "Unique Place", "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "November 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144786694}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "It was my very first time in a boutique hotel and it was a great experience.
