Lots of trucks parking across multiple spaces, lots of contractor's with 4x4 pick ups...it's that kind of place. The room was fine. Microwave and refrigerator, two luggage stands, small closet. Breakfast is silly and not appetizing, but the woman staffing the small room is friendly and helpful. I will be returning later this month, which does not thrill me, but also does not bother me greatly.

We bid $87 on Priceline and this is what we ended up with. There are far nicer places in the area. The hotel looks like a complete dump from the outside. The inside is a bit nicer but smells of smoke. Didn't use the hot tub/pool area, as it was located right in the lobby and didn't afford much privacy. Breakfast is the typical complimentary fare, which means a total carb-fest with no protein in sight other than microwaved eggs. No thanks. My biggest complaint is the inability of the staff to quiet down a group of student athletes who awoke very early and sat in the lobby right outside our room for what seemed like two hours. Actually, we were initially awoken by a group of loud, drunk kids coming home at 3 A.M. This place seems to attract that element. Staff is young too and didn't seem to care. If you're going to stay here, don't accept a room on the first floor. Overall, it served it's purpose, as we weren't there to hang out but next time we'll spend a little more for something nicer.", "title": "Average at best", "user": "loudon79", "date": "October 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 182913747}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Maybe it's because my husband and I stayed here the Friday of Labor Day weekend, but we felt to spend over $150.00 for a basic room wasn't a good value.
