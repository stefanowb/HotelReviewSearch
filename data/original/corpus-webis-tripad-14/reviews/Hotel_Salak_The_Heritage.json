I am glad I listened to that advice. The hotel is just opposite from the gardens, although the gated entrance was a far cry from there (unless I missed one of the gates). The staff on reception were a little bemused to see an unwashed, unshaved, sweaty, dusty traveller grace their presence in such a beautiful hotel, but the price was right. Not cheap, but not expensive. Unfortunatley, there was either a wedding or a photo shoot in progress that day, so I didn't use the pool. Really quite liked the room. Internet room was a box of a room, with old computers, but staff were helpful. Travel agent on site couldn't really answer any questions I had, but tried to help.
