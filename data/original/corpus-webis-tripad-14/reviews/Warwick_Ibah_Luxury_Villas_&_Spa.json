The layout of the villa itself was a little odd - one large room with the bed raised up high on a split level. The stairs to get up there were wierd - really high so it felt more like climbing into bed. We stayed in one of the normal apartments however for the majority of the time and these were delightful. Fantastic balcony overlooking lush tropical forest with waterfalls crashing below. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and each villa secluded and private. We hardly saw anyone else the whole time we were there. The main pool and bar area was a highlight - to the degree that if we went back we wouldn't get a pool villa because we'd want to use the main pool.
