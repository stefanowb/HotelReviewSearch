The more we read about French hotels, the more worried we became. It seemed as if there is no such thing as a non-smoking room in France (ditto for many other European cities). This Holiday Inn actually DOES have non-smoking rooms. We requested one when we made our reservations and when we arrived (nice check in) we went to our assigned room. The room itself was fine, but smelled horribly of stale cigarette smoke. The two of us were exhausted from our flight and just wanted to get some sleep. Even the beds smelled. I went back down to the reception area to ask to be put in another room. Initially, there was some reluctance -- \"We arranged this room just for you. This is a special room...It will be inconvenient to move you at this time\" I stuck to my guns. They gave us another room on another floor and it was heaven. Honestly, this switch saved our trip. --All the other reviewer's' comments about cleanliness and the bed comfort, etc are true. Our breakfast was included in our stay and the chocolate croissants were the best I've ever had. The location is great too. It's in a quieter area but close enough to walk to everything w/o much bother. If we were ever to return, we will come back to this hotel. I'm not sure what happened with our original hotel room and why we were placed in this room, but in the end it all worked out. Had this not occured I'd rate this establishment a \"5\". It's a clean, Holiday Inn in a great location and the hotel actually does have smoke-free rooms.", "title": "They have Non-smoking rooms!!!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "GooseB", "date": "August 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8495883}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here for 4 night.
