Only two minuses: (1) when we arrived at 1 PM and phoned Massimo from a pay phone, he didn't answer his cell phone despite several tries. So we had to trudge back to the parking lot (about 10 minutes each way) and stow our luggage in the car, and go back and get it later when we reached him. Very important to phone him BEFORE you arrive -- since we had no cell phone we didn't do this. If you arrive in the morning most likely he'll be there so should not be a problem. Also the web site indicates the latest time you can check in - I would take this seriously as staff time is limited. (2) Some traffic noise - it wasn't a problem since we were there in the winter and had the windows closed, but in the summer it would be bothersome.", "title": "Perfect location, great value", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Niall0", "date": "July 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5504623}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "What an excellent little B&B for the price paid (80 euros a night).", "title": "The perfect place to stay in Siena", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Surefolly", "date": "June 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5406696}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Tuscany", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 19, "very good": 39, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 48}, "aka": "San Francesco Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.406593406593}
