We felt super smug when we arrived and saw our comfortable looking room and were offered a glass of wine or a beer while they were in a damp field putting their tents up in the rain! We stayed in the smaller double room, but there was still room for our 6 month old to sleep comfortably in the travel cot. When he was asleep, we made use of the guest living room and dug out a few board games. Breakfast was delicious and there was plenty of choice, especially for someone who isn't a fan of the full English. I'd highly recommend this if you're looking for someone to stay slightly out of Salisbury - it's great value.", "title": "Perfect, just perfect!", "user": "katherinious", "date": "August 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 138594463}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "A great B&B experience - everything that is best about staying in a guest house applies here.

Everything I'd expect from an establishment with this ETB grading but personal touches - breakfast in a conservatory on one big table with other guests (if you get up at the same time!), freshly cooked breakfast with home-made muffins, friendly but not in your face owner. Could have booked dinner there (if you say so in advance) but there was also a pub in the village (Duck Inn) that did food as well as all the usual suspects in the city centre. Very comfortable room, spacious bathroom, shared a lounge area with other guests but also had full range of books, TV, DVD in our bedroom.

A tranquil study area with an eclectic library and music selection helps to relax before tatefully decorated rooms with soft comfortable beds and bed linen welcome you to a serene repose.
