We had specially asked for a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room. Luckily, we had arrived early in the booked-out hotel and with the help of friendly reception staff, this was quickly remedied. The air-conditioned room was comfortable, the dinner at the nice restaurant good value for money and the breakfast, as always at Novotels, was a treat. There is a swimming-pool in the nice garden. Would definitely use this hotel for another overnight stay but not for more than one day.", "title": "A perfect overnight stay", "user": "blacklab", "date": "July 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 69653043}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Does what it says on the tin", "text": "Arrived after a long journey up from the south, 5 mins off the autoroute and straight into an atypical clutch of stayover hotels - F1, Etap, 'MisterBed' and the Novotel - most owned by Accor anyway. Surprising lack of french speakers at Reception but having got my 'nous avons une reservation' speech off pat, no worries. We had two interconnecting rooms which they had allocated following an internet booking request, all very clean, quiet and ideal after a tiring day. Secure parking, nice pool, clean and welcoming, free internet facility by reception (used to book the next night in a Novotel...!)...can't ask for much more. At the end of the day, a Novotel is about being either a convenient base or an over night stay - it's not about views of grazing wildebeest nor honeymoons.
