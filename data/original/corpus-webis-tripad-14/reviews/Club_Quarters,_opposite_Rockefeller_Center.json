Traffic was horrendous, because in my divine wisdom, I decided to select the avoid tolls option on my GPS! BAD MOVE! Uggghhh... so after fighting with traffic, we finally arrived. We were lucky to find parking right in front of the hotel. We waited a while because there was a huge rush but the concierge, was very patient and kept checking in on us and updating us on how things were going. She noticed that we had a small baby with us, and said that all she had was a smoking room but would look to find another option in consideration of our son! How sweet! We ended up in a smaller room than what I booked online, but the manager offered us a comp'd night within a year and Iris (I think her name was) offered us free breakfast! Talk about good customer service! The room was comfortable, a little tiny but seriously it wasn't an issue. It was furnished nicely, everything was neat and clean and the bathroom was without issue as well! I was very comfortable. We had breakfast the following morning on their outdoor patio and looked over at Rockerfeller center. The location is great! Walking distance to everything--attractions, eating shopping etc. I can't wait to go back!", "title": "Great find in the city!", "user": "BushTea", "date": "November 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144635629}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed at Club Quarters in October for business reason.
