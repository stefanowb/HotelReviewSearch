{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 513, "name": "The Chatwal, A Luxury Collection Hotel, New York", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "As a Starwood Gold member (just recently downgraded from Platinum), we used 30,000 points for a 1-night stay at The Chatwal. Although the hotel is a very nice property, it did not come close to our expectations for a \"Category 7\" hotel. We requested an upgrade a couple of weeks before our stay and informed a \"front office supervisor\" that we would be celebrating a special birthday. He responded promptly and said he would do his best to obtain an upgrade but could make no promises. Our reservation was for a \"grand deluxe\" 400-square foot room. At check-in, we were advised that we had been \"upgraded\" to a larger room (but not a suite) on the tenth floor. The room, in fact, was the bedroom of a suite and had a locked, adjoining door to the suite itself. It had two windows, but limited natural light and no view to speak of. One of the first things we noticed was that the occupants of the suite kept trying the adjoining door to our room (presumably assuming it belonged to their suite). This was a bit unsettling from a security standpoint. The room was luxuriously appointed but did not appear to me to measure anywhere near 400 square feet. The bathroom had 2 sinks, a heated toilet (which held no appeal to us in 90+ degree weather), a TV built into the mirror, and a rainshower tub/jacuzzi (but not very much room for toiletries). The bedroom had a sitting area, desk, and coffee table, with a good selection of interesting magazines. The major disappointment we had was that the so-called \"lap pool\" was not a lap pool at all. I would call it a \"plunge pool\" at best. The spa attendants referred to it as a \"resistance pool\"--it is the type of pool that would be installed in a luxury condominium unit that does not have the space for a \"real\" pool. I tried it out (very skeptically) as I am a devoted lap swimmer and found that I could not take more than one stroke before being pulled back to the wall of the pool. I am sure there is an art to mastering this type of pool, but it is not for real swimmers. The picture of the pool on the website makes it look much larger than it is and, when I mentioned this to the spa attendants, they laughed (good naturedly) and said they did not understand how it could have been so misrepresented. All in all, our one-night stay for an occasion that we hoped would be quite memorable was nothing special. Perhaps it was naive of me to expect the level of luxury that we had encountered in such properties as Tambo del Inka in Urubamba, Peru, the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, the Park Hyatt Palacio Duhau in Buenos Aires, the Nadesar Palace in Varanasi, the Taj Mahal in Mumbai, and even the ITC Maurya in New Delhi and the ITC Mughal in Agra. I wish I had saved my 30,000 points for a truly seven-star property.", "title": "Great Expectations", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DCRE", "date": "July 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134619881}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed at this hotel in June 2012. My first impressions were great. I thought the location near Times SQ would make it really noisy, but it's actually set far back enough from the action that you're not really affected by the hustle and bustle of the square. The hotel's proximity to 42nd St station and Grand Central make it perfect for getting around NYC. We had a little trouble with our credit card when we checked in: the staff tried to put a 'hold' for the total cost of our stay on it, as is normal practice, but it was being declined (my bank thought it was a fraudulent purchase and stopped my card). However the staff were so pleasant and understanding about the situation- not snooty at all- and gave me the time to sort everything out. The room was phenomenal. We stayed in a suite which came with a butler! To be honest we didn't use him much, but it was great to know that he was there. The concierge was super, printing out all of our boarding passes for us the day before departure and putting them under our door, and the reception staff, especially Elizabeth and Catalina, were the most friendly hotel staff I have come across in a long time. We were even loaned a laptop for the duration of our stay. I think a lot of hotels forget simple things, like remembering the name of guests, smiling, and being genuinely helpful. The Chatwal had all this perfected and it made this a truly great stay. The only reason i haven't given this hotel a full five stars (although I'd like to give it 4.5 out of 5, but TripAdvisor doesn't allow that) is because the control panel for the lighting/curtains in the room was a little complex and confusing and on a couple details didn't work. But our butler sorted it out, so it was fine in the end! I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anybody visiting NYC- I've been coming every year for the past 8 years and this is the best hotel I've stayed at in the city.", "title": "Surprisingly good location", "user": "EMCLondon", "date": "July 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134596308}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "For our first trip to New York, my girlfriend and I and chose to stay at The Chatwal because I read quite a few very good reviews on this hotel.

I enjoyed a drink in the hotel bar and while the drink was delicious, my friend and I were ignored until we flagged down a waiter and then ignored again once we got our drinks until we flagged him down again for the check.
