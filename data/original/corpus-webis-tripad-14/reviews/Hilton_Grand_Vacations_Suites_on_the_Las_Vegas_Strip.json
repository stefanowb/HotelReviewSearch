We always book the 1 bdrm suite b/c it has a washer and dryer. The rooms are clean and well equipped. They even give u detergent! Views are not so great b/c of the massive hotel being built across the street right now. However, it is really convenient to everything and it's very easy to get your car in and out. There is a small grocery store on the bottom floor which has just about everything. The rates average about $100 per nite. Valet is very fast. There is no casino here and not much of a lobby.
