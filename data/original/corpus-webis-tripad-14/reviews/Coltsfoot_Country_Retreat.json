There is a good range of starters, mains and desserts and trust me they fill you till bursting point.

The toiletries were molton brown and I had the choice of shower with jets or a massive bath.Unfortunately i did not have time to enjoy the facilities and the hotel as it was an over night stay for me and i arrived late. However the time i spent there was very relaxing and will definitely go back there.

They did try and charge us an excessive amount for having \u201cuse\u201d of this, \u00a3500, we felt this was totally unacceptable as in our opinion it should be part of the venue, the reason why it is there is because the venue isn\u2019t big enough in it\u2019s current state for the numbers they have.
