We've been to nola several times and have always stayed in one of the big hotels. I wanted, however, to try something more authentic to New Orleans and convinced my husband to give it a try. Glenn and Diana Smith, the new innkeepers, were terrific and the inn is better than we anticipated. The beds in our suite were so comfortable we didn't want to get up. The free use of the computer was particularly helpful to us. We had everything we needed. There was fresh fruit and other goodies daily, a refridgerator outside our door for our use, and a lovely patio area in the back.", "title": "Clean, charming and affordable!", "user": "dukes225", "date": "October 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20780356, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beds and amenities", "disliked": "\u2014 Can't think of anything"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "The location is safe, the neighborhood charming and we never had a problem finding a parking spot on the street.", "title": "A great little B&B", "user": "John H", "date": "June 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16772753, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Staff friendliness, relaxed courtyard atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Small rooms"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Charming place", "text": "Diana works tirelessly keeping it clean and comfortable.
