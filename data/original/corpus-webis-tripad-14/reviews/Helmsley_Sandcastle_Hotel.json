Yes, it is \"dated\" - that's part of it's charm. I always think I'll see the Rat Pack there - and once I even did see Leona. You can go to any other hotel in Sarasota, or anywhere for that matter, and they all start to look the same. The Helmsley is unique and my favorite place to stay anywhere because it takes me back to a simpler, more relaxed time. My husband and I got married at the Helmsley in 2003 and my family loved it so much, we decided to come back every year for our family reunion. Every time I go to Sarasota to visit my in-laws, we stay at the Helmsley. The service is superb, the staff is friendly - Julia in sales is tops! Plus, the rooms are spacious and clean and you can walk right onto the beach or to the pool or the lovely courtyard. No, it's not perfect - what hotel is? But the web-site does not misrepresent anything about this hotel, and you will never find a deal like the Helmsley for a beach-front room on the Gulf. If you want modern, go to the Hyatt and over-pay for a generic room on the bay. If you want the most relaxing, charming place on the most beautiful beach in the world for a great deal, stay at the Helmsley!", "title": "My favorite place", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "jaimeekga", "date": "October 5, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2620645}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "wonderful", "text": "I have stayed here twice and can't wait to get back in November. various mebers of my family have accompanied me on these trips and we have all had a wonderful time.

The Gulf front rooms are heaven to walk out in the morning onto the beach and to not even worry about putting shoes on. Itis safe clean comfortable the staff are lovely the food is wonderful. everyone there just wants you to have a good holiday. The whole point of the Helmsley is that it is a beach hotel hence no long corridors and closed in walkways as stated by Hotel/motel! It is so laid back there you can't fail to relax. If you want entertainment St Armands is great for strolling around there are Flea Markets near by a Dog Track many resturants.

I found the hotel room to be clean and spacious. I guess I must not be able to tell if the hotel decor is updated because it didn't seem old or shabby to me. The staff we encountered was, without exception, friendly and helpful. We booked directly through the hotel website because it was the least expensive option we found. A Gulf side room was $199/ night. I didn't see anything close to that on the water in Sarasota.

After reading some of the reviews, we were anxious to see if we had made a mistake in booking this hotel. Quite the contrary! We were upgraded to a beach-front room that was spotless. The pools were sparkling and service was exceptional. While the outside is deceiving (it looks dated), the inside was wonderful. I have to say that if I was just driving around looking for a place to stay, I would not have chosen this hotel from the outside appearance. However, I am glad we stayed and we will be back. We also found it to be exceptionally quiet in the evenings even though the pool was open until 10 p.m. The only meal that we ate there was breakfast before leaving for the airport. It was good but the food cannot compare to the restaurants in St. Armands. For those who are planning to book a last-minute vacation, you do need to ask about Red Tide. Because of this, we were not able to go into the water. However, the beach was cleaned daily and cabanas were available for a reasonable fee.", "title": "Really impressed after reading some of the reviews!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "SXMChick", "date": "June 23, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3607225}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Hotel, Great Staff", "text": "We were well pleased, with a, pretty, oversized room.

Food was great, also. Everyone was so helpful. The only complaints we had, was that, towels could have been put out sooner in the morning, for pool, and, rules around pool area could have been better enforced, due to diving into pool, and , very upsetting, and disturbing, that, small little girls, being unclothed, around pool, running back and fourth, to room, naked.

We asked for a room facing the courtyard because we wanted something quiet and we experienced no excess noise except for the occasional sound of someone using the shuffleboard court during the daytime hours and sometimes we could hear our next-door neighbours talking but nothing that disturbed our sleep. We didn't pay the extra for the Gulf view but our room was at the beach side of the hotel so we got the view anyway. The room was adequate -- two double beds (too soft for our comfort), moderately decorated, and yes, it could use significant redecorating but it was certainly clean enough and there was a nice little balcony with a table and two chairs. There was no bathtub but a nice big shower. The beach is gorgeous -- wide, white sand, cabanas and beach chairs available for a moderate cost. We walked on the beach but unfortunately found the Gulf too cold to swim in. The pool area (two pools) was great -- lovely warm water, lots of chairs and towels, umbrella tables and an outdoor 'cafe' under a big awning. There was also a nice beach bar that served lunch and drinks. We chose to have breakfasts and some lunches there (sandwiches, seafood baskets, hamburgers, etc.) and went out for dinner. I did look at their dinner menu and was surprised at the high prices. You can do much better with some careful menu-reading on the upscale, lively St. Armand Circle which is about a 10-minute drive away. Also, go into Sarasota proper for some good restaurants on Main Street. We found the service at the hotel pleasant and friendly and didn't have to wait for anything more than a few minutes. I do agree, though, that this wouldn't be a very interesting place for kids, especially teens -- not a lot of watersports or other amenities to keep them interested. I must say though that my first impression on entering from the car park was that I was going into a women's prison (pink building, no windows on that side of the building) but it was no problem -- it's just how we got into and out of our room. Let's face it, this is not the most glamorous hotel on the Key but it was just fine for our purposes. We had great weather and we really just wanted to laze by the pool, read, swim and go out in the evening and it was just fine for that.", "title": "OK Rooms, lovely outdoor area", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "HDM", "date": "February 28, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3236970}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A real gem!", "text": "Long live Mrs Helmsley, and make the Helmsley Sandcastle go on and on and on .....
