Staff seemed fairly polite but not quite the customer service you'd expect from hospitality staff. For instance checking out in the morning, the young man asked me to wait because he was getting more coffee. Now as a shift worker I understand what kind of emergency coffee can be at times but seems his priorities need a little work. I told him not to worry about the receipt as I wanted to leave, he said ok and left to get the coffee I presumed. The girl checking us in seemed friendly enough, recommended a place to eat and showed us on the map exactly where it was.
