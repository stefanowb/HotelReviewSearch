Given umbrellas to borrow on a rainy day, good dining recommendations, questions always answered with a smile, and the desk attendant walked us to our water taxi on our check out day.

The rooms and public areas are covered in interesting art works and there is even an accompanying brochure which explains them all. We were given a large room at the front of the hotel over the square and bar below. The room was almost like a suite with a seperate sitting area. Yes some of the decoration and furniture is dated but that is part of the hotel's charm. The room was clean and bright and we loved going back to it after long days taking in the sights of Venice. After a show one night we opened the windows to hear opera singers singing in the bar below and it was wonderful. Staff were courteous,helpful and efficient. Absolutely no complaints and if we ever returned to Venice this is where we would want to stay. Please do not be put off by poor reviews about this hotel.
