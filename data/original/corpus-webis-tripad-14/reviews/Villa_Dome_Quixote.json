We were traveling through the Kootenays to deal with my husband's father's estate. We were tired, emotional, and in need of some sort of balance or sanity. We happened upon New Denver because I wanted to visit the Japanese-Canadian Internment Museum and were lucky that they were open for a school group that day. When we saw the domes we had to stay. Our room was lovely. The person who booked us in was fine but basically the domes are stand alone units with kitchens so we didn't get any service. Our room was amazing. It was so fresh and open and yet also cozy. It just felt right. I thought that all that talk about round rooms being healthy was mumbo jumbo but I did feel good. The place had a lovely contemporary design to it. The bathroom was luxuryious. The main building was very cool to explore and the outdoor hot tub was just what we needed. The plush towels were devine. The town is small and rustic but the people were lovely. We bought groceries, a bottle of wine and rented a film to watch on my laptop (no TV) and had a lovely stay. Best part of it was that our dog was welcomed in too. We had spent the same cash staying at crapy motels in BC and were delighted with Dome Quixote. I would stay here again.
