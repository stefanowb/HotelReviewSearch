We did enjoy the beach grill, and the 24 hour snack bar. Tourists do need to relax when it comes to the food; the doors would open, and people would run like they were on-fire to get to one of the grill stations first. I was behind a young 20 something girl who seems to think she's better than everyone/everything, who was screaming to her mother about what a review she'd be posting on Trip Advisor about how the rolls were hard. Get over yourself, and decide if it's worth complaining about before you complain about it. The poor workers slaving, yes, slaving, over our omelets, pasta, etc, have to work in that heat for hours, with little thanks. I will say however, it seems that the buffet area is mismanaged.

Upon arrival in Cuba we were nearly knocked out by the heat, this place is hot, people we met were friendly and helpful and not at all pushy. At the resort we were very pleased to find we had a large family room with a cot as requested, next door were our friends who also had kids and they were also pleased -both having ground floor apartments in the 400's meant we were central to everything. We understood that there had been a bit of a lack of rain - 3 and half months so everything wasn't as green as expected, however, still a beautiful place and who wants rain anyway! As this wasnt peak season we reaped the benefits of not having to queue for sunbeds, food or drink, the kids were more than happy in the pools or at the beach - our 2 year old son took a particular liking to Yan Ellis who couldn't have done more with mini disco, dancing, and generally making us feel extremely welcome and relaxed. Although it wasn't busy the 'Animation' team worked hard to get people involved, Johan, who looks like a basketball star cannot go unnoticed, he is a big guy and always on the microphone around the pool doing dance classes or aqua aerobics. A special mention also to the ladies making the Omelettes, Smoothies and Pasta (sorry i didn't get your names) but lovely people and also to Yamir our waiter who was a top guy, really friendly, likes his football and always made sure we had a good table and plenty to drink. The only downside i can mention are the miserable staff in the shop who have either just been told they have days to live or need to take a serious look at their attitude - we were spending money and it was a real shame.
