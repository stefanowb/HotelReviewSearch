I had requested, online, a room close to a lift or ground floor. When we got there the room was the first one in the hallway from reception which they said was as per my request. That already impressed me because people often miss that. The staff was so friendly and stressed to the person checking in before us and to us that they wanted us to have a relaxing stay. The room is decorated in relaxing colors and we loved the big wood door for the bathroom that had holes at the bottom, presumably for steam. We opened the window to a lovely view, sat on the bed \"for a few minutes\" and proceeded to fall asleep! So yes, it is a relaxing atmosphere. After a tasty dinner at the restaurant we went to the jacuzzi. You can reserve the jacuzzi for your own party (seats up to about 6 if I remember right) and the sauna for 1 hour. We woke up to a nice breakfast with a good amount of variety. They let us check out a little later since we were going on a tour of the mine that morning. The hotel can arrange tickets for you but we had reserved already. Overall we loved the atmosphere at the hotel and would happily stay there again. The price was reasonable too. And if you are touring the mine (which you should!) it is right next to the entrance.", "title": "Beautiful hotel, perfect location for the mine", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SJNK", "date": "August 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173252149}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went there at the end of July, it was very hot so air conditioning was very welcomed.
