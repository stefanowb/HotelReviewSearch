Seems to be more of a residence than a hotel, and English speaking staff not allways on hand, but they could not be more friendly or accomodating. Close enough to two Skytrain depots (consider a Pass for longer stays), and grocery outlets (found under department stores!

The hotel is between two sky train stations which is great! You can walk a few blocks and be right near shopping, night market, food and transportation. This hotel is very basic... nothing luxurious about it. I like staying here because I am in BKK all the time and dont need the hotel staff to help me with anything. This hotel is great for a long stay or for someone who knows BKK and how to get around. If you are need to BKK I suggest staying a hotel that has english speaking or foreign speaking staff... I like this hotel because I am just there to shower and sleep... I dont need a pool or anything like that...
