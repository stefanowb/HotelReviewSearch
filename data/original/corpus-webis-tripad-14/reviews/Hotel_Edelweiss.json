It is a well-run, clean and comfortable hotel where the staff are great, the food is comforting and you are made to feel very welcome. Our room overlooked the front hotel garden and had a good sized balcony. It had comfortable beds, a great shower and plenty of storage. Breakfast was a selection of cereals, toast, fruits, cheeses and meats or cooked breakfast and you were able to make up a packed lunch which was a welcome addition. A very useful card was left on the table each morning showing the weather forecast for the day, suggestions of places to visit and the menu selection for the evening. The owners, Klaus and Veronika were always pleasant and would enquire what your plans were for the day and offer any additional tips to make your walk or journey more enjoyable. After going for a nice walk the afternoon tea/coffee and cake was just lovely and kept you going until the evening meal. The dinners offered a salad buffet, soup of the day, starter and a selection of three main courses (one vegetarian) plus desert. The food isn't fine dining but there was more than enough to suit everyone's tastes and it was well-cooked homely food.", "title": "Simply brilliant!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Mrsrobs", "date": "July 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134264574}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Kitzbuhel itself surprised us with the number of things to do in the immediate area.
