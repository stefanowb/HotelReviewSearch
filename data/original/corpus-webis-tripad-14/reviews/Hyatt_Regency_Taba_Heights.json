The local wine, Obelisk, at the current exchange rate is about \u00a312 odd a bottle which is more or less what I\u2019d pay in a restaurant here in Bolton for a decent Pinot Grigio. In most bars, the local beer is about \u00a33 a pint but there are, however, two for one happy hour offers, details of which are in the hotel information packs in the room. From memory, the Beach bar has the offer from 4.00pm till 6.00, the Rocks bar 6.00pm till 7.00 and the Breeze Bar has selected after dinner spirits and liqueurs on offer till late. In the Breeze bar, you also get to see the barman do some fairly interesting tricks with burning sambuca. Finally, Waterworld, sometimes, I think, referred to as the Dive Centre has a very nice caf\u00e9 by the sea and from 4.00 sells local beer at E\u00a314 a pint (about \u00a31.20).
