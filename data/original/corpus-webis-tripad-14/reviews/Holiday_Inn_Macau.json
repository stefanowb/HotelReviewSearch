It's close to the Grand Lisboa and the Wynn. From the Grand Lisboa, it's easy to catch a city bus that will drop you off at the Venetian casinos on the other island.

We had a suite with a comfortable king-size bed that helped us quickly overcome our jetlag from after a long flight from the U.S. The room and furniture were a bit dated and rough around the edges, but we didn't plan to spend much time in the room anyway, so that was easily overlooked. The location allowed for easy exploration of the city. It was only blocks from larger casinos and historic areas, so we walked most places during our long weekend here. A shuttle runs regularly to the ferry terminal, making connections to casinos and shopping on the other island simple. Breakfast was included in the hotel price for us. There was a large selection of food and friendly staff in the restaurant. The front-desk staff and concierge also were helpful throughout the stay. As others have mentioned, smoking is allowed in public areas, so we had to dodge smelly clouds of smoke while waiting for elevators. The main negative was a gross, moldy bathmat in our bathroom.

Smoking is allowed within most places in macau so if this bothers you then finding a hotel is going to be a bit of a problem for you. The rooms are nice and spacious with comfortable beds. Hotel staff I found to be friendly and most of them speak very good english and are glad to be of any help. Food at the restaurants isnt too bad either but there are some better places to grab a feed outside the hotel. There is also a pool and hot tub as well as a spa centre, useful for those needing some stress relief. The hotel is conveniently located as well being located a couple of minutes away from grand lisboa, wynn and mgm to name a few as well as a couple of minutes away from most bars and nightclubs.

However Holiday Inn in Macau was horribly different. I reserved the renovated deluxe room. They charged us for breakfast that we had evidence from them in an email that the breakfast was for two. They charged us tourism charges which I have never seen before. The price difference between online price estimate and actual charge was much more expensive than priority club due to additional charges called tourism charge and other charges. This was in addition to tax charges. Quality of service was poor no phone calls answered for room service after 10-11pm. I booked two rooms. My guest in another room had the same feeling that the service was poor. During check out they did not let me pay earlier and drop the key cards. they told me that rooms should be evacuated and investigated first. The breakfast the person in charge of egg station was never ever there. Pool is very small compare to other hotels in Macau. Internet is NOT for free although it says in room wifi access but you have to pay for it. Staff are not so friendly. If you want to go to Macau stay away from this hotel.

Most of the time we waited in long taxi lines at the major hotels to get around. When we did call a taxi, we didn't have a problem.
