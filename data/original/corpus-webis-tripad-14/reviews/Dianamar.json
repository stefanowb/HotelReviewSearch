I often don't take the time to write reviews, but for me, this was by far the least acceptable accommodation I have ever stayed in. I normally stay in mid-range places, anywhere from 100-150 Euros a night, sometimes less/more, and I never unrealistically expect perfection. There were a handful of reviews for the Dianamar, all positive when I had booked, and I thought at 60 Euros a night I could definitely do without AC or a TV, since the accommodations were in a great location, and the rooms seemed nice coupled with special touches (e.g., beach towels, parasols, afternoon cake, etc.).", "title": "Not for everyone and definitely not for me", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "nbologne", "date": "July 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 70793245}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our room was clean, and for us the size of the room/bathroom was fine, and the location was fantastic (only a 5 minute walk to the beach).

Worst night of non-sleep I ever had, my body was numb, seriously considered sleeping on the floor, ruined my night and also the next day for me since I was sleep deprived. Just because you only charge 60 Euros a night does not give you the right to not replace your mattresses when required - I travel extensively and do not have high expectations of mattresses by the way. The other annoyance was the lack of the shower head being mounted. I'm on a hot beach vacation, covered in sunscreen, sand, and sweat and not being able to go back to my hotel and properly wash off was a huge inconvenience, made worse because the water would go back and forth from being cold and lukewarm, and there was almost no water pressure, and little running water makes it hard to properly clean yourself. I felt so unclean and greasy during my stay.", "title": "The saviour of our holiday!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Pastapesto", "date": "December 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 51206431}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Given the poor \"sleep\" and inability to properly cleanse ourselves, the fact that there was no AC also became an issue since the problems were piling up and our tolerance levels were going down. We constantly ran the fan they provided us, but in 35 degree heat it was still uncomfortable and hot/sweaty in the room, and I might as well mention the fan is really loud when you are trying to sleep (I slept with ear plugs), and be aware that if you turn the fan off, in our room at least, you will hear the insects steadily chirping right outside so not a quiet sleep regardless.
