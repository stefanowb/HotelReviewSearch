I didn't think I would like a Hampton Inn, but this location is perfect. The lobby is tiny and its so easy to get in and out of the hotel. My room was very impressive. Large and open with a huge terrace. Splurge for the 19th floor terrace room. It's so worth it. The view is amazing. Empire State Building, Chrysler building, midtown skyline, Hudson River all at ur back window. The view is even better than the public terrace outside your door. The construction in the lobby was unobtrusive. The cafe that is being worked on wouldn't be a place you would want to go anyway.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jaypowen", "date": "August 16, 2013", "id": 172562095}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "We visited during renovation yet it was not loud.
