The roads are used for coaches. The hotel offers a valet parking service, which I didn't need on this occasion, but I'd certainly inquire about it if I intended to arrive by car on a Friday or Saturday.

The Dom Hotel provide the most exceptional service of any hotel I have stayed at in Europe. Starting from their welcome to the room it is all exceptional first class. First off the location is within direct sight of the Cologne Cathedral, just across the square. The train station is a three to four minute walk from the hotel. Paricularly great during the frequent rains in Cologne during the spring. The room they gave us on the first floor had a large balcony with picture access to the cathedral. Very clean with the best of toiletries. The room which I paid for with Starwood Points and cash was exceptionally large and first rate. Nice new furnishings in a large classy room. However what sets this hotel apart from others is the exceptional concierge service and general manager. The three concierges went out of their way to help us with every reservation and piece of information about how to get to different places in Cologne and the Rhine Valley. They printed out the schedules and gave detailed directions, pointed out what to see, and how to get back at night. They were all first rate. I wish i would have kept the names of the three different males that provided assistance to us during the two days we stayed there to give them adequate credit. In addition, there is nothing too small to ask the general manager to do. My only fear is that as good as he is he will leave the hotel for one of the larger facilites in Europe. He trains his staff well and it shows! There is also free internet service at the hotel and three computers available for desks. I never had any problems using the internet and staying on as long as I like. The only negative about the hotel is there is not an on-site gym or fitness center at the facility and the price of food and drinks in the hotel is very expensive. However the concierges were more than happy to point out places that catered to any budget. Please check out this hotel if you like a great location and exceptional service. Definitely the best of the Le Meridien chain I have stayed in during trips to Europe.
