Everything you needed in the kitchen and a parking space right outside. Laundry and BBQ available for all guests to share, again spotless. Hosts were very helpful. Only a short walk from Ellen Cove which is one end of Middleton Beach and an even shorter walk to Bay Merchants, a lovely deli/specialty food outlet which is open for breakfast, lunch and tea. We could only find one restaurant (on the beach) which was pricey and the Squid Shack at Emu Point had been recommended but we were disappointed with the food. Lots of restaurants in Albany itself which is about 3km away. Beautiful area - Whale World is well worth a visit as is The Gap and the Natural Bridge which are both close by. Another lovely beach was Little Beach in Two Peoples Bay east of Middleton.", "title": "Everything you need a block from the beach", "user": "UKBells", "date": "March 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 102059850}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Stayed here for 2 nights while in Albany.
