I would also refer readers to the Hostal Marissal across the square on the Balcon. Other family members stayed here. Whilst it did not have a 24 hour reception, the rooms were beautiful and overlooked the square on one side. There was a lovely cafe area where you could buy cooked breakfast. We had never been to Nerja before and were there for a wedding.

The staff were at all times friendly and helpful, explaining where to find free car parking on arrival, and providing early breakfast when we left. The room was comfortable and would have been surprisingly quiet considering the location had we not been staying during the Feria. It meant we had to close windows at night and rely on the air con which was OK, if slightly noisy. Free wi-fi worked fine in our room and for British travellers suffering TV withdrawal symptoms, there are all the main BBC and ITV channels. Breakfasts were fine with really lovely fresh bread, although we would have welcomed a little more variety, particularly some fresh fruit. But this is a minor quibble. We recommend it highly.

(2 adults, 2 children - 13yo and 9yo). Firstly, this hotel is perfectly located in Nerja. Right beside the church in the main square of Balcon de Europa. You don't need any form of transportation but your feet to get around the town or down to the beaches. Secondly, it looks very newly renovated and is spotlessly clean everywhere. The staff are very pleasant, friendly and helpful. The hotel is small and quiet, I'd say about 24 roooms or so on 2 floors, yet you can easily mind your own business as there is very little interaction with other guests apart from in the mornings for breakfast. Breakfast was fine, standard continental, but the choice was good and fresh. (Breakfast room is a little bit small, but not too cramped) The rooms are quite spacious but aren't too elaborate with furnishings or decor, but they're perfectly clean and modern and fine for anyone who doesn't care for un-necessary fancy stuff. Air-conditioning is very good. Sound-proofing is good when balcony doors are closed to busy pedestrian street outside so your sleep won't be disrupted. (Mid-summer in Nerja has people on the streets all night long) The rooftop terrace is very spacious with plenty of sun-loungers and parasols so again, you can still mind your own business. One small criticism is that the pool is very small, but if you're lucky, like we were, there were no other children staying in the hotel at the time, so you could have it all to yourself most of the time! If you're not happy with that, you can be on the beach in less that 5 mins. The hotel offers a very useful facility for you to leave your bags, shower (towels provided) and get organised after you have checked out on the last day which we availed of.
