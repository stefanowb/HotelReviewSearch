In one sentence: It was a delight to be at this hostel, it is definitely the best hostel I have been in Argentina. The people of the hostel (owners, workers and the 2 dogs!) here were so helpful and nice with us. You can notice that the owners do not run it only for money, but also because they love to run a hostel. The hostel s extremely clean, the dorms, the common room but also the bathrooms. The drinks they sell are practically at supermarket prices. The only bad thing I can say is that the dorms have no closet to use with a padlock, at least not a good one. They have also on well working PC with fast internet.

The place was very clean and had lots of extras like the organic jams at breakfast. The only two not great things I experienced were 1 - the activities being booked or cancelling last minute and 2 - the showers get clogged very early in the morning with hair so you stand in a puddle of water during your shower.
