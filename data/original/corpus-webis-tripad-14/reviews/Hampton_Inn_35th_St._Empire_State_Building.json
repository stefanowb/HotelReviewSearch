I arrived at around 11.00 prepared to drop of my bag prior to hitting the streets of NYC, but the very nice girl on reception said if I would like to wait 10 minutes my room would be ready, and it was. Great, comfortable rooms with ample space. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds are very comfortable after all the walking entailed in a day in New York. I love the location of this hotel - just across the road from Macy's and close to the subway and good bars and restaurants.
