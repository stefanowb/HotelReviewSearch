The hotel had the clean, high standard finish you would expect of any Marriot. The location is literally 2 minutes from fishermans wharf but the hotel doesnt benefit from any stunning views of the wharf or the golden gate bridge from any windows. It has an almost dwarfed apperance and in honesty looks more like a motel; It is only once inside you see the luxury. We had a hire car with us and were told there was no where to park in the vicinty and had no choice but to take advantage of the hotels garage which we thought would be free or at a discount at least for residents...but it actually cost \u00a345 for 2 nights parking!! Our room cost alot and this on top was extortionate espcially as my partners uncle was paying for it I couldnt enjoy our stay as much thinking about it. On the upside our room was great and the bed very comfy but purly on extreme lack of value for money I would go else where next time.", "title": "\"Great location but expensive\"", "user": "Travelling_Queenie", "date": "March 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14301820}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Marriotts have never disappointed me!", "text": "I just got back, had great Marriott service as I always do and would stay at this one again in a heartbeat.
