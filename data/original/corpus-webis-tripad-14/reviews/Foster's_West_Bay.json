Foster's is rustic but very clean and our bed was so comfortable that we slept 9-10 hours most nights. We didn't miss that we had no TV in our room because we could relax on the beach with a book or read in the hammock on our porch. We could walk out the door and be at the beach in seconds. The beach is well maintained by Foster and every morning it is raked. The water is calm and perfect for just floating about and cooling off. When we were rested there were many activities to choose from and all within a short walk of Fosters. If you want to dive there is a dive shop right on the site. Anemone is the name and they are a great group of instructors that focus on small groups. We also booked a day of sailing right from West Bay and you can also get a massage from Edgar right on the beach. There are tons of things to do once you feel like doing them. If you just want to relax Fosters is a great place to unplug.

This year was our third year in a row that we've been staying with Foster. Each time we arrive, it feels like we've come home again. We get big hugs all around! This special island getaway has been carved right out of the jungle and sits tucked away on the perfectly secluded stretch of Roatan's best beach. I love awakening to the sounds of several red macaws as they fly overhead, squawking, finally to perch themselves on a branch right beside your ocean view porch. I've traveled to many far-away lands but nothing comes close to this magical paradise. We've stayed in three different units and they've all been great! Our favorite is the Lower Roundhouse. You can rent the individual rooms but if you have enough people you can all stay in the entire lower level with one large common area-full kitchen, dining area and living room. There are three separate rooms closed off with their own small fridges and bathrooms (my shower could fit 10 peope in it). With 5 of us sharing the entire lower level, I think it cost us approx. $300 per peson for the week. You can't beat that! As others have mentioned there is great food and nightlife only steps from the resort but the food at Fosters is great as well. Don't miss Lobster night or the famous Monkey La La! One important note: We are divers and spend most mornings diving without ever enjoying the other island activities. Every year Foster's son Ray has tried to entice us with a snorkeling trip to Cayos Cochinos but the first two years we declined due to diving. I kept saying to him, \"What don't you understand about this? We are divers. We certainly won't lose a full day of diving just to snorkel.\" However, this year I was unable to dive so we took him up on his offer. I cannot emphasize enough how foolish I felt that we had turned him down the first two years. This was a one of a kind trip! As we approached the second island of the Cayos chain where we were scheduled to eat lunch, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. My jaw hit the ground. I was speechless. The beauty of this place was intoxicating. The island is called Cacahuate. It's a tiny crescent shaped island, where only 100 Garifuna villagers live. They prepared a lunch of fresh grilled snapper, grilled plaintains and rice and beans. Of all the wonderful moments on Roatan over the past three years, this for sure was the hightlight!

I had gotten to the hotel early as I had been traveling and was meeting my boyfriend on Roatan (he was flying in from Ohio). I arrived at the hotel and was greeted by the extra nice owner, Mr. Foster, who showed me to our room, but casually mentioned that the TREEHOUSE also just happened to be available. Are you kidding me? He stated that it was the only one on the island. One look up the vast spiral stair case heading 50 feet up the huge Mango tree and I was sold. It was very cool. The rustic room was complete with indoor plumbing (sink, toilet, shower (on the porch)), a refrigerator, bottled water, linens, etc. The toilet is only separated by a curtain and the shower is more of a pipe of cool water that runs out onto the porch. So the key is to shower at night under the stars so noone can much you. But what an experience to wake up in the tree to the sounds of birds and have views out to the beautiful beach and Carribean sea. And I really can't say enough how nice and helpful Mr. Foster and sons were. I was given a personal tour to some other parts of the island owned by the family...other special places are contained here, but I was sworn to say no more. The were pleased to explain any and all possible activities going on and figure ways for you to get there. One of the sons is now offering fishing charters. We went on this and got a whole lot more than a fishing charter. We fished plus got a tour and went snorkling. I might add that the beach is beautiful (minus sandflies - spray!) and Gimbalina Park (sp?) was excellent and within walking distance of the resort. At Gimbalina, we played with monkeys, and parrots, ate traditional Honduran food and learned much about the history and cultures of Honduras.

This is not a 3, 4, or 5 star resort. No office, they were in the process of rebuilding. Noisy, a lot of bugs, swamp and garbage dump in back, alot of people on beach when cruise ships are in town, and that was the only time chairs were cleaned and put out. We stayed in the A-frame building. It does have a good location, if you enjoy listening to construction sounds, sawing, hammering, and chipping of rocks. The stairs in the loft were a joke. If you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night you take your life in your own hands, but the flood lights across the compound brighten up the inside so you don't need any lights on. There is a sliding glass door to no where. There isn't a deck so do not have too many monkey la las and get drunk and fall out. The faucet is tricky, you just have to figure out how to turn it off. Too much thinking for me. The bats in the rafters were alot of fun, just don't sit under them because they do their business upside down. You can feed them bananas. Actually they were a pleasant distraction. This place is in need of alot of repairs, so if you book a room check to see if they are finish with construction. Take all of your own toiletries, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner etc. They did provide soap. Take alot of bug spray. There were more bugs on the island than on the mainland. If you get tired of the sun, sea, and bugs, take a few days and go to Copan, you won't be sorry. It is an inexpensive trip if you go by the bus, Hedman Alas. Good places to eat were Bite on the Beach, breakfast buffet at Henry Morgans. If you go exploring the island go to 6 Huts.
