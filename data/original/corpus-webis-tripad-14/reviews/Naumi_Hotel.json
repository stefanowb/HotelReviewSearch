Incredible lap pool on roof. Nice style. Great breakfast. Wish it was possible to open the windows and get fresh air. Staff needs to be trained in hotel basics, very helpful but quite inefficient. I would stay again. Really enjoyed the style and cleanliness.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mitchmu", "date": "June 19, 2008", "id": 17059211}], "location": {"country": "Singapore", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 18, "average": 42, "very good": 187, "terrible": 10, "excellent": 487}, "aka": "Metropole Hotel Singapore", "slim_ranking": 0.0555555555556, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Naumi Hotel is an intimate retreat in Singapore that presents a selection of 73 elegantly-appointed rooms to cocoon guests in comfort.
