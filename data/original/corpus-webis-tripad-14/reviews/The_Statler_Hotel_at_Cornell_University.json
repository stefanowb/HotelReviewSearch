The Valet staff hustled and we had our car in minutes whenever we needed it. The staff was helpful and courteous. It was a nice place to stay. The room was very clean. I would stay there again.

This is where the problem occurs. As the hotel is connected to the Cornell Hospitality School, you would expect it to offer something a little different and certainly to be pushing the barriers a bit more. The students are also not as forthcoming in service as you would expect from this Ivy League School - They are very friendly, but again, certainly no better than your average college kid working in your local hotel/restaurant. I found I had to always approach them, rather than the service coming to me. The bedrooms are well laid out and equipped, with Aveda Amenities in the Bathroom. Room service is good, but the menu is a little limited (they do a great burger). The bar is a bit soulless and I did not dine in the restaurant, as it looked a bit dated and lacking in personality.
