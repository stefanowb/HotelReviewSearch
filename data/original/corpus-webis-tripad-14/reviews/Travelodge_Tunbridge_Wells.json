The hotel is in a great location and is just a short walk from the town centre. The rooms are what you would expect from a 3 star hotel, and have all the facilities you need, admitedly the TVs are a bit out of date, but still work ! We can't fault the Italian food in the restaurant and they serve a nice breakfast also. We used to stay at the nearby Royal Wells Hotel, but started coming here to escape the bad traffic noise you get there and lack of customer service.", "title": "We like it here", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "YorkshireRose10", "date": "October 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10247704, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Food and location", "disliked": "\u2014 The TVs in the bedrooms"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The price for this hotel was very good but that is the one and only good thing.", "title": "A Last Resort", "user": "Globe-spanner", "date": "June 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 16740540, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Price", "disliked": "\u2014 Noise, dirt"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled on business", "text": "The rooms were basic but that is what we expected however our room was dirty and not cleaned during our 4 day stay.
