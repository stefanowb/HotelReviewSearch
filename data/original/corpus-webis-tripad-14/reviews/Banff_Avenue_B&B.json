Connie & Jamie were extremely welcoming and friendly-we really felt like we were staying with old friends. Connie allowed us to check in early as it was pouring with rain and all four of us had a nice chat together over a cup of tea. They virtually give you free roam of the house apart from a small private section. The rooms were comfortable and clean as was the whole house. They gave us excellent advice on everything Banff and beyond. They lent us their bear spray one day which worked -we didn't see any! (We ended up seeing 10 in all and 2 of them brown on our trip through Canada). The breakfast was excellent also.
