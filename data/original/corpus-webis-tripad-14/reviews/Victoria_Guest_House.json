Their user-friendly website adequately explained directions, amenities, what to expect, etc. The hosts were very gracious in expecting our late-night arrival from 9 hours away. The lodging itself is divided between two homes adjacent to each other. The main house is where majority of the activity occurs. We found Victoria II to be more quiet and relaxing. Accommodations are well kept and having a private bathroom was a nice feature. Our bedspread did have an odd looking stain on it which didn't detract from our experience, but it was noticeable upon initial entry. We were impressed with how ambient sound was muffled from other guests, stairs, street, etc. which led to a relatively good night's sleep.

We went on a cooler weekend, so it was a treat to dip into the heated pool. There were lots of other great amenities too. There was a fridge full of bottled water to take to the beach. The beach chairs and towels provided were great; the chairs were especially nice featuring backpack-style carrying straps, insulated pockets for cool drinks and padded neck rests. There was a fantastic breakfast spread every morning. I haven't ever had a free breakfast before at any hotel like the one provided at the Victoria. We had the option of coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, or milk to drink and then there were cereals, bagels, muffins, croissants, homemade waffles, a variety of coffee cakes, yogurts, etc to eat. All tasted fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the homemade monkey bread, which I told the owner, Judy; the proprietress nicely printed out a copy of the recipe and passed it along to us before leaving. The bikes provided for jaunting around were really cute and convenient. Everyone staying there was extremely friendly. The owners work hard to maintain a quiet and relaxing place. It made the whole stay very relaxing. It was definitely one of the better vacations I have been on in recent years.
