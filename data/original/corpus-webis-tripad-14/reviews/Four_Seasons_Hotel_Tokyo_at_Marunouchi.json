Arrived at Four Seasons with a friend and her young son and explained that we wanted a suite so that they could stay the night wiht us. Reception messed up our reservation, and sent us up to a room where a guest was already staying. Embarrassing to walk into someone else's room when they are still there!!! Then when we asked for extra blankets and pillows, the hotel wanted to charge us $50/pers extra (for my friend and her son) on top of the rate they were already charging us for the suite. The five-year-old was so upset, and told my husband that he didn't need to stay the night if it was a problem. Another problem - the concierge sent us to a restaurant that was having a private party. I would think that they would call ahead before blindly recommending places...", "title": "Bad service", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "traveller987", "date": "December 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6447176}], "location": {"country": "Japan", "region": "Kanto", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 15, "very good": 60, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 300}, "aka": "4 Seasons Hotel Tokyo At Marunouchi", "slim_ranking": 0.0338983050847}
