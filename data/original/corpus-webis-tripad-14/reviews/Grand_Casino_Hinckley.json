It was clean, very spacious, and the beds were fairly comfortable. We were at the Casino to see a show, not to gamble, but the place was very crowded, so there was a lot of smoking in the casino. As a result, even though our room was on a non-smoking floor, the smoke tended to permeate the entire building, even the non-smoking areas.
