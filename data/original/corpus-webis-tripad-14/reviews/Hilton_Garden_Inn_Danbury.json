We have stayed here each time we travel to Danbury, usually once a year. We have NEVER been disappointed. The hotel is clean and kept in really nice condition. The room is totally comfortable. We had a room with a king bed, fridge and microwave. Had dinner one night in the restuarant and it was very good, prices were very average. I unknowingly dropped 5.00 on the floor when I went to ask the front desk girl a question. 20 minutes later, she called our room and told me she had found 5.00 and she knew it had to belong to me - WOW!!
