The service at the front desk was a little iffy, I had the misfortune of arriving at the same time as a group of 10, and ended up waiting 45 minutes before anyone even said hello. I would have chocked this up to bad timing except that when we went to one of the onsite restaurants, we waited 30 minutes after seating ourselves and to our surprise, nobody came to see us, so we got up and left! I must admit that given the price I paid...(700/night)...I was expecting a little something extra...I don't consider myself a diificult person to please, so if you are a picky person in general, I would probably suggest you pass on this place.

It was great to have a private beach, a gym, a good restaurant all within a stones throw and to be able to order room service while having a fully stocked kitchen. When we realized the kitchen didn't have a frying pan, the hotel found one in their kitchen and brought it to us. I would definitely stay there again. Hotel is expensive, but worth it. Highly recommend if you want a quiet, relaxing vacation with the services of a good hotel. I'd like to go back every summer. One thing I would advise...don't stay at the golf course if you want to be near the beach...there are two parts to this hotel..and there is a shuttle that takes you from the condos at the golf course to the beach area...I would have found that a hassle...If you want the beach, stay at the condos right near the beach..There are two pools..one indoor and one indoor and a nice gym which was perfect for a \"vacation\" gym.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "scnewhaven", "date": "August 9, 2007", "id": 8377834}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not quite the truth", "text": "We stayed at OE three years ago and just returned from a long weekend.

The room was very nice and spacious, there were some things that turned me off, like the trash I found when opening the door to the safe in the closet, also the screen was ripped on our sliding glass door, which my husband fixed so that we could at least enjoy some fresh air without having bugs all over our room. There were little things that could have been better, but overall it was a nice stay the first two nights. The final night we stayed across the street at a one bedroom villa at Britterige Village. That was very nice also, but again there were little things like light bulbs out, and our sliding glass door didn't lock, the bed was very uncomfortable also. This could be a top notch place to stay if they paid more attention to the little details. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay. We found plenty of things to do with a 2.5 year old, and I must say all of the staff were very friendly. We ate once at The Reef Cafe, which is a great place.
