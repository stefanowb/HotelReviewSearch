The last hour before checkout we were dealing with this issue writing a report etc to be turned in with the car but the rental car place never received it. It was a pain for several days especially once we returned home and trying to get people on the phone to solve this problem they caused by crashing our car and trying to lie about it. I can't blame this on the valet department, the head of the valet at the time was a great guy he assisted us as much as he could. He even called in a town car to take us to the airport. He was a big reason why we loved the hotel and would ask for the same tower when we return. Even though the problems caused many headaches after our stay I will be staying at The Signature in the future. The walk is just perfect to the MGM not too far at all. You end up near the train, spa and pools...perfect. The food in building two was just yummy.

We searched the internet and read all the reviews on Trip Advisor before deciding on the Signature and we were not disapointed at all. The reception is classy and plush, without a hint of the tacky Las Vegas that we were expecting. The room was large with kitchen and large bathroom and like other trip advisors we found the bed extra comfortable!! We stayed in tower two and yes the walk to the main MGM was a little way it wasnt a problem, unless you realised that you had forgotton something and had to walk back!I We had under-estimated the amount of walking that you do in vegas and so definatly wear comfortable shoes. MGM itself is unbelieveable, better than we could ever imagined but after a night spent at the tables it was nice to go back to a quieter hotel with no bustle and calls of 'wheel of Fortune'. We made the trip out to The Wynn which was the other contender for us to stay in, and although the hotel is extremley plush it was very expensive to eat,shop and play anything.$100 spins!! We also paid a visit to The Rivieria (set of the film Casino) This is the place to go if you want to see and experience old time Vegas. The casino is smaller, they have a lounge singer entertaining you while you play and the croupiers very friendly. The bathrooms are like walking into a 1950's film set!! Whilst playing at the tables got talking to people who visited the Riveria throughout the year and watched as they were treated like family by the staff. The Signature is situated behind the MGM and you have to walk through there to get out to the Strip, about a 15 min walk one way takes you to the Luxor and Mandaly Bay and 10 mins the other way gets you at the Bellagio and Ceasers Palace. We saw O at the Bellagio and I would totally recommend that as the show to see. Book tickets before you go as they sell out completley!! On the subject of shows inside the Coco-Cola shop, situatued next to the exit of MGM is a place called Tix-4-Tonight. They do exactly that, discounted tickets for shows and restaurants for either that night or the next dayWe managed to get tickets for the David Copperfield show (which isnt as cheesy as you would think) from there at $30 off the listed price! I could go on for ages about who amazing Vegas is and to be fair any hotel that you choose will blow your mind. We were more than happy with the Signature and on our trip back(yes weve planned it already) we will be staying there again!! Oh, there is a great discounted shopping outlet in a place called Primm, this is advertised in the guide books as being on Las Vegas Blvd. It isnt. Its a 50 mile journey,as I went alone I got a taki-BIG MISTAKE. It ended up costing $100. Managed to get on the shuttle back which is free for MGM residents.which id of known about that before and had extra $ for shopping!!

(which was nice not having to wait for our room to be ready). We had 2 rooms right next to each other, it was nice becuase there was a main door to a little room, then 2 doors to each room (each with E-Key entry).

I informed them that i was quoted total price with all charges, including restort fee. Since it was a mess up on their part (wrong quote) they gladly waived the restort fee. Having stayed at the Suites at Mandalay Bay (THE HOTEL) I must say i was very impressed with the rooms. The Gym facility was very nice too have, get a nice work out before hitting the pool, and trying to work off some late night / early morning food runs. Anyone who says its a far walk to the MGM and MGM pool is very missunderstood, From tower 1 it was a 2 min walk (unless your 140 years old).

I talked to the manager who at first was a bit defensive and said they are full and so they were behind and that the people didnt leave the room in time. I explained those excuses do not help me and I always find such excuses of not being staffed well poor when you are paying a high price for a suite. Finally, we found out our room was ready (its was like 5:30pm) and the manager gave us $100 room credit to use for food and starbucks at the hotel. That was a nice touch. We got to the room and the view was awesome, room very very clean, big with two bathrooms which is a plus with 4 people. Had a mini kitchen and fridge. Free valet parking so we could come and go often without cost and staff were friendly and cordial. I would definately stay again even though it was off the strip as the quietness was great and space of room was exactly what we needed. Oh they had smores by the pool every night which was fun.

In fact, after returning at night from smokey casinos it was a nice change to smell something so fresh and pleasant. We checked in early, and got a top floor 1 bedroom suite. The suite was elegant, the bathroom was outstanding (loved the jetted tub). We had a view of the mountains and airport out one window, the strip out another. The pool (Tower 2) was very calm, beautiful and relaxing. The service was outstanding.
