This is one of the newer Hilton brand time shares. Yes, it is about 3 yrs old and still has that newness about it. Rooms are spacious and provide views of the area, The property sits on an undeveloped area of land off of Interstate 4 .You are about 15-20 minutes from Disney, about 10-15 minutes from Downtown Disney. Hotel has a couple of pools, great for small children.OK, let me hit the negatives since I have stayed at probably 10 to 15 other hotels in this vicinity. The linens were dirty,pillowcases and sheets had lots of hair on them. Rooms were large but I felt not well decorated. Hotel in general was sort of generic in appearance. Pool areas large and attractive but the large pool was dirty (lots of dirt and objects on pool floor). The access road into hotel poorly planned and narrow. Dont bring a mid to full size suv to the parking garage, again poorly planned and only limited spaces available in which to park one. They do have a great kids program for the younger ages(up to 10) . I think this is great if you need the space (large family) . There are so many nicer choices that offer more convenience ,amenities, and a better atmosphere within a 5 mile radius of this property.", "title": "Nice,but not quite Hilton", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Jeff511", "date": "July 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 134484663}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Lastly, I am a hilton honors member and really like their resorts.

The rooms are spacious and beautiful. We had a view of the Magic Kingdom and could see the fireworks at night in the distance. The pools and hot tubs are great. They have a gym with all the newest equipment which we enjoyed using. There is a nice store on site that also serves food and beverages which was good. We did try the restaurant and bar and that was OK but overpriced. One of the drawbacks of the property is that it is located in an area with nothing else around. There were some condo projects that were stopped and old signs are all that is there. Also Hilton has only 2 towers up and several more that were planned but are not going up. So you're kind of in the middle of unfinished construction. You can't walk to anything and there's no shuttle or bus service so you definitely need a car. The resort is only about 10 minutes to Disney to the south and about 10 minutes from Sand Lake Rd with all the great restaurants to the north. There's even a Wal-Mart within 5 minutes to the north. Another drawback is that sometimes the maids do not come to the room until 5:00 pm or later. This can be inconvenient when you're trying to get ready for dinner. The price we paid was $95.00 a night and we upgraded to a one bedroom with our Hilton honors points. We felt the price was very reasonable for the amenities and quality of the property. A much better deal than any of the Disney hotels. I would stay here again for the price and don't think you'll be disappointed if you stay at this beautiful resort.", "title": "We heard the angels sing when we drove up.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "smatt1965", "date": "July 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 134319721}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "BEAUTIFUL place.
