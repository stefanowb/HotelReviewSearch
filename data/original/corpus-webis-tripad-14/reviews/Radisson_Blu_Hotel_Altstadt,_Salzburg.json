It is without doubt one of the most memorable hotels that we have stayed in. The hotel is small and cosy, and the room we had was remarkable. Lovely old wooden beams spanned the ceiling, and the view of the magnificent fortress from the window was unforgettable. The central location of the Radisson, along the river, was another plus point. The only slight drawback was the lack of food and beverage options, but then there were ample alternatives within walking distance. I would definitely stay at the Radisson again.", "title": "What a wonderful hotel!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "dbasha", "date": "May 13, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3468872}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "I was really pleased with this hotel. In the old town, with a door that literally opens into the middle of the pedestrian area. There is no need for a car or even to hire a taxi for anything except maybe to get back to the train station if you have too many bags. The location is excellent. And the property itself, in an old building, is very charming. My room was quiet as the walls, floors and ceilings were quite solid. The bathroom was updated with all you would expect from a 5* hotel. Similarly the bed linens, robes, etc. were all in order. My room was a bit small, but it was a single tho easily could sleep 2). My room overlooked the river (away from the old town/pedestrian area and I would recommend that. While the pedestrian area is the desired area, it gets loud. And you'll be walking around in it all day. No need to spend extra money to come back to your room and look at it/hear it. Also, based on the suggestions of other reviewers I booked on the Raddison site and indeed got a rate of 100 euro a night. Ironically, this was the only 5* hotel I stayed in over a 17 night trip, was certainly the nicest, and was the cheapest! I will absolutely stay here again.", "title": "Great Location, Great Hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "travelingcher", "date": "January 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4391743}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "I have stayed at this hotel for almost 10 years and even celebrated my 21st birthday here (centuries ago) shortly after it opened. I continue to stay here when in Salzburg but for no other reason than the location. The biggest issue this hotel has is its current management - clearly several steps down from the team that used to run it. A reflection of bad management is bad service from disinterested and often scruffy staff. The hotel in the last 3 years has really started to lack its sparkle. The staff are not as good as they could be. Food is fractionally above average. Rooms really need a renovation. Dont get me wrong - this is not a 2 or 3 star hotel. But it really is also not up to international 5 star standards. It could be a gem ...if only it was run properly.", "title": "Its ok but not great", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Livingoutofasuitcase", "date": "January 5, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4325663}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "what a fantastic find!!
