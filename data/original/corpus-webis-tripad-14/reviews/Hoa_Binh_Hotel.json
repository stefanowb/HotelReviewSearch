The Hoa Binh is a lovely old girl. My husband loved the sweeping wood staircase taking you up 2 floors, and the quality wood accents in our room added to the feeling of old world charm. The location couldn't of been better for watching the \"super crazy\" traffic snarls on Christmas Eve, and just 7 blocks from hotel was probably the best restaurant in all of Vietnam (and we ate at a lot of them)! The whole restaurant is full of little kiosks, tiny restaurants in themselves, and everything you order from the menu comes from one of these small places. Wonderfully clean and a place where locals eat, we only wished we had more time to sample more of the dishes. The walk to the restaurant is interesting to say the least, but the area as a whole is pretty safe, and the walk to and around the lake is marvelous. We only wish we could of had more time at the Hoa Binh, but it was a great way to say goodbye to Vietnam!", "title": "Loved the Grand Old Dame", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Karen-Ducharme", "date": "January 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12463729, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 It's Location, it's away from the Old Quarter but close enough to walk there.", "disliked": "\u2014 It allowed smoking in the restuarant.
