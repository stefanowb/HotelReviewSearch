Food very good, which is very important when All Inclusive - wide selection and you can usually always find something you'd like to eat. Entertainment OK (if you like cabaret), some early evening entertainment for the kids. Only downside is the bar service - very short staffed and sometimes large queues form, and empty glasses/cups left on tables for a long time. Great choice if you want a quiet holiday in a nice location. Likewise service in the restaurant can be slow due to short staffing, ie. getting drinks/having plates cleared away.", "title": "Great 4 Star Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "FionaM", "date": "May 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 15696009, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Large comfortable room", "disliked": "\u2014 Bar service"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Wide variety of nationalities and a lot of Spanish visit, especially at the weekend.", "title": "A Cheap Break", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lambchopsandgarfy", "date": "May 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15522904, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean and tidy", "disliked": "\u2014 Food and Pools"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008", "text": "We booked this for a late bit of sunshine and thats what we got for 4 days........", "title": "Everything fine, except the weather!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "elliegib", "date": "April 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 15478929, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Other guests, food all round good aura", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Andalucia", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 28, "average": 76, "very good": 127, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 87}, "aka": "Benalmadena Best Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333, "description": "Located directly at Benalm\u00e1dena Coast, facing the sea and just a few minutes walk from the golf courses around the area.
