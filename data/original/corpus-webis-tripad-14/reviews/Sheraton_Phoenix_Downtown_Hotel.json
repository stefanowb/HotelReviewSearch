From the moment we drove up, the Valet was most helpful and cheerful! Then, we were surprised to see that this was a host hotel for the baseball All Star Game because the lobby was bustling with people and merchandise for sale. This made us think it might compromise our experience because we were going for a family birthday dinner. In no way did the All Star Game activities affect our dinner. We were greeted with a warm welcoming smile from the hostess, had a very friendly, fast and helpful bartender at the bar, then after we were seated, we were blown away at the most incredible service we have had in a long time. Not to mention the food was to die for! For our party of five, we sampled quite a few different menu items and everything was amazing! They even grow fresh veggies and herbs on the roof! And, you can taste the difference with those freshly picked veggies in the garden salad I had. The filet was the best I ever remember having. Our server, Ian, was so patient with us and truly seemed like he loved his job. Being in the hospitality industry myself, I think I'm a bit more critical than most when it comes to service, but The District was such a wonderful experience, I felt I had to share. Keep doing whatever you are doing because it's working. We will be back! :)", "title": "Dinner at The District", "user": "CaveCreekAng", "date": "July 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115328672}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Beautiful hotel.
