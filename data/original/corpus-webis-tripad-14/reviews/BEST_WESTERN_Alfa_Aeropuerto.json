This service starts at 0500 so if you have a really early flight out a taxi will set you back around \u20ac30. You can get a bus into the city (about 8km) & back as they run all night & it's cheap. The hotel bar prices are very good, a bottle of Vina Sol white wine is only \u20ac9, we pay roughly \u00a36 in the supermarket for that. Higher taxes in the UK & it's imported I know but makes me think that the Spanish economy might benefit from hiking tax on booze & fags a bit. You can buy 200 cigs in a tobacco shop in the city for \u20ac40 which of course includes Spanish tax, much cheaper than in UK.", "title": "Transport to/from airport included", "user": "Jennifer M", "date": "November 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 145003647}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The not so good things - the hotel is on a really busy road so you wouldn't want a room at the front of the building.

When we asked why we should have to put up with this intrusion the staff said there is nothing they can do about it as the police do as they like. The other time we saw them they were actually doing some work after a lady had been sitting in reception with her handbag on the floor next to her & a female thief grabbed the bag & ran off down the road.

It was a double which had visibly sunk in the middle & my partner felt springs protruding. We complained & we were moved to the room next door which had a much better & newer bed, or rather beds, as they were 2 large singles pushed together. We were there to meet my sister & brother-in-law who had been holidaying in Europe & were staying at the Alfa hotel too on their way back home to Vancouver. They were only there 1 night but unfortunately had a dreadful double bed in their room as well.
