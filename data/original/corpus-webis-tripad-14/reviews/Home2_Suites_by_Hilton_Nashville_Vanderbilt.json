I guess I just expected a little more for the price. The room was nice and clean, but kind of small. The kitchenette was clean and had lots of glasses and flatware and even came with a dishwasher, but it wasn't really necessary. I think I could have done without all of those \"extras\" and been happier with a nice King sized bed and a little more floor space. Also, the bathroom was clean, with glass door shower, but again small. The soap and shampoo dispensers were a nice touch, and we did enjoy the shuttle service. The location was nice being within walking distance of several mid town bars, However, I would advise parking Downtown and taking the shuttle to and from. $20 parking fee is PER NIGHT which is not what I was told at check-in. That is crazy! At almost $500 for two nights total, it just wasn't worth it. Esp without daily maid service.

Home2 is an updated version based on its color schemes, furniture, and themes of sustainability and conservation seen in areas ranging from housekeeping to breakfast. I would even categorize the rooms as utilitarian or efficient. The room is shaped as a narrow rectangle; a curtain is available to separate the sleeping area from the \"sitting\" area. The window treatment just consisted of a white shade; no curtains. My third floor, rear facing room had an uninspirational view of the parking garage. Other aspects of the room were fine, including mattress comfort, lighting, lamp mounted outlets for iPad/computer charging, water pressure & temperature, and wall insulation (quiet). The lobby decor and breakfast area is \"modern.\" Food quality is probably better than what you would find at a Hampton Inn; not as extensive as an Embassy Suites. Located less than 5 minutes from the Demonbreun exit off I-40 on the west side of town. There is an attached parking garage where you can either valet or self-park (both costly fee).
