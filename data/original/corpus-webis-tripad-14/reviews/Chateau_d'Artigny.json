This was great since at 350 euros we'd certainly not have been able to afford to book 2 rooms for 2 nights, but at 210 as a celebratory splurge related to the impending opportunity to become grandparents for the first time, we could and would do it.

For breakfast, once they discovered that a lot of Americans were at the hotel, they added Coke and potato chips to the breakfast buffet!
