Room was clean, well appointed and exactly as I expected. I stayed with points but I also checked prices before booking and the rate was a good value. I did make a request to switch to a larger room for the last night of our stay, but only if it wasn't any trouble. The desk staff (Melvin was the manager; sorry, I forget the young lady's name) went the extra mile to help make that happen since my reservation using points made a room switch a bit more complicated. Got everything moved and the bigger room was MUCH appreciated!! I would not hesitate to stay here again for business or leisure. We have been to a lot of Marriott properties under their various brands, and have almost always been extremely happy with everything. Towneplace Suites Arrowood definitely sets the bar higher and is a great example of taking good care of your customers.

There was not enough parking so you have to park wherever you can find and walk. Questionable people were hanging outside the door all night long laughing and partying. We complained to the front desk but nothing was done. These same people were in and out slamming doors all night. We could hear them yelling and partying in their room across the hall too. There dog barked all the time. There are too many things wrong with this place to even list them all! This was by far the WORST stay we have ever had!
