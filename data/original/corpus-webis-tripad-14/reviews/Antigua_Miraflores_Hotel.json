Walking distance ( 8 blocks) to a major historic site. We booked directly and our room came with daily breakfast and airport pick-up.

(I filled up on bread rolls.) Otherwise, the staff were helpful, my ground floor room was clean and comfortable and overlooked an attractively landscaped garden.

There was a big difference between our two rooms. The first room was musty smelling and had rather old comforters on the beds. It was almost like being in a cabin. The second time we were on the top floor (room 300) and it had a nice view, smelled fine, and the furnishings and comforters seemed newer and better. Pros: there is a nice bar/coffee place in the hotel. The breakfast was decent, but nothing great. But every room has a pitcher of purified water to use, so you have plenty of clean water. The hotel is also in a nice location with restaurants and shopping nearby. Cons: the water pressure for the shower was terrible you only get a trickle of water.

Don't miss this new venture, Alembic, operated by Carla Davila Carlin and her partner. They have created all sorts of infusions to go in your Pisco sours, from gooseberry to blue corn to lemongrass, and even if you don't want to sample the alcohol, their tapas are not to be missed.
