The last vacation we took we were crammed into a 10x12 foot room and we were miserable, so this hotel offered a 2 bedroom with full kitchen and almost 1000 square feet. So, space we did get, but not much else. We really only had 1 bedroom and the other bedroom was a bed behind a curtain. We had 1 T.V. The full kitchen was a joke. We had a mini coffee maker, 2 burners, a small fridge and a microwave. Dishes-only a few-flatware-only a few. Pans-just the bare minimum of everything. Good thing we did not really cook. It would have been grossly inadequate for that. Oh-it did come with roaches-babies-lots of them. When we checked in we had a a full garbage can in the kitchen of someone elses garbage and 1 bath towel for 4 people. We had to ask for everything. Nothing was provided without effort on our part. We were told we had complimentary coffee provided every day and as much as we wanted. Well, it depends on who you ask. The maid does not provide it so we would have to ask down at the desk and by day 3 we were told that we get 1 packet for free and that is it. Now, we were 4 people with a mini coffee maker, so we needed 2 packets of coffee to give each person in our party a cup of coffee in the morning. We all had to share one bathroom, but we managed with that. Upon our arrival, we could not get into the buiding because they lock the entry door at 10pm. We read about that ahead of time online and called them to inquire about this and they assured us that the door will be open for us even at the late hour of our arrival. Well, it wasn't, so we had to follow someone in who had a key. We asked for a room on a high floor since we had read online that the garbage trucks wake people up because thay are so noisy. The check in went smoothly. As for the maid service-well sometimes we had it and sometimes we didn't. They work on \"island time.\" In other words, whenever they get there and when they get there they only make the beds. We asked at the desk and left a note and a tip for the maid to clean our floors and vacuum as they were not clean upon our arrival. Well, the tip was gone but the same trash, leftovers, dirt and toe nail clippings were still on the floor. We were instructed to place our used towels on the floor so the maid would know which ones were used, but when we left to go out for the day and we returned, the maid had not come yet and now all our towels were on the dirty floor and not able to be used, so again we would go down to the desk to get new ones. They are definitely used to this because they seem to keep extra of everything at the desk and will accommodate you for any request. But to have to ask for everything is a lot of expended effort while on vacation. Oh-as for the garbage trucks, oh yes, they woke us up every morning except Christmas and Sunday between 6am and 7am, even though we on the 9th floor, we could hear them perfectly. We eventually began sleeping with ear plugs!! The building is old and according to my inspector husband-displays a lot of construction errors! So, what good can I say-Well, the room had about 1000 square feet give or take and the hotel was near a lot of things. The beach was a 2 block walk, but we knew that before we came. No one knew the hotel by name because it has changed name so many times-including our cab driver from the airport-so I gave him the address. They were nice enough to print our boarding passes for us at the desk although not without sarcasm and negative inferences regarding mine and my daughters intelligence. The hotel had a bar but nothing else. We had no car so we did not have the parking issue. We managed well with \"the bus,\" as it was cheap and easy to use. I bought a package hotel and airfare combo but I would not do that again as I shudder to think of how much I really paid for this hotel. I would definitely stay at a well known hotel next time and have more ammenities available like pool, restaurants, hot tub, service, etc. This was definitely a \"no frills\" hotel, but not at a \"no frills\" price!", "title": "Only the bare minimum", "user": "darcymrn", "date": "January 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 52322503}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We booked this hotel last minute because our trip to Madrid was very disappointingly canceled.
