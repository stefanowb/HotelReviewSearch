I would like to know if the person who only rated it 1 was in the same Hotel Jacaranda as I was. I found the hotels cleanliness second to none, food variety excellent (although saying this I think they could cater for children a bit more) and the staff more than friendly. I had also read negative reviews about travelling with Thomas Cook. Again I cannot fault them at all.

The evening meal is divided into 2 sittings and the choice of which one is taken at initial check-in.

Things did not start well when we were given a room overlooking the road. We asked to be moved to a quieter room but was told that there were none available. Following a sleepless night I went back to reception and was given a quieter and larger room that day. The location for the resort centre is excellent. The food is of a good standard. The choice for children is limited and the desserts were disappointing. Lunch is served in the main restaurant and it is a shame that there is not a snack bar alternative for those who do not want to use the restaurant. There are two pool areas. The one on the bottom level is very enclosed and surrounded by the hotel. The sunbathing area is very confined with little space to spread out. The pool area on level five is much better for having more room and the guy running the pool bar does an excellent job. The pools are small, more plunge pools than swimming pools. The hotel posts a strict no reserving of sunbeds rule which is ignored by everyone, so you have to be up early if you wish to reserve beds. The bar service is relatively good despite my son being given a rum and coke instead of just coke. Luckily he told me it tasted funny. The animation team does a pretty good job with the daily activities if this is for you. The accommodation is clean but lacks drawer space. The safe is an extra E15 per week and if you want to use the fridge to keep your drinks cool then this is an extra cost. Bottled water is freely available from the Piano Bar, however you are not told this. I took my son to Siam Park. The free bus stops just down the road from the hotel. Tips: Get to the bus stop 20 minutes before the pick up time, pre book your tickets - saves queueing at the park and go early and hit the main slides as the park does fill up quickly. We bailed out at 2PM as the queues were huge and we had done the slides at least twice each. The slides are good fun and it is a good water park. Go early, do the slides then lunch followed by sunbathing or playing in the wave pool. In summary we had a good week and the hotel tries hard to hit the mark but doesn't quiet make it. We preferred the Bahia Principe at Playa Parasio, even though it is more remote and would recommend this hotel if a central location was required.", "title": "The Jacaranda masquerades as a 4 star hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "willo8660", "date": "March 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 26726715}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned from a weeks stay at the Jacaranda.
