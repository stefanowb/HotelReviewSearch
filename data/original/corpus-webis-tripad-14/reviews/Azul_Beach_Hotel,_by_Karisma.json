The room in Villa 9 (new) was exceptional in every way, decor, space ( large living, dinning room, separate bedrm, large bath w/jetted, free standing tub, sep. shower & toilet area) and ammenities. Large veranda with comfy seating. The older rm. in Villa 4 needs renovation and is much smaller but I would chose it again for the glorious ocean view (never garuanteed ahead). The food was very good with lots of choices in cuisine. The beach was excellent, a bit grassy but the staff worked VERY hard to keep the beach clear and the beds under palapas on the waters edge are heaven. The best things about Azul Beach Hotel are the dedicate staff providing outstanding service and the small size, about 100 rms. so you feel pampered every minute.

Erika Torres of Azul Beach was the primary hotel wedding planner we worked with prior to the wedding to order all the amenities and decorations necessary to pull off a wedding. She always made sure to respond to us in a prompt and timely manner and truly tried to make sure that we had the best of everything (when we were shopping around for resorts, we tried working with employees of other hotels on the Mexican Riviera and she was a breath of fresh air by comparison). By the time we got there, our on-site wedding coordinator, Miroslava was a miracle worker. Considering that we had wedding ceremonies that extended over two days and started in the morning and lasted until 11 or 12 at night, she was always available, cheerful, and made sure to take care of every last request. Daphne of Lomas Travel, who we used to provide wedding decorations, also was a tremendous help. Because of the threat of rain, we had to reorganize some events on the fly, and both Miroslava and Daphne made it as stress-free as possible. I wont pretend that there wasnt any stress since it was our wedding weekend after all, but they helped take stress away rather than adding stress, which made all the difference in the world. Finally, all the staff and servers at Azul Beach turned the weekend into one that made us feel at home. By the time we left, staff such as Alberto at Blu, Javier with the activities, Barbara, Lenin, and Alfonso at the front desk, and Irma at the Spa all knew both myself and my wife and made sure that we were not having any problems. It has been a month and a half since our wedding and we still talk about how friendly everyone was and how they made us feel so special throughout our stay there. This was truly the event of our lifetime and we could not have imagined a more perfect weekend.", "title": "Wedding Vacation", "user": "Anjana0219", "date": "February 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153290741}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Booked the holiday with Thomson, upgraded to oceanfront suite with Jacuzzi, I will be taking up problems and discrepancies in their brochure with them.", "title": "3 Weeks in Paradise", "user": "ZAPD1234", "date": "February 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153218914}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The setting and ambiance are excellent with the emphasis on chill areas, swing beds scattered around the hotel lobby and Aquanox bar, the restaurants 5 in total serve food of a very high standard.
