We were from all walks of life and diving levels of experience. It was Ken's 11th trip to the Island and he coordinated a fantastic trip. The staff ratio is 3-1 and the service, food, bungaloos and environment were all outstanding. I'm an X- Hotel manager and foodie so had an eye for the unexpected. The Swiss owned and operated team performed magic for 10 days. The Dive team were mostly European and had a macro eye for the unexpected. I rented ALL equipment on site and it performed perfectly. I'd use Island Dreams for my next adventure and certainly reccommend Wakatobi.", "title": "Magical Journey", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "dreemin2", "date": "December 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 11579780}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our first visit to Wakatobi and every thing was great.", "title": "Great Dive destination", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "t2311ps", "date": "November 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10677179, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "Food,rooms,dive center and overall organization excellent.", "title": "Perfect Scuba diving in a wonderful part of the world", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "DAVIDWARSHAW", "date": "December 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6504076, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Remote, and all inclusive.
