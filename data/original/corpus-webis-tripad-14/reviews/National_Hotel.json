If you wanted to take a shower in our bathroom, you had to climb over the tub rim which was 22 inches high, making it difficult to get in and out, especially for older people. (Try it) At home, ours is 15 inches. The floor of the tub was not comfortable to stand on, and there was no grab bar or soap dish. The design of the shower protection was such that the floor was sure to get wet.", "title": "Great place", "user": "Harrin", "date": "July 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166529416}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled solo", "text": "The location and service were good.
