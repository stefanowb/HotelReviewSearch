It was an excellent experience from check-in until check-out. Our bellman was super and took a great deal of interest in us. He set up our departure to the airport for Thursday, early morning. The room was spacious with a clean bathroom. The bathroom was well supplied with ample clean towels, shampoos and lotions, and a working hair dryer. We left our maid a tip each morning. Each night we would return to receive a handwritten thank you note for that tip. We have done a lot of travel worldwide, and have NEVER had the maid write us a thank you note!! We were impressed and our room was well cared for. We were on the 25th floor and got very little street noise. We found plenty of delis and great places to get a snack within close walking distance. We travelled by taxi to some of the places we wanted to go (Macy's, theater district 2 nights) and only had to wait seconds for a cab to arrive. If you will be traveling by subway, there are 2 terminals just steps away. There is a pharmacy next door and a news stand out front.

We booked a King Room with a pull out couch and it was perfect for the 3 of us. I should of requested a corner room which I have had in the past, they are definitely bigger. We had dinner at the Pig n the Whistle down the street and it was great, they were so nice to my daughter even though we were there during Happy Hour. The first time I stayed it was for a Girl's Weekend in the City and we had a corner room with 2 doubles, plus the pullout. It was perfect. We enjoyed breakfast both mornings in the hotel.

If you are looking for swank and fancy, it isn't that but it is very, very nice and the rooms are HUGE. From what I understand this building used to be a book distributor?? Something like that.... I think that really contributed to the size of the rooms when the marriott took it over. However, important to note that the bathrooms are not huge. It is obviously cheaper to stay in the winter but even at that we ONLY paid $174 a night and for NY that is really, really good. I booked it in either Oct or November on the actual Marriott website so if you are planning a trip, just keep checking their website because the prices can change on a daily basis.", "user": "willis2005", "date": "March 23, 2008", "id": 14477456}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved this hotel, will definately stay here again.", "text": "Now, the reasons why I love this hotel. First, location, location, location! You are blocks from 5th AVE, Rockefeller Center where the Ice Rink (in the winter only) NBC Studios etc. Time Square. We walk to all of these places from the Hotel. I would say that Time Square would be your furthest point and that is aprox. 15 blocks. If you walk up to 5th AVE and make a left and go up about 10 blocks you are at Central Park. Great, Great restaurants surrounding this hotel. Small, cute quaint places to eat from Italian to Mexican. There is a Starbucks around the corner, a 24 Hour Duane Reed Drug store directly next door and the subway station stairs right in front as well. A Washington Mutual Bank across the street. The Hotel also has Laundry Facilities with washers and dryers and a business center with computers to print your boarding passes or what ever you need to do on the Internet FREE. Free coffee and Tea on that floor as well. A small restaurant and a fitness room that isn't too bad. Only disappointment is that they closed the Bar/Lounge when I was there in Jan 2007. No longer a place to have coctails in the hotel but there are plenty of places to go right up the street. As you can tell, I highly recommend this hotel.", "user": "SueJenkins", "date": "March 21, 2008", "id": 14430089}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Courtyard Midtown lived up to every great review I have seen on Tripadvisor.

The hotel room was very clean and large with a king bed and a sofa-no stains or funny smells. Incredibly comfy bed--no nasty bedbugs(I looked!) and no other creepy crawlies that I could spot. The hotel was very quiet and every staff member we met said hello and asked if they could help us--they told us about places to eat that stayed open late, mailed postcards for us. They also checked our room keys when we walked past the lobby to make sure we were actually staying there-a nice safety feature. In the lobby, they have excellent free maps of Manhattan with clearly marked Subway stops.

We reserved the king suite because our party had five guests and this was the only room that could accomodate this many. Warning: do not book this hotel through a hotel finding website, book with Marriott directly if you have more than four guests in one room. Anyway, about our stay...our room was unbelievably spacious! We had six large pieces of luggage between us and there was room for all that and more. There were two closets and a long hallway where we set up the ironing board and left it out - the hall was that wide. We had a corner room so the hallway led from the living room, wrapped around the bathroom and went to a separate large bedroom. There was one bathroom, but there is a sink in the living room where my daughter and I brushed our teeth when the bathroom was in use. There is a microwave and mini fridge by the sink, and both the living room and the bedroom had a t.v. with free cable, including HBO. The living room also has a high speed internet connection and the room has a ton of outlets to plug in phone chargers, battery chargers and whatever else you need to plug in. The bathroom comes with a small table to put your toiletries, and a hair dryer. The water pressure isn't great, but it's adequate. What I found most appealing about the hotel is the staff. Being my first trip to New York, I heard people here are so busy, they don't care about you, but the staff here was absolutely the best! Every morning we were greeted warmly by the concierge whose desk sits right near the elevators. Every evening when we walked in we were greeted just as warmly by the front desk staff, who made sure our two daughters knew they gave out free cookies every evening. One night when we had problems with food poisoning from a local restaurant at 1am, we were furnished with new bedding and towels two minutes after we called them. When we were asking about transportation for the ride back to the airport at the end of our stay, they made sure they told us about another service - the Lincoln Town Car service - which costed exactly the same as a taxi would have, but was much more comfortable, and could be reserved in advance. When we got to the lobby at 8:30am, the cars were waiting for us and had been waiting around the corner since just after 8! No worries or stress about being able to hail a cab or finding other transportation - what a great service. You reserve the Town Car with the bellman the day before. This hotel is located in what is mostly a business district, so a walk around the block has several options for eating. Right across 3rd Ave. is a building with a food court one floor below street level. We found Cosmo Crepery there where we had a nice breakfast one morning, pancakes for the kids (one 3-stack portion was enough for my two children to share), and large crepes filled with meats and vegetables for the adults, quite delicious. A one-block walk west then one block north will bring you to Hale and Hearty Soups, a great little soup/salad/sandwich place on the corner of 54th and Lexington. Their main clientele are the business lunch crowd so by the evening rush they run out of some of their soups. Of course there is a Duane Reade Pharmacy/Store right downstairs where you can buy Cup O' Noodles and water, or cereal and milk, if you would rather dine in your room. Our hotel had a convenient Metro (subway) station right on the corner of 53rd and 3rd. The blue and orange lines stop here which can take you to Rockefeller Center (orange) or Times Square (blue). A short walk underground to the green line gets you south to Grand Central Station or north to the Bronx.
