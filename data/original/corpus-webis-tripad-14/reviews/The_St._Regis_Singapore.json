The guest rooms were well appointed with good in-room internet, a nice \"spa\" feel and upper level rooms have a great view of the city and parks surrounding Tanglin Rd and Orchard Rd.

I fell sick (briefly) while I was there and the staff was helpful, discreet, sympathetic and efficient. It is a bit of a walk to the main shopping area of Orchard Rd which was fine for me - I like to walk and the taxi services were easy.
