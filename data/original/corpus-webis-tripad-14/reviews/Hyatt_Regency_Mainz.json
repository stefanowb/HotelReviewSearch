I joined him for 2 nights before we headed out for our trip across Germany finishing in Italy. This hotel was top notch all the way! We had a room overlooking the rhine that was perfect to watch the numerous barges traverse the river each day. The room had a large king size bed with crisp white linens & bathrobes. The best part about the room was the shower. It was a huge walk in shower with a stone slate floor & matching tube. You could spend all day standing underneath the rain shower head that beat down on you and massaged your body. Then you get your warm towel off the towel warmer and are so relaxed. The breakfast buffet & restaurant served excellent food. And on the suite floor there is a room that serves cocktails each evening with appetizers & breakfast in the am as well. Mainz is not a BIG tourist attraction but there was excellent food to be eaten & shopping was great.

Came back and the room was ready but it ended up being the last room at the end of hall and just to far for my elderly mother to walk back and forth. They switched rooms but unfortuantely this one was smaller and my biggest issue was a nasty looking stain on the carpet by the bed. It looked like a dog had left something behind. On my way out for lunch I told the receptionist about the stain and she said that they would have somone come up and clean it. It never happened and I ended up putting a washcloth over the stain so I wouldn't have to look at it.
