But don't get me wrong, it's a very nice place to stay-- immaculate and beautifully tended as in my somewhat limited experience I've found Swiss hotels to be. Desk personnel is multilingual, patient and helpful. Rooms are sparkling, comfortable and extremely sleek and modern in design-- a bit lacking in storage space, however. Baths, as pointed out in another post, have an usual layout-- toilet in a small room in the entry; tub, sink and stall shower in a separate room around the corner-- or at any rate that was the layout of our room. Our triple was a bit cramped; but we all slept well and the sofa bed-- I was told-- was very comfortable. Kind of a nice security measure this hotel has is that the elevator won't operate unless you have a card key-- just be sure to have a key with you whenever you opt to go out.", "user": "honestopinion4u", "date": "July 1, 2005", "id": 3625003}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room was very clean and modern.
