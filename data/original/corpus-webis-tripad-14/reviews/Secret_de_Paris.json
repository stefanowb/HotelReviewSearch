We chose to spend the first night in the Moulin Rouge room and the 2 nights in the Musee d'Orsay room. Both rooms were fantastic for different reasons. Moulin Rouge is, as you would expect, more romantic and fun. Where as the Musee d'Orsay room was elagant and more luxurious. Personally I preferred the Musee room as it had a lovely bathroom with beautiful lighting. Each room has 4 levels of lighting depending on your mood. The staff were also friendly and quite helpful. The location is also good being on the street that leads from the Galeries Laffayette to the Place de Clichy.

I arrived very early, dismayed from a bad hotel experience the night before. While awaiting a room, the staff pampered me, gave me a big robe, slippers, free coffee, refreshments, and invited me to use the spa/gym downstairs or to hang out in the front. Free wifi internet code was given immediately, so that I could communicate with the rest of my party arriving later in the morning. Even though there was a rush to get us into a room, our room was perfectly prepared and shown to us with great welcoming fanfare and explanations about how everything worked. I was almost amused, but it was well-done and introduced us properly to the special aspects of the hotel. Much nicer than \"here's the key, do you need help with your luggage. . . .\" Our room looked exactly like the one in the photo on trip advisor, and the bathroom was great fun. The flat screen TV rises by remote control out of the footboard of the bed! Each day, our every wish and whim was granted. The staff do a splendid job of being warm, professional, attentive, youthful, playful, and service-oriented. The rooms, like most hotel rooms in Paris, are small, but the design makes it work. We were there for a week and were in no hurry to leave. The surrounding neighborhood is not luxurious, so you don't get the broad boulevards just out your door. However, even for a personal with limited mobility, walking to the Gallerie Lafayette one direction or the Moulin Rouge in the other direction, was readily accomplished. It is convenient to have small shops, grocers, and other places to buy food and drink at all hours on the block, along with a self-serve laundromat nearby, not to mention the metro stop at the circle at the end of the block. Whether it's Starbucks or small boutiques, pastries or wine, or a big traditional french meal, you can find it very, very nearby. A woman with a women's clothing shop in the next block altered a pair of black slacks for me in 24 hours, for free. And the slacks were a classic french shopping \"find\" - fantastic style for a very inexpensive price. As for the hotel itself, the style, design, attention to detail, and level of solicitous service from the staff make this an excellent choice.", "title": "Perfect", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Andygrey1", "date": "July 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 133695254}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Fantastic hotel, we arrived late but were greeted woth friendly smiles and warm welcome.
