It stands on a main road however the front 'garden' is large enough to give a sense of being away from the traffic. My room overlooked the pool and this would be worth requesting I suspect.

Work stopped around 5:00pm, just as we were going out for dinner anyway, but it started early in the morning. This wasn't the end of the world, but I think the fair thing would be to discount the room, not claim it was a step up. The buffet breakfast is good, and the pool area is very nice, and the pool large enough to swim lengths. Location is excellent, very central, and just a short stroll to the old town. This hotel caters to tour groups, and they were older, quiet types, and they seemed to be moving in and out at reasonable times (and into the well located rooms, I suspect).

On arrival we were given a Deluxe Room (a little larger than a Superior) this room was at the back of the hotel with a glassed in Balcony that did NOT have a garden view but a view over a road and the school. The room was clean but we could not lock the glass door onto the very hot balcony (Glasshouse). Maintenance fixed that a little while later. Now the Glass door out to the balcony did not have any curtain or blind so at 5am when the sun came up we were awake. We complained and asked why we did not get the room we booked. We never got an answer to our question. Soon enough they upgraded us free of charge to a Junior Suite. Still no balcony and this time a very modern looking room but not very practical. The bathroom set up was a mess. Water pressure was very weak the shower head was useless and then water spilt all over the floor when you showered. The shower is over the bath that is set very high and hard to get in and out of. Also the hair dryer was not working. Our new room was situated over the lobby area and pool so we had a lot of noise carry into our room and first night in this room we had to phone reception twice to do something about the noise. 1st time at 11.30pm and then again at 1am. Yet another night with limited sleep. All we wanted was a little room with a balcony to sit out on in the evening and a garden view. Exactly as we booked and had stayed in on previous visits to this hotel. So on the whole very disappointing especially when this hotel was the most expensive we had paid during our 5 country 12 week ,30+ hotel trip. In favour of the hotel there are two things.
