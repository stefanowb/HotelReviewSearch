Everything you would expect from a 5 Star resort, except I must point out now that although I've stayed in a good many resorts in my time, I have never received such genuinely warm and gracious service in my life. It was amazing, we were blown away. Perhaps it's just the Bali way. Yes it was humid but ,you are afterall just south of the equator, and if you follow the hotel guidelines and keep your balcony door closed, no problem, very comfortable. Yes it is pricey for the bars and restaurants, but the hotel offered a very good deal for a discount on drinks and meals purchased in the hotel. The best bet to save a bit is to go to the new shopping centre ( the name escapes me), about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, although there is a free shuttle. There's great shopping and about 8 restaurants, quite a variety, and about half the price or less than eating at the hotel. Most of the restaurants allow you to sign the bill to your hotel account. It's true as others have said the breakfast really was not up to 5 star standard but it was really good nevertheless.", "title": "Wonderful place", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "mtlcatcher", "date": "April 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7420377, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pure luxury", "disliked": "\u2014 A bit pricey."}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "By all means, take a spa treatment at the Yhi Spa, on the grounds.

Recommend eat out at night - you can get a taxi but the walk is nice and you dont get too bothered by people trying to get you in the taxi - just say no thanks. The balinese were wonderful people (and genuine). Dont recommend the massage! My partner had parts massaged that shouldnt have been (if you know what I mean) and was in quite a lot of pain.
