As it was my girlfriend's first trip to Sri Lanka, I had researched our holiday before making any bookings. In the past I had stayed at the Holiday Inn and Galadari and found both to be reasonable in quality and price. Cinnamon Grand was recommended to me by my cousin who works in the tourism industry, and I am really glad we took her advice. The hotel is situated on Galle Road in Colpetty (Colombo 3). It is a short walk away from the southern point of Galle Face and an easy walk from Fort. For travelling around Colombo, Tuk-Tuks are numerous and you can haggle with the drivers until you reach a good price (knock a 3rd off the initial sum, and agree before you set off). There is a decent shopping centre next door to the hotel, but the stores seem to mainly cater for tourists, so expect to pay more than in smaller stores. If you don't want to eat in the hotel, there are many restaurants nearby (we recommend the Bavarian restaurant opposite the Galle Face Hotel).", "title": "Would definitely stay there again", "user": "Im2009", "date": "May 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 30576037}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled on business", "text": "The Cinnamon Grand is quite modern, with a nice, open lobby area.
