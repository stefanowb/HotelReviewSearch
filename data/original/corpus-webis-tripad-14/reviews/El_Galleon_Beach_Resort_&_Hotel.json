There were dozens of photographers and experienced world traveled divers who all agreed- for the price this place can not be beat! Food, servce, diving, Asia divers, rooms were all excellent. I would give this place a try in a minute! Only draw back is it's a typical seedy village with tons of hawkers selling crap and the sex trade in the bars is alive and well.

If long boring boat rides are your thing then it's no problem. what i liked here is the dive sites nice variety of pelagic fishes,sharks and sea turtles are a common site here. Mostly the clients here are americans and europeans.
