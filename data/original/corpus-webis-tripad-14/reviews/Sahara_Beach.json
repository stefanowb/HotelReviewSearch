The hotel is very large (can hold up to 3,000 guests), consists of all nationalities. The reception staff could learn a lesson in greeting people, very miserable, no smiles. Let me work through the good points because believe me it wont take long!; The animation team work extremely hard and long hours, yes ok the entertainment is some what cheesy and not to everyones taste. The beach is nice, sandy and plenty of sunloungers. Give the on site photographer a go, they take extremely nice photos, there is no obligation to buy and are reasonably priced. Now the bad points; Reception staff already mentioned, plus not very nice having hoards of kids roller blading through the reception unsupervised or challenged. The all inclusive is a farce, you have to have your photo taken and put on a card which you need to carry every where with you. If its lost, its 15 dinar for another. The card system simply does not work, it is one drink one card. You cannot order a round of drinks for your party, it got really tiresome. Plus the all inclusive runs out at midnight then you have to pay and its not cheap. You are given one huge chunky key to your room regardless of how many people share your room! The rooms are totally basic. The walls are so thin you can hear phones ringing 3 doors down, you can hear conversations in the next room-plus any other noises! The beds are hard, the bedding and curtains are stained. The air conditioning is not switched on until mid June which is no good before that, it got so hot like a sauna in our room, when we left the patio door open we were eaten alive by mosquitos. There is no tv. In the bathroom the hot water comes out the cold tap and vice versa and there is no useable shower, its the old fashioned rubber on the taps and handheld, it either comes through scalding or freezing - nothing inbetween making a shower impossible. The water in the bath is somewhere between yellow and brown in colour - not very inviting. Dont bother putting the do not disturb on your door because the cleaners do not respect it. Between 8 and 8.15am every morning the cleaners were right outside our door, hoovering, banging the hoover on our door, shouting to each other, dragging furniture across the floor in adjacent rooms. If thats not bad enough, the planes at the very near airport roar overhead and you could not sleep through anyway. Also at night it is a very noisy hotel with the late night drinkers and partyers. The worst of the lot is the food. On all inclusive you are supposed to be allocated a table for your sole use during your stay but that is rubbish. On a number of occasions we came in to missing cutlery, food all over the tablecloth and dirty glasses. On 2 occasions we had to clear and the clean the table before we could sit down. The service is very slow and more often than not the dirty plates were not collected between courses, again you have to produce your id card at every meal and for every drink even if you have just previously had one. The food is the worst I have ever tasted, every day same old stuff for lunch and then it comes out again at dinner time. There were loads of flies landing on it. The best part was the bread!!!!! The pizzeria is worth a visit. For a couple of days there was a dreadful smell of raw sewage that hit you as you went to go to the swimming pool. Another pain is the shop people constantly trying to sell you things, it got very tiresome every time you went for a meal. We could not see the evening entertainment because it was held in the Skanes bar which was not equipped to cater for the amount of people they had staying. No way was it busy when we went, one of the buildings were completely shut so I dread to think what it would be like at full occupancy. All we kept thinking was we were grateful we werent there for 2 weeks. There are far better hotels in Tunisia and I seriously would urge you to go somewhere else. This hotel is 3 * rating in the brochure and no way what so ever, it would be very lucky if it were a 2* but travel agents wont tell you this because if you knew the truth no one will go. If you are booked to go, see if you can change, if you still plan to go....dont say you werent warned.", "title": "Dont waste your money", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "tokar", "date": "June 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 7832414, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Going home", "disliked": "\u2014 99% of it but mainly the food"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "went with some trepidation, with my wife, and two young boys, (6 and 10),", "title": "Great holiday", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lorddowney", "date": "June 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7789830, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean, cool", "disliked": "\u2014 Nil"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005, traveled as a couple", "text": "All staff were extremly helpful, accomodation was very good, if somewhat sparse. beach was lovely however be aware of the con artists trying to get you on the camel, They are not part of the hotel, and the price will go up, if your kid so much as looks like he will get upset at not riding,", "title": "Lovely place", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Princess_Nikki_Lou", "date": "May 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 7722028, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The swimming pools were fab", "disliked": "\u2014 Hallways could do with a good re-vamp -
