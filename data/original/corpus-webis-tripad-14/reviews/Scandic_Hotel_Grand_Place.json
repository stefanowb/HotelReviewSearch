Check in was just fine. The lobby was decent and the reception staff was friendly and helpful. Stepping off the elevator on the third floor, I was assaulted by a dirty carpet smell and was appalled at the appearance of the horribly stained carpet as well. I was expecting the room to be just as bad, but was pleasantly surprised to find the room clean and of a decent size. We were happy to be able to adjust the thermostat to our liking (unlike other European hotels we've stayed in) and we also had a \"balcony\" door that we could open for fresh air. Breakfast was good--nothing special, but good. We were also pleased with the free wi-fi. The location of this hotel is what makes it, though. Just a few minutes' walk to the Grand Place, tons of shopping, and so many restaurants and bars--for the price, it can't be beat. We would definitely stay there again. Now if they could just replace that carpet....", "title": "Good location and basic hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "browtal", "date": "July 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133194421}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here for one night after a meeting which was also held at the hotel. My room was small, and had two pushed together single beds in it. The size of the room wasn't a problem for me - I was only there for one night and although there wasn't room to leave my medium sized suitcase on the floor, there was room for it in the bathroom and that was fine. My main problem was that the room had no external windows - the hotel has a central atrium and my room overlooked it. This made the room even more oppressive, dark and gloomy than it normally have been on a gloomy and overcast November day in Brussels. Despite the hotels 'green' claims, the room was extremely hot and although I switched the heating off, because the windows opened onto an internal atrium it was impossible to get any fresh air into it. Although I stayed in late November, the weather was mild and the heating doesnt seem to have been adjusted to take this into account.", "title": "Very good price for central Brussels but slightly underwhelming", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "seniledelinquent", "date": "November 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 146106380}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was also l bit surprised by the decor, I was expecting simple blond wood Scandinavian style furniture but it was actually had strangely ornate plasticky looking imitation wood furniture - very strange.", "title": "Hand location & good", "user": "srantako", "date": "November 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144749227}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I did appreciate both the free internet connection and the free bottled water in the minibar.
