On arrival I was greeted with Tina at reception who couldn't have been any nicer. I asked to see the room first just in case it wasn't what I was expecting but on viewing it was adequate, quite small but clean and having a walk in shower was a bonus. My luggage was brought up for me from the car, the same on departure . Also a lift to all floors. I was only bed and breakfast and going by the quality and selection they had to offer I know all meals would have been great.
