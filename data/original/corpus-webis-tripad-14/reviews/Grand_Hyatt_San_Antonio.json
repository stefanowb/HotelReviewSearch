Our very simple request to have a cab called for us, which we do every year for these events and have never had a problem with at any other hotel downtown, was first shuffled of to \"the valets will get one for you\" and then with the valets it was a vague gesture towards the street \"Oh, they're out there all along the strip\".

Of the two Hyatt\u2019s in town the Grand Hyatt has the best location to the Henry Gonzalez convention center; it\u2019s literally on the same property. I prefer the Hyatt Regency which sits on the River Walk in the center of town. (The Hyatt Regency is under renovations currently) The Grand Hyatt has a very large and modern lobby, desk staff are plenty and very friendly. There is a loud bar in the lobby and small gift shop. Rooms are modern and decorated in contemporary style furnishings....not very big but functional. The fitness center is excellent with at least a dozen treadmills and half dozen elliptical machines, yoga room, free weights and best yet open 24 hours. There is also an outdoor lap pool on the same level. Only ate one breakfast at the hotel in the Achiote River Cafe. Two Eggs, toast, orange jc and coffee was $22..!! There is a Denny's two blocks around the corner on Bowie Street...two minute walk....actually run very well...took about five minutes to get our food each morning and they were busy and very friendly. Lunch and dinner you can pick from anywhere on the Riverwalk. Mexican, Steaks, Seafood, Burgers....everything is there, no reservations needed.
