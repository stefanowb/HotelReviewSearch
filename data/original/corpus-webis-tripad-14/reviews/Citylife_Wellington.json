We were one couple and one adult plus 2 teens. We booked a studio and a 2brm apartment. They upgraded us to a 1 brm apartment. The one bedroom apartment was huge but the internal bedroom was way too hot. We had both the fans in the room running and it was uncomfortable. This is when it was quite cold outside too. In the 2 brm apartment, the safe didn't work, nor did the heatpump/air conditioning unit. So that room was also very hot. Also, I'd asked on booking and twice the week we arrived for both apartments to be on the same floor. They weren't. I wouldn't stay there again until they sorted out the heating/cooling issues.", "title": "Location good but facilities not great", "user": "princess5222", "date": "April 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 129078141}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012", "text": "The beds were also very uncomfortable.

Heating was very basic, a wall mounted fan heater in the lounge, which heated the room very quickly, but the bedrooms especially can get hot and stuffy, given no air movement.
