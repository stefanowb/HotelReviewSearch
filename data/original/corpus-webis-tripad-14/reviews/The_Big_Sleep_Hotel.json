The staff were the Ace cars, Evira is so professional on reception helped by Sharaz ( hope spelling correct?) nothing is too much trouble with a warm smile.

It kind of advertises as a 'boutique' hotel, but that might be pushing it a bit. In reality, it's a big, old seafront hotel that's been refurbished and made young and funky instead of old and frilly. I booked a 'suite' (which is actually more like a big room) and it was great - a huge room with corner windows, a big TV at the foot of the bed and a freestanding rolltop bath in the room - all with views over the sea. Don't expect too much - there was no sofa, no internet in the rooms and basic (but fun) decor - blue furry curtains, nice. There's no restaurant or bar to speak of (but they don't mind you eating your own food in the lounge area) and breakfast was a basic (but very acceptable) buffet. Don't expect high-end designer, but for a seafront option that's clean, well-priced and considerably more fun than the more common 'old' hotels in Eastbourne, go for it.", "title": "Just the ticket...", "user": "plusfour", "date": "August 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 117191372}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "We booked the Big Sleep for 2 nights whilst attending a friends wedding in Sussex.
