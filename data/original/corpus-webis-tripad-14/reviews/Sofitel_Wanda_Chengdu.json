We figured that since we were staying for such a short time, we'd take a chance on a cheap hotel (we paid $95 for the night (includes taxes, etc.) through Travelocity.com). I wish we could have stayed longer! The room was great - I was definitely expecting something seedy for the price. Not the case. The only semi-snag we hit was upon check-in, the front desk tried to charge us extra for hotel taxes. I pointed out on our Travelocity reservation print-out that it said Taxes and Fees: ALL INCLUDED. Apparently this settled it, and we were not charged further. That aside, all was great - the room was nicely appointed. The shower situation was a little interesting - would be especially so if you didn't want the person you were traveling with to see you shower! (It was an all glass stall shower, but was not enclosed within the bathroom; it was open to the rest of the room!)

Evening buffet menu fine as long as you liked seafood - ended up going a la carte, but still a decent amount of choice available.
