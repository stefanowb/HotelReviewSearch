This Ramada hotel on the outskirts of Baltimore met the basics. Was it clean? Yes. Did it feel safe? Yes. Did it have a decent outdoor pool? Yes. Did it have a free, though meager, continental breakfast? Yes. If that's all you care about, then stop reading. However, the bar on budget hotels has been raised by places like the Hampton Inn and the newer Motel 6 locations. For the same price range ($60-$120), the room quality is much higher, with a more upscale feel than what this Ramada had to offer. Quite simply, this hotel felt tired and in need of a renovation. From the dated green bedspreads to the old CRTV and the straining air conditioning unit, the room where I stayed was not exactly a showplace. On the plus side however, this Ramada location continued to offer free toiletries, something which some hotels have cut-back on or even eliminated. Overall, unless you've absolutely got to stay in Pikesville, I can't recommend Ramada Baltimore West. This is a $50 a night hotel charging $80+ prices. For $80+, you can find any number of better places in the greater Baltimore-DC area, particularly if you're using a discount site such as Hotels.com or Priceline.", "title": "Not up to the standards of its peer hotels.", "user": "RenardFX", "date": "July 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 70420300}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We arrived at the Ramada around 9 a.m. after getting into Baltimore on a red eye from California, and although our room wasn't ready, Elizabeth at the front desk found us a room to take a nap in until our room was ready. The room that was available was a smoking room, which was on the parking lot side of the building. These rooms are small and dark, and there was litter all around outside -- very depressing. The front desk called us when our room was ready -- a larger, cleaner, brighter room on the courtyard side of the building. It was a completely different experience. We appreciated the use of a room while ours was being made up, but rooms on this side of the property should be AVOIDED AT ALL COST.

The place is incredibly dated and needs a massive facelift. We checked for bed bugs and didn't see any and the place appeared to be \"clean\" but it was old and worn. I did notice colonies of ants all along the walkway outside the room and some even inside our room door. They could use an exterminator. The morning of the second day, friends of ours that were also staying at the hotel came out to find that their car had nearly been stolen. They had mistakenly left their car unlocked and someone had gone in and cut some wires in the steering column to try to get it started. After that we moved our cars in front of the building. However, after coming home I found out that someone had been murdered in the parking lot right in front of the hotel just a few days before we got there. The location is ok, it's right off the beltway and for the race it was ok because it was as close as we could get although the taxi guys left us high and dry after the race after promising to pick us up, they returned but took others back instead. While we turned down the cleaning folks to turn over our rooms since we prefer to not have anyone in our rooms when we stay somewhere, it seemed to take them all day/night to clean the small amount of rooms that they had to clean. They also just stared at us most of the time. Very strange. I'd never stay here again.

After approximately an hour of trying to go back to sleep, I called and reported it to the front desk. The loud conversations ended within a few minutes, but, resurfaced at approximately 6:30 AM. Once again, it was reported to the front desk, however, nothing was done. The loud conversations at the gazebo continued. Consequently, my cousin and I were not able to get any sleep Friday night. Then at approximately 7:30 AM, I called the front desk again to request a room change. The man who answered the phone did not speak English well, and therefore, hung up on me. This was rude. Needless to say, I was extremely offended. If he could not understand what I was trying to communicate, he could have asked the person in the background for assistance rather than hanging up on a customer. Better still, maybe he should not be answering the phone until he is proficient with the English language. This is a sure way to lose customers. Moreover, we when visited the front desk Saturday morning to request a room change, the person operating the front desk, LaShonda, displayed a nasty attitude and was extremely rude. She was curt and acted as though my complaint had no merit and if it did, she did not care. We were re-assigned to another room; however, the room was filled with smoke. Another room was assigned to us at approximately 2 PM only to discover that it too was smoked filled. Upon our arrival back to the Ramada Inn at approximately 8 PM, we were told that the females who were responsible for disturbing our sleep were escorted off of the property. Consequently, my cousin and I had a restful night of sleep on Saturday. Perhaps they should have been escorted off of the property Friday night. Moreover, it would help to have LaShonda attend public relations classes, so that she will know how to address customer concerns in a professional way. Additionally, I would like to suggest that it may help to charge a fee for smoking in designated non-smoking rooms, thus ensuring that customers honor the no smoking policy. This could be an agreement added to the room reservation bill and/or contract. Moreover, it may also help to close down access to the gazebo at a reasonable hour, so not to interfere with other's rest.
