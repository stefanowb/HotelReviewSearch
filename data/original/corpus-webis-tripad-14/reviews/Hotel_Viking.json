I read the reviews others have posted online as well and concur with some of the points that they made. First when we arrived at the hotel, the valet parking is $15. I don't think that is too bad considering it is Newport. Check in was fairly easy. The staff seemed friendly but when I inquired about an upgrade for our room, we were told it was an extra $50-$100 a night ( I thought it was less online but perhaps I was mistaken.) The room itself was very small. Honestly, one of the smallest hotel rooms I have been in. The bathroom had what I would define as the smallest sink I have ever seen. It wouldn't have been a problem but there were no shelves or anything to put your toothbrush or toiletries on. I literally had to open the shower door to allow myself enough arm room to blow dry my hair. The room was nicely appointed however and did appear clean. The other complaint that I had, as another writer had commented, is the blind situation. The room gets very bright early in the morning due to the blinds. This could be easily resolved by hanging curtains that cover the spaces in the windows where the sun light comes through so I was surprised that was a issue. The noise level was also a consideration. The room next to us had someone come back late at night and we could hear them like they were in the room next to us. Luckily they went to bed pretty soon thereafter but if they had been up all night that could have been an issue.", "title": "Hotel Viking", "user": "VernonCT", "date": "December 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146701606}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We did go to the pool, which was very nice.

The one thing that I will say stands out about this hotel was the staff. You can have a great hotel and horrible staff, or you can have an average hotel and great staff ( which I felt was the case here ). The valet service was great, and at breakfast, I went to get my daughter a bagel and the man saw her and said, \"oh, its fine, just help yourself to one, no charge.\" The hotel is also decorated for Christmas so they have the Christmas trees up which are very nice, I took a picture of my daughter in front of the tree and one of the staff members came over to ask if I would like to be in the picture with her.
