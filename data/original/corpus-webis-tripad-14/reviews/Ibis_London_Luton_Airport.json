Arrived early (just after lunch) and was checked in by a really friendly member of staff (Marie I think) who asked if we needed any wake up calls, or breakfast or dinner etc. and then went on to give us information about getting into Luton and to the cinema to waste some time as we didnt want to waste all afternoon in the hotel. The room itself was small, and had we been spending longer here, this may have been frustrating. That said it was clean and perfect for what we needed- somewhere to rest our head before an early start, at a very good price (less than \u00a330!).", "title": "Excellent value!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "catchthatrabbit", "date": "September 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 177089714}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Would stay here again!", "title": "Stay at Ibis Luton", "user": "KumarieR", "date": "September 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 177028598}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled on business", "text": "If you are using this hotel as an overnight stay before an early flight DO NOT rely on the incompetent Reception Staff to call you for an early wake up call.", "title": "Terrible Stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Rachel s", "date": "September 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 177297076}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I have worked in hotels for 6 years now, and to be so close to the airport they must realize many of the guests will have flights to catch and not receiving a wake up call is completely unacceptable.", "title": "Needs Must", "user": "Mike B", "date": "September 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 177094774}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013", "text": "I asked for a 6am call and asked Reception if my phone was working only to be told rather rudely that it was fine....
