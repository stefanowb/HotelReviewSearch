I booked the hotel through selloffvacations.com in May for approximately 60% less than the rate on expedia.ca. The hotel is just down the street from Disneyland and it would be walking distance with older children. We opted for the ART Shuttle as we were travelling with a 4 year old and no stroller. Check-in was quick. My mom used her Hilton Honors card and we were able to get free wifi in our room. Parking was also discounted to $5/day. The room was nice and clean. Nothing special, 2 beds, 1 desk, nightstand, flat screen TV, and 2 Queen beds. We were on the 14th Floor facing the courtyard (south). The beds were very comfortable and I loved the pillows. We were able to use the pool 2 times. The maid always left fresh towels and the room was pristine. The room did not come with a fridge but we called down to the front desk and they had one brought up. We also called down for a bottle opener and we had one within 10 minutes. I only have one complaint...the hallway noise was very disruptive during the night (not every night). The service elevators were very close to our room and we could hear carts rolling over tile at all different hours (this is the reason for my average sleep rating). The hotel has a very business feel to it but I expected that considering it proximity to the Convention Center. When I was researching hotels I looked at some of the hotels that seemed a bit more resort like but their management responses to some of the trip advisor critiques were in my opinion unprofessional.

Called Hilton's 800 number and the reservation staff at Hilton got hung up on and then when they tried again they never answered. The parking structure is horrible, we paid extra for a Dinsey view room and what a waste of money that was. The room was smelled musty as if it had been wet for days. Hilton Corporate needs to do something about this hotel, its management and the staff. Horrible experience and never again will we stay here at this location.

I tried to call the desk to see what and when the service might be restored but could not get past the answering machine that kept telling me how great Hilton Hotels are. When I went downstairs to see what was happening, I was told by a woman by the desk they were sorry and had no idea when the system would be restored. Couple this with the entire area around the Hotel being torn up makes just getting to the entrance a challenge, and this was not a great experience. I know bad things happen in all hotels, but to me, what makes a good hotel stand apart is how they respond to adversity. In my opinion, this hotel did a lousy job and treated their guests like they had no right to know what was going on even though rooms are priced in the over $100 per night range, they could not be bothered. The following morning, my bill was slipped under the door with no reduction in the rate to compensate for the lousy service. I did go the front desk and raised the issue with the clerk who did reduce the rate but only after I had to get irritated and make a trip down to the desk did they offer that reduction. Again, a good hotel would have made that credit across the board to all the guests affected without having to make each guest angry and confront the front desk staff.
