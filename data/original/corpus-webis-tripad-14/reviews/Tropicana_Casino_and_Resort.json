There was a whirlpool for guest 18 and older. The pool was crowded though. If a child was like to swim in the indoor pool, an adult must be with the child. There are locker rooms and saunas. The pool is in the south tower which was annoying because the south tower is the oldest and crumiest. The restaurants were okay. The rooms were nice but the beds didn't have fitting sheets. When I called house keeping, they said they don't use fitting sheets. The west tower was very far away from everything else so you had a to walk through a long walk in the quarter which was a shopping and restaurant area designed like a cuban street. The Havana tower was also far from everything else. The hotel was very bad about charges. they tryed to charge us for so much we were suppost to get free. They also tryed to charge us more for our room so we had to fight with them to lower the price.

As part of a large group of family that ranged in age from 10 to 85, I can say there was something for everyone here. Now for the bad: the awful, $270-for-one-stinking-night hotel stay. Check-in was horrendous with an over 40 minute wait (only two employees, one of whom thought a huge line was a good time to count register cash); staff was neither friendly nor courteous, they simply \"did their job.\" Hotel public areas (hallways, lobby by elevators) were in disrepair and quite dirty.

I pulled the spread off the bed so as to put it in the closet and my hand touched some still damp, disgusting white stains on the underside of the spread. The blanket under the bed spread was no better with many stains and small holes. I left a note for the housekeeper to get rid of the spread for the rest of our stay.

When I called the front desk, they said they'd send someone up. An hour later still nobody. I went down to the front desk to complain, but instead of offering me another room, they said they'd send someone up. Went back up ... and an hour later...still nobody. Mind you, it's not easy to get from the front desk to your room. It takes about 20-25 mins to get from check-in to your room because of the elevator set-up. So I went down for a third time, and talked to a manager. He gave us another room. This room had no heat, no remote, no soap or clean towels. Looked like it hadn't been touched in years. I am now at the three hour point on my \"vacation\". I went back down and requested the same manager. Magically, he had gotten off five minutes before I got there.
