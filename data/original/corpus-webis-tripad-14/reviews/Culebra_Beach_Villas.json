We flew from San Juan Puerto Rico to Isla Culebra and minutes after arriving we fell in love with the people and the Island. We met some of the most friendliest people as soon as we arrived to the small airport. It turns out we happened to be on the same flight with someone from management who then proceeded to offer us a ride to the villas saving us time and confusion. When we arrived to the villas we were quickly checked in and invited to a bbq with management and other locals from the island. Soon after that, they made every attempt to make us feel comfortable and have a wonderful experience during our stay. They gave us tips on what to do and see, and even invited us to their houses for drinks. The villa we stayed in had everything we needed to make ourselves at home and was clean. We found utensils, pots, microwave, refrigerator, etc, etc. We were able to cook our own romantic dinners in one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. We have traveled to many places but we have never before had the service, friendliness, and detail we had during our stay in Culebra Beach Villas. Also since we arrived during slow season we practically had Flaminco Beach to ourselves! The only thing this place lacks is a closer grocery store since it takes about 10-15 minutes to the closest one. I would recommend taking energy bars or some sort of snack to have around until you can make it to the store especially if you have children. And believe me, if you have children this is the place to stay! I cannot wait to go back and maybe take my niece since the beach is perfect for children as well. If you are looking to relax in a down to earth place with wonderful people this is the place.
