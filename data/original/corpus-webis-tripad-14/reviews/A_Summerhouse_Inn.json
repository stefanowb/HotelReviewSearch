I don't believe we could have found a more accommodating staff anywhere. Anything we needed or asked for was provided for immediately. The rooms were neat and clean. Probably one of the best things was the large grassy courtyard in between the buildings where the kids played football, soccer, frisbee, etc. I would highly recommend the Summerhouse Inn.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 23, 2006", "id": 5204135}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Nasty", "text": "We picked this place because we needed a last-minute room at a fair price ($79 plus tax), and most places were booked because the Final Four tournament was going on in Indianapolis. The room seemed okay upon arrival - a typical small motel room, about the same in layout/size as a room at the Red Roof Inn. The smell of disinfectant was strong, but that didn't seem to be too much of a problem. When we turned the heater on - it was unseasonably cold that weekend - an overwhelming mildewy odor poured out of the heater. It was awful. We immediately went back down to the front desk, informed the clerk we would not stay and explained why, and asked for our money back. Then we went ut to the Four Winds Resort and Marina, and got a much better room for only about $40 more. The Summerhouse Inn is a dump - do yourself a favor and spend a little extra to get a decent room for the night.", "user": "cuicatl", "date": "April 7, 2006", "id": 4948785}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A very nice stay", "text": "Fireside? Best Western? New to \"A Summerhouse Inn\" and it was a nice stay. Okay, it's not \"the Ritz\", but it was clean and no problem with \"smelly\"! We were visiting the college with our daughter and found the staff to be really pleasant and helpful. No problem with the bill either. Breakfast was included with a \"help yourself\" style which we found to be a nice touch. For the price, which is difficult to find in this area, it's a good choice. :)", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 8, 2006", "id": 4446340}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "A Dump", "text": "A place to stay away from? - University Plaza Hotel !!!
