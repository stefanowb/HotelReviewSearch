I have to say that the Spa itself was quite nice and relaxing, and the massage services wonderful. The food was 'ok', but not what I would consider exquisite fine dining quality. The service, however, was absolutely terrible. The server had what appeared to be very little training for the type of restaurant it purports to be. In particular, we felt as though we were being served at a diner, with little to no attention paid to our 'speed' of eating, and absolutely no information provided about the specials, types of wine, etc. I was thoroughly disappointed with the service and complained. I do hope these reviews are eye openers for the management team.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 6, 2006", "id": 4329261}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Terrible Food - Overrated", "text": "The Kingfisher suffers from overselling itself as a world class resort when it is not.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 5, 2005", "id": 3738776}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Spa was fantastic", "text": "The setting is beautiful.

I would think that these places would welcome feedback; however, I did not get that feeling. The actual treatments and the people who performed them were lovely.
