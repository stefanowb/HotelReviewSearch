We were on the 11th floor and had one of only 4 hotel rooms that had a balcony, which was really nice. We stayed Dec 1-6 and overall had a pleasant experience. I was surprised at how small the hotel room was, but that seems to be a standard for New York. The room was very clean and we did have a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and iPod charger in the room. With our room facing 51st Street and with a balcony we did hear a lot of noise from the street below, but again, I think that\u2019s going to happen in such a crazy city! We arrived before our 3 PM check in time, and the room wasn\u2019t ready, but they held our bags for us and had them waiting in our room when we came back at 3:00 to check in. The staff was always pleasant. Right out the front door you could see Rockefeller Plaza and the Christmas tree. It was only a 10 minute walk to Times Square, which was one of my favorite places.

Very clean and with more than enough mod cons for us to make a good old cup of tea every day after our adventures in this amazing city. The staff were excellent and always threaded us with swift service and a smile, acces to the living room, computer equipment including printer and a really nice coffee machine all came in the price which was brilliant. There was also a small gym and use of a washing machine and tumble dryer which after a day outin the rain was warmly welcomed. In all honesty if you are after somewhere clean, tidy and so close to the major attractions that you can almost touch them at a really good price then look no further. Thank you for an amazing 1st stay in a wonderful city, you made this trip so worth while, we will be back for sure.

This was especially the case, since we had to pay for a night in Chicago, and their concierge informed us that they were not booked the night we missed. After talking with the manager, the concierge then told me that they were booked and denied ever telling me different. She also yelled at me and refused to let me speak with the manager. Once I made contact with the manager, he was equally useless, and basically told me to screw off. Glad I spent 7 nights worth of money there...for my honeymoon.
