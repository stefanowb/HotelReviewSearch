First week was manic, all the flights and hotels. Where to start, Rio is such an exciting city, with so much to see and do, and in the short space of time we were there we did so much. We did all the usual tourist attractions, but one of the best was going to the Maracana Football staduim on the 31st May for the 1st Leg of the cup final -the fans are so passionate and colourful - what a great atmosphere, if you get the chance go to a match. Then after our 3 days in Rio, it was off to the Igaussu Falls, no words can describe how you feel when you see the Falls for the first time. Stuningly beautiful rainforest with cascading waterfalls, plenty of wildlife, quatis and birds, and the occasional big spider. We had a great tour guide named Rodrigo, spoke fantastic english.

THIS IS PARADISE. Everything about the hotel is 1st class and i have very high standards and they were more than met. The food was amazing with enormous choice. The all inclusive drinks menu was the best I have seen and you get an inclusive mini bar in your room with beer, soft drinks and water too.The rooms are all large and very well furnished. As this hotel only opened last year its all still shiny and new !!! We travelled with First Choice from Manchester and it was a very enjoyable 10 hour flight. We upgraded to star class premier but the standard class accomodation looked as good just no free drinks or headphones in there. Would probably only upgrade again if we got it for a good discount ! If you read the other reviews they all say fabulous. Tips go a long way with the staff and will mean you will have no problem getting drinks !!! If you want to go to Rio (we didnt) it was \u00a3350pp for two day trip and the feedback we had from other guests was mixed. We did a day trip to Salvador and it was nice to see the cities culture but it is quite poor so expect beggars. We also did a day trip into the jungle which involved canoeing and a visit to a school that was fab. Bring pencils,chalk etc from home if you fancy doing that, the school will be more than appreciative as its run on a shoe string. Have you booked yet ???
