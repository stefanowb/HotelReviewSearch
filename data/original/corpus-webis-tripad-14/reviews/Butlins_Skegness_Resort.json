The apartment was clean although very dated the windows had gaps in them which we found out the first evening when I checked on my little boy to find the curtains blowing wide open (the window was shut because we was on the ground floor) so me or my partner took it in turns to sleep in there so my little boy would keep warm. The shower door wouldn't close properly in the bathroom so the water would be all over the floor by the time you'd finished your shower which wasn't good when the supposed bath mat they gave you was a hand towel!! Butlins itself was brilliant for my little boy, the shows had all his favourite characters so he was well pleased, the arcade was as you'd expect, we didn't visit the fairground because of the weather (it rained all week) We spent a lot of time in bob the builder land which my little boy loved, splash world was as you'd expect for a swimming pool although I was surprised they didn't have there own toddler area but they are expanding that area so who knows. As we went self catering we found there was very limited places to eat I.e burger king, papa johns & the chipshop which wasn't very nice when we did eat there, we found it to be very pricey if we wanted to eat in the restaurants \u00a315 pp or \u00a38 for children, now being a mother of a 2yr old I know he couldn't eat \u00a38 worth of food in a week never mind in one mealtime!!! There was a pub on site that did meals but that was often very busy & again the 1 time we did eat there wasn't very nice. We left a day early but I think that was mainly down to the weather but as a whole I'd be very suprised if went back to that particular Butlins again!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Beccy D", "date": "May 8, 2012", "id": 129589216}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We spent 5 days at Butlins Skegness in a gold apartment (We being a family of 4 - 2 adults, 2 children, 8 & 4 yrs) and I have to say it was fantastic.
