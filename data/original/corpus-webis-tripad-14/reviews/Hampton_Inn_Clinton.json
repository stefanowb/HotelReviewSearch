The outside upkeep seems to be suffering a bit as we saw abandoned shopping carts in the parking lot and a mound of dead bugs near the side door which had not been removed. All in all, still a nice place to stay but we sensed things were changing and not for the better....Time, as always, will tell.....", "title": "Alas!

Like the charming, Victorian town of Clinton, the hotel is full of hometown friendly hospitality. Lining the nearby historic streets are wonderfully eclectic boutique shops and designer stores. The Red Mill and Raritan river create a picturesque landscape that has insipid artists for over a century. The backdrop is sure to inspire a picture taker or two. The Hampton Inn provides business and leisure travelers alike with the opportunity to escape the hectic pace of large cities and spend some time relaxing in the perfect American hometown."}
