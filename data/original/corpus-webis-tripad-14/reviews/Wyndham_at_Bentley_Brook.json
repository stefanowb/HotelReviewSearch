Most of the restaurants (not on site) are a 15-20 minute drive from the resort (which was expected) and there are some cool museums (Normal Rockwell) nearby as well.

It was VERY cold so they actually started making the snow while we were there, which was pretty neat to see. The resort was beautiful and it was one of the best time share units we have stayed in. It was very up to date. There was forced air heat in the unit but a bonus of radiant heaters in both bathrooms which was nice on the feet in the cold mornings. The unit layout seemed a little small (the living area) if you had kids with you (we left ours w/ grandmom but if they were there, they would have been underfoot a lot). And the jetted tub was wide but short and more of a one person tub than a two person tub. The master bath had a stand up shower and the 2nd bath was a bigger shower but there was no bath tub, so if you had small children, you\u2019d have to bathe them in the big jetted tub which seemed rather large for small ones (yet too small for 2 adults). The unit had all energy efficient bulbs which were hard to get used to at first but they got brighter after a few seconds and we were fine w/ them (the resort is environmentally friendly...they even have a turbine on the top of the mountain which was cool to see...whenever we were in the valley, we knew where we had come from and where to go back to). The linens seemed fine...nothing fabulous, nothing shabby. The kitchen was adequate and had a nice rack to just sit your dishes in when they were clean.

They had a nice pool that went from indoors to outdoors but it was a little chilly (even though it was heated). The outdoor jacuzzi was nice....and you weren't cold getting out of it (because your body was warm) so it was great to soak in it and watch the snow fall on the mountain. There was also a bigger jacuzzi in an enclosed gazebo which would be nice if snow was naturally falling as it wouldn't be landing on you. We used this jacuzzi twice but it was harder to get back in then the other one...you had to walk up a walkway and then in the door and down the hall, up a flight of stairs and down another hall to get back to the locker room.
