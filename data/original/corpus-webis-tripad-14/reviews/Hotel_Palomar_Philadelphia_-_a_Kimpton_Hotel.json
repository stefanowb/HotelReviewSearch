The valet and bellman were extremely nice, helpful and greeted me with a smile on their face and believe me, after dealing with airports, TSA and cramped flights, that is the first thing I want to see when I arrive to my destination. All of the folks at the front desk went above and beyond to help me get adjusted, answer any questions and recommend local restaurants based on the type of cuisine I was in the mood for. They even went so far as to print out menus to some of their favorite restaurants! All the staff seemed genuinely happy and excited to be working at the Palomar and helping each and every guest - you certainly don't mind waiting in line when you know you are going to get superb customer service. The room was amazing - the perfect mix of modern, chic and homey. It's the little things in life that count and I was extremely impressed with the dimmer switch on the bathroom lights. I loved the decorations and furnishing used in the room and immediately said to myself, 'this is my kind of hotel' as I entered the room. I was traveling alone but the room was more than spacious and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the counter space in the bathroom! The workout facility was immaculately clean and quite up-to-date regarding the fitness equimpment that was offered. The staff at Square 1682 was extremely pleasant and very accomodating as well, checking to make sure that my meal was prepared to my liking and I was happy with not only my stay at the hotel but in the city of Philadelphia as well. To say that I was impressed is an understand and I look forward to visiting the Palomar upon my next trip back to Philadelphia.", "title": "Palomar Philadelphia - Home Away from Home", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SMP1107", "date": "June 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 165062125}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "Location location location!

We didn't bring our dog this time, but it was nice to know that she was welcome if we come back in the future. It can be hard to find a hotel that will let you bring a large dog.

We like Kimpton hotels. We REALLY like Kimpton hotels so we try and stay in a Kimpton if there is one in a city we travel to. The service is always really good, rooms are usually great and food of high quality. They're a little trendy, but with that friendly edge that takes them above the usual hotels and always look after the children. This was our first stay at the Kimpton Palomar Philadelphia. We arrived a late after a long day. (10.20 pm) The general restaurant was shut and the bar open. Having children with us, we didn't want to bother the bar staff with catering to us, so we asked the front desk whether we could have food for the children in the room and what sort of food we could order...we were told we could have anything on the regular room service menu and order anything from the drinks menu (I did mention I was in need of an ice-cold martini aswell)!! The front desk told us that the room menu was more extensive than the bar menu so it would work better for the children. Going to the room, it seemed a little \"tired\" even though the hotel only opened in October 2009. There weren't enough towels and the carpeting around the bathroom was frayed. The room lighting was poor and the bathroom was just not what you'd normally expect from a Kimpton. It felt a little drab and not 100% clean but we were tired and hungry so I put it down to being tired rather than the room. Calling down to room service - we tried to order food and were told it was too late - we couldn't have anything. We said \"anything for the children will do..even a plate of fries\"..but were told we couldn't have anything and that it was too late for milk and cookies even. We got to the 'almost begging' stage and told the room service/restaurant guy that the front desk had assured us we could get anything from the menu - but we were told 'no\". I asked whether they could do a plate of cold fruit?..'no'. So we were forced to raid the mini bar...which would have been okay..IF someone else's half-eaten food (including fresh garlic dips...NOT fresh anymore) weren't in the mini-bar! (Hmm..why wasn't this checked when the room was cleaned previously)????

We had to ask for coffee refills on 4 occasions as the coffee was not replenished without asking. The breakfast menu is limited but okay - however the quality of the food is very poor. We were given 3 cold, hard mini-muffins which were obviously straight from the fridge. 2 of us ordered waffles with fruit and they came quite hard, and were very dry (which I don't know how you manage with fresh waffles). The fruit consisted of 4 tiny strawberries and a few blueberries which seemed as though they had been sitting around for a while.

The hotel is a very new addition to the Kimpton family, but offered all the amenities and charm of all the others we have visited. The Palomar was very centrally located in the heart of the city. We are very big walkers and were able to get to all the major and minor sites from the hotel no problem. Everything is within a 2 mile radius of the hotel. You can walk to incredible restaurants in any part of the city from the hotel as well. The staff are very helpful and take a genuine interest in their guests to make sure everything is exceeding their expectations. The rooms are well appointed with everything you could need.", "title": "Great Staff, Great Location, GREAT MASSAGES!", "user": "buffalobaby", "date": "July 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 72746485}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "In addition, the wine reception, morning coffee/tea bar and afternoon refreshments were a great perk while exploring the city in the summer.
