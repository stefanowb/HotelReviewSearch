The service was inconsistent - ranging from calm and professional to aloof and judgemental. The room were incredibly small, and while chic, it felt cold and impersonal.

This was my second stay and it was even better. The standard rooms are a little smaller than the superior but they are just as much fun. Everything is very clean and modern. I love the curtains and the glass between the bathroom and room. All of the staff are friendly if you are staying at the hotel and it is easy to get something if you need it. The Long Bar is always fun and makes some of the best drinks in London, as does the Purple Bar. The lobby is a scene and always fun to walk through. The agua spa is amazing, really one of a kind, and has great massages. The restaurant is nice in the summer because you can sit in the outside terrace which is beautiful. The food is good but for the money I'd recommend Asia de Cuba at the St Martins Lane. The location is also perfect as it is right near Oxford Street and Soho, everything is walking distance, good for restaurants and nightlife.
