We'd been to the Galapagos on a previous occasion and stayed at this hotel at either end of the trip due to its proximity to the main tourist areas of the city. We promised ourselves that we would come back and explore this country better as we realised we missed out on so much. It was odd coming back somewhere after over ten years. In some ways the hotel hasn't changed much which made our visit all the more nostalgic. The rooms are comfortable, they haven't modernised the bathrooms but they were clean and worked. It still has plenty of character and the staff are friendly. We were disappointed that they no longer offered lunch but the breakfasts were good, a mix of European and US with eggs, meat, coffee, bread etc. It was useful that they had internet access, at the same price as internet cafes but more convenient.
