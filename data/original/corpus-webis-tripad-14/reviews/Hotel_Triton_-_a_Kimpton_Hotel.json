The bathroom had been renovated with a granite countertop and tiled showerstall. I found our room to be exceptionally peaceful and quiet, perhaps because we were on the top floor. My only problem with the Eco floor was that the shower gel/shampoo/(thin & runny) conditioner was in a dispenser on the wall, but not filled with Aveda products (the normal amenities in a Kimpton hotel). The hotel remedied that when I requested for them. The hotel was a good value- great location (next to Chinatown, steps from shops, close to the BART/MUNI/cable cars), nice perks such as morning coffe & tea, newspapers, fresh apples, cookies. They willingly credited my Kimpton rewards even though I booked through Hotwire.

Our hotel was booked through the ADA but I picked it out because I thought it looked like fun. From the second we got there to the second we left we were treated like old friends. Remember the old saying, treat others the way you would like to be treated. If you walk into any hotel with an attitude or a chip on your shoulder you're probably going to get the same in return... and ya know what? Ya probably deserve it. Anything we needed they were right on it. They made dinner reservations for us on a few occasions and if we needed anything else they took care of it immediately. I didn't seem to need anything though. There wasn't a thing wrong with the room, the beds were comfortable, and the room was clean. Anyone that complains about the room size is just being a pain in the rear. you think that's small? Go to Europe! If you want a bigger room go stay at a $400 a night hotel! Who cares! I'm not 500 pounds so I had a fine time getting around with my roommate and I don't plan to be in the room but to sleep anyway so that shouldn't even matter. I loved the fresh cookies and wine offered. All free. I also thought the complimentary massages and tarot card readings were cool. It's dog friendly which is nice for those who need it. But I didn't see one trace of any animals the whole time I was there. It's located in a great area, right across the street from China Town. And for those who complain about the noise, get over it! IT'S A CITY PEOPLE!, there is going to be street noise. I slept like a baby. You think thats bad... go to New York!! If you want 100% absolute quite go stay in a bed and breakfast in the mountains of Montana! Gee, some of these other reviews really errked me! At any rate, this is a great hotel, there is a fantastic pub around the corner called the Irish Bank, ask for Mark, tell him Alicia sent ya.
