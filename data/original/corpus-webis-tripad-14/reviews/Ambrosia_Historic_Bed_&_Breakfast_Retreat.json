At least, it left a sweet taste in our mouths. My 18 year old daughter and I were taking our first trip together without the rest of the family. Although I knew Victoria B.C. was a beautiful city with lots of activities, I remained slightly nervous about what was in store for us, wanting everything to be perfect for my college-bound child on her last vacation trip before school. I shouldn't have worried. Gracious attention from hosts Gavin and Gae made us feel immediately welcome and at home. Their willingness to help us to locate any place we wanted to go, see or do; as well as offering to make reservations and handle other details gave us nothing else to do except delight in our visit. We loved the delicious truffles left on our pillows, the constant supply of water which magically appeared in our personal mini-fridge, the coffee table outside our door with a plate of fresh baked cookies that never seemed to empty (no matter how many we ate.) We slept soundly in a comfortable bed and, surprisingly, had no awareness of other guests until we met them at breakfast. We enjoyed breakfast tremendously; the food was fabulous, and the company at the table provided interesting and intelligent conversation. My daughter had a wonderful last trip before she starts college, and I'll have some great memories to sustain me in my loneliness until she comes home for Christmas. We had an excellent time.
