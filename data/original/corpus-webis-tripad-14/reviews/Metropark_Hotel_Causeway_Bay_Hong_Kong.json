So close enough to enjoy the hustle and bustle, but far enough away to escape it too. Tin Hau underground station is a two minute walk form the hotel, so you can get anywhere in the city very quickly. One of the hotels best features is the roof top pool on the 32nd floor. If you are lucky and get clear weather the views are amazing. The worst feature is possiby the view (or lack of it) if you have a room on the back of the hotel. Had we realised that we would be staring straight into someones apartment opposite, we would have paid the extra money for a room at the front with some sort of view. Due to this we felt the need to keep our curtains closed most of the time we were in the room. We did not use the hotel restaurant, for two reasons. Firstly it's billed as Franco-Japanese fusion. That combination did nothing for my appetite! Plus they have live entertainment, in the form of some local crooner. Every evening on our return from the days exploits we'd hear them whilst we waited for the lift in the lobby. This little taster of what was on offer did not tempt us to go down for a bigger helping!
