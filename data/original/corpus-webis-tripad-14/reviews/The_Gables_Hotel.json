There was no view to talk of (other than a campsite and the motorway in the distance)but we weren't there for the view! Our guests rooms were clean and spacious. The only problem we had with the rooms was that they were too hot, and we were unable to control the temperature. We had to open our window and then we had the noise from the motorway in the distance. The food in the bar the day prior to our wedding day was ok. Our meal after the wedding was amazing. It was a fantastic sunny day, we had drinks and nibbles in the garden, then they took our orders for our a la carte meal. The meal was excellent , and way above our expectations. The staff were very polite and helpful, it was a little worrying that the wedding co-ordinator had her day off the day of the wedding. We did have to repeat requests to the stand in due to poor note taking/communications. But the day ran smoothly and overall it was a fantastic day to remember.
