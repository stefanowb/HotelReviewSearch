It is a modern hotel with large rooms and nice bathrooms. Did I mention the view. It is right on the Danube and facing the river your room is a wall of glass. You will be blown away by the view of the city across the river at night. That in itself is worth the price. The breakfast is excellent, the best of our entire trip including eggs bacon or omlets cooked to order. We walked into the city across the bridge but I would recommend using the trolley. One stops right in front of the hotel and crosses the river into the city. In Budapest, the hop on hop off bus tour is worth it and highly recommended to see the sights because Budapest is so large. Also the main tourist street Vaca Utca is delightful in the evening for resturants and strolling. The only negative point was that the tile in our shower was not real clean.", "title": "The view is worth the price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Robbed_John", "date": "September 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 44563036}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed with 5 people (three rooms) for 3 nights.
