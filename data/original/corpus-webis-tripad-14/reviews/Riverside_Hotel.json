Lots to do, clean and everyone was very friendly. The hotel is really pretty. We stayed in the newer section. The only thing I would suggest to Riverside is to replace with better beds.

The room and bathroom were very clean and the bath products were high quality. The location was what set this hotel apart from others we've stayed at in Ft. Lauderdale. It is on a prime dining and shopping street which provides great choices and activities. We will definitely consider staying at this hotel again.", "title": "Classic Hotel in a Prime Location", "user": "xxx123", "date": "May 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 109514090}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our room in the old 1936 building was small but nicely furnished and very clean. Equipped with an iron, hair dryer, tv, radio, coffee maker, basically all we needed. From our window we had a nice view of Las Olas Blvd which is perfect for a stroll, eating or shopping. The service was amazing. Everyone and anyone who worked at the hotel who we bumped into was courteous and helpful. The lobby is beautiful and the elevators and hallways clean and nicely lit at all times. It has two small bar areas and a very nice restaurant. The pool area was perfect for just my husband and me and it would be just as good if we brought our grandaughter with us. Though there is no attendant plenty of clean towels are available and the area was very clean. You can order food or drinks from a phone by the pool. The view from the pool is also very nice since the hotel is on the Intracoastal and you can see some very expensive yachts going by. It was a perfect romantic get away for us and we hope to return soon. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the room was small but it certainly deserves the 4.", "title": "Excellent stay, great old fashion hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "daskysdalimit", "date": "May 10, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 107691274}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "I would tell anyone who is heading to Fort Lauderdale to definitely come the the Riverside Hotel. It is the most historic hotel in Fort Lauderdale and is probably in the best location of any of the hotels in the area. Walk out the front door and you are on the famous Los Olmos Blvd. Los Olmos is the main street in the downtown area and has all the stores and restaurants you will ever need to see. At the back of the hotel are the riverboat tours. The rivertaxi's are good value but it becomes boring when the staff constantly talk about travellers leaving tips. Everyone in the hotel is most helpful from the concierge, bellmen and front desk. They have a great restaurant which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner right at the front of the hotel. Our room had fantastic views from the balcony this is the best place to stay.
