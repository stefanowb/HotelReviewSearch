Cute boutique hotel. The rooms are adorable. Nice staff. GREAT LOCATION. One street over from the water, walking distance to a lot of shops, restraurants/bars. There was a craft show/festival right next to the hotel held on Saturdays. We went to see the Red Sox play. We were able to walk to and from the stadium to avoid TRYING to get a cab afterwards.

The elevators of the parking garage are on the far side of the next block. We took a cab out that evening rather than jump over puddles and get wet trying to get to the lot.
