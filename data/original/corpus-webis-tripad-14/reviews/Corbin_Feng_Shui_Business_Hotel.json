The simplicity of the furniture, the decor, and the design must be part of the Feng Shui influence and I do find the whole package tranquil and relaxing.

There is no dinner or lunch service, but I've had some great meals in the hotel lobby or dining room that the staff has ordered in for me. They also provide bar service in the lobby and good advice on places to go. Finally, I always pay the same corporate rate, even during high season, such as Oktoberfest.
