When we arrived at our room, I was pleasantly surprised to a clean acceptable room. The walls were a little bit thin, we could hear people outside walking by, but not a real problem. The walls didn't have any pictures, but we were just there to sleep. The pool/spa was acceptable, it looked like it could use a cleaning, but this is a Comfort Inn, not a Hyatt. We were there to sleep and go about our day. It ended up being a nice clean room w/ fast maid service the following day. We were not expecting a kitchenette, but had a fridge and a microwave, so that was a nice addition. They also had a complimentary breakfast each morning with a nice selection of breakfast foods including freshly made waffles.
