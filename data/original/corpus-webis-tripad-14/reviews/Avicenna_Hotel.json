I was a bit wary of the complaints re; railway and Yes you can hear the trains from practically all rooms I think -but this was not a problem to us.Hotel in excellent position for the \"must sees\" although we went purposefully to do Bospherous cruise and to visit friends.The breakfast (is downstairs in a very pleasant room with garden attached) and consisted of cereals,bread/toast,cold meats,cheeses and biscuits/pastries,fruit,so no need to go hungry.
