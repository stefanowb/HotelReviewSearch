The grounds were impressive and well-groomed. The lobby was immaculate. I stayed in a king room and was very pleased with the room. The bed was very comfortable and the room was enjoyable. The walls were a bit thin, however. The food was fairly expensive, but what I tried was good. The highlight of my stay was the willingness of the shuttle drivers to transport me to my required locations at varying times; they were very helpful and courteous at all times. Upon my arrival, I called the front desk to ask if there was a fee for a refrigerator to be delivered to the room and, when I was informed it was $10 a night, I declined and decided to \"do without\". However, after my inquiry phone call, I was charged $10 both nights for a refrigerator that I never ordered (I found this as I checked my electronic folio on the TV system). Both charges were immediately removed following a call to the front desk. All employees I encountered were professional and efficient. Overall, I would highly recommend this property and will definitely stay there again if another visit to Wichita arises.", "title": "Very impressed -- Enjoyable stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "forevercruising", "date": "August 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8467799, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 comfortable bed + view of river", "disliked": "\u2014 thin walls"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled on business", "text": "The Hyatt Regency in Wichita met the expectations I have regarding Hyatt hotels.

I would recommend this hotel if you need to be downtown or are attending an event at the conference center - it is right next door. If you are going to old town, there are hotels that are better located. The hotel is perfectly acceptable, but not great. On the good side, the rooms are nicely decorated and spacious enough (not giant, but not tiny), the bed was very comfortable, and the hotel itself is very pretty. It is well kept, not run-down or dated at all. It has nice dining choices, and the staff was teriffic - pleasant and helpful. On the bad side, the walls are thinner than the average hotel - we heard basically everything that was said in the room next to ours and out in the hallway. Also, if someone is using the bathroom above you it is very loud, especially the shower. The gym is next to the indoor pool, and it is a nice gym, but the chlorine is overporwering - my eyes were burning all day after I worked out.

We discussed the details of our reception and told her that we would indeed like to have our reception there. She knew our date, and told us that we would just need to sign the contract and make a deposit. She said that she would need to have some time to prepare the paperwork, but that we could definately have our reception there. We told her that as soon as she had the paperwork ready we would sign and pay the deposit. Three weeks passed, and every time I called her she said that she did not have the papers ready, but that she would email them to me. She never did. Finally, when my fiance called her she told him that some company had called them over the weekend and wanted to book a convention for that day. Because of this, we could not have our recpetion there despite the fact that she had already promised us the space. We wasted three weeks with the Hyatt, and they did nothing but mislead us. She said that we could be put on a \"backup list\" in case the company did not come through, but that this \"wouldn't really be fair to us\". This flabergasted us, it was as if she thought canceling our recpetion plans was fair to us. She made it clear that since the Hyatt is a \"convetion\" center that this is their number one priority.
