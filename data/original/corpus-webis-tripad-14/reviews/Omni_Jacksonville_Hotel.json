Bad mistake! For a 5 star hotel the room was just dirty. I am guessing that no one had stayed in the room for a least a week because the clock had not been changed for daylight savings time. The bathroom had been partially refurbished but the bathtub was still old and covered with mold. There was a thick layer of dust on the toilet paper holder. Soap scum all inside the shower stall as if it hadn't been cleaned in months. The ottoman had mud all over the top which we easily wiped off with a wet cloth. You could see it as soon as you came in the room so I am not sure why the maid missed it. The desk which had a glass top protecting the wood was covered with some unknown sticky substance and the dresser had spit balls on the side. The window with a nice view of the river was covered with nose and hand prints that were clearly on the inside since we were on the 11th floor. The bed was extremely hard. I really felt like we had been put in a room that had not been visited by housekeeping in some time. However on a positive note, the staff was very friendly and helpful in other matters. The wait staff were extremely friendly. The hotel is directly located across from the Performing Arts Center and Jacksonville Landing which is nice.
