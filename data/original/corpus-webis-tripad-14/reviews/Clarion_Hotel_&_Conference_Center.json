There was so much dust in my room - on lamps, in the bathroom around the mirror and even on the coffee pot! I'm sorry but there is NO excuse for dust - what is housecleaning doing?? One of my towels was also dirty. The wall area around the door safety chain was worn and tattered. In addition, it certainly was not quiet - maybe it is on the other side. My room was over the \"overflowing dumpster\" mentioned by someone else and near the exit off Route 91 so I got to hear all the trucks as they slowed and rattled toward the exit all night. It was truly awful. Also I could barely get to sleep thinking of what might be lurking in the room. Others at our conference complained of ants in their bathrooms. And it wasn't that cheap - we got a conference rate of $89 and after a certain date it was $119. A collegue stayed at the Holiday Inn in town and it was fine. They must get college students or families of college students to avoid renovating and stay in business.

Good thing it was a busy weekend and I didn't spend a lot of time in the room. The whole place smells like mildew, is very dark and from outside looks abandoned. They charge around $150/night as regular rate and it is absolutely not worth that. I don't even think that it's worth the $74/night I paid. They do not have the hotel tv channel that you can use for check out so when I left at 6:15 am, I went to the lobby .No one was there and there were no instructions anywhere on how to check out so I just left my key in the key box. I wouldn't spend another night there.

In our first room we discovered the toilet han obviously not been cleaned. The hotel staff quickly reassigned us to a clean, but smaller room. When I attempted to use the iron in the room I discovered it had plastic melted onto the ironing surface. Fortunately I spotted the mess before using the iron. Again the staff was apologetic and replaced the iron. A little quality control over room condition is needed. Overall the place needs a face lift. The rooms and public areas are dark and outdated. Our mattress was lumpy and the entire facility smelled stale.The indoor pool was nice, but the sides of it had the typical scum build up that indicates a lack of routine cleaning.

Oak and gas fireplaces everywhere.", "text": "Don't judge this book by it's cover. The outside is not very nice, However, once I went in...wow! This hotel is a flashback to the 1970s. Oak everywhere, gas fireplaces and sitting areas everywhere...lots of nooks and crannys. It does have some issues, but overall it was a very interesting place with a lot of character and interesting layout. The center of the hotel is a dome that is over an indoor pool, with hallways like arms that spread out from the pool. Each hall opens into a large family room type setting with gas fireplaces sitting areas and soft couches..Oak everywhere from floor to ceiling. This was a super high class hotel in the 1970s (think it used to be a Hilton) and it is nice to see that places like this still exist. It could use a little work.(leaking problems form the dome over the pool in heavy rain), but over all it was very interesting highclass retro place. Nice steakhouse and bar right on the premises. If you are looking for a place with character and are not high maintanence then this is the place for you. The rooms are clean and modern. They were renovated in 2006. I would still rate this as a 2.5 star hotel, just because of the small structural issues it has. It would have been a 4 star back in the day.
