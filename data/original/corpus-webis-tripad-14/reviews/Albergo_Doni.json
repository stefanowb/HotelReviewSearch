Though you do have to leave your key at the front desk, I often struck up a conversation with the friendly staff, and since I was alone for two days before my friends met me there, it was very nice to feel included. Breakfast is light (rolls and coffee), but it was enough for me to get started for the day, since I prefer to eat outside the hotel to better experience the local cuisine. It's not easy to find the hotel, though I suppose nothing in Venice is, but by the end of my stay, I had discovered several different ways to get back to the Doni.
