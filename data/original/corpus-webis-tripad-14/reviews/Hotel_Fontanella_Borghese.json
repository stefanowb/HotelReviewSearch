Room 203 was clean, quiet and average sized. The shower had the best water pressure I have seen in a European hotel and you could take a shower without soaking the rest of the bathroom. Hotel staff was helpful with all questions. The location was excellent. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see and only took 1 cab (except for back and forth to the airport) and that was more due to a time issue than anything else. I will say that it was very disappointing that the hotel did not offer any internet connection workstation. Breakfast consisted of coffee, juice, milk, cereal, yogurt, quiche, breads, jams, etc. No meat and the cheese was prepackaged. All things considered it was a very enjoyable stay.", "title": "GREAT Location!!!

He gave us a map and highlighted all the sites we could do in one day/two nights. The room was small but OK. We wanted a courtyard but got a street view. It was noisy until 1am because there is a restaurant near. We are night owls so it was OK. The room has a safe but it locks with a key that you have to keep up with or pay 30 euros fine. I prefer the types of safe where you punch in your own determined code because then no one else has a copy of the key. We didn't have hot water in the morning. I didn't think the staff was as responsive as they needed to be since we couldn't take a shower. It was fine at night but I guess it must not be able to handle everyone in the mornings. Also our toilet wouldn't always flush. The hotel did not have internet service which was very surprising and the internet cafe pointed out on the map was not close. All the other hotels in big and small towns had a computer for guests. We did have two wonderful meals, both recommended by Kaled and walking distance from hotel - La Campana (menu and waiters only speak Italian) and AL 34 - eat outside and have the 34 salad. Breakfast was good - breads, cheese, cereal, real fruit, quiche, hard boiled eggs (the only eggs we saw in Italy!). The private car called by the hotel to take us to the airport was on time (45 euros fixed price). Taxi is 40 but its not located outside the hotel so take the car. I know hotels are expensive in Rome so this is probably a reasonable deal - we paid 205 euros but I think it could at least have a computer for that price", "title": "Reasonable - not perfect; good location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Georgia&Sunshine", "date": "September 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 8740470, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 issues with bathroom; lack of internet access"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Elegant - beautiful - great location - wonderful service - reasonably priced for what you get. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and loved it! I was a little surprised to read other reviews noting the smallish size of the rooms -- of course this is typical of European hotels. I found it to be elegant and (maybe because we were on the courtyard?) quiet. The staff was wonderfully accomodating; for my tastes (I'm a professor and am not used to a high-roller lifestyle) luxurious. When I walked into the lobby, I smelled fresh flowers. I loved the marble floors (note the basket-weave pattern in the beautiful breakfast room), and the gorgeous turquoise tiles on our bathroom floor. It is also extremely well located -- only a few blocks from the Spanish steps and all the rest.
