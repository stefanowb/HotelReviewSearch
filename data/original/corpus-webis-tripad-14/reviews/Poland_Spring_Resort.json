We were attending a family wedding taking place in town. We really enjoyed our time here! Lots to do between the gift shops, snack bars, pubs, restaurants, dining rooms, hiking trails, lakefront, etc. The Maine State Building from the Chicago World's Fair and the original Poland spring located on-site are quite impressive. We also toured the last active Shaker community near Sabbathday Lake nearby. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained and the area surrounding the resort is very scenic. While we personally don't golf the course looks great as well as the pool near the clubhouse. The huge porches overlooking the scenery and sunsets are fabulous. A very nice relaxing time! I am a little disturbed by the misleading and sometimes hurtful comments by some. Perhaps they were expecting a Scam Vegas or an idiotic Mickey World experience. The Resort may not have all the bells and whistles or fake glitz but it is very comfortable, the food is great, and the hosts are top-notch! We stayed in the least expensive room available in the Lodge building which has all the basic amenities and is very comfortable. There are many choices of accomodations in the Maine Inn, Presidential Inn, The Lodge, and the cottages located throughout if you really need something larger or fancier. The Poland Spring Resort is the epitome of a great country inn and is truly \"The Stress Free Zone\" and I am looking forward to returning when the opportunity presents itself again!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 13, 2011", "id": 115340124}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Curt Carleen and Cheryl Lilienthal, Saunderstown, RI", "title": "Great Place for Older Adults", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Summerfun00", "date": "July 10, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 115223453}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just spent 4 days at the resort.

My coworkers were impressed by the claims on the website, and gave us the gift. We made a reservation for the Deluxe room in the Presidential Inn, thinking it would have ,more of a bed and breakfast feel. At $147.00 a night, it was not cheap. I can handle old and quaint, but I cannot handle run down, water stained and generally poorly maintained. The owners of this inn obviously feel no need to show pride in the property, When we entered the Presidential Inn, the rugs was water stained, the walls covered in cheap paneling and the deluxe room consisted of a stained headboard with stained tiles in the ceiling. Okay,. so we tried the golf for additional fees, and were hell-bent on trying to be positive about the place. We felt that the dinner that was heralded in the brochure would surely make up for the less than stellar accommodations. What we got was a cafeteria style dining room with an Italian buffet that included soggy spaghetti and eggplant parmesean with their lasagna, the touted highlight of the meal. No table cloths, plastic and metal chairs, etc. Certainly not the wonderful ham, roast beef and turkey that were also a part of the brochure and their advertising. We live less than an hour from the place, and rather than argue about their firm, no refund policy, (no wonder they make that very clear on the phone!), we drove the distance back to our own home and our own bed.
