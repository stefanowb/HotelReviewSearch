The public spaces are gorgeous and well planned/designed and kept, the staff are friendly and attentive while in public places. The food and options for food were above par (for hotels) so I really don't mind paying the additional $$. I know I am paying a premium for convenience, atmosphere and not having to pack up and drive somewhere. The downside is that the rooms mostly seem to be an afterthought and do need some tlc. I don't want them to get rid of the old tile, or the adobe/stucco look of it. I like the classic charm and beauty. I just feel like the rooms are not cleaned as well as they should be (excepting the linens, which are great). Nothing seemed gross, just not well taken care of, or not kept up like it should. Some examples: The sconce on the bathroom light was burned on one side and not replaced, the window shades had poles in them to keep them straight, but 90% were sticking out of the shades and needed to be pushed back in so you didn't get scratched when opening them, the bathroom floor had stuff on it (not mud, or anything sticky... it just needed a better vacuum) the pulls on the dresser were sticky, the doors didn't hang well, the ice box was in desperate need of a good rinse, there was dust in the room in areas, one light switch didn't work, outside I found cigarette butts in my yard as well as pieces of un-chewed gum that the ants were loving, the chairs and table needed a desperate dusting and cobweb removal, the stucco around the casita needed a little finishing, the vent cover in the hot tub was not attached and kept slipping off and could cause a trip. The hot tub in general needed some love. It looked great, again love the \"casita\" style, but it was like sandpaper to walk and sit on and many of the tiles were cracked. Again, I don't mind the old look, even cracked tiles, but the patching should be done better and to pay an extra $200/nt for a hot tub that hurts to walk into or sit in is asking a bit much.", "title": "Making it a tradition", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "whitmer59", "date": "August 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116165739}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed 7/30-31/2010.

But that charm only goes so far. Like some other reviewers I found the front desk staff to be not at all charming or helpful. A traveler's experience at the front desk - the first impression - often sets the tone for the entire stay. In my opinion, the resort's management needs to give front desk staff a refresher course on customer service.", "title": "Charming but...", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "frogprince", "date": "July 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 116021471}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I also feel that the resort is putting too much stock in quaintness and history, and not enough in cleanliness and modernity.

I love to travel with my dog and been many places but i never experinenced a such a welcome for my dog .The office provided my dog with a bed ,bolws and a treat . i had no problems there ,i took my dog with us to the pool and around the property and all staff were very friendly. We swim at pool till 3-00am and no one kicked us out .I guess their pools stay open all night ,not like most resorts. My room was wonderfull ,we had a huge back yard with a tree ,grass and umbrella. Which was perfect for my dog.It was a very privite location ,you can tan naket if you wish and no one to see (no cameras). The bathroom was amazing and big , huge tub and separete large shower ( big enouth to wash a horse) I am going back there in 2 days , and i am so exited ,it is so beatifull there and so many pools to shoose from . i would recomend this resort for everyone ,neither if its your romantic getaway or a family vocation it is perfect for both ,just make sure to mention what you desire , front dest is very helpfull and do all they can to make your saty satisfying.", "title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "rseely615", "date": "July 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115983244}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 148, "average": 169, "very good": 349, "terrible": 95, "excellent": 675}, "aka": "La Quinta Resort & Club Hotel", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "La Quinta Resort & Club and PGA WEST\u00ae is a world-renowned Southern California desert retreat featuring 796 elegantly appointed casitas, suites and villas; the 23,000-square-foot Spa La Quinta\u00ae with 41 pools and 53 hot spas; 41 tennis courts; over 100,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor meeting and banquet facilities; and exceptional cuisine at Morgan\u2019s in the desert, TWENTY6 and Adobe Grill.
