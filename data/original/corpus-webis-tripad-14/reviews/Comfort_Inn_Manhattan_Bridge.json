This hotel is located between Chinatown and Little Italy. Within a short walking distance, there are several places to eat (Chinese, Italian, fast food places, etc), a couple of different subway stops, and steps away from the foot of the Manhattan Bridge.

My wife and I were traveling with her best friend so the desk agent gave us connecting rooms on the 6th floor. We loved our room. It was in the back of the hotel but it was on a corner so we had a lot of privacy. For how small the cozy the hotel is, our room was a decent size. The bathroom was huge and very nice. Everything was very clean. The rest of the hotel was also quite compact but they do such a good job of geting everything in that it doesn't seem so small. The breakfast area on the first floor just fits but it does the job. I also thought the breakfast was pretty good for a hotel breakfast. A great thing about this hotel was the fact that the Grand St. subway station is just a block and a half away. That was key as we were in town to see the band Furthur at the Beacon on the UWS.
