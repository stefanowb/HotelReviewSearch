Without giving away which cabin we stayed in (we would like it to be available next time we want to book it) we got what we wanted. If you fell off the cabin's rear deck you would just miss landing in the river. The river's rapids are so loud that, although the other cabins are close by, we had a pleasent sense of isolation and privacy. Lincoln, NH itself is a very nice town with plenty of stores, gas stations, restaurants and nice people. This may not seem impotant but we have stayed at lodges in NH that were a minimum of 20 minutes from the nearest anything. The next time we are in the White Mountains area would we stay at the Mt.

We got a two-bedroom room for a really low price because it was off-season (leaf peeping starts in late September). The two-bedroom room was comfortable for two people, might have been a bit too small for four. there were two stove burners, a small fridge, microwave and pots/pans/dishes. It was perfect for fixing a quick breakfast before going out hiking to Franconian Gorge (less than a 10min drive away) and the other sites. Lincoln and Woodstock downtowns are right around the corner, maybe a 7 minute drive to restaurants/bars. The place was quaint, the owners very friendly. We had the cabin without the river view (#2 I think) but we could still see the river from the bathroom and kitchen and hear it (the other cabins were literally right alongside of the river). Only a few cons: we were right next to the highway, though it didn\u2019t feel like it (didn\u2019t hear cars; this is also a pro since it was easy to get where we wanted to go and easy to find the place). Also the beds are not the most comfortable though for sensitive sleepers, and there is no dvd player.

So, not having a specific plan, we set out to find somewhere the was reasonably priced, comfortable, family friendly and not too far from the main road. We remembered a place that we stayed at about 10 years ago, but we were without kids at that time, so our options were more flexible. We ended up at Mt. Liberty, where Tom and Darlene greeted us with a warm smile...the kind you get from a relative that you haven't seen in a few years. We talked about options, rooms, cottages, prices....and local fishing spots!! My son, going on 13 years old, absolutely loves to fish, but not being locals, we had no idea where to start. Tom was great in helping us out. In addition to helping us out with fishing, he put us in a cottage that was perfect for us...not too big, but enough room to move around without bumping into each other! Plus, the 'enclosed' back porch was amazing, especially in the morning with a fresh cup of coffee!! We had such a nice time with them that we stayed an extra nite and even when we finally did have to leave, we talked about staying 'one more nite' just to enjoy the area. So, if you're ever in the Lincoln, NH area, I would HIGHLY recommend staying with them. They make you feel right at home and will do almost anything to make your stay an enjoyable one!!
