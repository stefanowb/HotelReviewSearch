Its the small details-the bath salts, cute origami towel animals and notes from housekeeping(..\"how was your day..?) that make it memorable. The downside to me was the unorganized staff in the executive lounge and being bombarded to sign in while balancing drink & food that caught me by surprise.

Rooms are large, clean, nice bathrooms. The hotel is within walking distance of a fairly large mall, about 10 min. The Sooks aren't too far in the other direction, probably about a 8 dollar cab ride. It is true there aren't really any stores or restaurants around the hotel. You will have to pay for internet wireless and anything else you might decide to use around the hotel. I will say the breakfast buffet is awesome, it is expensive but really good for about $25. As for training, there are some pretty decent commercial treadmills in the fitness centre to include as well some up to 40lb dumbells and a multi-station fitness structure with chin bar. It was chilly when I was there so didn't spend much time in the rooftop pool which has a gorgeous view of the city. No hot tub, but can imagine in the summer it must be pretty hot up there.
