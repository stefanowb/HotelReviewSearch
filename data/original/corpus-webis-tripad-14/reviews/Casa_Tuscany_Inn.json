If you have read any of the other reviews, you will already have heard about Carol's gifts as a gracious hostess. She serves sumptious breakfasts, is very knowledgeable of places to go and things to go in the La Paz area, and in addition to information about the wide number and variety of restaurants, will steer you toward some of the best choices on the menu. Carol is a travel consultant par excellance and has personal contacts with local drivers, tour agencies and specific guides that she has vetted. She put together a whale-watching trip for us to Magdalena Bay in San Carlos that was absolutely incredible! We also enjoyed a day-long adventure to snorkel with sea lions and enjoy a shore lunch on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Her backyard patio itself is like a bird sanctuary. We added four new birds to our life lists without leaving the inn. In short, you won't be disappointed if you choose Casa Tuscany.

All guest rooms have private entry and open out onto a central courtyard where Costa's Hummingbirds rule. These friendly fliers are very curious and often buzz guests, especially if dressed in bright colors. The Malecon, or boardwalk, is only one block away and invites guests to stroll, bicycle, roller blade, or just sit on one of the many benches to watch the sea and the sunset. Casa Tuscany is close to just about everything in La Paz, encouraging visitors to get out there and experience the local culture without the encumbrance of a vehicle. Rooms are nicely appointed and all rates include taxes and a sumptuous breakfast."}
