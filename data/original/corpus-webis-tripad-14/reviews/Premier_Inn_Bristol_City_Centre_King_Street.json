Rigt next to Welsh Back and lots of nice restaurants, bars and with a pub next door...very centrally located to shopping centers, banks, harbourside etc. Check in was smooth, my room was facing other buildings so it was totally peaceful. They have a tray with tea, coffee, milk etc in reception so you can take as much as you need if you use up what you have in the room. Vending machine in reception for drinks, chocolate, toothbrush etc. though it was our of order when I was there. I stupidly arrived without a us/uk adapter and reception very kindly provided me with one. Loved the extra large bath towel in room. The room was a very nice size, comfortable mattress and choice of soft and firm pillows. The tv screen was a bit like a computer monitor but I didn't watch tv so it didn't matter to me. It is a budget hotel but had everything you need except a lobby area to sit in but who needs to pay $100 more for that. I did not try the restaurant adjacent to the building but the menu looked well priced and had a wide range of food. I also liked the door knob flyer where you can choose to not have your room cleaned if you wish...this is useful for times when you need to work in your room and don't feel obliged to leave so housekeeping can clean..I liked this option and have not seen it before...unless you use the do not disturb option which is really not the same.", "title": "Excellent location and stay", "user": "natmicstef", "date": "July 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166951135}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stopped here for two nights over a weekend.
