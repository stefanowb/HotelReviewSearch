I was given a smoking room which was fine I did not mind but the power went out at 3am when I went to the bathroom. It took over 15mins to fix and several calls to the front desk. Then at 8am or so the power went again after switched on the lights. The agent at the front desk called me and told me the maintenance guy said I had something in my room. I told her that he had said there is a problem with the lights, she offered to move me at this time but I was not going to move everything when I was checking out in 5 hrs, so I stayed in a room without lights. I called and requested a 1pm check out only to be called at 12:10pm to be asked what time I am checking out. Upon check out a guy who I think was the manger (no Nametag ) asked me if I had a problem with electricity in the room. I said yes , he asked if it was fixed I said no and that was it no apology.
