The hotel is seemingly brand new, and in a commercial centre with other hotels and cinema and restaurants 10 mins away from the centre of Troyes. This was on balance our favourite of the stopover hotels we tried - everything worked well. Its minimally staffed, but this is fine and presumably keeps costs down. The room was huge and very pleasant, without a bath which was a shame, and also the fridge/microwave of the Suite Novotels would have been welcome, I am not sure why All Seasons does not follow the same policy. But the convenience and relaxedness of the common area, with free tea/coffee and cakes until 10, computers for the kids to hang out in, made up for these. No restaurant, but no need as there are 3 or 4 nice ones just next door (having kids, we ate at Hippopomus, which was not cheap for what it was but was good for the kids) Best of all, Troyes was fabulous to explore for a day, with beautiful old buildings - and after the Alps it was refreshing not to be greeted in English as soon as we opened our mouths!", "title": "lovely city", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "twoplusonetravel", "date": "January 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122778803}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here overnight on the 2nd Jan as a stop over traveling back to the UK from the Alps.", "title": "Superb 'Funky' Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "suez23", "date": "January 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122689311}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent!", "text": "I was pleasantly surprised at the style and ambiance of the hotel as well as the size of the rooms.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 1, 2012", "id": 122356832}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011", "text": "We had a family room with a double and sofa bed.
