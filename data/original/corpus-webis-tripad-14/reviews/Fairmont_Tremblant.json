The hotel is located at the base of the mountain and the top of the pedestrian village. What I like most about this hotel is that you can park your car upon arrival and leave it parked until you leave. The hill is steps away and so is everything else from great restaurants, rec facilities and shopping.

The bed was exceedingly comfortable and the shower was more than adequate. Upon stepping off the elevator a staff member meets you, sits you down and gets you all settled in very quickly. There is a private Gold floor lounge with a relaxing atmosphere and lots of free food and beverages. No need to pay for breakfast on the Gold floor, its all included. Any wish you have or information you may need is immediately provided by the attentive staff. They will make your restaurant reservations and bring your coffee and lift tickets to your door in the morning. No waiting in line! I was very pleased with the personal service I recieved on the Gold floor. The restaurant located in the hotel was very good. The food was excellent and the service was exceptional. I do, however, have to recommend Coco Pazo in the Village as an alternative if you can't get reservations in the hotels dining room. It was some of the best Italian cuisine ever! Try the creme brule! I recommend bringing your own ski equipment with you if possible. Rentals are expensive and the 360 rental shop within the hotel has terrible service. If you must rent take the short walk to Chalet des Voyesgeur located at the top of the Cabriolet. They have an abundance of staff and equipment. The process of renting is much faster and the quality of the skis and boots is much better. Avoid 360 at all costs....it may seem more convinient to just go downstairs but its NOT! The hotel also has an amazing outdoor pool and hot tub open year round. We were very happy with it but be aware that its not open in the morning....if you like to soak outside before skiing, you're outta luck. I also have to mention how dissapointed I was with the hotel spa. It is an Amerispa and I had high expectations. I was very dissapointed, the treatment rooms were not very nice and most of the staff barely spoke english and were unprofessional. It was over priced and not worh the money, if you must use a spa go somewhere else...like the Westin! Overall the hotel was great and I would stay there again if I was only in Tremblant for a night or two.
