We will skip San Juan next time and go to Copamarina straight from the airport as it takes only 2-hour drive. We brought 7 years old and 3 years old, both loved the pool, kiddie pool and play ground. We did not choose All Inclusive package and that was the right choice for us as we saved $1000 over food and activities that we did not do. My husband did scuba diving twice (2 x $90), and I did Bodyderm spa massage ($80), and still saved that much money. We were disappointed that Alexandra restaurant was horrible. I ordered Oriental shrimp and the sauce was totally disgusting - believe me, any Chinese restaurant in your home town can do better. My husband ordered some Italian-like dish with pasta, and we agreed that nothing was fancy. Alexandra was supposed to be fancy with lots of $$$, but food is not worth the money at all. We drove to neighboring town and had much better dinner there. We stayed in Garden View room, but it was a bit small for our family. We looked at the Superior Garden View room and it had more space and looked nicer. Our Garden View room did not have a bath tub (just shower), but we were told that we just needed to ask for it as some rooms have bath tub. The resoft is relaxed and laid back, and stuff were friendly to make us feel comfortable.

It was nice but we found the front desk staff to have no personality at all. The hotel was clean and the view is beautiful. but after checking in to our room the connecting room wasn't locked and when we opened the door there was another family in the next room - changing no doubt! Had to wait awhile for this to be fixed since the door had nails keeping the lock from locking?? The safe needed a key that you had to pick up from the front desk (what's the point if the front desk has a key). Dinner at Alexandra was okay but when we asked to sit outside we were told that request couldn't be accomodated. When the couple next to us complained after being seated in the restaurant that they wanted to sit outside and they were told \"no\" they wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer and got seated outside. When we asked why they were granted outside seating after being seated inside, the staff told us they had reservations. When clearly they did not. They were out of pool towels and when they finally came in after the pool towel truck ran out of gas we were charged a 30.00 deposit for two towels (you do get this back after returning the towels, but let's get real) the towels aren't really that nice. On the whole it's not a bad hotel, it just didn't make us feel welcomed and we usually stay at Ramada's etc. So, we expected to be \"welcomed\" when we arrived, paying close to 300.00 a night. There's no vanity in the bathroom only a pedistal sink. The view is beautiful and if you're going to Puerto Rico to read a book then this is the place for you.
