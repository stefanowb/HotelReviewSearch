While its location is convenient, there were just too many other inconveniences from the very beginning to warrant recommending it to anyone. First of all, as we always do when making hotel reservations, we had requested non-feather pillows before our arrival because I have asthma and am extremely allergic to down. There were feather pillows on our bed when we arrived, and when we requested different ones, not only did we wait a long time (and we were anxious to get out in the city) before anyone showed up at our door, the housekeeping person finally came and told us that he had been looking everywhere for non-down pillows and insisted that the ones he was holding were the only ones he could find. They turned out to be feather ones again. We wound up having to go downstairs ourselves to complain to the desk manager, who finally was able to find the appropriate pillows. The inconveniences continued....although there was a note saying that the bottles of water provided for us were free, there were no bottles of water provided other than the ones in the mini-bar. There was no ironing board, nor iron, and when we inquired because we had wanted to use one, we were told that they were all \"out\" and that if we wanted to iron anything we would have to go iron in a different room in the hotel. There were lights missing in the bathroom, and the only lights in the actual hotel room were one small and dimly-lit floor lamp, and dim colored lights (for which one could change the colors) behind the bed. There were reading lights coming out of the wall, but they were miniscule and malfunctioning. There were not enough towels and the shower flooded the bathroom because of the design of the shower door. In addition, the hallways of the hotel were poorly vacuumed, and when the housekeeping cart was in the hallway, it took up the entire space, making it almost impossible for even a normal-sized person to pass. All in all, considering the price of a room at this hotel, these inconveniences were unacceptable... there were lots of superficial minimalist design aspects to the hotel and room interiors, which they use to promote their hotel, however this is an example of form over function and comfort.", "title": "Disappointing experience", "user": "jccCalifornia", "date": "August 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 38920137}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "Myself, my Husband & our friends stayed for one night & it was brilliant.

The room had an electric tea-kettle and it was very convenient to have a cup of tea or coffee in the morning with a croissant from the local grocery store! The location is the best in the city: all major museums are just a few steps away (Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum), Rembrandt House and Anne Frank House are 20 -25 minutes of walking. The Canal Tour is right across the street. Leidseplein square is right behind the corner. It's an ideal location! The staff was extremely friendly: check in and check out were fast. Initially we had a room with a Canal view, but the noise from the street really bothered me during the night. After I mentioned it we were immediately given a new room facing the back yard (nice and quiet).
