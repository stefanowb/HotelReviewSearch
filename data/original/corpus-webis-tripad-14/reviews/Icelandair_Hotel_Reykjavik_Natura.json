The beds were very comfortable, the room spotless, and the bathroom (although small and a tiny bit weathered - some small chips in the enamelled floor of the shower) was more than adequate. A rain head shower head and unlimited hot water was fabulous after a nap. The food was quite good and the coffee although different looking was delicious.
