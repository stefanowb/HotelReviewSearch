This is a nice pub / hotel with loads of atmosphere and we had a great time here. We stayed for 5 nights and the room was very modern, clean, spacious and bright and no hint of the noisy shananigans that were going on downstairs. The food was excellent and the service was fine. Apart from these good points, I left feeling that McGrory's just didn't cut it, and this was probably due to the hole left in my wallet. We paid 65 euro per person for bed and breakfast. For a triple room at 185 a night, this was simply too much as I would expect to pay this in Dublin or a major European city (not a small country town in the middle of nowhere). Friends of ours rented whole houses (brand new and uber-modern about a 5 minute walk away) for half the price.", "title": "Very nice - but pricy", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "imabari", "date": "September 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8693745, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Front Bar.

It's a wee bit off the beaten track but all the better for it. Culdaff is a good location to explore Donegal from and McGrory's is the perfect place to come back to every evening. Rooms are comfortable with modern tasteful decor and clean, nicely -proportioned bathrooms. Breakfast was very tasty with plenty of chioce from what I could guess was locally sourced produce. (good eggs) The overall atmosphere in McGrory's is relaxed, warm and welcoming without being in your face. The front bar is the perfect place to relax in after a cobweb clearing walk on the beach. The Guinness and fab bar food may also be strong factors in the unwinding. It's a difficult place to leave once the music starts. The traditional sessions can be amazing...you just never know who might turn up to play a tune or give you a song. The restaurant also deserves a mention....you'd be hard pressed to find such a good standard for those prices anywhere else nearby.....good wholesome Irish food with a modern twist, not too finicky, just how we like our food. Oh, and when you ask for your steak medium, it comes out medium not chargrilled (!) like many Derry restaurants. The winelist is excellent. We chose house red which was a very decent French wine.
