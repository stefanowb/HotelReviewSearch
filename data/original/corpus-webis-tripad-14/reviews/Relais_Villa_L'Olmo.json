It offers flexible stays (similar types of accommodation offer stays by the week only) and also has a variety of accommodation types from apartments for couples to houses for larger parties. It is immaculately maintained and represents excellent value. The staff are extremely helpful, cheerful and friendly. The fact that the owners live on the property ensures that high standards are maintained. At the same time the privacy of guests is respected to the utmost. From here, Florence is a 25 minute ride on an air-conditioned bus at a cost of less than \u20ac2. It is a very attractive option to enduring the challenge of driving in the city then paying the very high parking rates. After a summer day in Florence, what a pleasure to return to the pool and the peacefulness of Villa l'Olmo. The location is a 2 minute walk from Impruneta which has a selection of restaurants and a food Co-op. From here, day trips into Chianti and beyond are a breeze.
