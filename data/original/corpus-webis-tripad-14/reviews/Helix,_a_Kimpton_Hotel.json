I have family in the neighborhood and the convenience for me to be so near their home as well as close to all the desirable sites is a huge bonus for us. The staff remembers me by name, check-in is swift and the room is ALWAYS in clean and orderly condition. Love the FUN decor! As with other stays, I slept soundly and was pleased to enjoy the fabulous coffee/tea bar in the lounge upon waking. Afternoon social hour is always a great time to mingle with other guests and relax with complimentary wine or beer. So many travelers want their pet to accompany them and a pet-friendly hotel is a real plus for including your furry friends.

I have to agree with the reviewer who commented on the seediness of the hotel. The first impression was generally a little run down, but not terrible. I left for dinner immediately upon arrival and returned to my room after 11 pm. When I went to get into bed, the carpet next to the bed was soaking wet - looked like it was seeping from a locked door that I assume housed some HVAC. I could live with that. But when I pulled back the sheets, the bed was dirty!! I won't describe it - but it was disgusting!! There was no housekeeping at that time of night. Someone brought me a set of clean sheets. Not ideal. Then the sink in the bathroom backed up - also disgusting. I tried to get a room at another hotel the next day, but the few rooms available - including at other Kimpton hotels - were $500 plus. I would have expected Kimpton might have let me stay at one of the other hotels for what I was paying at the Helix - or something close. They did move me to another room the next day that was acceptable. But the hotel itself just didn't seem clean or well-maintained - trash on the floor of the elevator that stayed there for a couple days, general wear and tear. I've stayed in other Kimpton hotels in other cities and have generally been very satisfied, and I'm not particularly demanding - as long as my room is clean and things are generally acceptable, I won't complain.
