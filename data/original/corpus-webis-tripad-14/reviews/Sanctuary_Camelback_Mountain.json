As far as the staff comment goes, we've had nothing but 5 star service from the staff on both our trips - and especially at the pool. As far as price, I think the reviewer might not have enough experience with the higher end resorts because for the price the Sanctuary offers quite a bit of value relative to similarly priced resorts. However, there are difference in rooms and having viewed one of the mountain casitas, i can say that I do not think they are as nice or worthy of the same price as the spa casita.

The Phoenix area is overloaded with top-end options like the Biltmore, Phoenician, Ritz, Four Seasons, Royal Palms (see my earlier review), etc., and like many of these, Sanctuary is part of the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts which offers incredible perks and discounts. For sheer relaxation, peacefulness, solitude, and scenery in the desert, this is the top! The staff is very attentive and friendly in a casual yet very respectful manner (not formal or stuffy at all). Service is outstandingly prompt for any type of request. The turndown service each night was a very nice touch We stayed 6 nights and wished for 6 more. The contemporary styling of the rooms is very refreshing, and they are spacious and well furnished. And the views are amazing. We visited several of the top area resorts and are delighted we stayed here. The location is very convenient to the best Scottsdale has to offer.
