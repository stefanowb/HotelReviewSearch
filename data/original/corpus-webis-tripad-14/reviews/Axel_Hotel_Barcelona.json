I stayed at Axel few years back and thought it was a reasonable hotel. Good location and nice roof terrace. I imagined that after the recent renovation it had become something special, but, unfortunately, not entirely true. They added one floor where the new pool terrace is situated. It's much better than before, both during the day and at the evenings (especially Wednesday-Sunday parties). Where the terrace was previously located one floor below, there are now 4 new suites, which have very large terraces (apart from room 701 which only has a small terrace). The terrace was fabulous (ours was the corner terrace) with sun loungers, nice dining area and cool lightening. If it wouldn\u2019t have been for the terrace, I don\u2019t think we would have stayed so long! The suite itself was nothing to write home about. Cheap furniture and decoration. Thought I had walked into an IKEA store. Floors of cheap light pine look-alike material. Furniture similar light pine material. No decorations, and already bit of wear and tear. Bed was ok, but pillows hard as stone. The hotel does not offer any alternative softer pillows. No blanket for the bead, only the bed sheets which became a problem. The floor-to-ceiling windows were obviously a great feature and the curtains effectively blocked out all the light in the morning (and no disturbance from the traffic). But they didn\u2019t block out the heat from the sun! So, around 10 in the morning the whole suite was boiling! The AC was by far effective enough. Some sort of remedy was to keep AC on coldest temperature during the night; with result we froze during the night due to lack of a blanket (only managed to get an old moldy blanket after the weekend). The bathroom was fine with a shower, bathtub and separate toilette, but the amenities were minuscule and there was no soap dish or anything else to place them in the shower. Most of the staff at the reception were really snobbish and not overwhelming enthusiastic. No help with the luggage. Concierge service? When? Think saw him most of the time during the evening parties on the terrace. The majority of the other staff was great and very friendly. Room service was good. Nice cocktails and food satisfactory, but nothing spectacular. The hotel had a great gym! Another stunning experience was on our final day. Our flight left in the evening. Since hotel wasn\u2019t full we asked to keep our room. It was free of charge until 2 pm but after that we would have to pay 50% of the daily room charge. We asked if we could take a shower in the gym before leaving and it was ok, for an Euro 25 charge per person. Or we could, free of charge (how generous!), use the open shower on terrace next to the pool, and change in the toilette!! Oh my God! To conclude: I\u2019m not sure the huge terrace in the suite can make up for the price the hotel is charging (in level with some 5 star hotels in the neighborhood).

They put our bags away so we could go out for the afternoon as we were far too early for check-in. The guy at the desk noticed we had booked a twin room and when he questioned this we told him not to worry and that we would push the beds together! He then immediately told us that he would see to this for us.
