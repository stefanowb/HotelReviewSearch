One reason we chose the Grand Hyatt was their promising pool, but when we checked in, we were notified that it was closed for maintenance. There was zero postings on their website about this. They offered us swimming at the Park Hyatt, which is about a mile (and a 30 minute Beijing taxi ride) away which we declined after sitting in 2 hours of Beijing traffic coming from the airport but they did waive the 15% service charge for us. One nice feature is that you can pre-book tours on their website: we booked a Great Wall tour and acrobat show and this was super convenient for us. The rate included a buffet breakfast. Having sampled the breakfast buffet at many Asian hotels, I would say I was disappointed here, especially for the price of 750 RMB for our family of 2 adults and 2 children.
