We had a two bedroom tree house and it was perfect for our family of five. Very comfortable for our family of 5 and great food served in the restaurants. The beach out side is stunning and the water is crystal clear. My only comment would be that they could use a few more sunbeds as we arrived and they were all taken.", "user": "lucy29linda", "date": "August 10, 2013", "id": 171577381}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent 10 night stay - we will be back!!", "text": "Sorry everyone for the late review! We went to Koh Tao in June for a 10 night stay as we wanted some where we could relax and do a stop on Diving. We booked direct with Sensi and the room was discounted due to the dates (not the best weather out of the 10 days 3/4 days of rain then rain showers only 1 sunset view). We were met from the ferry by Sensi holding a board and it only takes 10 mins to get to the resort. When you arrive they sign you in and a welcome drink then your bags are carried to your room.", "user": "TheScubaDuo", "date": "August 6, 2013", "id": 171073407}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Nice honeymoon retreat", "text": "The Room - We booked the Honeymoon room 312 and WOW paradise, great views of the beach and steps down to the sea to snorkel. 312 consists of 3 rooms - Living room, bedroom and bathroom and then outside a large veranda with a day bed on it a couple of chairs. The bed is king size and there is a mosquito net above which is placed down every night by the maid at 4pm they also close all the curtains. There is also a jug to boil water and tea and coffee is provided. There is also a hairdryer and beach towels, so do not pack them!! The living room has a settee and a chair and it has shutters which can be opened to let the sea breeze through, plus there is an A/C unit in the bedroom. They also provide sarongs and hats for you to use and if you like them you can purchase. In the bedroom there is also a safe and in the living room is a fridge which has a mini bar - but we just went to the local supermarket and bought litre bottles of pop and placed them in the fridge - but when you get there it was nice just to be able to have a drink whilst unpacking. There is no wardrobe but there are a few coat hangers in the living room. The bathroom is large but the lighting is dim but for the 10 days as it was so hot no make-up needed!! I did purchase a small mirror so I could dry my hair in the bedroom only cost a pound at the supermarket. The shower is very modern with various settings and shampoo/conditioner/shower gel is provided.", "user": "joblogs83", "date": "August 6, 2013", "id": 171048547}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent service with treehouse rooms", "text": "The Resort - there are 2 pools on different heights - you can not swim between them.

There were 4 adults and 3 children. The main bedroom has airconditioning and the other two rooms only have fans. One of the rooms (if it could be called a room as you could barely fit the bed in there) was up 2 lots of steps (which was useless for children and our elderly parents) and was so small you couldn't even fit your luggage in there.The 2 rooms with fans were SUPER hot each night which meant only the people sleeping with the airconditioner got any sleep. Also only the main bedroom had a bathroom attached to it, the other bathroom is at the base of the stairs between bedrooms 2 & 3. This bathroom has no cover at all and so if it rains (as it did when we were there) & you leave your toiletries out everything gets wet (which meant important tablets for my parents were ruined as they became water logged). Also the shower in this bathroom is barely useable as it is situated on a rock which is impossible for kids or the elderly to stand on!", "user": "hewyrosey4", "date": "August 3, 2013", "id": 170517492}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved our stay at Sensi Paradise", "text": "Breakfast was ordinary & staff only occasionally asked if you'd like a hot drink.", "user": "brijan19", "date": "August 1, 2013", "id": 170239186}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Brilliant, lovely, wonderful!", "text": "Pools were nice but for the price we were disappointed in the accommodation.

We could walk into town and there were at least 10 restaurants along the way. Our fav was whitening, good food at good prices with a great view. Would highly recommend. The only thing I didn't like was the stairs had no barrier and the gaps in the fence were large do be cautious if travelling with children under 5.", "user": "Pekka69", "date": "July 15, 2013", "id": 167637545}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "FABULOUS RESORT. AWESOME LOCATION", "text": "I stayed 7 nights with family and friends - we were picked up from the port and driven to the resort, we had a lovely welcome and our room was ready within the hour (we arrived at 9.45 am!) The chalets are excellent - the website does not give this resort enough justice. We had a family villa with two seperate rooms - 2 double beds, massive (and I mean really big) terrace which housed a lounge area, day beds, chairs and tables, fridge etc. Just brilliant - Our friends who had a standard villa were also impressed by the size. One thing I really like is the attention to details - they provided beach bags, beach mats, umberellas, dressing gowns it was really high quality and for the amount we were paying we found this outstanding value! Wifi was good - bathroom was huge.... The chalet is cleaned daily - and there is a turndown service at night where they let down the mozzie nets.", "user": "Judy D", "date": "July 10, 2013", "id": 167020903}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 25, "average": 41, "very good": 138, "terrible": 21, "excellent": 218}, "aka": "Sensi Paradise Hotel Koh Tao", "slim_ranking": 0.2}
