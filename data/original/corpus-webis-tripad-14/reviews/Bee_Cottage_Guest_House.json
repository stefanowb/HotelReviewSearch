You have to pre-book the food and we had a parsnip and apple soup, vegetarian shepherd\u2019s pie with fresh veg followed by plum and apple crumble and custard. It was filling and delicious!

Surrounded by stone walled fields and sheep. Fabulous garden. The present owners have been gradually renovating the place. Its much larger than I thought. Some of the interior is still dated but I don't think this matters too much. The bedroom we stayed in was a double ensuite shower with tea coffee all the bits. Not huge rooms but fine. You can choose a private appartment which has more space. I think this would be sensible if you were staying for a few days. For general guests there is a pleasant lounge and lots of books, maps andbrochures on what to do. Bee Cottage is licensed and provide meals which is geat. The owners can provide information on luggage delivery for walkers or cyclists, bike hire, provide packed lunches... just about everything. We turned up after an evening flight into Newcastle and after a dark and foggy drive it was nice to be greeted with fruitcake and be able to buy a bottle of wine. Owners are charming and knowledgeable. I had to drive into Durham the next day for a conference approx. 30 mins.
