The included food helped with budgeting and was of a good quality. The dining room is basic with wipe clean tables, mainly in rows, but this encourages friendliness between guests, and shared experiences. The breakfast included a large choice of cold meats, cheese, cereal and fruit with some hot food. My husband liked the breakfasts that included baked beans best! The waffles were fun to make and tasty. Some reviewers have complained about the queue, but the waffle maker is available from 3 to 6 so either take a hot drink into the TV room and wait, come back a bit later when the queue has gone down or join the queue, talk to your fellow guests and probably pick up some tips on where to visit. The 'light supper' is available from 6 to 9 and includes soup, salad, main course (no choice), dessert, cheese and biscuits - a veritable feast! When we had an evening tour, (which all started at 6:30, five minutes away at either Rica or Radisson) we went down 5 mins early got our cutlery and drinks and had time to have either a soup and a sandwich or a salad before we went out. On evenings we weren't on a trip we went down about 7(to give the trippers time to eat) and had a leisurely meal before going for a walk to the lake to look for the lights. (Take a flask and a headlight or torch). We were lucky to see the lights most evenings. If you want a friendly hotel which is in a good position, and good value for money pick this hotel.
