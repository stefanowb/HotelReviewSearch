I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone. We stayed there for two nights and only paid around $70.00 a night. I thought this was very reasonable for such a clean, comfortable and quiet room. What really impressed us was the way we were treated at the front desk. Their staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful with any questions we had. They also suggested two nice restaurants for dinner in the area and we had great meals at both of them. The front lobby of the hotel was decorated very nicely and had a fireplace too. The location was perfect, right off Route 495, can't miss it. Plus there is a 24 hour CVS store close to the hotel. We also enjoyed a dip in the pool and used the brand new fitness room too. I'm sure you will like this hotel as well.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 30, 2005", "id": 3427483}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Comfortable and Convenient", "text": "I stayed at this property on a last minute trip from Florida to take my daughter to see a Doctor in Boston.

The hotel was the only hotel in close proximity to our client that offered \"high-speed\" internet. That was our first mistake - only going for internet access. First of all, the \"high-speed\" access was wireless, which we didn't bring our wireless card and had to go buy one. The wireless connection was much slower than a dialup connection when you got a connection. Most of the time the connection kept getting dropped. Beyond internet access, the hotel was rank. The hallway carpet was severely stained and smelled horrible. The carpet in the room was a little better and the smell was bearable but I spent all week with the bathroom light on just waiting for the bugs to come out. Thankfully I never saw one but suffice it to say that I wasn't the most rested human being after a week's worth of sleepless nights. The best thing I can say about this hotel is that it's cheap. So if you could care less where you sleep, pick this one. Otherwise try the Comfort Suites across the street (new hotel, new high-speed internet coming sometime in April) or drive a little further to get a much nicer hotel. One other thing - the lobby displayed a plaque showing that the hotel was named Best Western's \"Best of the Best\". I would seriously hate to see the worst of the worst.

Happily, the remaining staff responded with new towels, etc., when we notified them in the late afternoon that we were skipped that day.
