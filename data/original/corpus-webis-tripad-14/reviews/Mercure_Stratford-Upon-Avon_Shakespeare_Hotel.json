The odd thing was that the reception never answered the phone, despite us trying again and again over the 24 hours we were there. The room service button on our phone was broken so there was no way to contact anyone apart from going down to reception ourselves, which sometimes wasn't manned, and sometimes had a long queue.

I didn't eat it, spoke to the waiter who was really kind - he went off to speak to chef who sent a message back to say something about it being that way because of the cooking method - baked rather than pan-fried - just not credible I'm afraid - the fish was cold and spongy - it hadn't been cooked properly.

I would recommend looking at the hotel website when booking a room, other websites were double this amount. The Hotel itself is lovely, full of charm, the seating area in Reception is very cosy with the huge fire keeping you very snug and warm. After reading some of the reviews, I asked for the two rooms we had booked to be at the back of the hotel, and thankfully, we received this and it was very quiet. We had room 136, which was a double, and not bad, except the mattress was not very good as it sank in the middle! Our friends room, 138, was a twin, we did book a double, but their room was slightly bigger and they were happy with this. If you do not have breakfast included in your rate, please do not pay \u00a315.95 per person for breakfast as we did not think it was value for money at all! There is a fantastic, cafe/bar/brasserie next to the hotel's car park entrance called Vintner. I can 100% recommend this place for lunch and dinner. We ate there 3 times over the weekend. The food, service and atmosphere is fantastic! We ate at an Italian called Sorrento on the Friday evening, which was over priced and the food not brill.
