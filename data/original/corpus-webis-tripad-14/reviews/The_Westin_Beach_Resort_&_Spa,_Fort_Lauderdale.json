I arrived 30 minutes early to use the spa facilities. There is a whirlpool jacuzzi and steam room as well as a relaxation room. The relaxation room is very close to the pump of the jacuzzi, so while you're relaxing you have the thundering sound of the pump in the background, hence it wasn't so relaxing.

We really liked the hotel and the facilities. The pool is elevated up and not on ground level which we really liked, it gives amazing views out over the Atlantic. The pool was clean, and with a great atmosphere around the place. Food and drink is served poolside, it was quite expensive, but really good quality.", "title": "Beachfront Location, Stunning", "user": "travelgorilla", "date": "March 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154824741}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We arrived at the Sheraton after having spent time in the Keys.

There was no way I was staying in this hotel and a lovely hotel employee tried to help when she saw how upset I was, I wish I got her name because she really did try and help.

The first thing that I want to address is the \"window\" between the bedroom and the bathroom. I had read all of the reviews and I could not imagine what this was exactly, so I am including a photo of it with my review. In a nutshell, there is a \"hole\" in the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom which is only covered with a louvered door or California shutter. It does not afford any privacy whatsoever as far as \"noise\" in the bathroom whatsoever. So, my advice to you is if you stay here and you want privacy in the bathroom ask your room mate or spouse to take a walk for a few minutes or at least put the volume on the tv up high. There is also only a sliding louvered door to close the bathroom. (see photos)", "title": "Breathe Easy at the Westin Ft.
