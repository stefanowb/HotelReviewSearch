The hotel owners go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. We had wine each evening in their inviting living room area, and enjoyed a very delicious breakfast each morning in the adjacent dining room. The nicely decorated rooms were spacious and bathrooms were new. The location, next to Cartier and other fashionable shops and restaurants was ideal. I can't wait to return to this very nice home away from home!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Liz1953", "date": "January 28, 2005", "id": 3096352}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beyond our expectations", "text": "I stayed at la Residenza in 1995, so I thought I knew what to expect when my husband and I visited recently for our anniversary. It was even better this time. Hospitality above and beyond. The location is perfect. Close to everything. They may not mention the rooftop terrace that is our favorite part about the hotel, so seek it out. Breakfast was the best of any hotel we visited during our trip. Our room had a bonus room that we weren't expecting, so if you go, you may want to request that. La Residenza is locatated close enough to the train station to make a walk with luggage bearable. When arriving, take the cool old elevator to the 2nd floor. We can't wait to return.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "floradivine", "date": "October 30, 2004", "id": 2796181}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Tuscany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 24, "very good": 75, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 56}, "aka": "La Residenza Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.380434782609}
