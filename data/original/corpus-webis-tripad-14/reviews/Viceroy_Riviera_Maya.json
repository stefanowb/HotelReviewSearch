Beautiful, private and extremely romantic. You really could stay in your villa all day long and never leave. Once we had our \"tour\" of the property and walked to our room they immediately delivered a bottle of wine and fruit. Then they came and offered us two bars of soap they had just made. Our Villa was beautiful. And the pool was unbelievable. We would have them warm it up every night when we left for dinner and when we came back to our room the water was like a jacuzzi. It was still warm in the morning and we would go swimming after we had out pastries just prior to going to breakfast. Then it would cool off for afternoon swimming and then we would have it warmed up again that night. The first night they just happened to be having a barbecue on the beach. The night was perfect and the food was amazing! I have never had so much lobster in my life! Our waiters were great. We became friends with all of them and they make sure that you are happy at all times. Ask/look for Carlos. He is the best. Tell him Cary and Angie said hello! The staff always call you by your name and remember any special needs/wants that you have throughout your entire stay. The motto of the hotel is that no request is too much. They do everything in their power to give you anything that you want. From the second you step onto the property you know you are somewhere special. It is small, intimate and magical. I know, I sound like a freak, but it was just so amazing. The first night they also left us a journal that they had hand written a note to us in. The spa was great as well. The couples massage in the Jungle room was great. And the Tezmacul was a moving, unique experience. I took advantage of all the showers, jacuzzi and steam room three times and I never saw anyone else in there. It was as if it was reserved just for me. And it smells great!!!! The outside shower was one of our favorites!! You will never use the indoor shower! You must have dinner on the sand with the tiki lights around you. The food was great. Breakfast was unbelievable. Drinks were strong. Do your self a favor and not pay any attention to how much money you are spending. If you are lucky enough to be at Ikal, truly enjoy the whole experience. Even my husband (who doesn't spend money as freely as i do!) said that it was worth every penny. And on top of everything, we met another couple that we have stayed in contact with and will be life long friends!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 27, 2005", "id": 4055714}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2002", "text": "The only negatives- Use the bug spray they give you in your villa.

I had been unbelievably stressed by planning a wedding and one minute at Ikal del Mar washed it all away. As if the beauty of the property is not enough, reception is impeccable. The staff is beyond professional, yet they become your friends. They have perfectly achieved the balance of meeting your every need while building an amiable rapport with each guest as an individual. This staff is in the business of making your stay the absolute best it can be.

This was such a wonderful treat. After a disaster trip from San Antonio on Fun Jet where we were delayed 24 hrs. we were met by the resort's driver who had made three attempts to pick us up due to delay after delay. There he was at 4am in his car when our flight was suppose to arrive at 2am. At the resort they quickly got us to our room where there were cheese, fruit, crackers and wine waiting for us since they knew we might be hungry after such an ordeal with the flight. After resting we were delivered the delightful pastries and coffee on our beautiful patio. These little villas are so spacious it is really like having your own little private home. The resort is small and there are not many guests. In fact you can traverse one of their paths and not even see a soul except for the many workers tidying up the place. It seemed at though there were about six workers to every one guest. While on the beach they bring you ice cold towels (literally with the ice often still there) to wipe your face and cool you off. The breeze off the beach and the hum of the waves was enough to put me to sleep for days. Between the morning coffee and pastries and breakfast (complimentary) that could be taken until 11am, we had no need for a lunch time meal. We ate at the hotel for dinner twice. The food was excellent and the service was extraordinary. We ate one day in town and though it was cheaper the quality of food was far inferior. The shuttle went from 4-6:30 and we really didn't see a need to stay longer. Carlos in the office was wonderful in catering to our every need. There was internet available in the office in order to communicate with our four children back at home. They also were very accomodating to bring ice to our room as often as we asked for it. It is all bagged purified ice so we did not experience any gastrointestinal problems so associated with Mexico.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "12984736", "date": "June 19, 2005", "id": 3576202}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Trip of a lifetime", "text": "All in all I would recommmend Ikal Del Mar to anyone trying to get away to a quiet, intimate, small resort.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 16, 2005", "id": 3570609}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "luxury villas but overpriced & average food and drink", "text": "My wife and I just returned from IKAL DEL MAR for our honeymoon.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 15, 2005", "id": 3555319}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "We were to arrive on Sunday night after getting married on Saturday but the airline delayed us and we did not get to IKAL DEL MAR until Monday at around Noon.
