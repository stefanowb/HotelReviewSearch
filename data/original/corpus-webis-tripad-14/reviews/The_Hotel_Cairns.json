At check-in, we were not acknowledged for a couple minutes, and when we were the impression was that we were somehow interrupting. The check-in process went quite quickly, however. We had reserved a tower block room and had requested a quiet room when we booked through the hotel\u2019s website. The room itself is best described as dingy and the floor especially looked like it could use a good polishing. The bathroom was not only in need of a serious update (chipped, stained corian, very old fixtures), but it also needed a pretty thorough clean to get rid of the mildew in and around the tub. Molton Brown toiletries are advertised and there were bottles of shower gel/shampoo and conditioner fixed to the shower wall, but other toiletries were not Molton Brown. The Hotel itself is more of a motel than hotel in layout, and is nicely landscaped. We did not swim in the pool, and while small, it looked clean. As part of our reservation, we received $100 off dinner in their restaurant, The Plantation. The meal and service were both wonderful. I\u2019d highly recommend the steak (which you cook yourself on a hot stone) and the barramundi. The desserts are okay\u2014they seem to be going for presentation over taste. I\u2019d eat here again. Our disappointment with the room grew when we returned that evening. The \u201cclean\u201d coffee cups had the dregs of someone else\u2019s coffee in them and the AC was too loud to sleep through. Although we had requested a room in the quiet part of the hotel, noise from the road below kept us awake. Furthermore, the pretty but impractical wooden blinds meant that the sunshine was very poorly blocked. The perks (money off dinner, use of a smartcar) are nice ideas, but I\u2019d much rather see that money put towards cleaning, updating, and soundproofing the rooms.
