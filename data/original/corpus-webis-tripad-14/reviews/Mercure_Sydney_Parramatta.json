Disabled room was adequate but only has a shower chair. Adjoining room has access door for carer. Footpath outside was very cambered on where it crossed the car park driveway and you could easily take a tumble. Entry to carpark is very tight but carpark has several disabled parks. Rosehill racecourse only 100 metres away. Next door is bowling club which has a very cheap all you cab eat area. Many clubs within walking or short drive distance. Bus with access right outside to railway station which is also accessable. Ferry terminal also accessable and nice trip to circular quay or darling harbour.
