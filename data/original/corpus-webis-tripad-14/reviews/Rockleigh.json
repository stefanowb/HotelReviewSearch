You can see the gable of the house standing at the entry and looking across the wide expanse of tarmac used by busses, trucks, and cars heading for the ferry (see attached photo). To get there, you walk away from the landing area past the bus stand, cross the road into a small parking lot and turn left opposite the pub; stay on the left fork past several buildings behind the high fence and, just before the sign for the Skinner Monument across the road a small sign on the retaining wall identifies Rockleigh and the word \"Accommodation\" on the gable end provides reassurance that you've found the right place. It's a 10-minute walk at the most, on the level, even with rolly bags to manage. The proprietor is attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the town. The \"traditional Welsh breakfast\" was delicious, though it did look a lot like the \"traditional English breakfast\" we've been served at other B&Bs.", "title": "Pleasant, well run, and very convenient to the ferry", "user": "Putnam B", "date": "July 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 169205057}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Just returned home after visiting our Son in Holyhead, we always stay at Rockleigh as it is so close to him. As usual our stay at Rockleigh was wonderful. Sylvia is not only a superb landlady, she has become a good friend as we have stayed here so many times. Nothing is too much trouble for her and she can often be found searching for the correct buses or trains routes to places of interest for her guests. The breakfasts are great, so much variety, lots of fresh fruit and cereals plus a Full Cooked Welsh Breakfast if you can eat it all.

The room was spacious, clean, well appointed and warm. Tea and coffee and a kettle were in the room and a jug of fresh milk supplied every day! I have never seen that before, except on occasions when I've been lucky enough to stay in a 5* hotel - and then you have to ask for it. There is a small visitors lounge which I found useful for doing some quiet reading during the day. This area has a range of books about Wales and a CD player and leads on to a balcony overlooking the port. Unusual amenities for a B & B ! I was surprised to find, behind the house, an extensive area of garden going up the hill with a delightful patio area at the top - another quiet retreat ! The full breakfast was enough to keep me going most of the day, I certainly couldn't eat all that was on offer. The landlady was very attentive and seemed to be available 24/7 if one needed anything. I would certainly recommend this highly to anyone who was staying in Holyhead, either for an overnight stopover or for a holiday.", "title": "Outstanding B & B with many extras", "user": "Ronald L", "date": "February 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 151466659}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 0, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 15}, "aka": "Rockleigh Holyhead, Wales", "slim_ranking": 0.272727272727}
