It felt like absolute paradise!! The staff were amazing, so friendly and always so eager to bring you another drink when your current one was getting low...no bad thing! The rooms were clean and maintained as such daily by a designated room boy. You also get a designated waiter in the restaurant and so you feel extremely well looked after throughout the entire stay. i cannot say enough good things about this island really, it is truely beautiful. I would say it's more of a couples destination though. I don't have children but i imagine if you brought them here that they'd be at abit of a loose end! One thing i have noticed people mentioning which made me feel dubious about going after we had booked was the rat presence. Yes there are rats, but they only appear at night time and they do not come anywhere near the bars and that. We only noticed them as we tended to sit on the decking outside one of the bars where there were trees and shrubs, and rats tended to crawl from the trees up a drainpipe and into the roof, presumably for heat or shelter. At the end of the day theres rats everywhere and as long as they keep themselves to themselves i did not find this to be an issue, nor something that would put me off going again! Also...if you are worried about going during monsoon season as i was, we stayed from the 2nd august until the 12th and we had 2 days were there was a brief torrential downpour, probably for about half an hour. Then it was over as soon as it began and everything dried up quickly. There was one day toward the end of our stay where it was stormy and remained pretty much all day. Not bad for going during the monsoon season though, it's just a hit or a miss but it didn't put a dampner on our stay!", "title": "Perfect Honeymoon, absolute paradise!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Melissa M", "date": "August 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 137987066}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is our fourth visit in as many years to the Maldives, having previously stopped at veligandu, villamendhoo and sun Island each island has had something to offer.

The Island was in many ways the same as veli and villa, being owned by the same company designed and laid out along the same commercial lines but it works well. The lagoon was mostly sea grass you had to swim out quite away to get to any living coral alot of damage created by too many tourists hence not the amount of fish as the other islands which were in the South Male Atoll. The only comment we feel we need to mention is the wildlife every island we have stayed on has had rat,bats,geckos,ants and cockroaches. These are tropical islands and for the out of town experience and the health of the island should be tolerated the complaints we have read were quickly dismissed. The cockroach in our room was soon rounded up using the dustbin and room guide as a cover and released back into the wild. BUT the rats!!! as usual we heard and saw a few until we got to Thursday the 2nd August this may have been something to do with ongoing building work, a supply ship or even the full moon but the rats were everywhere on the north of the Island from our room (509) to dinner, during dinner we watched them playing in the trees outside and return to the room we counted over 30 mainly on the 10 minute walk from our room to the restaurant and back they were very brazen running along beside us and even after seeing us coming some would stop check us out and then run straight at us, I should say after this time the numbers quickly went back to the usual low level amounts but we never felt like walking barefoot around the island.", "title": "4th year in the Maldives", "user": "baz-rochester", "date": "August 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137920553}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Please don't be put off by this review, the overall holiday is everything you would wish for from the maldives on your first visit and mostly what you would expect if you have been before and what keeps you going back for more.", "title": "lovely..but with issues!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "jaeamyross", "date": "August 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137907586}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "My wish list would read please crown and champa stop building on this island before you overpopulate it..", "title": "Loved Everything!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Chic_chef81", "date": "August 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 137774943}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband,myself and 7 year old daughter stayed for 2 wks from 6th aug 2012. We were in a beach villa 257 which was perfect for us as close to the beach and pool and of course the bar.We were told by thomas cook 5wks before our holiday about the beach villas and pool with childrens pool were being refurbished,we were worried by this but on arrival we were given a newly refurbished villa which was lovely and didnt notice any other villas being done. However the childrens pool that they expected us to use was a blow up one situated behind the pavillion pool. We did'nt use this as water was too warm and my daughter couldnt do anything in it. The Pavillion pool is ment for over 18's but we had no option but to use this pool, i imagine guests were a little put out by the fact there where children in the pool, but we paid for her to holiday and she prefers pools to the beach.When you first see the island and its white sand you are blown away but after a few days we were becoming more and more unhappy with some parts of the island. As we had a child we were limited to where we could go and the best parts of the beach were the adult only end. The soft white sand is there but walking into the sea you have to walk through dead coral, we had to buy water shoes to make it a bit easier as every day it was more and more unbearable to stand on. I read reviews on here for weeks before our holiday and thought some maybe a little over exaggerated, but although most of it was good there were more bad.There was a boat sucking up sand about 30ft from our villa onto the beach which was bringing coral with it and this was being used to replace unsandy parts, so we had to wear flipflops.We had a builders yard behind us and was woken every morning to the sound of a digger and electric saw. There is a constant droaning sound from the generator and around the pool you smell the diesal and some days it was nasty. They are planning to build a new 24hr bar also which i imagine will be not good.We know that the island has to be maintained but the work that is going on there is not minor and i feel that the island should be closed for a couple of months to do this amount, the pool is no where near finished and there is a block building being built beside it and the 2 weeks we were there never saw anyone working on it. We took insect repellant but i got bit so many times i had to stay in for 2 nights. There are large ants, which every night returning home were in the toilet, midgy flies and yes there are rats. We seen the most sitting outside the dhoni bar, watching them scurry up and down a drain pipe, and no im not exaggerating, we never seen them in the day just evenings. We did enjoy our holiday as it is very relaxing, apart from the 5 days rain we had.The food was outstanding. The waiters,bar staff, room boys were lovely. We spent most of our evenings in the pavillion bar as this was the most friendly and relaxing bar to us, the other bars were nice but never really built a rapport with the staff. our daughter spent a lot of time in here as Alwyn,Shereff, Anthony and Billy whom we knicknamed as his name was a mouthful to remember, loved her and really made a fuss of her, and as it was just meters away from our villa she used to fall asleep on the sofa and we carried her home at the end of the evening.All in all, we wont be revisitng meeru as we felt it was like a building site. The beach spoilt it a lot for me. Also a little pricey, check what you have to pay for and what not, we were AI but still spent $1800. I dont usually write reviews but reading some of them, i think make it out to be the best but clearly they must not walk near the middle of the island just around the island or maybe not as fussy.

The staff were wonderful and very attentive. There was great food with a wide variety including traditional English ....personally i enjoyed my Sunday roast sat looking at the beach. Evening entertainment is very relaxed with soft music playing while you sit on cushioned wooden benches looking at the moon shimmer on the sea. If you wanted you could go for a drink to the other end of the island ,where they did once a week have a disco night and twice a week had live music. Our favourite was an accoustic band who played classic rock on the beach surrounded by candles......brilliant. The Asian wok is a restaurant which you have to pay extra to eat in, however you can go and have a drink with the all inclusive option i absolutely recommended doing this to enjoy the sunset. Certainly go for the all inclusive option as we drank three litres of water each a day and this alone would cost a lot of money if you were only full board. Also the all inclusive package entitles you to two trips the sunset cruise was good (saw dolphins) and the fishing trip was okay. Snorkelling is good but did not have a house reef ...however you could pay to go on a boat to a reef. Overall be careful as there is apparently a risk of overbooking rooms however when you get there if you are in a jacuzzi beach villa or above you have an option to go island hopping to another island or a cruise ...we would have been keen but sid not want to risk losing our room. We have been to the Carribean but the Maldives was even better.
