The room was very clean, the airconditioner worked great, after we figured out how to work it. The location was 20 feet from a good metro, the hostesses were helpful, friendly, and wonderful. It wasn't posh luxury, but for a middle class girl it was great. A neat old building, with character. The halls weren't fancy, but the rooms were thoughtfully decorated and attractive. It felt French not Days Inn. The neighborhood felt safe and although it was busy, it lacked some of the crazied crowdedness that the more upscale, touristy areas seemed to have 24 hours a day. In the evening it was quiet and even peaceful. Grocery store across the street, delicious bakeries on the street, nice cafe bistros.
