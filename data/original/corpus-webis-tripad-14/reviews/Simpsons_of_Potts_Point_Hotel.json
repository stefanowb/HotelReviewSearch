I found that in both my room and my sister's room so I assume it is across. Nothing major, but a small concern. My only advice, regarding our room location, if you are someone who is a light sleeper, and would like to sleep through the morning hours, is to book a room \"away\" from the breakfast area.

What you are paying for at this hotel is the impeccable service; any request within reason is met with extreme promptness. I stayed in two different rooms during my 7+1 day stay here in Sydney with the biggest difference being the flat screen TV in one room and a 13\" CRT in the other. Apparently 10 out of the 12 rooms do have flat screens so if you're looking for a better TV in your room, request one that does. I would have liked some premium movie channels with my room but I was out and about for most of the time so this was not that big of a deal. The internet was spotty on my first day of arrival, but that got quickly fixed and it was reliable during the rest of the stay. The continental breakfast is sufficient but those that want a hot eggs & bacon style breakfast will be disappointed. The decor is charming for the most part, though for the fastidious there are some areas that need a little sanding/repainting. Potts Point is definitely a trendy, charming area to stay and the walk through the Royal Botannical Gardens to the Opera House and then the Circular Quay is a nice 20-30 minute stroll. I do wish the price were a little lower as this was the most expensive place for my trip but I stayed during the extremely busy time of Mardis Gras so the prices were reasonable due to the demand and due to the fact that Sydney is a relatively expensive city.
