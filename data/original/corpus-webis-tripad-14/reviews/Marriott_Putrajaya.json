My room was not ready for early check in as promised. So after expressed my disappointment, they upgraded me to deluxe room with a view. My jaws dropped when I stepped in to the room eg an outdated room with wet carpet smell, a view with a whole bunch of trees in front of the small balcony, old furnitures and this is definitely not a deluxe room cateogry at a 5 star hotel. Hence I complained and they upgraded me to executive deluxe room with golf view. I must say that was a much better room because it is abit newer and cleaner. I was told that I was able to enjoy the executive lounge benefits but due to lack of proper communications, the senior butler told me I wasn't till they clarified with the staff at reception who gave me an upgrade. What a mess! The door bell in my room doesn't work. So you can imagine how well the hotel is maintained. It's a 11 yrs old hotel and the staff told me there isn't any major refurbishment.", "title": "A great improvement", "user": "jespermc", "date": "September 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 176737875}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled on business", "text": "You don't have to be excited even though you get to enjoy the benefits at the executive lounge.
