{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 36, "name": "Hotel Landhaus Feldmeier", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "If you are fortunate enough to be in Oberammergau for the Passion Play, you shouldn't complain even if you have to sleep in a basement. The Passion Play itself is other-worldly, a perfect balance between spectacle and piety. Everyone should do it at least once in a lifetime. Of course, none of this comes on the cheap: the Passion Play is a world-class event, and enterprises of Oberammergau charge world-class prices, especially in years whenthe play is being performed. In spite of this, we loved the Landhaus Feldmeir, and would gladly stay there again, either in conjunction with the play or not. The location-- a bit out of the center of town; perhaps a fifteen minute walk to the theater-- is in many ways ideal: away from the main hubbub, but still close enough to walk. The facilities are simple but lovely-- ample rooms, simply decorated, but with nice local touches and wonderful heavy wooden furniture. The location on the main road into town can be a bit noisy if the windows are open (and they will be at times, for there is no ari conditioning); it is a bit disconcerting, too, if you are on the ground floor, and a tour bus is loading up right outside as you attempt to shower! But the service is very friendkly and genuine (if a bit shy, perhaps even overwhelmed by it all at times). At least three of the members of our host family were in the Passion Play-- on top of their responsibilities making us feel welcome! The food is very tasty, nice and fresh. Lovely choice at breakfast (a typicaL German affair, with dark breads, cold cuts, and cheese, with bacon & scrambled eggs added for visitors!). Choices at other meals seem a bit limited (just two entrees, one of them always pork it seems); but our waitress was always very accomodating about making substititutions (can't stand those dumplings!) So, we were pleased to stay here during our Oberammergau sojourn. The Passion Play moved us deeply, and staying at the Feldmeier seemed to provide a more genuine chance to experience Oberammergau than we might have had at a larger, more homogenized hotel.", "title": "We loved the Landhaus Feldmeier", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "revjeff", "date": "August 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 75656305}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed for the Passion play, two nights.

The best seats for the Play come in packages that include the top-level and next-to-top level lodging. We chose the next-to-top level. The price for the hotel was more than it was worth for lodging, but it was valuable to be 20 minutes' walk from the Play Theater. With a full house, the staff did an efficient job of providing all our meals, and the food was good quality. None of the staff made an effort to be welcoming or friendly. Our room and the room of the couple with whom we traveled were both spacious, including a sitting area and, in our case, a balcony. Some wear and tear were evident. The weather was cold and rainy during our stay, so sleeping with windows closed was comfortable. Because the hotel is on the main thoroughfare into town, traffic noise (motorcycles and trucks) would be objectionable with windows open during warm weather. Free parking was conveniently located at the back door. The Passion Play lived up to all our expectations, and we would highly recommend it. In non-Play years, we would stay in Oberammergau only if prices were a fraction of 2010 prices.", "title": "Good hotel, walking distance to Passion Play", "user": "Wootie", "date": "June 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 66617261}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 4, "very good": 7, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 19}, "slim_ranking": 0.464285714286}
