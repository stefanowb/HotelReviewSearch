Easy access but away from the hustle, bustle and hassle of the Strip. Restaurants are varied and good to exceptional. Entertainment options range from gaming and top music acts (though a bit too youth oriented for my taste) to movies and bowling. The pool area is beautiful and easy to enjoy even if you don't go in the water, and the spa is top notch in both appearance and sdervices. Casino is well laid out and easy to get around -- and it's also much more attractively decorated than most, with the design elements mirroring the natural Red Rock surroundings. Finally, the rooms are beautifully appointed, spacious and exceedingly comfortable, with a great bath. Put in a microwave and a full refrigerator instead of the mini-bar and I could happily live in one of them forever!

I wanted him to experience Las Vegas but not the strip everynight so I chose the Red Rock Resort based on reviews on this website and a visit to their website. The resort is about 20 minutes from the strip so I rented a car so we could get around. I am pretty sure that the resort offers a shuttle but we never used it. Our room was immaculate and comfortable. Our beds felt like heaven! The bathroom was gorgeous and large. The bathroom had a TV in it which was great as my son often slept in and I could get ready and watch the Royal Wedding at the same time. Everyone at the resort was friendly and accommodating. The restaurants were bountiful. They offered an amazing array of cuisine and price points. My favorite place was The Cafe - great food and service and a beautiful atmosphere. The Red Rock bowling lanes were impressive and we had a great time bowling. The movie theatre was beautiful and clean. There was so many lounges to choose from around the pool I had trouble deciding where to sit! The water in the pool was too cold - I am not sure if it is ever heated - we are from the Northeast and unfortunately are used to pools being heated. Sat out in the sunshine nevertheless and enjoyed lunch outside. The concierge was extremely helpful. My son and I took Pink Jeep Tours to the Grand Canyon and to the Hoover Dam. Be sure to ask for a guide name \"Chris\" - he was a true gentleman and a wonderful guide. Went to the strip several nights - saw \"O\" and \"Las Vegas, the Show!\". We had a great time! Went into most of the hotels there - the Mirage, Bellagio, New York New York, Venetian etc. - all were noisy and extremely large - the influx of people was overwelming.
