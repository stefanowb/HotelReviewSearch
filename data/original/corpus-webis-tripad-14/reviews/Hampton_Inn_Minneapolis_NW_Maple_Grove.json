The room was perfect no complaints what so ever, the location was also very good.

The desk manager (David I believe) when we checked out seemed to have an attitude, we had to leave at 3:30 am, it took a few loud \"excuse me\"'s to get his attention, when I told him we're checking out he said he was doing an audit and couldn't get in the system to give me an invoice, I said \"could you at least tell me the total?\", he replied in a louder tone \"I'm up s**t creek without a paddle\" \"Get my drift?\", I very calmly said \"yes\".

We called the front desk to let them know that there was a lot of personal things left by someone - and they immediately gave us another room while they tried to figure out what had happened! When checking in, I overheard another couple arguing that they had reservations - but no name on the list. The front desk was kind and even though it was discovered that they had made reservations for a wrong location of the Hampton Inn, they accomodated them somehow. I thought the front desk gal was so personable and hard-working. She kept stacks of fresh towels in the crowded pool area - very nice - and coffee hot and fresh.
