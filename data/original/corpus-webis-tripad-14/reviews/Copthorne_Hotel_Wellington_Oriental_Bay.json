The location is perfect for a Wellington visit - easy to walk all attractions and on a less-congested section of the harbor front. The hotel is well-appointed, comfortable and attractive. We stayed in the front section and had a fantastic balcony view of the harbor - a bit of traffic noise, but not bothersome. The room was a generous size, with tasteful dark wood decor and a large bathroom. The staff was super helpful with tips and directions. I really enjoyed morning walks, turning right out the font door and strolling the harbor front towards Mount Victoria. Also, this hotel has the fastest elevator I've ever experienced - a nice perk when you're tired after a day of much walking.", "user": "KSchmidt", "date": "March 15, 2013", "id": 154608087}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Location", "text": "We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in Wellington at the Copthorne. The staff were all outstanding and the front desk/concierage did everything they could to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. The International Sevens Rugby festival certainly made for an exciting time in Weliington. Our room, on Oriental Bay, was perfect in every respect. The buffet breakfast was very good.

This property did not disappoint. We got the Kid n All package booked directly to friendly responsive Receptionist.We were on the second floor looking out onto harbour. Fully functional bathroom separated a King size bed and twin beds which was perfect . Room was perfect had everything we needed and was quiet which is a big thing for me. Pool was perfect for children as the weather was insanely hot, a tad tired could do with some more seating for adults and a paint but otherwise children did not care and was very refreshing and good depth for children (6 & 7) and adults. As part of package children ate free so had a fabulous buffet breakfast both mornings. Did not have a evening meal there. The children got free mocktails and have to say their Mojito was one of the best i have had. Fabulous location Oriental parade on your door step with a quick easy stroll to Te papa and Courtney place really lovely walk along waterfront to Lambton quay / shops & bars. All staff we tentative, engaging & friendly nothing a problem.
