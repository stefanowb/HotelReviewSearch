We were there during a busy holiday weekend -- I believe the entire property was booked -- and yet everything ran as smooth as silk. Our room was as quiet as could be -- we were on the top (5th) floor in the back; that might have helped. Room was spotless and very comfortable. Large, flat-screen TV, fridge in the closet. Good-sized room (King bed, desk and couch). Breakfast that came with the room was better than most -- scrambled eggs and some kind of breakfast meat both days we were there plus a waffle maker and all the regular stuff -- cold and hot cereal, hard-boiled egss, fruit, various breads, yogurt, fruit juices, coffee, etc. Hotel is located in a cluster of hotels right off the 163 freeway, in a mixed-use area. There was what looked like a condo complex next door and miscellaneous businesses down the street. If you're looking for a hotel with restaurants and shops within walking distance, this isn't it. But for travelers with cars, it's great -- only about 15 minutes to downtown San Diego -- including the zoo and Balboa Park -- or a little bit longer to get to Mission Bay. We thought it was a great location.

This must be one of Hampton Inn's newer hotels. The toilet is water-efficient and the towels feel fresh, but there is no microwave. Also, the a/c was rather loud. At first it felt drab, then I realized it is because of the dark green carpet. The breakfast area is small but I never saw it fill to capacity, so I guess they knew before hand the amount of traffic that come and go. The only issue in there is it was a bit dark in some of the table if you want to read the morning papers, supplied everyday.
