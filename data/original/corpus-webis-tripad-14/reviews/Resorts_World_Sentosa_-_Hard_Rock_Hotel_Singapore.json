The worst problem is the smell, which is really bad in some areas. My room had a very damp smell, combined with cleaning agents. I know it was not just my room as I wnet to a colleagues room and it had the same problem but not so bad. Some of the public areas are similar. Other problems - the aircon control doesn't seem to work. It blew very cold air whatever the temperature setting. In the end the room got so cold that I had to turn it off and by the morning it was about right. The sound proofing between rooms is not good and I could hear the television and other noises next door. The bed and pillows are not very comfortable. The hot water ran out straight after my shower at about 8.30 and afterwards was only lukewarm. The waste water makes a lot of noise as if one of the traps isn't working properly - perhaps this is the source of the smell. There is a desk area for working but no chair! The furnishings are trendy and nice, but beginning to look tatty and worn already. The lighting system is unfathonable. I could go on, but that gives the picture.", "title": "Avoid", "user": "MyReview186361", "date": "July 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 134623292}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with family", "text": "There are some good points.
