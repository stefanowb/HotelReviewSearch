I don't have any complaints about this hotel. The service was good, we stayed at the Grand Oasis so that was a big plus for all the options it covered. The only thing is that the lobby is so hot you would have to go to the VIP lounge to cool off but other than that everything is great. We got and ocean front room in the pyramid it was very nice. There are 17 restaurants to choose from and a wide variety of food. The food was excellent. For an all inclusive hotel the food, service and landscape is awesome. The beach is wonderful there was always plenty of chairs available and was always kept clean. The hotel is very clean, the staff are very helpful and try their best to please you. The hotel is situated very close to all the attractions and very close to the airport. We plan on returning back to this hotel next summer. We had an awesome vacation in Cancun!!!

The complex is rather big, and we were a bit daunted at first, but you soon get used to it. I must admit, at first, I was a little perplexed as to the difference between staying (and paying more) and the Grand Oasis than just the Oasis Cancun. The difference is actually quite considerable upon staying there. As a Grand Oasis resident you get full access to every bar and every restaurant, whilst also free room service (i was led to believe) and also we were allowed into the foam party for free (i think it was 390pesos otherwise.) Simply put - the restaurants alone make it worthwhile. Whereas Oasis Cancun residents have an extra surcharge on the specialist residents, of $20 per head, these were all free. The Tapas restaurant was beautiful, and never busy, with service which was on the whole immaculate. There were around 14 different dishes to try, all of which were brought out as you progressed, and the house red was very nice.", "title": "Totally underrated, I loved it.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Lil404", "date": "July 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 135648380}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Room Air Conditioning was broke upon check-in - no legitimate attempt to fix by maintainence no concern by hotel.
