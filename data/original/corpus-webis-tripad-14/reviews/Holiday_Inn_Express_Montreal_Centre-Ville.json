I'm actually writing this review in support of them and their efforts to fix what is wrong behind the scenes. Checked in very late on Thursday for a 4 night stay. Night manager was wonderful and changed my room when I discovered they had given me a smoking room. Friday, cleaning staff did a lovely job however, I had no cleaning either Sat or Sun even after I told the front desk on Sat no cleaning so imagine my surprise when I didn't get any cleaning the next day as well. Good thing i brought my own toiletries. Perhaps staff are reporting \" do not disturb\" when no such door hanger was posted? Just a thought. Again front desk tried to help me and did give a 15 dollar credit per night ( is that all cleaning is worth ...
