Our first week was at ther Sheraton Waikiki and it was old, crowded, uncomfortable, expensive, central but not relaxing. We wished we had booked at the Modern for our entire stay. The location is perfect, just a short 10min beachfront walk to the hub of Waikiki, just a 5 min walk to Ala Moana, overlooking the sea, Marina and pools - simply dreamy. The Modern Honolulu stands up to everything of it's name. The rooms are spacious, totally renovated, quiet and 'modern'. The pools are divine, and you can always find a pool lounge without paying extra (not like the Sheraton). The food is beautiful, good quality produce, australian standard / size and all comes from chef Morimoto's kitchen (aka iron chef). It's stunningly simple and beautiful, not crowded, classy, great value, quiet, convenient, spacious and most importantly relaxing. The perfect honeymoon destination.
