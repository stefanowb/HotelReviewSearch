The hotel is very homey with traditional Asian decor. It appears old but I feel like it only adds to its charm. It is located pretty close to the pub street/night market where most of the tourists go at night. If it weren't for the heat and dusty roads, I think this would have been a 10 min walk at the most. Or a $2 tuktuk ride. The biggest strength of this hotel is its staff. Being Asian, I am used to and have come to expect good hospitality wherever I go, but the hotel staff just exceeded expectations. Every time we walked in the lobby, we were greeted by our first names, complete with iced tea and cold towels. They also have a pool onsite which can get crowded at the end of the day when everyone comes back from visiting the temples and it can be difficult finding seats. There is a restaurant that serves both western and Khmer meals. The breakfast buffet is very limited, granted that it is free. But all in all, I think this was a great find with excellent value for money.
