The staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. We are especially thankful for Armando, Braulio, Carlos and Delfina, because they always knew our name, and remembered what we liked to have at the breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet was delicious with a variety of choices and good value for money. When we looked at previous reviews, some had said that the construction work was very noisy but we never found this to be the case. We would also recommend that you ask at kids club about the turtles hatching because when we visited we were lucky enough to help release the turtles into the sea. The beach was beautiful and a relaxing experience and the massages in the beach hut were the best we've ever had. The sea was rough at times but still very warm. Not only that, but the pool was very clean and never got busy. There were 2 hot tubs which were big and lovely to relax in. There's hammocks on site and rabbits in the kids club and you should definitely join in when they feed the iguanas which is at 11am on most days. unfortunately the weather turned and the 'rina' hurricane was estimated to hit us at full speed, but eventually died down into a small tropical storm. The rooms were beautiful and plenty of space, all balconies had a stunning view and great for photos. The bed was huge and the pillows were the best ones i've slept on. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant one time, we weren't very impressed as it was expensive and wasn't that great; But there were so many other options to eat at it didn't even matter and we would recommend - la madonna, la habichuela, la elefanta and thai (which were next to each other and had tables by the lagoon and ask the waiters to see the crocodiles that live in the lagoon). There we had tasty meals and good service and were all within walking distance as there were many restaurants in the shopping mall and lots with a 5 minute walk to. There were plenty of shops to go to on rainy days. There is also a small shop at the lower floor with limited stock but most essential items which was handy.", "title": "Stunning resort, would love to visit again!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "molly r", "date": "November 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120342483}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We would love to go back and experience more of Mexico and the friendly people.", "title": "Just got home from a great holiday in Cancun Mexico", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "cindy w", "date": "November 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120252650}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We just got home after staying a week at the Westin.

If you plan to eat a lot it is well worth the cost, which includes bottomless mimosas. Wide array of fruits, pastries, breads, eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes, omelette station and the list goes on!!! A little disappointing that espresso or bottled water is not included. The food I ate for lunch and dinner was also good and not too pricey, but the menu is limited. There are many pools and hot tubs and beautiful fountains. There is a magnificent infinity pool overlooking the ocean, with a swim-up bar. There are lots of lounge chairs and umbrellas around the pools and many waiters taking orders. There is a kiddie pool and a slide too. Very family oriented with lots of activities.
