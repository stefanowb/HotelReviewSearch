After three delightful weeks in Paris we were ready for the Provencial countryside. The warm welcome we received from Caroline LeComte was representative of our entire stay. We were given beautiful rooms and delicious breakfasts. Attention when we needed it and space when we did not. The Inn is small enough that we felt like we were living in Provence with the added benefit of meeting some other people and benefiting from their travel experiences. The location is spacious, relaxed and beautiful. The Clos is recently and lovingly renovated. It is a visual pleasure and the pool is delightful. I only learned after I arrived of Caroline\u2019s quilt and fabric arts passion. She has a notable collection of antique American quilts and fabrics which are magnificently displayed in the \u201cchapel.\u201d The Inn is close to the major roads so travel is easily accessible, and Caroline keeps a well stocked library of maps and information. She is a wonderful resource for everything from the best place to eat to the shortest route to the Marseilles airport. One week was barely enough time to see all the wonders of Provence and as I imagine returning I can not think of staying anywhere else.", "title": "Perfect Conclusion to a Month in France", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "france2008", "date": "August 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19499509, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 relaxed, quiet, spacious, comfortable,"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I learned about Le Clos des Freres Gris through Trip Advisor and my husband and I decided to book a stay there for a three-night trip to Provence.

Caroline, who owns and runs the inn with her husband, is a perfect hostess, offering lots of information and hospitality to guests. The breakfasts are fresh and delicious and the jams that Caroline makes to accompany the meal are the best I've had. I would without hesitation recommend Le Clos to anyone traveling to Provence!

I can't say enough good things about the stay...everything was great, from the beautiful rooms and circa 1789 building (lovingly restored) to the warm and gracious hosts and her incredible breakfasts! Fresh breads and croissants with the most amazing home made preserves and jams, fresh eggs with herbs from her impressive gardens, an array of cereals, fresh fruits and juices. All with an assortment of teas and great coffees. The grounds are filled with beautiful flowers and trees, the aforementioned gardens, a large swimming pool and a great bocce ball (petanque in France, I think) court. There is a very relaxing common area downstairs, with an amazing collection of travel information, menus and brochures from the area. Their recommendations for restaurants were excellent, as were their directions and parking advise. We had gorgeous weather while there and spent a good deal of time outside reading, and playing guitar, enjoying the wonderful smells of all the flowers and herbs. Just a quick drive into town, the TGV station or Marseilles airport. We had an extra day at the end of our trip, nearly three weeks later, and were lucky enough to be able to stop back by on our way home for one more night at Le Clos des Freres Gris.

Clos des Freres Gris is a B & B offering delicious and varied home-made breakfasts served in the clear Provencal light of a sunny courtyard or in the cosy sitting room. Drinks are available at all times and there is a swimming pool in the tree-studded garden for those wishing just to relax. A passionate advocate for the surrounding countryside, Carolyn can recommend a wide array of places to visit and photograph, either as day-trips or for a lazy lunch. The city has many bars and restaurants and a large underground carpark avoids the need to search for a space in the streets. Aix is an ideal base for exploring the Bouches du Rhone and the glorious Luberon and Vaucluse areas.

The bathrooms were well equipped with fluffy towels, robes and toiletries from L'Occitane, and large, rainfall shower heads.
