What a fantastic place (clean, serene, and nice!!!). My wife and I were exploring the NW and the SanJuan Islands fell on our list and she found Wildwood on Trip Advisor. Michael makes superb breakfasts (even asks if you have any food allergies). He also makes great cookies and had Reese's peanut butter cups available. The rooms are perfect; beds great; views to \"die for\"; and a hammock outside that called to me (my wife saw the deer almost kissing me as I was asleep). If you had to model a B&B after anyplace.....this would be it. The sad thing is that John only spends one week a month there (works in San Francisco), which makes Michael having to run this by himself. I can't imagine him having more time on his hands. Also ask him where to eat and what to do....he gives good advice.", "title": "I'd buy it right now, if it was for sale...........", "user": "barrycher", "date": "May 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 16257517, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The beds, linens and towels", "disliked": "\u2014 No internet unless you have your own laptop"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I booked 3 nights at this wonderful retreat for my boyfriend's 30th Birthday from 5/2-5/5 2008.
