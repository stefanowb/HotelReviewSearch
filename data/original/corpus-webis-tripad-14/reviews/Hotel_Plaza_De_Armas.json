There are a lot of souvenir stores, the house were the pina colada was born (Barrachina) was around the block. There are a lot of restaurants close by. We went to Jibaritos, a puerto rican restaurant, located about six blocks from there. Continental breakfast was included so that was very convenient for us. The elevator from the hotel is more than 100 years old!!!

The people at the lobby were very friendly and polite. There are no phones on the rooms but since we all had our cell phones we didn't care. The rooms had no windows but that did not bother any of us. The rooms were clean, and we felt safe all the time. If you would like to be close to the beach then this is not the hotel you need.

The Plaza is a great spot for people watching, meeting locals, and getting some coffee. The big problem with Old San Juan for me was that there aren't very many street signs on the buildings at intersections, so often times you really don't have a clue what street you're on. After driving in and out of Old San Juan though, you start to figure it out (it's not that big an area). This is an old colonial building converted in to a hotel. That means most of the rooms don't have windows because the houses had windows in the front and back to allow air to pass through the house and cool it down. Side rooms didn't have windows. I guess the door were just left open. If you want a room with a view, don't stay here. If you want a large room, this isn't the place to stay. If you want someplace to rest your head at night, this will do just fine. The air conditioner in my room sounded like, well, an air conditioner. If you're used to very high end central air conditioning that makes nary a sound, I suppose you might find it noisy. If you're used to the sound a window air conditioner makes (white noise), you'll be perplexed by the negative comments left by others about the sound the AC makes. The continental breakfast offered is decent, and should be taken advantage of (pastries, cereal, fruit, toast, juice, coffee). The staff is friendly and helpful, and made sure we knew which parking garage had the best rates (thank goodness! There was a big difference!). The elevator did break down one day while I was there, and it's slow, but it's not like it takes 10 minutes to get between floors. This is hardly unusual at a hotel in a building that was built before elevators were even invented (stay at any old converted hotel in Paris, and this elevator will seem like heaven by comparison). The staff gladly helped my travel companion with her bag the day the elevator was broken. I would describe the hotel decor in the lobby and lounge area as \"Pottery Barn.\" And I rather liked the tile work in the lobby. If I were to stay in Old San Juan again, I would definitely stay here. Compared to the prices of other hotels, this was definitely the best deal I found.

There's nothing glamorous about this place, but it is clean and it's a great price. The free breakfast was more like a hostel breakfast, so unless you're really on a budget, I'd venture out and eat something a little more local in flavor. As for parking, there are several paid lots that seem far away but are actually right on the free trolley line. However, I didn't have to use them -- I had great luck both nights finding street parking between 5-7PM -- after the working people left for the day and before the diners and party-ers came in for the clubs and stuff.
