My Experience there was delightful, pleasant and relaxing. My trip to Saratoga Spring was unexpected and I had no knowledge of the area so I had to depend on the staff for directions, restaurants and as well as sights to see and things to do. The staff there was very knowledgeable of the area and very helpful in all aspects of my stay. The location of the hotel could not have been any better. Being on Broadway gave me the ability to park my car on Saturday and not have to move it again until we left on Monday morning. Everything was within walking distance. Relaxing on the front porch and watching the town go about its business was the most relaxing part of the whole weekend. I would highly recommend the Saratoga Arms hotel to anyone staying in Saratoga Springs. Great place. Good people and accommodations were better that most major hotel chains (Sheraton\u2019s, Radisson\u2019s, Hyatt\u2019s, etc). The ambiance of the place only added to its character and made the stay that much more enjoyable. If you are planning to stay in Saratoga Springs, The Saratoga Arms is well worth it. Both my wife and I plan on staying there again when we get another chance to go back there. .", "title": "Perfect place to stay in Saratoga Springs", "user": "joesmor", "date": "October 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10057979, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Every last detail of our stay was perfect, from the immaculate room and surroundings to the delicious breakfasts!

Our room was spacious and well-appointed, and the beds were very, very comfortable. We had asked for a room in the back hoping that that it would be quiet, and quiet it was! The breakfast they served us was a REAL breakfast -- eggs and potatoes made-to-order and a buffet of other goodies. I'm a very picky eater, and I can tell you, it was delicious! They also have muffins and coffee available at the front for a snack when you need it. I loved having coffee out on the front porch and watching the passers-by.
