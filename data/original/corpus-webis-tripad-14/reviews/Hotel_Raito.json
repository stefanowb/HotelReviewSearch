Have stayed before in Amalfi however, this town is about 20 minutes away from the crowds which is what we wanted. Spotless hotel on beautiful scenic location overlooking Salerno and Vietri. You Must book a water view room! The hotel is small and intimate with the most wonderful friendly staff..we loved everyone here! In fact we extended out stay. From your balcony we see all the Bay activity and hear church bells and music from the Music Center in the hills....opera, jazz, fabulous!! Hotel offers service locally and drivers are easy to get..ask for Franco to drive you...the hotel knows him or use hotel service for local area. All the food is great in Italy but we loved La Fattoria (up the hills)..a family owned restaurant....we are Italian cooks and loved the food!...", "title": "Amalfi Coast-Spotless Hotel!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Libby G", "date": "August 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8374374, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything!", "disliked": "\u2014 At end of coast but close by car to everything, minutes to ferry to all destinations in area!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "travelling with 5 people the prices were great too...ask for the local wine of course!", "title": "Lovely!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "LondonRocket", "date": "August 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8272521, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Very luxurious and well appointed", "disliked": "\u2014 The restaurant food and ambience"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Try the spa while you are there too...the works for E125!", "title": "A great Honeymoon hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Emyr23", "date": "July 12, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8108158, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The views and tranquility", "disliked": "\u2014 A cab ride from other local restauraunts"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We moved to the Raito after two nights in a very disappointing hotel further along the coast in Praiano.", "title": "Beautifully presented with fantastic views", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "A.McMurray", "date": "October 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5921936, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean beautifully presented with incredible views", "disliked": "\u2014 The hotel was not quite complete"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Definetly not a 5 star hotel.
