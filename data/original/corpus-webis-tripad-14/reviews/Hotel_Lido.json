I thoroughly reviewed all the hotels I stayed at in Europe on TripAdvisor and all were excellent except for this one. The location is good enough; Geneva is a small town, easily walkable and this hotel is near the train station and you can walk to the other side of the city in about 5-10 minutes. Geneva is relatively clean and feels safe so I didn't have any concerns with the neighborhood, although I saw cuter areas as I walked throughout the city. The receptionists were helpful and spoke English well. However, the hotel rooms are very rundown and feel pretty dirty. They are small with tiny bathrooms with old fixtures. My room did have a cable TV w/ remote. I had a small twin bed. The hotel did offer a continental breakfast which was stale and not appealing at all. I paid about $127 and think this is WAY too much to pay for such a rundown hotel room.", "title": "Really run-down hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "lolomojo", "date": "May 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 7721595, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Geneva is a small town so the hotel is within walking distance to most sights", "disliked": "\u2014 The rooms were small and rundown."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good for the money", "text": "The hotel is centrally located.
