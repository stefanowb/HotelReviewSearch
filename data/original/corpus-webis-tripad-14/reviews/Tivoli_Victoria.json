My partner and I stayed here for one week at the start of June, absolutely loved this hotel! The room itself was lovely- maid service twice a day. Breakfast was also excellent- huge variety/selection including salmon and champange if you wished! The hotel facilities we could not fault- with use of the spa facilities for free. The pool side had waiter service from the bar, the most comfy sun loungers- which were free and we never had any difficulty getting a lounger. The shuttle bus is another excellent free service to and from the marina- just be there early to ensure u get on the bus as it is a small bus however the driver does come back for this who could not get on the first time! We took a day trip to Loule through a company based at the marina side- the coach picked us up from the hotel and we then had the morning to explore this lovely little village and both the gypsy and local food markets - well worth 12 euros for us both!!", "title": "Amazing Hotel", "user": "Elise85_12", "date": "June 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 133026654}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The marina has so many lovely bars/resturants- we were only sorry we never had enough time to go to them all!", "title": "Classy & Relaxed", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "thecrock02", "date": "June 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 132514936}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We visited the Marina tivoli for drinks- this is also a lovely hotel- however we preferred the victoria as it was newer- with better sunloungers!!", "title": "Lives up to 5*", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "1116joanne", "date": "June 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 131678230}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We would go back to Tivoli Victoria and have recommended it to our family/friends!!", "title": "Family stayed at Residence apartments", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "RYHY88", "date": "June 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 131651624}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I stayed at The Tivoli Victoria for 3 nights recently while in the area for business.", "title": "Fabulous 10 Days", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "404SarahM404", "date": "May 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 130997874}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "very dissapointing", "text": "This is modern hotel with a lovely pool area with very comfortable sun beds. The rooms themselves are clean and attractive and up to expectations, although I agree about the comments on the Pillows, they smell awful. Beware coming here in August as there is an outdoor night club that goes on till 4 and sometimes 6 in the morning and the base permeates your room. Make sure you get a room as far away as possible. Food by the pool is very mediocre as was the buffet I don't know what room service is like as we ordered breakfast for 06.30 - 07.00 and it did not arrive. Little things let this hotel down badly, for example we ordered a litre bottle of water by the pool and asked if we could have an ice bucket to keep it cool. I laughed when I was informed they only had 2 ice buckets and needed them for wine ( I don't know what they do if they sell more than 2 bottles! Bottom line is that with a bit of attention to detail it would be very easy to bring this Hotel up to 5 star standard and I can only assume the fault lies with the management.", "user": "AL777", "date": "August 15, 2011", "id": 116754129}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "The hotel was lovely.", "text": "The hotel was lovely.

The hotel is a little in the middle of no where but the hotels shuttle bus service was (on the whole) reliable and took you to the Marina within 10 minutes. The hotel pool was wonderful. The loungers were topped with a wonderful mattress like material which meant you could lie there all day.
