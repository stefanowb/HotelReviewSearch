In 2010 it has been completely renewed, including rooms - looks and feels much better than it was before. I would say it is almost ideal - good rooms, friendly staff, however two things disappointed me: now you have to order a breakfast instead of having a buffet - and this takes time, especially in the morning rush hour when hotel is completely booked and a lot of people come on business to a specific hour. The good thing with it - now there is a lobby bar that works in the evening. Same concern relates to the internet connection - it is free, but when there are a lot of people using it, it turns out to be really slow, Skype can hardly work.
