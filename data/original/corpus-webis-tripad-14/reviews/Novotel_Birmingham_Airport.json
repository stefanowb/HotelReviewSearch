Would have preferred the Metropole but it was full. Room was OK, but not worth the money. I have stayed all over the world in hundreds of hotels and it's fair to say that I do notice the little things. This is what I would consider to be a highly priced 'no-frills'. OK, you get drink-making facilities in the room...with the cheapest biscuits imaginable; you get broadband.....if you don't mind paying \u00a320 for 24 hours' worth, when it should in my opinion be free; you get to park close by......if you're OK with paying \u00a320 a day; but worst of all is the service. Begrudging, unfriendly, can't-do attitude. I wanted a little bit of fresh milk (can't stand the UHT milk/cream they leave you in the room), and asked downstairs. The flustered receptionist made a phone call (why?) and then told me someone could arrange to bring some up for a \u00a33 room charge! - In spite of me being stood there. So instead, I asked a nicer person in the restaurant just next to reception, who of course gave me a small jug of milk: no charge. On check-out, the woman didn't even look at me. She barked something incomprehensible at me, which on repetition turned out to be, 'Did you use the mini-bar?'. After hearing my 'No', she just pushed my bill at me: not what you expect for \u00a3175 a night! So, if you've got spare money, or if you're spending someone else's, and don't mind a bunch of staff who seem to think they're there just to get money off you and to ensure that you don't make any demands on them, this is the place for you.", "title": "Got money to burn?
