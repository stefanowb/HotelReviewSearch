We chose this Hampton Inn due to a late flight arrival to Ft. Lauderdale and wanted to get to our bed asap. Our flight to Ft. Lauderdale (4 hours) was delayed 3 hours due to weather so we arrived at 2 am. The shuttle service to the hotel was spot on and arrived within 10-15 minutes and the driver was nice enough not to chatter non stop as we were exhausted after being in an airport or on an airplane for that past 10 hours. I can't honestly say I remember much about the room as we had to be up and ready to leave the hotel the next morning by 9 am but the bed was divine as always. Quiet room. The only small hiccup we saw was that the breakfast seating area was so crowded even at 7 am that we had to wait in several lines then take the food back to our room as there was standing room only. Food was decent as always. I would stay here again due to proximity to airport but probably not my choice as a tourist staying more than a single night.", "title": "Above average but not quite very good.", "user": "sherihm", "date": "October 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 180401550}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel was very clean as were the rooms.
