I think there are probably better deals to be had in Pisa, but be careful as Pisa is a little seedier than other Tuscan cities. Breakfast was not served in the hotel. Rather, we had to walk about 10 mins over to their sister hotel (the five star hotel in town) to have breakfast, which was still free. Nice to eat breakfast in a five star hotel, but some of the staff at this hotel were uppity and rude and I would have rather have just been able to eat in our hotel as we were leaving immediately after breakfast and had our luggage with us .", "title": "Relais Dei Fiori", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SungeiSarawak", "date": "September 18, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 80096523}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you choose not to stay at this fairly posh 12 bedroom B&B situated less than 10 minutes walk from the Leaning Tower, don\u2019t do so only because it has limited reception hours from 2pm to 9pm.

But remember, Relais dei Fiori is \u201conly\u201d a B&B and it does have a big sister hotel Relais Dell Orologico less than 5 minutes suitcase pull away, which can be called on 24 hours a day if necessary. Do like we did. We got off our early morning flight, headed straight to the Orologico by way of a 10 minute \u20ac10 taxi ride from the airport, dumped our bags with the lady in reception, (who also organised our Fiori check in), and we got on with our day. After collecting our bags mid afternoon when Fiori reception was open we got into our room and freshened up before heading out again.

These are described as standard, deluxe & executive. We booked an executive room through Expedia when it was advertising a \u201croom sale\u201d and were very happy with what we got. When we asked at check in if it would be possible to have a room at the back we were told that the executive rooms (we assume there are 3) all face the road to the front, Via Carducci. Fiori is in a terraced building that is just 4 windows wide. Our very Italian chintzy bedroom was about 14 foot square with 2 large windows and our bathroom was about 9 by 6 with its own window \u2013 so it seems the executive rooms are lucky enough to each have 3 of the available 4 windows facing the front! The double bed is actually 2 singles pushed together making it over 6 foot wide. The satellite flatscreen TV appears to have hundreds of channels from all over the globe but only BBC World News in English. The safe in the room is free, as are a couple of bottles of water in the fridge. The marble bathroom was nicely appointed with a small Jacuzzi bath and a shower over the bath with a glass shower screen (which could have been fitted better to stop water leakage). There also appeared to be a leak from the plug hole end of the bath which we reported by email after we got home. Housekeeping was otherwise immaculate and we even got clean towels AND sheets every day.
