We could see the Eiffel Tower from the two (2) small balconies (along with the nightly light show \u2013 a trip highlight), along with the Tuileries Gardens, Louvre, Orsay, Invalides, and a ton of Paris. No kidding \u2013 this is the best view I\u2019ve ever had in a hotel. In fact, it was overwhelming. Even my 8 year old son had to appreciate the fantastic view. The hotel was quiet, and the room was nice enough. The room was not luxurious, and neither was the hotel lobby or restaurant. There are small areas of disrepair (the steps look awful), and housekeeping was hit or miss. For instance, despite requests, a lightbulb was not replaced during our entire visit. However, the room was clean. Like most of Paris, there is no A/C, but we did not need it in March with the windows open in the afternoon. At night, the radiator heat was great, along with the towel warmer in the bathroom. The marble bathroom was fantastic and huge. The hotel is centrally located, and within walking distance of two (2) metro stops. Because of its location, not much is open late at night, but you can easily get around town from the hotel. Desk staff was nice, but uninformed and unable to provide really good advice. They were willing, though, to happily run into the street to hail us a cab in the pouring rain. Even with recent renovations, this is an old-ish hotel. However, its quiet, clean, and not expensive. I cannot emphasize this enough: whatever shortcomings this hotel has are grossly overwhelmed by the stunning views of the city. I would definitely stay here again.", "user": "PNMLAW", "date": "April 7, 2007", "id": 7290476}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent view", "text": "The views and location is what sold us on this hotel. I read the reviews and as you can see from what people are saying this hotel is a nice place to stay. We booked from the web site with a price of just over $200 a night. We had the view of all the major attractions in Paris, Louvre, Jardin de Tuileries, Arch de Triomphe and the Tour Eiffel. The hotel is only one block from the Metro station, easy for getting around. The one concern that comes with the view is the noise. R. de Rivoli is a very busy street, with the weather being perfect I thought that we could sleep with the balcony doors open. That did not last long, cars going by all night. The room does have air condition but it didn't get cool enough. Not a deal breaker but some concern. The bathroom had a tub and seperate shower. A flat screen tv. The staff was helpful, we only know a little Frech. The front desk clerk told us of a nice resturant nearby L' Imperial, they spoke English. For the area and the price this was a great place to stay. One block down there is another hotel that charges over $500 a night. For what you get at this hotel, we made the right choice by staying here.", "user": "Travelguyvt", "date": "March 26, 2007", "id": 7226550}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Room, Bath, Location and Views as promised", "text": "Our party had rooms 312 looking out on the \"view\" and room 102 on the \"courtyard\". Both rooms were junior suites. They were huge by any measure. Double sink baths were extremely nice with separate tub and shower and toilet in different closet. (In 312, the toilet was separate location from rest of bath) Great water pressure in the shower and nice large soaking tub, which can feel great after a long day of walking. The location was superb! The views just as you see on this site from candid photos. The couryard view was just looking out over the tops of some buildings below, but we really were not there that often, so it didn't matter for that room. They have two elevators - one tiny and one very suitable size. Only have two minor complaints: one is that there was no clock in the room, and the other is that the desk staff was not friendly or helpful to us. Unfortunately, Bernard, (who others have mentioned here and who was very helpful in my email communications prior to arrival) was on holiday during our stay. Despite my attempts at being very friendly and trying my best with my limited french, I was disappointed at how unhelpful they were. When we arrived, one of the rooms was not made up for the third person. I called down and the guy brought up sheets, but we had to make the bed ourselves. He explained that he was alone at the desk during that time. We also asked the location of the nearest bank and they couldn't tell us. Maybe we just caught them at an off time. I could certainly recommend this hotel for all the other positives as stated.", "user": "More-trips", "date": "March 20, 2007", "id": 7194152}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great location!", "text": "This is a fabulous location for an excellent price. It is a simple hotel, but the rooms are large and the views are wonderful. We could see the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Tuilleries Garden, and the Crystal Palace from our window. The only negative is that there is very limited room service, but there are so many wonderful bakeries and cafes within a couple of blocks that that's not a problem. If you need coffee or tea in your room, just be sure to take a little hot pot and tea bags or coffee bags with you. Also, don't trust the front desk to give you correct information. They told us that Versailles closed at 7:00, and gave us wrong directions to the train station. After an hour of walking and riding the train, we arrived at 4:00 to find out that it actually closed at 5:30, and there was a 45 minute wait to enter.
