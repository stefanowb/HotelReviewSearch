Service was absolutely amazing - probably best I've ever seen anywhere (although I have not stayed at the Burj Al Arab). Brunch was spectacular, food extremely good. Next door water park was actually a very nice addition and allowed you to feel that you could move from one part of the hotel to a completely different experience (I went 1/2 the days I was there). Balcony views were fantastic (definitely worth the additional money in my mind). Hotel room decor was definitely a bit tacky though and the only place the service wasn't top notch was the front desk for issues related to bill payments or resolving small fee questions/disputes. For instance, if I remember correctly, at one point I wanted to upgrade a room and the front desk didn't seem willing to give me the price I could get from their own website upstairs in the business center or which had been available online the day before. Sure, they had a right to do this, but it's not typical of what one expects from a top notch American hotel, for instance (where they seem more gracious about small financial issues when they are looking at your overall experience). The matter was resolved to my satisfaction after speaking with a manager, but I did see others having some discussions with the front desk about billing issues (e.g., meals) - completely at odds with everything else about this hotel. Don't get me wrong - if I was in Dubai again, I would absolutely come here again and I felt that the overall experience was fantastic. I guess my caution above is more along the lines of \"don't get bent out of shape if you have a small issue like this, it happens, they aren't perfect in this category yet\" (and pls note my five star rating!). Outstanding gym and exercise facilities. Surprisingly, good Italian food too! Beach was very nice with excellent view, but perhaps since I'm not European, I don't love the idea of boats floating around anywhere near the swimming area (although it didn't seem to affect the cleanliness of the water, which was my concern!).", "title": "Amazing!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "leannezdiab", "date": "June 25, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 114732064}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I loved the Jumeria Beach hotel! especially for the beach!
