Rooms good size and clean. Had a problem with DVD player and safe but this was fixed within a day. Disappointed by both restaurants. Considering that this is 5 star, the food could have been better and it is not cheap! All the staff are fabulous, especially Sammy who arranges all the flowers about the hotel. He is so happy and talented and cheered me up every day. The new general manager is very switched on and is improving things daily. My biggest concern with the whole hotel is safety for children.. I watched as two children of about 12 and 9 were climbing aroung the turetted pool with open sides 4 floors up!! When this was mentioned to the staff, they quickly informed the parents, but did mention it had been a problem before. The ground floor private pools have no security if you are in your apartment. They fall directly off the edge of the terrace with no protection or any way of putting any in. There is no nightlife at all and most people seem to eat in their apartments, which are very comfortable with huge satelite TVs and good facilities. They need a shop on site for basic goods as the trip to Emerald City supermarket is a pain. If you take the hotel bus, you could be there for ages. Take the bus there and the number of taxi company to come back. The food is also expensive surprisingly. This hotel is all about the fabulous beach which is breathtaking.. After getting used to 300 steps each way, you appreciate the cool breeze -it can get extremely hot by the pool.", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "lfisgd746", "date": "March 5, 2006", "id": 4584538}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pretty and peaceful", "text": "When we arrived at The Crane in Sep 05, we pulled up to an average looking place.

There was soap scum remnants on the shower door other than that the room was very clean. The plunge pool was ICE cold with no heater. Our ocean view over looked the construction site where they were expanding the hotel and a sliver of ocean. The air conditioner was out in almost all of the buildings.

Just walking around the property is gorgeous, with amazing landscaping and small wildlife everywhere (frogs, koi, anoles, birds, snails etc). The pools (there are at least 5 or 6, plus a tremendous hot tub) are beautiful. The beach, and the views of the beach and ocean from the cliffs is amazing. The entire resort functions as a sort of gated community with a guard booth at the entrance which lends an exclusive feel to the grounds. Upon arrival they park your car for you and arrange for your bags to be brought to your room, provide you with a complimentary rum punch and start your check in with a guided walk to your room. On to the cons.... many of the past reviews we had read mentioned the rather aloof staff.... we ended up finding this to be spot on. Several times when we called the front desk with an issue (such as waiting for our bags to arrive at our room for 1 1/2 hours ) and got no answer at the front desk, finally giving up we walked down to the desk where we were told they were on their way.... another 1/2 hour later they arrived. The poor guy was covered in sweat and clearly delivering all the bags by himself which makes the delay understandable however the front desk not answering the phone and having to walk down there only to find the front desk staffed by three people who all appeared to be capable of answering a phone was annoying. By no means am I implying that the staff was anything but very nice when we spoke to them (including any staff we passed on the walkways and other parts of the hotel) but aloof was definitely the best way to describe them. On to our room.... the decor was quite nice and if everything worked correctly it would have been a lovely room. However, the a/c while quite loud, did very little to actually cool the room, the shower leaked out onto the bathroom floor so much that we constantly had to have several towels on the floor to soak it up, and the floor bolts on the patio doors required a lot of manipulation to engage as the doors were pretty warped. Overall the room really seemed rather run down. The restaurants may all have been quite nice but having only dined at one (The Carriage House) I can't comment on the the other three other than that the menu was rather expensive and all required reservations for all meals. Our meal at the carriage house was average at best with nothing about the food being worth the cost. Unfortunately with only high end restaurants on premise if you don't want to have to make reservations for breakfast then you are left with going off premise for breakfast or picking up food to cook in your room (this was the option we chose and I will say that having a kitchen in the room was very convenient).

It took 3 days to get these items. The staff was always very friendly except at lunch on thursday the dining staff were all non-emotional, not rude, just not too pleasant to be around. Construction was definately visible, but was never really an issue for us. We knew in advance about the construction. I think if we would have had a cooler room it would have been great. I guess these problems are common with time-share properties. The beach was beautiful! The pool was nice but the water was very COLD!

A charming young man saw us to our room which was in the historic old building. The lounge, bedroom and bathroom were large with very high ceilings and natural airconditioning (open the widows, close the shutters and you get a continual breeze through the room) . There was also a ceiling fan in the lounge and bedroom. We also had a small kitchen area. The rugs in the lounge and bedroom were soaking wet and took two days to dry out. One of the window shutters was broken and could not be closed. After a week and two requests to have it repaired a bodged job was done, but unfortunately the securing bar was two inches too wide and on checking out two weeks later the problem had still not been resolved.
