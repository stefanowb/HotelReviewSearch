I really liked it alot. The room was surprisingly large with a little patio area outside. The bed was pretty firm, but that seemed to be the norm in Italy. Everything felt very nice - sheets, towels, etc. The higher floors seemed to have nicer rooms. The breakfast was ok, nothing special but they had coffee and juice and some pastries, fruit, cereal and whatnot. The front desk staff was super helpful and gave fantastic restaurant recommendations and made reservations for us. (I suggest Baroncelli or Osvaldo for dinner). The location is awesome, barely a block from Ponte Vecchio and right on the waterway. We walked to everything within 10 minutes. The only complaint I would have is one morning we were running late and I asked to grab a croissant or something to go really quickly and the restaurant staff made it seem like I was a crazy person. After about 5 minutes of trying to explain I'd like to take a pastry in a napkin, I just said forget it and left. Other than that, we had a great stay. Oh - and they give you 2 free drinks at the bar o the 5th floor when you arrive. The outdoor area of the bar has a beautiful view of the Duomo. A perfect way to start off an evening!
