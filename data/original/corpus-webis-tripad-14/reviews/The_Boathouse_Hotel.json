Out of all the hotels I\u2019ve stayed in, this is one of the best for Holyhead. The room I had was a good sized double of average cleanliness, not as clean as my ship. The TV is the smallest I\u2019ve ever seen; it\u2019s so small it\u2019s funny. I used the man\u2019s ruler to measurer it, it\u2019s just over six inches wide. The bathroom is one the largest I\u2019ve ever seen in Holyhead, for those who have never been to Holyhead before it is the land of small bathrooms. The major defect of the room is the tea boat. What no biscuits!! The tea bags are also the individual sort, you know the ones taken out of a larger box with no protective cover, so by the time you use them they are all dried out. One of the major plus points are the staff, all the staff I came in contact with were very helpful. The lovely lady that serves breakfast would also be great as the local tourist guide.

However, we visited the hotel one Sunday afternoon when visiting Holyhead and saw a banner on the side of the hotel for Sunday Roast. There were four adults and we all ordered a Full Sunday Roast, two ordered Turkey, one ordered Pork and one Beef. The meals came out of the kitchen within three minutes of us ordering. The meat was dry, the vegetables were bland and tasted of nothing and the most disgusting part was the roast potatoes that literally disintegrated into a pool of oil when cut into. The attitude of the waitress when I pointed out to her that the Pork I ordered was Turkey was 'It must be Pork if that is what you ordered'. It was Turkey. I have read other reviews on this site and it appears that everything about this hotel is Hit and Miss. Our visit to this hotel on the Sunday that the Holyhead RNLI had their open day was definetly a MISS.

The bathroom was pretty basic, no bath, just a shower, but perfectly good enough for what we needed. All the staff we met were friendly and welcoming. We ate dinner there, but struggled to find a vegetarian option, so in that sense the food was a little old-fashioned. If you are looking for a glamorous hotel, don't stay here.
