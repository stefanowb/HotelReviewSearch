Sorry, Dan and Nancy! We loved staying here. Dan cooks enormous delicious breakfasts - Different and tasty each morning. Nancy is very warm and helpful. They both helped us with things to do and places to go. There are many fine restaurants within walking distance. It's nice to be out of the hustle and bustle of Asheville and relax at \"home.\" The room is very comfortable. The bed was great - I slept very well.

We wanted to stay two nights but the first room was only available one night, so we needed to move to a second room which gave us the opportunity to check out the first and the second floor of the main building. Both rooms were comfortable. The fireplace in the Lee Room is perfect for chilly nights and mornings. The Monroe Room was bright and had a good view. The breakfasts were wonderful and hearty, which was important given we had a full day of activities both days. Dan and Nancy were fantastic hosts and the guests were very friendly. Just a note of caution, as you pull into the driveway, be careful to stay to the right so as not to scrap the curb on the left!
