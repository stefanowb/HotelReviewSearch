Sure, it is convenient in the Mountain Village and the beds are quite comfortable but it is like a cave. It is one of the darkest hotels in a ski location that we have ever experienced. Does not take advantage of the Colorado sunshine. Most of the staff is very nice but on the whole, they are trying to get this hotel up to speed so a big company will buy it from the Swedish Bank. We found a disconnect between the facility and where it should be in terms of its potential as a luxury hotel in such a resort as Telluride. Pretty much, the hotel is over its head at this point in its hotel life. Wait until it is bought out by a big management chain so they can work out the kinks in the most professional manner.
