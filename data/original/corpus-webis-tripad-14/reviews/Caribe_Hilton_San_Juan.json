The room and bathroom were clean, the AC worked great, the bed was very comfy, and we experienced no bad odors at all. We went to Old San Juan for dinner which was great but I cannot really comment on the quality/price of food at the hotel itself (I would highly recommend Buru though for great tapas in old san juan) The grounds were perfect. We quite enjoyed laying on a hammock on the beach late at night listening to the ocean while drinking mojitos! On Saturday we got up early and grabed coffee and a bite to eat at Starbucks which was in the lobby and then spent the morning on the beach which again was clean and perfect for getting some sun and having fun in the ocean.

I got a very reasonably priced room with balcony looking over the private beach area and sea. The room itself was excellent, very clean, spacious and the bed was amazingly comfy. My wife and I stayed here when we came back from a cruise and the hotel delivered exactly what we were looking for which was a chill out couple of days before we returned back to Scotland. The hotels facilities are sensational, with a choice of relazing on its own private beach area (protected from the sea if its rough by a rock breaker) or by any one of three pool areas complete with pool bar and hot tubs. The staff were all very friendly and would go out of their way to help. We went to bio bay organised by the tours team who delivered a great trip for us. I like to try and give a balanced view but am struggling to come up with negatives - if i must and they are small points - there is no milk in the rooms just powdered cream which turns a black coffee into a very dark brown coffee (there is however a starbucks on site) and the hotel is a fair walk away from any of the bars and restaurants in Old San Juan. This isnt really a problem though as only a very short taxi ride away. If you are looking for a hotel before and after a cruise i would do what we did and maybe stay somewhere with OSJ on your doorstep (we stayed in Sheraton OSJ) and then Caribe Hilton after cruise for a continuation of the excellent service and relaxation after the cruise.

First the good news -- 7 great restaurants, nice lobby and pools, a small beach behind a breakwall, so no waves and little kids can play in the ocean, very comfortable and clean standard rooms. The biggest problem with the Caribe Hilton is location. Getting around in San Juan is a huge headache and costly. The Hilton is neither in Old San Juan nor in Condado. It's in the middle, and there's nothing there but the Hilton and the Normandie hotel. It's a 30 minute walk (hot sun) to Condado and 45 minutes to Old San Juan. Tried to rent a bike ($7 an hour and a hassle). Tried to rent a scooter for all 5 days, but only option was $60 a day for 9 am to 6 pm (yes must be returned every evening!). Renting a Harley was $150 a day (but at least you could keep it for the whole stay)! Taxis won't use meters and gouge tourists $10-$20 no matter how close you go (that's $20-$40 if you return). Buses (fare: 25 cents)? Both times I tried the bus: stood at bus stops minimum of 45 minutes (including in front of Hilton). Forget it. So conceirge desk pushed renting a car ($30 a day -- bring your proof of insurance from home or you'll have to add $10 a day). Hilton adds $15 a night to park your car. But why get a car? There's not really anyplace to park in Condado and Old San Juan anyway, so having a car is a hassle not a help unless you're going outside San Juan entirely. And the traffic jams up incredibly in Old San Juan and Condado. So here's what I did: took a taxi to Walmart ($20), bought a simple, fully assembled bicycle and lock ($60), and used it for 5 days (total cost $16/day including taxi to Walmart). Then I gave it away to a stunned kid on my last day (with a note to his mom assuring her it was not stolen). Biking to Condado took 8 minutes; to Old San Juan 12 minutes. Nothing worse than getting to a place and not being able to get around at a reasonable cost.

Family friendly. Clean grounds and hotel rooms. Friendly staff. Beautiful pool / beach area with hammocks too. Food is your average raised price menu (I suggest visiting Old San Juan for traditional dishes at better cost). Quick taxi to OSJ ($12) or Condado, you can also walk the distance.
