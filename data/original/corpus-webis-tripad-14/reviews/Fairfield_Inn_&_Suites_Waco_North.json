From walking into the lobby, you could tell that the hotel was relatively new. It still had the smell and everything looked new and shinny. The lobby staff were young and not professional though. One girl seemed not to know what she was doing (maybe she is new also). Our room was very clean and well decorated. Although the pillows looked dwarfed on the bed. My husband had to ask for another one. The amenities are great:big tv, DVD, FREE INTERNET!, iron, fridg, microwave, coffee maker, hairdryer, ect. My daughter loved the alarm clock because it played CD's and she woke up with her favorite song playing. The free continental breakfast was better than your run of the mill but my husband complained that the danish was hard. You can make your own waffles from scratch! I would stay away from the coffee though. Tasted stale to me. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again. I think what we paid was a bit too much but I am a cheap person and if I would have booked earlier probably could have got it cheaper.", "title": "Nice middle class hotel.", "user": "keely92", "date": "November 8, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4093851}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great hotel", "text": "I stayed for a week at the Fairfield Inn & Suites North in Waco and was very pleased.

We needed a place to accomodate 6 people and Waco was the closest vacancy. This hotel was GREAT! It was very clean. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms have everything you could possibly need on a vacation. There are 2 media centers that include CD/DVD/STEREO and a large T.V.. The microwave and mini-fridge were a plus too. I will recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to or through Waco. We loved it!

When we checked out we left the room keys in the room and left the hotel. My credit card was billed for four nights instead of the two that we stayed there. When I contacted the hotel the GM was unwilling to refund our money being that it was \"Our word against their's.\" Unfortunately our credit card company feels there is no proof either way. The Hotel has great rooms and a very poor staff. We are very unsatisfied with this Property...Cody", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 14, 2004", "id": 2571259}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Very nice, clean hotel, non-smoking, very friendly staff.

It's also walking distance (one hotel away) from the Cracker Barrell (great home cooking). That was a perk! The room and the bathroom was extremely clean. The shower was large with a big shower head (enjoyable). We liked the indoor pool because I didn't have to worry about sunscreen or sunburns with my 2 1/2 year old.
