Overall, the hotel is really classy with a refined and beautiful decoration -marvellous Christmas ones, in particular-. My room, although nicely furnished and cosy, was particularly small, and my bed was not comfortable. Also, it was a bit noisy due to the nearby train station. Fortunately, the bathroom was brand new, very well equipped, extremely clean. Had made it clear when booking that I wanted a non-smoking room. However, it seems that they missed the point and I got a smoking one upon arrival. So I asked for a change. This process, though, took a long time. The first room I was given had almost no window -unacceptable for such a long stay- so I had to wait until the next one, fairly small as already mentioned. Not very professional for a 5-star-or-so hotel. Also, breakfast is served until 10am only, which is a bit early during week-end. And they really stop @ 10am sharp. Finally, the price of 3150JPY to access the pool is just nonsense - increadibly expensive, indeed.
