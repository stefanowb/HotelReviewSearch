There are dirt spots on all the furniture. Material is actually coming out of the sofa in the room. This hotel is much more akin to a travel lodge or a Ramada Inn. It is not what you think of when Hyatt comes to mind. Unless of course the Hyatt brand has become diluted from selling their name to other companies. When we booked an executive suite we expected something separating the bedroom from the sitting area. Not in this case, it is all one area. I actually felt like crying when after trying to dicuss this with the manager on duty (who was not at all helpful) that this was not what we had in mind or was represented to us. When I showed him all the spots on the furniture, feathers seeping out of the sofa and just plain old ickyness everywhere he said \"that's all we have available\". He moved us to another room after my husband had an allergy attack from the feathers. The next room also had dirt spots and stains all over everything. He basically said \"take it or leave it\". We were stuck since it was a busy Friday night in Wine Country. My husband and I dreaded spending anytime in our room. I will never stay at another Hyatt unless I thoroughly have a verification that it is a decent place. As for this hotel I would say \"buyer beware\".
