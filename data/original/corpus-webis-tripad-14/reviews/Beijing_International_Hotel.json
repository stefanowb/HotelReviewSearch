Hope you packed an iron....to get you suits \"pressed\" is a pretty good fee as they mysterously have no irons in the rooms. There is no door hangar to keep housekeeping out (also mysteriously missing) so your guarenteed to have someone in your room everyday (something to consider if you are on official business). Beds are ancient but useable (I've seen worse). I guess one needs to remember that you are in China and not set your lodging expectations too high.

As it was part of an organised tour and completely pre-paid, we had no idea what to expect. Having stayed in other Asian cities we thought it would be convenient and clean at best, cramped and with limited facilities at worst. We were very pleasantly surprised - Yes, it was convenient and clean, but it was also spacious and had great facilities. The service was efficient and polite, language only a minor barrier, most staff speaking quite good English. Bedding was comfortable, bathrooms clean and adequate with all the shampoo,etc you might need. Hairdryer also. Bottled water was supplied daily as the tap water is undrinkable. Also supplied was tea, coffee and whitener, as well as a kettle so that you can have that all important cuppa at the start and end of the day! The restaurants were good, coffee overpriced as it is all over BeiJing. Breakfast buffet includes all anyone could ever desire, no matter what part of the world you're from.

It was the hotel our tour company booked and it was evident that a lot of tour companies use this hotel.

The staff are friendly, the rooms are immaculate and the breakfast that was included with our room was very good, with a mixture of Chinese and Western cuisine. They have a business centre (20 RMB for 10 minutes on the internet), fitness centre, and spa (massage was wonderful). The hotel shops on the second floor were very expensive but the supermarket on the lobby level for pop, snacks, etc. was reasonable. Within walking distance to Forbidden City and a 16 RMB cab ride to the Pearl Market. A great place to stay if you have the $ and like a more upscale hotel.
