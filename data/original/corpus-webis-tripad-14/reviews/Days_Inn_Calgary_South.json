The room itself was very good -- newly renovated, duvets on the beds, and an in-room computer with free Internet. The air conditioning functioned well but was very noisy so bring your earplugs. The hotel itself is in need of a major update / cleaning. The elevator is filthy and run-down, and so are the lobby and the guest laundry. Free breakfast is provided each morning in a common area, and the offerings are very good -- waffles, toast, cereal, fruit, muffins, juice. There is a pool and hot tub but no changing area or restrooms in the pool area. Parking is adequate. There is no restaurant on site (a pity). Overall, not a bad place to stay -- close to the Zoo, shopping centres, downtown Calgary.", "title": "Nice, new room; hotel itself needs major updating / cleaning", "user": "WBinBC", "date": "July 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8252910, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 In-room computer and duvets on the bed.", "disliked": "\u2014 Dirty and run-down elevator and lobby."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were in Calgary for the Stampede and this hotel is within walking distance (20mins) or you can take the train from two blocks away.

As in turned out the room was clean, hotel staff were friendly, good with kids, gave a gift bag to our kids, housed our bikes for us, gave us coupons for breakfast and helped us with our tent trailer parking needs. I got the feeling they would do anything for us and that was special. Another surprise was the breakfast - when they say continental, you think cold cereal and old muffins but I found my kids down there making there own beautiful waffles and the spread of food was great!!!
