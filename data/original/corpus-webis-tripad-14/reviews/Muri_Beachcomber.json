The accommodation we stayed in was pretty basic (wooden hut in grounds near to beach), although I do understand that some more upmarket accommodation was available. Don't expect luxury otherwise. The staff at reception were very pleasant. For us though the main negative about the place was the number of cockroaches infesting our hut, despite our best attempts to keep them down with insecticide sprays. When we mentioned this to the staff on departure I got the impression that this was a known problem, but they proceeded to make light of it with comments such as \"oh, they fly in from elsewhere at this time of the year\".
