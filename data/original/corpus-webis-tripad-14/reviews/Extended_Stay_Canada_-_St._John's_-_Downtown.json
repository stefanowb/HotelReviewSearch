The basement does have a little musty smell, but not bad. The room was spotless - you could have eaten off the toilet seat! Two beds, one double, one queen (lots of pillows and very comfortable), kitchenette with all the amenities you could want. What was most impressive was the modern colors and the lovely art work! The front desk staff were fabulous and check-in was a breeze. There was a continental breakfast in the morning (coffee, tea, cereal, toast, cinnamon buns, etc.).

The amount of noise in our room was unbelievable and made getting a good night's sleep impossible. All night, every night, we could hear people (staff? other guests?) walking and pacing above us, complete with a creaky floorboard. Several times we were startled awake by sudden loud noises (items being dropped on the floor above us?). To add to this, the door to the hallway was too thin and sounds from other guests moving about easily entered our room.", "title": "Only if you don't want to sleep", "user": "Gregory W", "date": "August 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 173353716}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The last straw was the toilet - it dripped constantly, and the tank refilled (loudly) at least three times an hour.

The beds were excellent and I slept better than I had in a LONG time. The rooms were spotless; the A/C was cold; the location was walking distance to what you need; and the staff was amazing. Regarding the staff- a very valuable bag of mine was left in a taxi, and I was frantic about losing it. The staff very calmly called around to all the taxi companies, found out who had it, and the driver brought it back. Tragedy averted. The staff here is friendly and knowledgeable and they made the whole trip a lot better than I had expected. I would definitely stay here again.
