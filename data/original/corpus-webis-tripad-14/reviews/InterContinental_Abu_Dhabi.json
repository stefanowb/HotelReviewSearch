It was a pleasure to use the large gym and the kids enjoyed the squash courts and swimming pool. The white sandy beach is just a walk across the marina. The sea water is warm, clean and idyllic. The food at the Selections restaurant was of outstanding quality and variety. The restaurant staff were attentive to our needs.

The lobby is classy; the rooms well furnished for all your needs; the restaurants serve attractive,varied food; the facilities from health club to pool to beach (fantastic upgrade on the way) are ideal; and the levels of service are extremely high.

The hotel is undergoing extensive changes to the beach and harbour areas but they in no way intrude onto the ability to enjoy the wonderful white sandy beach and pristine waters of the sea. beach towels were plentiful and ice cold bottles of water always available. The hotel is an older style building but with a prime location for the sea, shops and views. our room was always magnificently clean with daily fruit dishes, newspapers, toiletries, chocolates etc. The house keeping was outstanding and the bed and pillows to die for. Selections restaurant was where we ate most meals with a vast array of foods for every taste all perfectly presented. What makes this hotel so magnificent is the staff from the top echelons to the lower levels, all working as a team and genuinely attentive and caring. We were staying for seven days and made ourselves decide to return next year for two weeks hopefully in may. In every respect Abu dhabi is far more relaxed than its neighbour Dubai, and Ramadan had little effect on our holiday with even the truly magnificent grand mosque open for all to see and be guided around. Even during the fasting times meals were discreetly available to non-moslems.
