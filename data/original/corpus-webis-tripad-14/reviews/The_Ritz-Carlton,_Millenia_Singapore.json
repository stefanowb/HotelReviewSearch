I asked how long i would have to wait until the room i book became free and was told i that it was only a request and they don't guarantee room types, but for a king room i would have to wait until 1pm. Then i was offered an upgrade for $100.00, when i agreed she then said that i would have to wait 1 hour for that (what a joke). I said forget it and went for a walk around Singapore for a few hours. when i returned they had a room ready for me and said they had upgraded me for free. The room was great very large with a lounge room, bedroom, very large bathroom with walk in robe and toilet, it had two plasma TV's and a bose cd player. I ordered room service and apart from it being quite expensive the food was really nice. The room had great views out over Singapore harbor and the bathroom has a view out over the Singapore big wheel (London eye thing).
