We stayed for 3 nights and that was the perfect amount of time to devote to Zermatt's incredible sights. The hotel is a 15-20 minute walk from the main village and sits on a lovely meadow with a spectacular view of the Matterhorn. The location could not be better! We had a nice double room with a balcony view of the Matterhorn that was simply breathtaking. The Italian family that run the hotel are wonderful people who are always there to help. The restaurant serves up mouth-watering steaks, fish and pasta. Try the Roasted Perch Filets or the Argentian Steak. Wonderful food!! Ask for Dimitri to be your waiter. He is super nice and speaks english quite well. With a an on-site restaurant that was so good, there was no need to walk down the hill to the main village for dinner. The hotel is also very close to the Klein Matterhorn lift. The hotel will pick you up at the main train station and take you up to their spectacular location.
