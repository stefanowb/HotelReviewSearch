When I checked into my room there was a pair of used hosiery in one of the vanity drawers (yuck) and the closet was full of the previous guest's shopping bags. I apparently only warranted one washcloth per day and although they were more than happy to take the used bathroom towels they didn't want to leave clean ones to replace them. The housekeeper could only occassionally be bothered to empty the garbage in the kitchenette. The food on the complimentary breakfast was marginal at best. I'm not quite sure how someone ruins oatmeal, but they managed to do it. To top everything off they discharged my hotel keys more than once (I kept them in completely separate places so that if one demagnetized I'd still have one that worked so I know it was them and not me).", "title": "Poor housekeeping and service", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Suzannechitown", "date": "March 10, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3263909}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect", "text": "We were very lucky to get a last minute (due to hurricane evacuation) reservation at this lovely property.
