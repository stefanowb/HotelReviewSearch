Hospitality room was fantastic, offering male& female bathroom with shower (exactly the same as offered in rooms); we used this to freshen up having checked out early for a late onward evening flight. Best part of the hotel is the POOL which was great for a budget property. It was of a good size, intimate and comfortable to use, not overcrowded. Our 2yr old loved it! No baby pool but was not a problem. We absolutely loved the pool and would return on this basis alone.

Room service did not come until, some days, after 5:00 in the evening. This became somewhat of a problem when we would come back to the room to make dinner, and the maid still hadn't been there. But what threw this hotel over the edge were the rats. Food was missing from the room the entire week and finally one night, while watching tv, we saw why. There were two large holes in the wall behind the tv cabinet and the rats came out while we were still awake to look for more food.

She checked the computer and amazingly enough, there was a room availible. Imagine that. It's not a problem about paying more, it just the fact that first we weren't told about the extra cost when we booked and then the front desk told us a room wasn't availble when there was at an extra cost. We had to wait 30 min for a room, so we went to the breakfast. Which was very dissapointing. It consisted of bagel chunks, small powdered donuts and fruit juice.
