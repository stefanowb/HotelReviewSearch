After friendly check in I went to my room and was stunned by firstly the luxury in general, then the abundant technical gadgets in the room, the stylish bathroom and rest of the room, but ultimately when opening the curtains and viewing the inside of the hotel from my balcony. The view is a huge indoor arena with a lagoon and tropical garden in the centre with various lounges and live orchestra. There is nothing that reminds you that Bombay is just outside. I have never seen something similar. As it was late and I was tired from a long haul flight, I nevertheless tried to sleep and would suggest ear-plugs as the entertainment although not exaggerated still is perceivable through the closed balcony door. On the balcony by the way it is permitted to smoke what I appreciated. After few hours of sleep I took breakfast at the cafe. Good quality, note also the amazing aquarium there. A day later I had dinner at the Indian restaurant, and it was absolutely excellent (took Aloo Gobi, chicken, lamb, lentils). What was positive: the room was fully equipped with everything I appreciate including coffee maker, complimentary mineral water, ironing board, large flat screen TV with BBC World and CNN, slippers, etc. but it takes about one hour to get acquainted with all the gadgets, by the way all worked. Laundry service very efficient, my washing picked up within few minutes and returned on time well done. The newspaper Times of India delivered early morning. Positive is also a smokers lounge (Diwine) just at the ground floor caf\u00e9. What I missed at the hotel was any reference to India and/or the local Bombay culture, except the Indian restaurant and of course the personnel that was friendly and helpful without exception. As my time was limited, I couldn't visit all of the hotel (e.g. business centre, swimming pool, shops, etc.) , so maybe next time. Forgot to mention free of charge! pick up at airport with large name board at arrival and water offered in car. Also transfer back to airport on time and also free of charge, remember to be at airport at least two hours before departure due to extremely long queues. To conclude, I can recommend this hotel to everyone who appreciates full service, modern infrastructure and friendly staff.", "title": "Bombay Inside Out", "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "September 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 140354205}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel takes you by surprise by the mere grandeur of space.
