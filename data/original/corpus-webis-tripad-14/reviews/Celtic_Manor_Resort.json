Lovely venue, great forum spa, loved the pool area(helped that quiet so had the freedom to swim at leisure), sauna and steam room good. Yet on reflection a few niggles: jacuzzi not working, were told we had to fully change back into our clothes to take our afternoon tea, yet on arrival in club lounge other guests still relaxing in their robes and slippers which we would have preferred to do! On arrival at club lounge we found it to be locked so had to hover till a member of the team appeared. No atmosphere in lounge, a little back ground music would have gone along way! A delay on the service of the sandwiches. Not quite the right balance between savoury and sweet. When scones came they were cold and dry and we had to ask for cutlery to cut. Long wait for prosecco too. Service in lounge was a little soulless!

We arrived early to use the spa facilities. We used the pool, Jacuzzi and sauna together but there is also separate Jacuzzi, plunge pool, sauna and steam room in the male and female changing rooms. My husband said it was a shame that none of the showers or the plunge pool in the male changing rooms were working at the time. We had lunch in the Forum spa caf\u00e9 which I was enjoying until I spotted a live caterpillar in my side salad. The manager was brilliant and couldn\u2019t apologise enough and gave us a full refund and replacement food but still not what you expect from a 5* resort. When we checked into our room we received a lovely note and some Belgium chocolates from the hotel for our anniversary which I thought was a lovely touch and unexpected. The room was very nice although we paid extra for a room upgrade with king-size bed but was actually 2 (large) beds zipped together which we thought was a bit odd. Stayed at the CM before in a regular room and didn\u2019t see a vast amount of difference for the price. The best thing about our stay was the amazing meal at the Terry M restaurant. The waiters were very attentive and the food the best we have eating for a long time. Breakfast buffet was also lovely so much food to choose from.
