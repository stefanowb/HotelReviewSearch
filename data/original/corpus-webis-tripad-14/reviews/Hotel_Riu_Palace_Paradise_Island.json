We went on a business trip and stayed at the Cove for the first 4 nights, so the Riu was a huge downgrade! In short, this hotel needs a major facelift. The food is good and most of the people working at the hotel are nice. They all accept tips and we try to be generous. The location is great because it's next door to Atlantis and you can walk over to the Casino, Marina Village, etc. If you want, you can buy a day pass for Atlantis and make use of the water park and their facilities. The beach is also beautiful and big and you are a short ride from town. It is a better location than Cable Beach. The buffet food was good, especially breakfast and lunch- they always had a variety and we are not picky eaters. The drinks are so-so/we're not big drinkers. BUT - the biggest problem are the rooms which really need to be renovated - old carpeting, old toilets, old bathtubs and faucets, pretty disgusting. Our second room (the first one was facing the noisy compressors), had a rusty tub which was covered with an old rubber mat - nasty, eh? The corridors stink because the carpeting is old and some doors do not even close properly. The elevators are a disaster and need to be renovated. It is not a five star and I can't wait for them to renovate it in 2009! The entertainment is not that great, either, but we spent most of our evenings at Atlantis, either in the Marina Village where they have live bands all the time and Junkanoo on Friday and Saturday, or in the bars inside the Casino. If you don't mind the rooms, I am sure you will be fine. We love the Bahamians, and we find them very knowledgeable and friendly. My suggestion is, if you want to go to the Bahamas, stay at either the Atlantis or go the Comfort suites across the road and you get full access to the Atlantis facilities. Otherwise, you can stay on Cable beach, but there is not much to do.", "title": "It's not a five star...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CocaToronto_Ontario", "date": "February 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 13712999}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We just got back last week from RIU and after reading some of the other reviews on here I wanted to write my own. All in all, your getting a really good deal for your money. The all inclusive deal really works and it worked great for us. Check in was a walk in the park. No problems. The wait in line for the reservations for the speciality restaurants were not that bad. Tip: Get in line about 5:50pm, the line is almost empty by then and the wait will be just a few minutes. The rooms were average. Some of the rooms do have great views. The room comes with a mini refrig stocked with soda beer and avove the refrig is some hard liquor (If your a drinker, this is the place for you). The buffet is good. I enjoyed the desert part the best. Lots of good sweet treats. The breakfast buffet is good as well (the pancakes are on the crunchy side). The bar by the poolside and in the lobby is easy to access and you can have all the drinks you want. Getting on the beach and finding the beach chair is very simple. The staff is friendly and easy to deal with. To sum things up, if your looking for a good deal at a great price this is the place for you. Come with a good appetite and be prepared to put on a few pounds. If your looking for something more elegant and fancy and have the money to throw away, then the Atlantis across the street would be your place. Also, many things to do and keep busy while your there. We did the Robinson Crusoe tour which takes you to a remote island (rose island), it was fun but it got a bit boring. We also did the casino, which was fun, but its mostly primed for heavy betters (min tables are $15 and most of the tables are at least $25 ones.

The specialty restaurants were horrible,.. when you could book for the next evening. The daily lunch room is a bad cafeteria...complete with cardboard burgers and lots of greasy food. Our room was without towels twice, and although the 3rd floor is labelled as a non-smoking floor - our airconditioner pumped in smokey air everytime it cycled. The stuffing was falling out of the beds - which are ripped open from old age. The carpets are ripped, the pink wallpaper is from days gone by... and the furniture should be given away. The tub was rusted about 1 inch from the floor along the whole length and the complimentary shampoo and products were cheap paper vouchers.

We were somewhat disappointed in the appearance of the hotel. It definitely needs a overall facelift, which I understand they plan on doing in 2009. The rooms were OK - definitely need to be updated. Housekeeping kept them clean. Our mini bar in the room which was supposed to be restocked every other day was stocked only once all week. This was our \"first\" all inclusive experience so, we weren't sure what to expect. Surprisingly, the drinks were not weak. The buffet food was average but, we soon tired of the same selections every day. Guess we're not used to the all -inclusive concept and having to eat only at your hotel. Think we prefer venturing out of the resort to sample local restuarants for dinner. They did have 3 specialty restuarants in which you had to make dinner reservations the day before and only between 5-6 pm. We found that to be a hassle having to make plans the day before and then having to remember to go get on a line in the lobby between 5-6pm. You had 2 dinner seating times to chose from 6:30 or 8:30pm. (Much like a cruise ship) Not sure if that's how all of the \"all inclusives\" resorts tend to be. We enjoyed the atmosphere in the restuarants. Despite the fact you only had a very limited menu ( 3 main course selections) it was a nice change of pace from the buffets. The Bahamas Steak house and the Japanese restuarant were our favorites. They had nightly entertainment in the lounge that was enjoyable. We love to be on the beach or by the pool (self proclaimed \"sun worshipers\") Unfortunately, the way the building is situated, the pool area doesn't see any sun until late morning and starts to shade by 4 pm. As a result of a lack of sun, the water was cold. On the beach you must calculate where to lay so the building doesn't block your sunlight. We did not realize the vendors had full access to the beach so, you were constantly bombarded by people wanting to braid your hair, sell you stuff and rent you jet skiis immediately after reaching the bottom steps of the resort onto the beach. We understand, after vacationing in places like Mexico, that's how alot of countries are but, we find it to be horribly annoying. We vacation twice a year in Aruba and this does not occur there. We took a taxi to the shopping area (where the cruise ships dock) and found it to be somewhat shabby. We were stopped and begged for $$ quite often.
