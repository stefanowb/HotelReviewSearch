First off, it kind of under delivered given we arrived thinking it was five star - can't remember now if it does really say it is or if we just picked up that impression along the way. Anyway, it isn't. Four star yes as is v nice but it lacks the style and options of a five star. The room was pleasant and roomy, no wow factor but with a smart bathroom. Service was really friendly and helpful. Reception were lovely when my husband wanted some cream and plasters for a minor injury and the restaurant staff were crazy busy but very pleasant. I was disappointed to see just one beer and one red and one white wine were on offer as included in the deal for those who want wine or beer. I didn't much like any of them (husband happy though - I am a little fussier!) and expected a couple of options. As a veggie I ate similar meals for each lunch and dinner. A week would have been tedious for me but the quality of the food was at the top of our expectations, lovely fresh salads, fab soft bread, nice cheese and husband found most of the meat to be good. The pool area got quite busy and it wasn't high season but that said we did get loungers ok each day. Was a bit disappointed at so many children at what I thought was an adults only pool. Basically, wouldn't go back but would recommend for people that like an all inclusive break - it was v nice and is in a beautiful spot - many of the rooms (even our one at the cheap end of the spectrum) have sea views and the pool area looks out to sea and is a beautiful vista.", "title": "Nice, just not really for us", "user": "AlYorks", "date": "August 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136201805}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "On arrival we were given an upgrade to a suite as one was available.
