The Staff were excellent and nothing we required was too much trouble for them, they made us very welcome. The rooms were very clean and beds very comfortable. The light breakfast in the breakfast room is a lovely way to start the day but do look out for the cooked egg options at about 4 Euro extra as we missed the little sign on the buffet table.
