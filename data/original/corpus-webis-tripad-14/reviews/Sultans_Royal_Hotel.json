This foreshadowed just how much care was taken for us our entire stay. The staff at the hotel are like none other I have come across. In most hotels, people are cordial and helpful... but here, they consider it THEIR responsibility to point you to the best places, deals, and experiences. Each person working the desk has their own personal taste and recommendations, all which were quite impressive. The location of the hotel is a 5-7 minute walk to Blue Mosque, where all the action begins. LEARN TO TAKE THE TRAM SYSTEM, AVOID TAXI CABS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. If you are from out of town, it is very difficult to follow the city on a map while being driven around and it is easy to be taken advantage of. If you take a taxi to the hotel and are suspicious about the rate, ask the front desk to come check on it. Remember: The fare should be cheap.
