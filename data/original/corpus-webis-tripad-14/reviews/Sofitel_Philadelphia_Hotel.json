Each year we choose a different city and always stay in a Sofitel where possible. The Philadelphia location was the 5th Sofitel we have stayed at, and this recent visit has confirmed to us that there really is no other hotel chain that compares. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty by every staff member that we had the pleasure of meeting. Check-in was extremely efficient and our room was absolutely perfect, with the ultra comfortable beds that the Sofitel brand is famous for, and a sparkling clean bathrooms with separate tub and glass shower. Housekeeping did a fantastic job each day, not only of cleaning the room but also providing a wonderful turn-down service each evening. The black-out curtains shut out all the light, allowing us to sleep a little late each morning in the fluffy beds. Concierge was very knowledgeable and we enjoyed several apple martinis in the hotel bar while watching the people pass by outside. The location was great, just a short block from the shops and restaurants of Walnut Street and Rittenhouse Row. We had great pizza and pasta at Pietro's just around the corner and there were several choices for breakfast. Most of the city's attractions were within walking distance of the hotel, including the Museum of Art and Independence Hall. The only time we needed a car was to visit the Barnes Foundation, but that will be moving to the Museum District within a couple of years. All in all, it was a trip that I am sure we will be remembering fondly for many years to come and we hope to go back again soon.

I was told that I had to check back in the morning despite the fact that the hotel was not sold out that night. So I called the morning of my departure as soon as I woke up and was told that the manager wasnt available and asked to call back 45 minutes. This didnt help me because I needed to be at my conference in 45 minutes . I called the hotel on my cellphone as I was leaving the hotel to get the late checkout even though I wasn't packed. Fortunately I was able to get the late checkout at 8am. I have never experienced this before. Also, they charge $9.95 a day for internet. My colleagues that were staying at the Crowne Plaza got internet for free and I would have considered the Sofitel above the Crowne Plaza.

We were happy enough really but mentioned this in passing to the receptionist who really failed to see our point and in fact looked at us as if we were slight mad! She said all the 2 bed rooms have that size bed. We then asked for details of the location of the Sofitel in NYC; again the request was met by a less than enthusiastic response along the lines of we don't really have much to do with them but I suppose we could find out the address if it's really important....we said please don't trouble yourself! Anyway unlike the previous reviewer we did use the restaurant both for dinner and breakfast and although not that cheap we were very happy on each occasion. In the evenings a waiter called Kyle could not have been more friendly and attentive and the same applied to Paul, our waiter in the mornings. The manager also introduced himself, was quite charming, chatted for a while and was genuinely interested in our feedback. So all in all very happy until the last night (a Friday) when the club mentioned in the previous review kicked in with thumping music which also kept us awake until almost dawn. I believe it's called The Raven and is at the back of the hotel. When I reported this to reception I got a very off-hand comment that it's outside their control. They said that they get numerous complaints and when the hotel is less full they try to allocate guests to quieter rooms at weekends. So in summary, next time we would probably stay at the Sofitel but not unless they could guarantee us a quiet room and ideally a larger bed!", "title": "Really nice hotel!!!

Having heard so much, I went with some expectations and was quite disappointed. I checked into the hotel and was given a smoking room. My reservation was made through a package with American Express and I had requested a non-smoking room. Once I got to the room, I immediately called down to the front desk and the phone rang over 10 times before I decided to just hang up and head back down to the lobby as no one was picking up the phone. My room was changed as requested, which was nice. However, the wake up call I was offered never came through the next morning. Luckily, I had set my cell phone alarm as a back up. There was no offer of luggage assistance or any other assistance as is usually the custom upon checking in at a quality hotel. The rest of my stay was rather uneventful until Friday night which was very unfortunate. Being that I was there for a conference, I was trying to get some sleep but could not get any rest until well into dawn due to the constant thumping of the music at a nearby club. When I called down to the front desk, the attendant merely said, \"The clubs close at 2am.\" There was no offer to possibly change rooms or anything. Even if the employee had been sympathetic, it would have been nice. Of course there is nothing the hotel could do about the situation, but this might have been something that could have been disclosed to the customer. The following morning at checkout, I was surprised to not have the front desk attendant ask about my stay. She simply handed me my receipt and I was on my way. I do not know if this is a problem with the staffing at this particular Sofitel location, but I am not inclined to try another location to find out. Never have I encountered such lack of effort in providing service at a hotel.", "title": "Refined luxury hospitality--not quite", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "travelinbug7", "date": "April 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 28839340}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Service aside, the room was nice though the walls were a bit thin.

There was a only comforter, no flat sheet. It got quite warm using a comforter in spring. We ate breakfast in the hotel in the morning.

We complained and they immediately changed our room but we were still very nervous and had to check all the sheets and blankets. They comped our breakfast the next morning as well. They told us that they couldn't find any sign of bed bugs the next day. They were very apologetic and polite about the event but I still felt like we had been accused of lying. I'm sure they probably just rented out the room again to some other unsuspecting sucker. I used the hotel lobby bathroom the next morning and when I turned on the faucet, what I thought was a fingernail lying in the sink started squirming. It was a pinworm. Someone had obviously changed their child's baby diaper in the sink and left behind remnants. I would've loved this hotel had it not been for the bed bugs and the pinworm.", "title": "Lovely hotel.
