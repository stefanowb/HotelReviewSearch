My solution is to simply keep the window closed and to turn on the A/C or fan, which creates a bit of white noise to drown out the passing cars.

The bathroom was neat and tidy, and had excellent water pressure, and little extra shampoo's to take home. It also had a nice microwave and a small fridge with a freezer, and internet access. A pleasant continental breakfast was provided, and the people working there were very nice and friendly. This is a very small motel, with only 20 rooms, all non-smoking, and is in the heart of downtown Port Angeles, so there is a lot of traffic noise all night, but the motel itself was quiet. The whole place could use a paint job, and some upgrades, but for the price, it is an excellent deal. I paid only $59 per night, and even had an extra bedroom, which I used for my bags. The main downfall is the very small parking lot, and I drive a big pickup...hard to park!!!
