It is central and relatively cheap. The rooms have no ceiling lights only bedside lamps so are dark and feel dingy. We had a twin which was very narrow and looked out onto the tin roof and back of nowhere. The bathroom had black mould marks and needs a renovation. The next door bathroom noises and voices could be heard through the thin walls, the passage door needs a sound proofing seal. This was a grand old lady! She now is in need of more than a facelift. We chose to move to another motel for the remainder of our stay in Hobart. We did not eat here! When we spoke to reception about our disappointment the response was they had just change hands!
