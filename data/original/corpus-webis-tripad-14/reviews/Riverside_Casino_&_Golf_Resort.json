The shower curtain and the window drapes were electric which was also pretty cool. . . Since this is a newer hotel the room smelled clean and was spotless and the beds were really comfortable. The only complaint I would have is that there was no wireless internet. If you're into gambling the casino makes you feel like you're in Vegas. There are several eating options but the only one we ate at was the buffet for breakfast. It offered a wide variety of selections including an omelet bar and every topping imaginable for waffles. The food was pretty good and there was plenty of it but it wasn't too hot which was unfortunate. However, the hotel and the room itself definitely made up for it and I can't wait to go back! There are gift shops, a clothing store, a golf shop and a spa. I wouldn't recommend the Riverside for a family vacation with young kids just because there isn't a whole lot for little kids to do.

The hotel was very modern and surrounded by an extensive golf course which no one was playing on due to the 10 degree weather in early February. The check in process was quick and easy. The rooms were modern, well decorated with an unusual glass walled shower that had electric curtains that opened and closed with a switch. The widows also had an electric motor that opened and closed them. Not what we usually find but nonetheless, very nice. We eat 2 meals in the casino restaurants, one of which was the buffett. The food was ok, not super-fancy but good enough for us. The casino was busy (and smokey) so after the concert we did some people-watching and ended our evening early.
