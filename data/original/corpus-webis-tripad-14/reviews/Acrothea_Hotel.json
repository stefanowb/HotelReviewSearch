We were a late booking and I contacted the hotel direct only 5 or so days before we left. Dimitris and Alexandra were very helpful and fortunately they had a room for us. Our room was cleaned well and tastefully decorated , fresh towels daily - we did find it a bit of a squeeze and the bathroom was rather bijou. The location is excellent two entrances/exits one at the top so ideal for parking we had no issues parking even though Parga was incredibly busy - the hotel has 4 or so spaces or there is on street parking. The bottom exit/entrance is straight into Parga town. Our room had air con which was certainly needed in the August heat and the balcony did have a side sea view. Wifi was available and on the whole this was ok , a little up and down. Breakfast was great - lovely view from the terrace and plenty to choose from cereal , bread , lovely cherry jam ! fruit , eggs , meat , juice , teas and coffee. The staff we helpful and especially Dimitris who helped us with directions to find Sarakiniko beach and also Acheron River.", "title": "Location , service and a fab view", "user": "spadge", "date": "August 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174772906}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We visited Parga on recommendation of a couple we met in Tossa De Mar Spain last year.", "title": "Acrothea Hotel Parga", "user": "Golightlies", "date": "August 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174736298}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "As it was our Ruby Wedding Anniversary we wanted something special and chose Acrothea Hotel from the internet as it had such excellent reviews and we weren't disappointed.", "title": "Must be one of the best hotels in town", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jarlemann", "date": "August 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174529893}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Hotel is in such a dream location with awesome views of the Ionian Sea and is spotlessly clean.
