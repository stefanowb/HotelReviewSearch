The hotel was very well located, 5-10 minute walk to Tivoli Gardens and Central Station. Also quite a number of bars, pubs and restaurants within easy (5-10 minute) walking distance. With a good pair of walking shos you can cover most of Copenhagen on foot. Recommend requesting a room that is not on the street side of the hotel as the traffic would be noisy at night (however the busy road makes it feel very safe when walking home at night) - we were lucky enough to have a room on the non-street side so had absolutely no trouble with noise. Also suggest requesting a room that is not located on top of the restaurant as breakfast commenced at 7am. Couldn't hear the people in adjoining rooms, couldn't hear people in the hall outside. The room itself was basic but very clean. Wood floors, bedding was warm, comfortable and clean, bathroom was basic but clean (although privacy was a bit of an issue as the bathroom walls are thin) - shower over bathtub. Room is smallish but if you are just using for a place to sleep and relax a little in the mornings then the room is more than adequate. Great hanging space for clothes. Breakfast was definitely the highlight (served 7-11 on weekends, 7-10 on weekdays) - although suggest staying away from the scrambled eggs - go for the soft boiled instead. Served in a lovely covered atrium or seats inside if you prefer. Great Danish pastries! Good coffee. Staff were very helpful in renting us hotel bikes 150DKK per day at time of review. Even if you haven't ridden in 10 years (like me) it is a great thing to do in Copenhagen as there are many dedicated bike lanes and all drivers and pedestrians give way. Overall a great experience in Copenhagen at the First Vesterbro Hotel - highly recommend.", "title": "Great location, basic but clean, excellent breakfast - definitly recommend!", "user": "AmandaDeee", "date": "July 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 116057973}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Anna Marie on reception was excellent in her customer service and delivery, pity she works for this hotel.
