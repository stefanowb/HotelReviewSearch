We decided on this hotel for a couple of reasons-it was a good price for 3 adults and it was right in the middle of Banff. We were meeting our son there and he arrived early so the reception clerk let him go up to the room and settle in before we arrived. Reception was most helpful with checking in and parking. We had rented a large car which did not fit in the Brewsters car park so we needed somewhere to park it. The clerk was able to tell us a safe and secure place. Our room was quite large with 2 queen beds. The bathroom was basic and in need of a fix up. There was no fan and so it did tend to fog up after a shower. The room was very clean, sheets were crisp and pillows comfy. The lodge is a bit of a maze and can be difficult to find your way around once upstairs. Our room faced an interior courtyard and so we did not get any noise which seemed to be a problem for some of the other reviewers. Breakfast was very good with fresh fruit salad, yoghurt s, cereals, toast and pastries as well as teas and coffee. I would definitely stay here again as it is right in the centre of town so you have very little walking to get to shops and restaurants.", "title": "Right in the middle of Banff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Aussie8", "date": "April 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 158144803}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed at this hotel in Apr 2013.

There's free wi-fi but safe that for checking emergency email and not for streaming anything as it's didn't appear to be super speedy. The breakfast room \"Birdsnest\" was adequate, the coffee was a pleasant surprise in that it was really good. We were traveling with our one year old son so were happy to see a high chair there...makes breakfast so much easier. They've got onsite underground parking as well. It's best to park on the street while you check in so you can get your room card which also serves as access to the parkade. Make sure you have your most confident driver at the wheel when it comes time to park. The entrance is a bit narrow between two pillars and then it's a hard left to the key box to open the door, There was always a spot for us but some of them were tight and required some navigation. It's doable but you'll want to take your time. The hotel staff was great at answering our questions and letting us leave the car behind a bit after checkout so we could get lattes for our drive.
