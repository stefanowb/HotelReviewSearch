Our vacation started out in Rocky Mountain National Park, then to Keystone, then to Alamosa, then to Colorado Springs. By the time we arrived here, we were in the mood for a nice hotel with good amenities. The Hilton Garden Airport did not disappoint. Service was excellent, with staff being very informative and helpful. The room was spacious, clean, fresh and new. Refridgerator, microwave, a 37-40\" flat screen LCD and high-speed internet were standard features. King bed was firm and very comfortable topped with a nice down comforter. In all, our stay was very comfortable. The only thing I'd mention was that the TV turned on very slowly and channel changes were nearly as slow. Also, we hooked up a DVD player which wasn't super easy (obviously they'd rather have you pay to watch the Lodgenet movies instead). Switching the TV to the right input so that we could watch the DVDs took a bit of trial and error, but we figured it out. All in all though, we had a very comfortable stay. One last thing ... as part of our stay, we received coupons for 2 hot breakfasts each morning - only the second morning we were leaving at 530am. So the hotel staff provided us with cold treats (yogurt, fruit, danishes, etc) the night before so we could store in our fridge and take the next morning. It was a sign of how they were thinking of ensuring our happiness - and we appreciated that ...", "title": "We were very happy - we had a great stay", "user": "Roger_from_San_Jose", "date": "August 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 38096597}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I read reviews of this hotel prior to booking. My intentions were to have a hotel near the airport, with great beds and internet access. This hotel met all 3 of those requirements. Internet access was a bit slow, but useable. I requested on my reservation that we have a non-smoking room. When we arrived, front desk clerk seemed to be helpful but we found that the original room was on the smoking floor. Once we requested a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor, we were very happy. We just wish that they had noticed the note prior to us being exposed to the first room (with ashtrays and smell of smoke when leaving the elevator).

The lobby is bright and clean with plenty of place to grab some peace and quiet to finish some work. I could imagine myself relaxing there on a cold winter\u2019s night while the fireplace roared. The check-in was quick and efficient with a friendly staff. Room service is offered (daily until 10pm) via the onsite Great American Grill. Since I arrived at the hotel late, the hotel took my order at 9:50pm and my order was delivered to my room within 10 minutes with a smile. For my stay, I had a king size bed \u201cEvolution\u201d room. The room is spacious, bright and clean; decor is very current and trendy. A work space/desk offers a great place to work on your laptop with internet connection and telephone. A nice 32' flat screen is a nice centerpiece. A snack cabinet with mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker is a nice amenity. Blackout curtains keep out the sun when you need that extra few hours of sleep. However, the best feature of the room was the \"GardenSleep System\" bed, which was very comfortable... one of those mattresses where you can jump next to a glass of wine and not tip it over. The hotel offers a courtesy shuttle to the airport. A business center is located behind the front desk. Check-out was so easy that I didn\u2019t know if I cleared or not. I have stayed at plenty of hotels over the last few years and this one is certainly in my top five. The only thing that could make this hotel any better would be if it was located in a downtown area or overlooking a river... you can\u2019t have it all but you can find a wonderful stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.", "title": "In the Hilton Garden...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "StandingRoom", "date": "July 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 71274151}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed here with colleagues for business.
