We checked into a non-smoking room which was very nice and clean and smelled smoke-free. At night however, it smells like they are pumping smoke from the casino into your room. We smelled cigarrette smoke all night long. We have also had the same problem at the Horseshoe - smells smoky in the room at night. The casino was nice and blended very well with the lobby so you didn't feel like you were walking the gang plank to the boat.

I looked at several hotels in the area and wanted to stay in close proximity to The Bass Pro Shop and The Boardwalk shopping district. I narrowed our choice down to Sam's Town and the El Dorado. I called ED first and when I called to request a room I was confirmed for 2 nights at a rate of $125. My husband and I were very excited about our upcoming weekend and proceeded to make reservations for dinner at Superior Steakhouse for Saturday and planned out our Christmas Shopping. When we arrived at the hotel it was about 7 pm on Friday, as we were checked in the front desk attendant advised that they only had us booked for one night. I advised this is incorrect the reservation should have been for 2. I was told that they were overbooked by 15 rooms for Saturday and they could not accomadate us. I asked to speak to the manager and was directed to a telephone off to the side and was told to dial zero for reservations. I followed their instructions and when I reached reservations the clerk reiterated what I was told from the front desk, I was also told that I could not cancel my reservation for Friday as their was a 24 hour cxl policy. I then requested again to speak to a manager. I was placed on hold and when the reservations supervisor picked up I was again told that they only had me booked for one night. She then told me that she has spoken to the reservationist that had booked my room originally and that she remembered making my reservation and that she had told me they were sold out. I find it very hard to believe that someone that speaks to hundreds of people remembers booking my room 3 weeks prior. The supervisor then turned very nasty and condescending and told me that I would have to leave the property on Saturday and that that was that, she was not saying anything else about it and she then said \"bye bye\" very sarcastically and hung up on me. Let's just say that I was irate. I demanded to speak to the hotel GM and waited for about 10 minutes for someone to arrive. When they arrived I explained what had happened. The GM apologized and said she would take care of us, she checked us in for both nights and asked us to please fill out the comment card explaining what had happened. The room itself was very nice, we had a great view of the city and it was very clean. We ate at the Sportsman Grill friday night and had hamburgers. Our waitress was very nice and even made me a milkshake. On Sunday when we checked out we had a big surprise. Our rate jumped from $125 to $150 Friday night and $180 Saturday night. When I inquired about the rate again I was directed to a phone to call reservations. I told them, no I am not going through that again, so the clerk called and was advised that based on their calender that was the rate. I again requested the GM, when called the GM remembered checking us in on Friday and advised to go ahead and reduce our rate. Now the nitty and gritty of this, I worked in the hosipitality industry for over 5 years, I was the reservations supervisor and then front office supervisor for a Hyatt hotel and then a sales manager for Marriott. In all my years of working and travelling I have never come across anyone as rude or condescending as I did with the supervisor on Friday everning. If I had ever acted that way I would not have had a job. The way we were treated cast a palor over the rest of our visit and really put a damper on our romantic weekend. I know we were not comped gamblers or high rollers, and we were not staying there because of the casino, we were looking for strictly lodging. We wanted to find a place that we could get away and relax. We travel to Shrevport about 4 times a year and have always stayed at The Courtyard, we wanted to find a place a little closer to shopping and restaurants, I guess next time we will be staying next door at Sam's Town.", "title": "Awful Service from Reservations", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Duffersgirl", "date": "December 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 6362739, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Large soaking tub and seperate shower", "disliked": "\u2014 Check in/ Reservations/ Lack of communication between departments"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "If my experience making reservations for this hotel is any indication of how the stay will be -- We are going to regret it!
