Located just off the 101, it is centrally located to all of the wineries. The room was clean, had a refrigerator and microwave, and was quiet even though we were right next to the elevator. There are train tracks running alongside the hotel, but the only train that passed by was at 6:00 p.m. The entire building shook, but there were no other trains. The warm cookies at night were yummy, and the free breakfast in the morning was convenient and plentiful. We would definitely stay here again.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "ChristieBett", "date": "December 30, 2005", "id": 4311843}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I'm glad we stayed at a Holiday Inn Expres last night", "text": "This Holiday Inn Express was the best hotel we visited on our trip. We really liked the friendly staff especially. The room we had I believe was a suite, was quite large with a living room. My kids liked the indoor pool as it was very cold during our visit. The in-room refrigerators and microswaves are a big plus and the free breakfast was a added value. The hotel is convenient to the downtown center where we ate dinner at a great little restaurant. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name, but it was near the town square. I wish we would of had time to do some wine tasting, but with small children that wasn't possible. Our plans were to visit Hearst Castle, which which I believe was about a 30 minute drive from Paso Robles the next day. I would highly recommend you seeing Hearst Castle if you plan to come to the Paso Robles area.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 19, 2005", "id": 4250813}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A pleasant visit to Paso Robles", "text": "We decided to stay at the Holiday Inn Express after reading the reviews here. We had planned to come Paso Robles to do some wine tasting. The Holiday Inn Express wasn't a disappointment. The hotel was clean and the staff was very helpful. We really liked the indoor pool and spa after a day of wine tasting. I think we found a favorite winery at Tobin James. The people are great there and they even helped us prepare some wine for us to take home. One night we ate at this restaurant across the street from the hotel called Big Bubba's. It's fun place with a lively crowd. They even have a mechanical bull. One of the other nights we we ate at the steak house downtown. Good steaks. Overall our visit to Paso Robles was great. The hotel has a great breakfast in the morning and in the evening they bake cookies.

The location is great just off I95, and the hotel is only four months old as of this review. There is some construction going on nearby but we experienced no noise or disruptions. The front desk was helpful and very professional, we checked in and reserved with Preston. The hotel is very quiet and the patrons were all busy professional people, no noisy ones on our night. We got an upgrade to a handicapped suite which my husband needed for his limited mobility. The room had a fridge, a microwave, a coffee maker with it's own sink, a separate sitting room with a second flat screen TV and couch bed. The bathroom was large with a roll in shower. We saw the indoor pool which was overlooked by the modest sized fitness center and well lit so don't expect a lot of privacy if someone is working out, but it was nice and warm to the touch, no hot tub. The beds are wonderful standard HIE quality. The breakfast room is fantastic, large and roomy with a lot of tables and even booths, a TV and fireplace. The food itself was great, sausage patties, eggs, a variety of toasts, incl French, pastries and the signature cinnabons, cereals etc. great juice too.
