Evening dinner was absolutely gorgeous and we couldn't believe the high quality of food and service for the guest discount of \u00a319 for 4 courses! The most personal touch however was the way the staff marked our engagement; we were presented with a cake in the lounge after dinner and someone placed a card in our room whilst we were dinning!", "title": "Outstanding Service", "user": "Hannahpianaa", "date": "April 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 158263939}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel was spotless and the rooms beautifully decorated, our window view was overlooking the garden and the river at the bottom (every room in this hotel has a pleasant view) and the stay was extremely peaceful.", "title": "What a way to recharge the batteries!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SammySunshine83", "date": "April 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 158104566}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We are going to return to this hotel as soon as we can have another holiday as we were so taken by its quality yet outstanding value for money!", "title": "A lovely Easter break", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BuffytheVampireBat", "date": "April 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 158003439}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "My boyfriend and I enjoyed an excellent two night break at the Grasmere hotel from 13th-15th April.
