Our welcome was warm and genuine, the service beyond reproach and the room delightful and spotless. Breakfast was substantial and the Chef, in common with all staff we met, always prepared to go the extra mile to make our stay so memorable. Around 5pm there is an excellent and free buffet of canapes; cheeses, pastries etc. Our room (Sunflower) whilst charming and well equipped was a little small for us but as we were only there for three nights it was more than adequate.", "title": "Charming stay in Victoria BC.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bobandmanda", "date": "June 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114449577}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled solo", "text": "First time staying at Abigail's Hotel - a wonderful weekend!

My family and I were pleasantly surprised. The customer service was impeccable, starting with a greeting from the manager who also helped bring our heavy luggages up to our room. Their complimentary gourmet breakfasts were amazing which included Dungeness crab and local brie omelette supplemented with rosemary and olive oil roast potatoes on one day to smoked salmon, grilled asparagus and poached farm fresh egg with white truffle oil with whole baby red potatoes braised with fresh thyme on another day. However, the chef may be able to accomomdate any other request not on the menu, which they did for my son who wanted a simple hard boiled egg. The hotel also offered snacks in the afternoons from a variety of international cheeses and smoked tuna with various salads to fruits and chocolate covered strawberries.

The hotel is beautiful and very well taken care of. Nice historical property with beautiful gardens. Our room was amazing with lovely views and extremely comfortable bed. The location of the Abigail is a little off the beaten path....however an easy 15 minute walk to the downtown harbour area. Our room was on the 4th floor with no elevator so older people should be aware of a lot of stair to climb for the nicer upper level rooms. Luckily they brought our luggage up because that would have been quite a job! The complementary breakfast the next morning was the biggest surprise. Absolutely delicious. I'm a big fan of tea biscuits and the freshly baked one I had at the Abigail was the best I've ever had. The waitress was very gracious and brought me the recipe which was a nice touch! The tub in the room was lovely with jets however the shower was kind of weak and you had to stand in the tub to use it.

When we first arrived we were welcomed by an unbelievably friendly staff member. She gave us a tour, came outside and helped with the bags, and made us feel really welcomed. The room was beautiful! Comfortable beds, quiet surroundings, and a very romantic feel. We booked through Expedia, so the breakfast wasn't included in the room price, but it was no problem. If we wanted breakfast we could just wander into the dining area and take a seat, no reservations required. They would just add it to our room tab.

We loved the library and the fact that we could sit in there and eat scrumptious little hors d'oeuvres made by Matt, the chef was a bonus.

He occasionally went to each table talking with guests and making them feel at home. The common room is like an English library - with a fireplace and book-lined walls. I always felt comfortable going into it and sitting down with a book to read. They also have a small selection of DVD's that guest may borrow and watch in their rooms. The location is perfect - a short walk to town, and walking distance to many other things. I walked to the Government House and Craigdorrach Castle, as well as Beacon Hill Park and Emily Carr's house. Abagails makes you feel very welcome and comfortable.
