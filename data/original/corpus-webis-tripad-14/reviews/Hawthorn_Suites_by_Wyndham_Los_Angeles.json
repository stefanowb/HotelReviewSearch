First, Google misidentifies its location on the East side. It is actually on the West side of the street. Second, it is so easy to miss, it is not easy. I probably circled twice around until I found it. Third, all the lights at the cross-sections are terribly long, so if you come down the wrong street, you will be waiting forever to get back into the right. Fourth, traffic on this road is quite heavy, so getting out of the garage (which is a hazard in and of itself because it is so easy to miss that there is an exit and there is no warning that there might be exiting traffic) is quite difficult.", "title": "Half terrible / half good location, decent stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "tsk9383", "date": "June 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 162799735}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013", "text": "I stayed here in march and had a few problems with a handicapped accessible room.
