We had booked to stop 3 nights at the Castle Hotel in Aberaeron. The restaurant at the Castle was closed on the first night so we decided to book a table at the Feathers instead and we are so glad that we did. We ended up eating here for the 3 nights and stopping afterwards for a drink in the bar area as it was much more suited to our tastes than the Castle which could be rowdy on a night. The service is excellent, all staff very efficient and friendly. Good choice of food from several menus (either more expensive \"restaurant\" type food or from a \"bar\" menu - all food served in main restaurant). Food was just wonderful, beautifully presented, piping hot and cooked perfectly. Excellent value for money. Nice to sit back in comfy chairs in the bar area afterwards and relax.
