We were given an upgraded room. The room was quite large compared to most NY hotels. The bathroom was also quite large with a separate tub and walk in shower, and separate water closet. The room came with butler service so we didn't have to pack or unpack. The location is great. The hotel is right next to Central Park. There is a subway stop across the street and The hotel is an easy walk to many mid-town and uptown locations. The only complaints we had concerned some construction noise coming in the early morning from a building across the courtyard under construction on 59th street. The concierge also forgot to notify us of a reservation they had made.

Entering the storied hotel I remembered that much had changed since the days when people like Keith Richards made it there home away from. After Donald Trump lost it in the divorce the historic landmark has been through the wringer, condos taking over the Central park Side of the property complete with their own entrance. Fairmont has decided to make a statement by returning the hotel to a true 5 star property worthy of it's rich history. Reception was flawless. Since the hotel was not completely full I requested and was given an upgrade to a spectacular balcony/patio room on the 5th floor. For three days our world became one of complete Central Park South luxury. The Chandeliers and gold plated fixtures added an elegant touch to our New York \"Apartment\" complete with the wonderful white gloved butler Gabriel.

The first time, I asked politely and watched as the doorman assisted ladies who exited the hotel after me slide into a cab before me. I deferred because they were elderly ladies wearing pretty high heels and taking tiny steps, and I agree fancy geriatrics need to be seated much more quickly than a chick of indeterminable (but sufficient) age wearing Chucks and a backpack. I waited and asked again and he assisted more people (who were not me) into other cabs, and then I tucked my tip back into my pocket and walked towards 5th Avenue to get my own cab. This scene played out again the next night, with a doorman in hiding until Team Drunk Girls left The Plaza - I couldn't find him until the cab I had hailed pulled forward as I was about to get in it because the disappearing doorman had called it over to assist Team Drunk Girls. Truly, they needed the assistance and tumbled messily into the cab, but it's awfully frustrating that one must be elderly or drunk to get assistance. Again, I got my own cab, because, really, I can do that, but it's not fun when you're female and it's dark and there's a bellman who should be helping. Third night, I asked again ever hopeful and optimistic, but the doorman just couldn't seem to be bothered to assist me in hailing a cab. The tip went back in my pocket, and it stayed there with the other tips until the doorman at my friend's condo on the Upper West Side walked down the street to get me a cab and won the doorman tip lotto.", "title": "Location", "user": "lkchgo", "date": "April 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157425831}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Upon check-in, we also experienced a bellman awkwardly lingering for a tip even before assisting us to the room.
