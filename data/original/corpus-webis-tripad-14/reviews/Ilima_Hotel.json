This hotel is amazing with super friendly staff & excellent location. It is just down from the international market place. It is only a 5-7min walk to waikiki beach & close to everything else. The 1 small downside may be a small pool with not much sun. We had a 3night stay here from Sat 12Aug'06. The rooms were huge & clean & we could see some ocean too. We had a kitchenette which was great for making our own b/fast. Would be very happy to stay here again.

I read the reviews on the Ilima and was more than concerned about some of the reports. Let me set the record straight!

Actually I am writing this from our hotel room as its our last night here :( but we are on a cruise tomorrow so don't feel to bad for us! The hotel is by far more than we expected.

Not at all; my husband and I were in the bedroom, our 6-yr-old slept on the hide-a-bed, and our 2 1/2-yr-old slept in his portacrib in the living room. The place was spacious and very comfortable. It wasn't the Ritz, but we don't go to the Ritz (nor were we paying for the Ritz). It was a great deal. Really quiet, too---only heard some small kids running in the hall once. Never heard footsteps thudding from above, etc. Great housekeeping service. The room had excellent cross-breezes so was well-ventilated and fresh. Slept with the fan on so never heard any city noise at night. Pool was heated and, although small, perfectly adequate. Very friendly staff. Ample free parking.

With young kids (5 and 7), having a full size refrigerator and freezer really helped. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, toaster, plates and utensils. We used the stove to make breakfast and dinner right in our room. Free parking was available everyday and our kids especially loved the heated pool. One of the best assets of this hotel is their staff. Our light in the kitchen was acting funny and they fixed it without us even having to ask them. My son had to do some homework and the front desk helped us out by letting us borrow their Elmer's glue and well as sharpening our pencils for us.
