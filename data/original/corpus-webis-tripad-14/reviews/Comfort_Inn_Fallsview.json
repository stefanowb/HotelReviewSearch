The breakfast was so crowded, you shared your table with strangers. After 4 attempts to get ice out of the machine, I finally managed to get 1 small amount. But the largest problem, was the RUDE MANAGER. We were placed on the 8th floor with a balcony and children, we were moved to the only room left which was smaller and they would not adjust the room rate. Also, you need to get pool towels at the front desk instead of the pool area???? Too many headaches at this place if you are looking for a relaxing hotel stay. $6 to park-$9 after taxes each day!!", "title": "Save your money and find a better hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PhillyFeisMom", "date": "July 12, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 70674758}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The front desk people messed up my reservation. They charged my credit card but didn't have it in there system. IThey said that I didn't pay for my stay when they actually did charge my card. SO at this point I called my credit card company to find out what was going on and they said that the hotel already charged my card before i even checked in! (I booked online) I was arguing with the manager for two hours trying to get my money back on my credit card and they were denying that they ever charged it!! They showed the WORST customer service that I have ever seen! So anyways, to make a very long and fustrating story short, I had to call my credit card company to refund back the amount that the hotel denied charging me in the first place and then just recharge me again and this time they had confirmation of it. Isn't that pathetic? They didn't even apoligize or anything! I will be complaining to Choice Hotels on this one for sure and never go back to this dump , rip off of a hotel ever again!

This March break we hotel hopped and stayed at the Comfort Inn for one night, we found the room to be clean but small and older, the front desk staff was not the most friendly. They have free wireless internet that is weak at the best of times. They do have an indoor pool that is good for kids. The free breakfast in my opinion is a bit of a scam because it is only a continental breakfast that is offered only between 6:30-9:00am and you CAN NOT take anything up to your room, you MUST be fully dressed, NO PJ's. Why no PJ's at 6 in the morning when I can wear my neon blue Speedo from my 6th floor room down the elevator to the pool on the main floor ? Sorry but I will pass on the free muffin and coffee with those kind of restrictions. The one night stay was $70 including taxes (parking not included). We have free parking off site. No bad for the price but you can spend a little less for the same or spend a little more and get twice as much. We may return if our other spots are booked.", "title": "NOT BAD......
