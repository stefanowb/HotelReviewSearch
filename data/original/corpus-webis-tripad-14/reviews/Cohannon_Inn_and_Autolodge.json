When you are in the corridor heading for your room, there is a smell of smoke, and the hall ways have the feel of a barracks about them. However the rooms are more than adequate. Clean rooms with working telly, showers and basic but clean duvets. The bathroom was excellent. The shower and toilet spotless. We had the breakfast on the following morning and both thought it excellent. I had a bacon and sausage buttie and she had poached egg. It was a fiver each and great value. Highly recommended. We would stay here again. It was two star but was very good. It is half the price of other hotels in the area so definitely work investigating. One of the biggest pluses is the ample parking and the fact that you are beside a filling station for all your amenities. The only downside was that we were woken to screaming and roaring at 2am, but it didn't last long. Not the hotel's fault if some people are inconsiderate", "title": "Not the Ritz but does the job", "user": "BurstYourBubble", "date": "May 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 161281545}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Myself and a colleague stayed for 2 nights on a business trip.
