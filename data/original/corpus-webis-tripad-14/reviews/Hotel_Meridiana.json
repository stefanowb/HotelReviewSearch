Rooms are tiny compared to American standards BUT definitely average for European budget hotel. Our room and bathroom were neat and clean. This hotel is not centrally located but is a pleasant walk (15min-30min depending to where) from pretty much anything that you'd want to see. There are also many buses 1, 7, 12, 13 that run often and whose schedules are posted that take you to all the sights under 5-10min. I think the front desk sells bus tickets and there is a tobacco shop a block away that does too. Breakfast is buffet style - croissants, rolls, cereal, juice adn coffee/tea. If you get tired of it, there are a multitude of pastry stores nearby. There is also a grocery store a block away. My only complaint was that 2 of the nights, there was a tour of young girls on our floor who ran around yelling til the wee hours of the morning. We did complain and they were less loud but walls are thin- you can hear doors opening and closing and people in the hallway. After they left, it was quiet so was more a problem with the guests than hotel. This is definitely a more than adequate hotel for those on a budget.", "title": "Good Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Alonzoiii", "date": "March 23, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3296562}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice Modest Hotel", "text": "We just returned from Italy which included a stay at this Hotel.

This hotel was a pretty good distance from the sights, although we did do a lot of walking to and fro and a bit of cab rides. As far as the hotel, it was clean, big rooms, big baths, the breakfast was very good. The staff was helpful. The airline lost all our luggage,but we all got it by the second day, it is amazing what you can survive without. Around the corner is a grocery for water,etc., a bank atm on the next corner, plenty of restaurants around the hotel. We took cabs from the airport and cost 12 euros. We had two doubles and a triple. Traffic noise muffled by the windows, so maybe double paned. This hotel was part of our package so I am not sure of the price, but most likely budget. If you cab it everywhere or can walk easily, stay here,otherwise, find a hotel closer in to Florence.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Miser", "date": "March 18, 2005", "id": 3284644}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2005", "text": "Stayed here as part of a package.
