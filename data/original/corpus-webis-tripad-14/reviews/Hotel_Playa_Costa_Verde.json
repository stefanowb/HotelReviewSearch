There was a minor problem with the air conditioner and safe, but they were fixed quickly. You may want to ask for an extra room key as the electricity in the room is controlled by your room key. Our maid left towel creations every morning along with bottles of water. Our room was very close to the restaurants, entertainment area, lobby and pool.

I have to say, there is just such a huge assortment of food that I never went hungry. We all thought the food was great. Make your reservations for the a la carte restaurants (done in the lobby area) as soon as you get there as they fill up quickly. The line up for reservations is shorter in the afternoons. The Bariay is the buffet restaurant. You must try the freshly squeezed orange juice - it is excellent!! We ate here in the mornings and a couple of nights. We ate at the Cuban, Italian and Japanse Restaurants and again the food was good. The snack bar \"Los Caneyes\" is where we ate lunches most days. They serve pizza, hamburgs, hotdogs and french fries. The only thing I will mention about the restaurants is that sometimes the English translation of the food is not really what the dish is. For example, their chicken ceasar salad is really some type of fish on a bed of rice. The ice cream bar is fantastic. Make sure you try every flavour of ice cream.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 28, 2006", "id": 4565364}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "Like the previous reviews, we just got back from a WONDERFUL week at Playa Costa Verde on March 10th.
