The best thing about the Jurys for us was the location! Three blocks from Newbury Street, within easy walking distance to Copley Place, Back Bay, the Public Garden, and Downtown Crossing made the Jurys the ideal hotel for us. Public transportation could not have been easier: less than 2 blocks from Arlington Station on the Green Line, within 4 blocks of South Station on the Orange Line which is also the Back Bay stop for Amtrack. A Hertz rental car facility was only a couple blocks away near the Park Plaza Hotel. In short, a wonderful base from which to explore the Boston area. While the location is fairly quiet in the evening, the Jurys' hotel bar is quite popular and filled with revelry every night. We asked for a quiet room and never heard a peep from the crowds in the bar. It wasn't until our last day that I discovered the spacious and comfortable sitting area in the hotel lobby.
