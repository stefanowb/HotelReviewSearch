The coffee machine is very neat, the bed very comfortable. My wife and i enjoyed it. I didnt try the tv or internet we didnt want to look at it for a few days. We did eat breakfast there one morning and it was fine and average price for s. beach. We brought in our own booze in our room for obvious reasons. On tuesdays there is a happy hour and they gave some very good ham and cheese brie and some fruit and some booze. It wasnt cheap it was high quality stuff. All staff members we came accross were polite and kind. Went to the beach lots and had no issues with chairs and an umbrella. Very comfy. The room had an umbrella that we used the one day it rained. Every night we went to dinner we would come back and our bed was made and i had wrote on our reservation that this was our anyversery and on our first night when we returned from dinner there was a bottle of champain. Parking is $32 a night as most places in that area. Next year im gonna try to figure out a way to go without a car. The pool area and bar is nice. They also have a hot tub. When we were there a lady was topless at the pool area and many staff members seen her and to me it seemed like it was a common option. So my wife did it also and that was nice for her and i. My wife who can be picky like most of us here and she loved the place and so did i. There was no noise bothering us. My wife have spent 4 years in a row going to south beach and at 4 different hotels and this is our favorite so far. We havent stayed at the one on 17th and collins that starts with a d and ends in a o because there about twice the price as the z any time i looked. There was no comp breakfast it was very clean. Would i go back? if i can get similar rates as this year. On the holiday inn sight you can pay in advance and get about the cheapest rates i have seen.

This was my second time staying there but this trip was vastly different and very negative. We had booked a pool suite but they gave us the wrong room, when I went back to reception to ask for the room we had booked they told us it wasn't available and that we'd have to wait a few hours for it. Keep in mind that we arrived the next day due to a flight cancellation and had called the hotel to tell them that we'd be arriving late and to keep our room. They also said we couldn't stay in the room they had just put us in and suggested we wait by the pool. This was totally unacceptable but they did nothing about it except for offer us breakfast. After breakfast the room still wasn't ready...3 hours past and we finally got the room. the manager had said the pull out bed would be turned down in the evening...it wasn't and we called twice and had to wait 3 hours for them to come turn it down. It ended up being broken and the man used the side table to hold it up. Then the curtain rod fell on my head, the internet we purchased didnt work so they suggested i move around until finding a spot that would work, the tv remotes didn't work, there was fire bell testing one of the days and to top it off they ended up over charging us even though we had prepaid for the duration of the trip. It took about 6 phone calls to get this resolved. i found the staff to be clueless except for Mario who was the bartender by the pool.
