The Hampton Inn is right next to the Juan Santamaria International Airport. After my husband and I made our way to the exit for the taxis and shuttles, an airport employee asked us where we were going. We told him \"Hampton Inn\" and he immediately found a gentlemen (employed, I believe, by Hampton Inn) who directed us across the street to the free shuttle. The shuttle dropped us off at the hotel and we were relieved to be in a cool, very clean and spacious room after a long day of traveling. The free breakfast had a lot of different options and lots of fresh fruit. The front desk arranged for a taxi ride to the Tobias Airport for our flight on Nature Air to Uvita efficiently. One small issue occurred when I asked to pay the departure tax to avoid dealing with before our departure flight. The person at the front desk at the time apologized and advised me that they had run out of the necessary forms. I ate breakfast and saw that the small desk in the waiting room (with a sign regarding payment of departure taxes) was occupied by another gentlemen, who informed me that I could in fact, pay the departure taxes there). The moral of the story is to ignore the front desk if they tell you they ran out of forms and wait until the other gentleman who handles the departure taxes arrives at his (separate) desk. (Note also that you can pay the departure tax at the Tobias Airport as well). While the Hampton Inn is certainly generic, without any charm, and occupies a surreal Americanized area (complete with a Holiday Inn Express, a Denny's Restaurant, etc.) next to the airport and would probably not do for a much longer stay, it could not be closer to the airport, is exceptionally clean, the staff are friendly and generally very helpful, the breakfast is free and filling, and the beds are comfortable.
