My room overlooked the bus loop, and the noise from it wasn't intrusive. Room service food was terrific, and arrived ahead of the estimated time; the hamburger I had in the in-house restaurant was also excellent. I liked the Sheraton's option of not having the room made up every day; I can make my own bed and don't need new towels or the toilet cleaned daily, and I appreciated the $5 in-house credit I received for each day I made up my own room. The bathroom had a huge shower stall (no bath) and was quite large in general, though it took me a bit to find the light switch -- located on the wall behind one of the doors -- without a light to find it!
