We all had our ID'S to prove this but the staff at the hotel including the manager denied our quoted rates. We were stuck because all other hotels in the area were booked. Our finance department is tossing around not letting us stay at a Hilton Hotel. My co-worker and myself went down to the front desk to get more coffee pods. The desk clerk took our information. I recieved the coffe an hour and half later. My co-worker never received her requested coffee. I was unable to conduct business using your internet. I had to use my cell phone as a hotspot. The internet was not strong enough for the business that I needed to take care of. I only had 2 bars on my computer with your internet.
