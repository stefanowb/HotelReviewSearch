This hotel is perfect for that. The exact ambiance for alumni, but not unwelcoming if you are from Michigan. There is a hotel up the street that booms fight songs in the lobby, and guests jeer if you are not wearing scarlet and gray, so this was a nice, elegant change. We chose it because of an alumni package, but as it turns out, the rate was not available because of a special event. Room was incredible, great view of stadium from Room 808. We also may have received extra amenities or service because we were on the Executive level. We did have a disturbing episode around the wait list for one of these suites, which were not available when I originally called. I was told I would be called if one opened up, which they said would be quite likely because there were only three of us. A couple days later, I called in again, and was given the opportunity to book the room without them knowing who I was. Therefore, the wait list people were not callled to be told of the opening like was promised and assured. For me, it was no problem, I ended up getting the room I wanted, but was misled about it, and had to initiate myself. I think the problem came because students are doing a lot of the work, and reservationist was new. I want to thank Emily for smoothing things over, and trying to explain things. It is a remarkable level of service they are providing, if indeed, most are students. Very friendly and professional staff. It was fairly expensive (over 200), so we couldnt afford this often, but very convenient to be on campus. Other more reasonable hotels still within walking,but none right on campus.
