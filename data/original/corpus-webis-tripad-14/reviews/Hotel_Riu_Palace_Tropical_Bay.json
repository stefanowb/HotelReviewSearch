We have been here several times since they opened this hotel and I have to say the service was outstanding. There are a few of the regular staff still working there, but most of them are new. What I came to find out was that about half of the staff is not Jamaican! I couldn't believe that they could take work from the Jamaican people. As I said the service was outstanding, if you needed anything, it was taken care of within 5 minutes. Nothing like it used to be, where you considered yourself lucky if you received it before you left! However, for the first time, we really didn't feel as if we were in Jamaica. The staff used to sing and laugh and joke around all the time. Now, it's just service with a smile. I am so disappointed in the atmosphere that we probably will not return. The music they play on the beach is mostly hip-hop latino music. I'm sorry, but if I'm in Spain, then I'd expect to hear Spanish music. When I'm in the Caribbean, I want to hear Caribbean music. We like to lay on the beach and relax, and it was hard to relax with that constant banging music. Also, I think the staff they brought in are from the Dominican Republic. When they would talk to each other, they spoke in Spanish. At first glance they look like Jamaicans, and we were fooled for the first day. Also, the resort no longer has the Jamaican soda, Ting. The rooms are all done being renovated. Mostly, they changed the floor tile and the bathroom sink, toliet and counters. The beds used to be two double beds pushed together. Now, they have a weird size ! It's smaller than a double, but bigger than a twin. They push them together, but it just doesn't work . They constantly pull away from each other even if you just bump it when you walk. The sheets were really soft, much higher thread count than before. The housekeeping staff was wonderful! They brought clean towels every evening and checked if you needed anything. The beach was gorgeous as usual! The food was also good. Ricardo is still at the Jerk Hut so that was welcome news! The buffet was good, but some nights, it just didn't seem to have the variety that they used to. We ate at the Japanese restaurant, which we had always liked, but this time it was very mediocre. The Steakhouse was fantastic though! Much better than last year even! The filet mignon was really thick and very high quality and the lobster ( half a tail) was also good. The resort seemed only half full till the last few days we were there, but it still wasn't full to capacity. The pools were clean and the only change I noticed in the pool was they added mosaic tile loungers in the water which were not at all comfortable! They also expanded the bar that is actually in the water adding several barstools,but the bar above was the same size and overcrowded. Crazy Diana is still there! Yeah! The pizza restaurant is gone . They put a really nice bar in that spot. You can get drinks up there in the morning before the pool bar opens. It's a great place to wait for your bus back to the airport. Oh! The liquor is actually name brand liquor! That's a big change for them since they made it a Palace. You can also order room service, although the menu is VERY limited. We ordered a sandwich and dessert one night, and the food was there in 20 minutes! The guy was out of breath, like her was running to the room with it. So, all in all, the resort has made some serious upgrades, but at what cost? The Spanish influence is spreading throughout the island, as I noticed at the airport the signs were in both English and Spanish. I was told by one of the Jamaicans, that it is now mandatory to teach Spanish in the schools. It's like they are taking away the Jamaican identity. One of the buffet theme nights is Mexican. Two new restaurants have been added, one is Krystal( a fusion restaurant), and the other is Italian. We looked at the menu and it didn't look like real Italian food, so we skipped it. Other people were not impressed either. I think I covered everything. Oh, they have 4 new computers if you want to do e-mail. $9 for 30 min and they work faster than the old ones they had. However, they were down twice, once was a server problem, the other was the computers. If you have a laptop, the wireless is free!

I mention this as we experienced a lot of rude people when ordering drinks from the bar or talking (down) to the maids. Visitors from other areas of the world seem to expect a \"Ritz\" type service on a package holiday. We felt for the amount we paid we got superb value for money. Mannners cost nothing and a simple \"please\" when ordering makes all the difference. I would not be at my best if I was spoken to in the ways in which heard. A lot seems to be made also with regard to \"Bugs\" etc. This is a tropical island and funnily enough there are cockroaches. We saw a few a night,. So what, they were there first and none of them attacked us so we didn't feel it was a problem. Out of a party of 16 of us no one saw any \"bugs\" in their rooms.
