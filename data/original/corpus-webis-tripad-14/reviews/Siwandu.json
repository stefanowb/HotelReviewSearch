Guides are really good and on ride from airstrip to camp we saw giraffe, impala, hyena and many birds. Its a really lovely place and very isolated which means no crowds as on many Kenyan safaris. Kinda feels like something from early colonial days. game drives are awesome but make sure you do a sunset river trip too. that is truly breathtaking. bring a good camera with 300mm lens. Fulfilled all our dreams and hopes for what a safari would be. Its expensive but honeslty worth every penny. early July seemed like great time to go too. the hardest part was leaving.
