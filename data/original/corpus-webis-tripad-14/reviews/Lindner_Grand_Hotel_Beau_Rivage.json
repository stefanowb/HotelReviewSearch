Room was cozy and very big and had a great view out all 3 windows. The furniture and carpet very old though. You could feel the springs through the mattress and the tv was old and oddly placed where you couldn't use the remote from the right side of the bed. The key to the room weighs like two pounds and is very bulky to carry around(encountered similar in other Swiss hotels). The bathroom is nice but poorly arranged as you have to sit on an angle to use the toilet due to heater in bathroom. But fresh robes and slippers are a nice touch. Location is a big plus, walking distance to the train station for anyone in any kind of shape, and if you can't make it there's a free shuttle. It's also close to dining and entertainment in Interlaken. Thr free breakfast was nicer than most hotel buffets. Many coffees are available made to order including expressos, lattes, cappuccinos, etc. Eggs are also made any way you want. The staff was awesome in informing us about Jungfrau train schedules, help finding our hotel in Thun, and recommending Laterne( a restaurant well off the tourist path in Interlaken. We kept joking that the hallways to the rooms looked like the ones in the movie The Shining and the outside looked like a haunted mansion, but they're both very nice. The lobby is also very grand in decor. For anyone wanting to stay in Interlaken I'd highly recommend this hotel, however if like most your just there to visit the Jungfrau I'd recommend staying in Wengen, Murren, or Grindlewald.

Very comfortable bedroom and modern bathroom. Excellent breakfast in lovely room, in better weather, breakfast can be eaten on the patio which is wonderful. Helpful and fairly friendly reception staff. Great location, very close to Interlaken West station (3 minute walk). On arrival at the station with suitcases, we called the hotel and were picked up and driven to the hotel. Interlaken West is at the quieter end of Interlaken and makes a welcome break from the busy, hustle and bustle of Interlaken Ost. There are plenty of local restaurants. Great trips to do from Interlaken West. I would say the best rooms are at the front of the hotel opposite the mountains. Side rooms might be a bit noisy due to the railway running along side nearby. This is a 5 star hotel but really I would classify this hotel as a good 4 star. An enjoyable stay.
