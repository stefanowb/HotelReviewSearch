Our hosts, Dean and Paul, were so wonderful, friendly, helpful with reservations, always nearby if you needed anything. Geri and Rebecca were very helpful in setting up reservations before we arrived (which I would recommend if you are travelling during busy season) for dinner and also massaages in their garden oasis. We stayed in the Sun Room, which was so beautiful (all of the rooms are beautiful) with a private deck. Caya and Havana, the M&A mascots, are so precious, and like their hosts, are very attentive to the guests! We missed our dogs a little less having them around each day. The gardens at the Mermaid and the Alligator are the most breathtaking I have ever seen. A delicious breakfast is served in the gardens each morning, where we met such great people who were staying there. The best part is after your day and evening, coming back to the heated pool in the gardens. Can't get better than that!
