We rented a 2 bedroom apartment. Each bedroom had one double bed, a small closet, 2 night stands with lamps. The sheets were clean. The bathroom had four small bath towels, one small bar of soap and 3 rolls of toilet paper. It had alot of black mold around the tub, floor and sink. It also smelled very musty all the time but it was clean. The kitchen had a refrigerator, dishwasher, washer/dryer combination. It had plates, cups, cutlery etc. It was clean but the counters were worn in some areas. The apartment also had a dining area with a table and chairs, living area with sofa and chair in very poor condition, TV and electric fireplace. The whole apartment was very run down, the carpets were worn, ripped and dirty in many areas. The curtains were falling off the rods, were ripped and stained and looked horrible. Everything about the place was very shabby. It is not a 3 star accomodation. It should only be rated 1 star. The only good thing was the location. It is across the street from Christchurch Cathedral. It was close to everything and we could walk everywhere. It seemed to be a safe area. There were two small markets down the street that were very convenient for picking up breakfast and coffee in the morning.", "title": "Great Location", "user": "poma", "date": "August 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "front_desk": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 8275114, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location was convenient to most major attractions", "disliked": "\u2014 The apartment"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The staff was okay.
