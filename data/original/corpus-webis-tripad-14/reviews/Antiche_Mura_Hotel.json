The recommendations for restaurants and sight-seeing and just general conversation, we valued. We really felt like family and were sorry to leave. The hotel itself is very nice, and the beautiful pool surrounded by lemon and orange trees, is a welcomed sight after a day out and about Sorrento. The hotel does not have a view of the sea but is in a great location, close to everything. The only feedback I have for the hotel is that they should replace the mattresses on the beds.
