Our room had a full view of the Eiffel Tower at Paris and a partial view of the fountains at the Bellagio. The room had a huge bathroom with a shower and a tub. The buffet was wonderful too. The best aspect of the Aladdin is the location. It's mid-strip location is perfect for walking to the other casinos. For those who like to shop, the Desert Passage Mall inside the hotel is nice. In one area, on the hour, you hear thunder and it starts raining. Tres cool. Since this was my first visit to Vegas, I'm not sure, but due to the desert climate, there may be laws regarding water restrictions. My only beef with the Aladdin was the loud noise the toliet made. Again, it may be because of the local regulations to have pressurized small-tank toliets, but the result is that you can hear the neighbors' toliet through the walls. This may sound petty, but bolting out of bed to the sound of rushing water at 3 AM is not my idea of a good time. All that being said, I'd stay at this hotel again. Next time, I'm bringing ear plugs and something to keep my sinuses moist.
