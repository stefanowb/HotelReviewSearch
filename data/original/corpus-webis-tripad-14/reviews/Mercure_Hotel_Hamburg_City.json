Not far from the hotel is s-bahn station Hamerbrook, whis is only one stop from the main railway station - Hauptbahnhof. Hamburg is a beautiful city, I used to live there for two years. Very easy to get around and if you get a good price at Mercure City I highly reccomend the hotel.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "nireno", "date": "January 3, 2007", "id": 6545510}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in the Mercure Hotel Hamburg City for 4 days in December 2006 and were totally happy with our choice. We had booked it a while before via internet on the website of the hotel chain for 60Eur per night (cancellation not refundable). The hotel is located at the big street Amsinckstrasse. The bus stop is just a minute walk away. All buses passing there will take you into down town and buses 120 and 124 take you from down town (bus stop is behind the Saturn) back to the hotel. An advice: As for the bus and train tickets, from 2 persons on it turns out cheaper to take a group ticket for a whole day instead of a day ticket for each one.", "title": "Good value, location and comfort", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Terence_Hill", "date": "January 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6532867, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, price, room", "disliked": "\u2014 the breakfast is very expensive"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were comfortable and clean.
