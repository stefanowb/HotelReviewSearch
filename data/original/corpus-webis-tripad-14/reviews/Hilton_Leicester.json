Staff ok but unable to deal with more rowdy customers (for anyone who works in the area, you too will have suffered the horror that is sharing the hotel with anyone from British Gas - I have never seen so many drunk and disorderly people in my life but BG seem oblivious). Hotel rooms are ok but tired, decoration is shabby, showers/baths are bit ramshackle and water pressure poor. Living Well is great though if you are travelling for work during the summer holidays be warned, they have an offer of 4 nights with entry to 3 attractions which means that children (yes, I have 2) spend their time running up and down the corridors shouting and screaming.
