Somehow we see so many stars, way more than we could ever see even on a clear night in New Jersey. Here the fruits are as fresh as one can get them and be sure to fill your lungs with the clean air.

We just returned from a 4-day stay at Casa Flamboyant with our friends. They recommended the getaway as they go every year, and we are THRILLED that we took the recommendation!! This B&B is nestled in a mountain top location in the El Yunque rainforest in Puerto Rico. You are literally surrounded by tropical foilage, waterfalls, and fabulous rainbows after the rain. Banana, papaya, mango, lemons and so much more grow wild and we ate the seasonal fruit every morning. The owner, Shirley Mooney, is a wonderful host. The inn is set up perfectly with a large patio and wonderful heated pool. The rooms were all beautiful and unique with private bath and comfortable settings. I highly recommend the Rainbow Room where we stayed. You have a nicely sized room with sitting area, and your own private balcony looking out at the mountain, valley, with a fantastic view of the island of Vieques. Shirley provided a delicious breakfast every morning...pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon. A different menu daily...and of course fresh fruit. She also booked a lovely dinner at El Bohio down the road....very good and a fun setting...private and nice. She will also arrange for guided rainforest tours and other types of excursions. Shirley has 3 beautiful dogs they were great!! The evenings were magical with the sounds of the Coqui, and the gentle rainfall. All was amazing! Plus we were only a short drive to the beautiful beaches of Fajardo and Humacao. We cannot wait to go back to this magical setting.
