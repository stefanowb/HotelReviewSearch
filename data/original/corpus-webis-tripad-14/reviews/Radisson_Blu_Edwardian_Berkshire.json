I was told that we had to change room on the 4th night as all Standard Twin rooms were booked and we had to upgrade to a Delux Twin for \u00a330. Upon check in I asked if the Delux Twin was available for all 4 nights and if we could stay there but for the price of the Standard Twin room for the first 3 nights which we had booked originally and the pay the original Delux room price for the last night, the receptionist checked and answered yes, and that there was a corner room available. I asked the receptionist several times if this was correct and checked the total price for all four nights and she answered yes, corresponding to my calculations. NB! we are both Swedish and one would think this would make things easier, having the same language and all... However, on the check out it appeared that I had to pay the additional fee for the upgrade for each night! = \u00a390 extra! I felt very cheated as until then I had thought that the offer was most generous however, once I had to sign the bill I was told that it had been a \"misunderstanding\" from my part and that I had agreed to an upgrade for \u00a330 per night for all 4 nights.", "title": "Delivered fully on promises made", "user": "DorsetPeter", "date": "March 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 59904160}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Needless to say I didn\u2019t want to spoil the exit by objecting to the bill seeing that I had invited my mother to this trip and didn\u2019t want her to feel in any way obliged to share the bill, I signed and left.", "title": "Near the centre and clean.", "user": "DiManMilan", "date": "March 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 59893610}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Also due to the \"rebooking\" our room was left unclean, we had to wait until 3pm before the room was cleaned and fresh towels were provided.
