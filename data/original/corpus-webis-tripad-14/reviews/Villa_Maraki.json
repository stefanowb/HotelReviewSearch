The rooms are small and quite basic but very clean and well looked after. There are only a dozen or so apartments which meant it was far more friendly than some of the bigger hotels available. We had maid service every day and complimentary toiletries, which was nice. The pool bar was open from early till late and Saggis (apologies if the spelling is wrong) was an excellent host and makes the most wonderful mohitos and strawberry daquiries. The food was really simple but very tasty. The pool itself is rather small but really clean and welcoming. Only a few sunbeds which were quickley claimed, om a first come first served basis. Some of the apartments up up a long flight of steps which could be a problem for anyone with walking difficulties. Villa Maraki is on the main bus route (bus stop 16) and the bus runs every twenty minutes or so either into the old town, which is very cosmopolitan and is a must on an evening for people watching or to the beaches at the other end of the island.", "title": "Great Apartments", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "northumberlandsandie", "date": "June 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132245652}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed there in August 2012 and enjoyed every minute of the holiday.

For those who've not been to Skiathos before, means you are in a great location at the Maraki, next to the one main island road, with views from I would guess just about every one of the apartments out over the sea. It's a lovely and well appointed small Villa complex. The staff are really friendly and helpful, the rooms are kept clean and are tidied every day. There's a great little pool and bar and meals area as well as plenty of loungers if you don't want to wander to the nearby beaches. We've stayed three times at the Maraki and are heading back again in June for another fortnight stay - for the price, the Maraki is really hard to beat. And of an evening there's plenty of bars and restaurants within a few yards of the Villa to choose from if you prefer heading out. And if you want to self-cater there's at least two small supermarkets close by as well. If there's any drawback to the Maraki is the closeness to the road and it can get a bit noisy with buses, bikes and trucks going by, but this does settle down by evening time and certainly by night you shouldn't get disturbed by it. All in all, a great place to be.", "title": "Family friendly", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "wackyalan", "date": "February 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 151950916}], "location": {"country": "Greece", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 5, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 18}, "slim_ranking": 0.0942028985507, "description": "Villa Maraki is located at the southern coast of the island, 150 meters from the organized beach of Agia Paraskevi, near the settlement of Platanias at a distance of 6,5 kilometers from the town of Skiathos island.
