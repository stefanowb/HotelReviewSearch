The bed faces the window so waking up to the view each morning was more than I could ask for! Yes, the Intercontinental is a little expensive -for drinks mainly but we went to the store and bought our own and kept it in the room. Dinners were great - we ate at the Momoyama and the cost was no more than what we pay back home to go to dinner.

Our stay was: Thursday to Monday over St. Patrick's Day weekend. San Juan is a relatively quick and direct flight from NJ, no passports required, so off we went. Upon arrival, it seemed to me that San Juan is still caught in the 1960's and has never really progressed into the new millenium., I was there in 1968 and it all looked exactly the same. The hotel was 10 minutes from the airport, so expect lots of air-traffic noise, but you travel to the resort quickly by cab, so no long uncomfortable van rides. Our room was average-to-below average in size and style, but was clean.and did not smell. Although we had \"run of the house\" we ended up facing the street on the 7th floor. The landing path for air traffic.was our \"view\". We only stayed in our room to sleep, so it wasn't the end of the world, however I do enjoy hearing the waves at night through open windows when staying at an ocean-side resort. and missed that feature.

The beach, however, is called the Emerald Isle for a specific reason: the green seaweed.

The seaweed extends the full length of the beach, well-beyond the hotel's boundaries. If you want a beautiful beach and like to swim in the ocean, don't go here. The pool was lovely. There is one small area that is deep for swimming, the other areas are about 3' deep. Lots of little waterfalls (great for aqua massage) and a swim-up bar. The bar served well-made and strong, albeit expensive, drinks. If you plan on eating and drinking solely in the hotel figure on spending quite a lot of money ( hot breakfast for 3 averaged $70; lunch, with drinks $100; dinners was always in excess of $100, with the exception of the sushi house, where my one daughter and I had maki rolls, wine and dessert one evening for under $50.). A Walgreen's (open 24/7) down the street ( within easy walking distance) sells spring water, I'd suggest you stock up, unless you want to pay $4 for an 8oz bottle.

The hotel has gorgeous grounds, beach bar, lots of lounges with umbrellas surrounding a lagoon like pool with a little \"island\" and waterfall. It is not far from the airport and has a bus stop almost right in front that serves Old San Juan buses that are very inexpensive. Senior rate for a ride is only 35 Cents. Bus 53 takes you right to the bus station in the Old City. You can then take a free trolley from there to the many tourist stops in the Old City. There are a few local restaurants just a few blocks from the hotel. The food in the hotel is ridiculously expensive, so unless you wish to spend your vacation dollars there, take a little walk or go into Old San Juan where you can get some great cuisine for very little money. The rooms are nicely appointed, but the bathroom was pretty small and average for such an expensive place. Beds and linens are the typical Holiday Inn improved bedding--very comfortable and crisp, clean sheets. Ask for a room facing the pool and beach area. We were only at the hotel for one night prior to a southeastern Caribbean cruise. Unfortunately, the hotel is quite a distance from the port area, which is in Old San Juan, so you need to take a $25 dollar or more Taxi ride if you have any luggage, as the buses really are not equipped to handle luggage. Better to stay in Old San Juan if you are taking a cruise. The hotel has a large casino, but we did not gamble, so not sure just how large or nice it is. We ate at a little restaurant almost across from the hotel which was inexpensive and very good. Cannot remember the name, however. The hotel was a nice place to relax and enjoy the beach and pool area, however, even if for a short time.

We ended up spending more than we hoped with the nickel and dime approach (coffee in the hotel bar was $5 a cup after tip). We did go back last year, 2011 and will NOT GO BACK AGAIN. First, they refused to honor our free night certificate, saying that we didnt book thru the proper office. I spoke to the Ambassador Club rep for booking directly for this reason and was told what I had to do to retrieve the certificate. They would not honor it. They also would not upgrade our room, nor compensate us for the difference. The front desk staff are rude and will make you wait while they ingnore you and continue typing or speaking to another rep. We left the front desk after feeling defeated and went to our room. This started the trip off on a bad footing.

One day we bought an umbrella for $10.00 but if you pull your chair up to the shade of the trees by the beach bar, that works just as well. The beach bar food is fantastic and so is the food from Room Service. (Yes, pricey but easily shared by two!) We didn't eat at the main hotel restaurants but did notice they had Early Bird Specials at pretty reasonable prices. For breakfast, we ordered a la carte and didn't have the big buffet. The Continental Breakfast was also a mini buffet with cereal, yogurt, bagels, sweet rolls, fresh fruit and more. We did go across the street to Mi Casa for one breakfast, like some folks recommended. We weren't impressed. We took the local bus into San Juan ( instead of the $21.00 taxi ride) and it took about 1/2 hour and cost 75 cents; plenty of seats in the morning. My only suggestions to the hotel for improvement: the pool is too cold, the jacuzzi is not hot enough, and the music at the pool is too loud.
