We had a wonderful time and the staff was amazingly friendly. The resort is on a quiet cove, and it's only a 5 minute drive from the downtown area. Great if you want access to the \"touristy\" parts of Lake George without having to deal with it 24/7. Prior to arriving, I called and asked if there was a spa at or near the resort. The manager (her name escapes me) said that they did not have a spa, but would look into our options. Sure enough, when we arrived they had researched spas in the area and provided us with prices and info on 3 options. The staff also meet every other request with a smile. We stayed in a hotel room, not in a cabin. The room was clean and the decor was up-to-date. There is a nice patio and pool area where we they'll bring you lunch, drinks, or anything off their menu. The restaurant menu is vast and they'll make anything on the menu from early in the morning til late at night. The beach, (which is literally across the street) is small, but clean and uncrowded.

We rented a porch suite cabin & arrived VERY late at night. I checked in and walked into the cabin & noticed a weird smell. We went in anyway & I was shocked because all of the 'renovations' I had read about were NOT in our cabin (except a newer TV in the living room space)! The bathrooms are in DESPERATE need of renovation. The sheets on one of the beds were stained and were tucked into the wall to hide the stains! Anyhow, we stayed for 2 nights until I could not bear anymore- the restaurant was understocked- every time we tried to order something they were out of the item- (even, vanilla ice cream one night!) The day we checked out (two nights early and demanded a refund- which they obliged with no problem and were very polite about), we went to the \"beach\"- across the street- which was DISGUSTING! There was duck poop everywhere and we were swarmed by yellowjackets! I made my children leave the beach and we went to swim in the indoor 'heated' pool which was FREEZING! In fact, I had complained about the pool temperature two days earlier and nothing had been done (they claimed no one had informed them). Also, while changing, housekeeping BARGED in without knocking (although they claim they did knock- they definitely did NOT)!

We had 41 people from California, Boston, North Carolina and the Capital District. The ages ranged from 2 to 76. We booked our reunion weekend in the winter and took a ride up to make sure they could accommodate us. Mark and Lynn did everything to make our reunion such a great weekend. Every family had their own cabin. Mom and Dad had a hotel room booked and were surprised that they upgraded them to a one-bedroom cabin when they arrived. The cabins were very roomy and comfortable. They also were very clean and updated. We had 2 dinners catered by Dunham's Bay and they did a wonderful job. Friday night we had pizza and wings set up in the yard and Saturday night we had a chicken barbeque set up on the patio. Both meals were great, food was hot and fresh. The entire staff was very helpful and courteous. I can't say enough about how nice the staff is at Dunham's Bay. Kids and adults had a great time in the pool and using all the outdoor facilities. We used the fire pit each night and the kids loved using the swing set and ping pong table. We were lucky enough to have great weather so we were outside the entire weekend. We would definitely recommend the Dunham's Bay Lodge for a reunion or just a weekend away. Our family had a wonderful experience at the Dunham's Bay Lodge!
