The restaurant is good and not expensive. Great breakfast buffet. You can walk to River Street which is great.

We called the front desk & a friendly engineer came up really fast. He fixed the problem & said the motor was not moving. We left to do some sightseeing on the Riverwalk. A nice view & walk to River Street. Make sure you stop and get some pralines at River Street Sweets. They give samples too. We ate the first night at Huey's. It was good. Later that night we took a Ghost Walk Tour thru Savannh Walks. It was @ 9:30 & was very interesting. The guide was very nice & chatted with everyone. Don't know if the stories were true but gave you a chill when he told them. We called it a night. The next day enjoyed breakfast at the hotel (buffet) with a view. We did a lot of walking & saw most of the squares. We finally found the Mercer-Williams house. The tour was interesting. This was the setting of the famous book/movie. We ate later at the Pirates House(haunted). I took a lot of pics inside the diff. rooms. The server told us some stories. I haven't upgraded to a digital cam yet so will have to wait till I develop to see if anything shows up. Got back to the hotel @4:00 & the power went out for 1.5 hours. They had problems with generators. I was told this had happened previously. We were stuck up on the 7th. floor waiting for someone to tell us what was going on. The phones didn't work while the power was out. I had to use my cell phone to call 800 # customer care. They couldn't get thru to the hotel either. It was frustrating.
