It's located on a busy crossroads next to Rte 13, close to a number of popular dining and shopping options. There is a porte-cochere at the the entrance that facilitates unloading your vehicle during inclement weather. Unfortunately the design of the property is such that, unless you are assigned a room close to the lobby, you'll most likely want to use a closer entrance from which to carry your luggage. Some of these entries necessitate entering a corridor only to have to exit another exterior door to access stairs leading to the second floor.

The bed provided me with the best night's sleep I had over my10 night trip. Furnishings were typical \u201cmotel\u201d style. Not quite in the same league as a Hyatt, Hilton or even Hampton Inn. The carpeting was stain free and in good shape, as were the drapes. The A/C was a wall mounted unit, relatively quiet and effective in keeping the room at my desired temperature. The one glaring weak spot was the bathroom. While clean and in good repair, it was outdated by at least a couple of decades...if not in age, then in design. The Formica vanity and powder blue wall tiles reminded me of that in my parent's country cottage, built in the early 70's.

Most of the chain motels were grossly overpriced in my opinion. I paid $95 plus tax on this room which was reasonable comparing to what others were charging. I also chose it because it was so called just renovated. Well that's partially true. They have not yet done the bathrooms, but have done the rest of the room with new carpet, a very comforable recliner, Thomasville furniture and new mattresses. I felt the mattress was of great quality, however my wife hated it (said her side sagged). Plenty of fluffy pillows and new linens. Still have tube style TVs. Many renovations in hotels are going to LCD. Bathrooms are seriously out of date but they are working on them. Room was clean, quiet and comfy. Free wireless connection a plus! Elevator was dirty and got even dirtier as we stayed the two days. We went to Ithaca as part of a vacation to view the phenomenal falls in the very close area (3 major falls within a 10 mile radius). I loved the location. About 5 miles away from the busy campus but within walking distance of the very nice Pyramid mall ( they have a cement path leading to it from the back of the hotel). There is a very nice carwash, 2 Subways sandwiches, a McDonald's, an Applebee's, a Best Buy, a Borders bookstore, a Target, Dick's sporting goods etc, etc. All in walking distance. That meant a lot to us, maybe nothing to others! I felt the area was safe and I liked the Ramada that we stayed in.
