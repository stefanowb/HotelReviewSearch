I must say driving up to the property we were very disappointed, the exterior is shabby and in dire need of paint and attention. We almost drove away, I later learned the owners are slowly having things repainted and had to remove ivy on the walls, therefore the shabby appearance. This is a very old farm house, built around 1790...we like these places full of character and ambiance and we give well deserved credit to the owners for the attention, effort and money they are putting into their hotel. However, for the price we paid for our room, I do not feel we received the commiserate value. It is an old house, that understood, and again one sees that it is being painted inside also and care is being given to refurbish a difficult property to maintain. But they are not quite there, yet are charging to be there, in our humble opinion. We were first shown a room in the annex across a rather shabby courtyard, this room was quite dark, not inviting at all, so chose a more expensive option upstairs. This room was brighter and had been decorated, but in keeping with an old house which is ok, but not great comfort...bath, bed, sitting area etc. Public areas are dark, and dark colors were used in repainting and fabric. We did hear their restuarant is good but did not dine there. All in all, much credit is due the owners as I have said, and eventually with the paint and new carpet on the stairs (this was very worn and sort of a turn off) and other details, it will be a very nice option...", "title": "Great Place Near Shannon Airport", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Steven B", "date": "September 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 177309477}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Magical", "text": "location is nice , away from the airport area, sort of out in the country, and we visited a pub (Honk Pub)very nearby..one of the best pubs we visited on our trip...clean, cozy, fireplace..friendly folks!
