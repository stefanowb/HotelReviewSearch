Our garden junior suite (I think everything is a suite except the ocean view cottages) was large and comfortable, and the pools, beach, spa, and other amenities were great. The food was very pricey, and we preferred food at the bar (where there was usually great music, too): shrimp, great fries, good salads, etc. There are only three places to eat dinner in Hana: the hotel restaurant, the hotel bar, and a restaurant also owned by the hotel. Although we didn't go for the food, it would nice to have more choices. We went to relax, and that made it a perfect choice. The Hana Highway is certainly slow, but not scary. It is, however, absolutely beautiful. The hotel is a great place for quiet: even when it was full we were often alone or with only a few other people. If you're really tired, this is a great idea--and rent a convertible.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NancyPomodoro", "date": "May 16, 2007", "id": 7633002}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Everything about this hotel is top notch.

What a difference! This area really seemed to be what I always thought Hawaii was like. The hotel was very nice, peaceful and elegant. We had booked a Bay Cottage. Be warned: there is a road that runs behind many of these cottages. We were in #41. While it's a teeny town, the cars do zoom by and they seemed very loud. We expressed our concern immediately to the hotel manager and she swiftly upgraded us to a Sea Cottage (#206). That was a very nice gesture. The lay-out is great and relaxed. The wellness pool is wonderful and it's great to look at the ocean from the hot tub. I went to the spa and was pleased. Our only gripe was the main restaurant. There were only a few selections and none were under $30 for an entree. They brag about how the fish is so local, so why in the world do I have to pay $32 for it? I live in Manhattan and routinely get fabulous meals for well under that. Furthermore, the portions were very small. We found the bar food to have better prices and portion sizes. Even a small Caesar salad (with added grilled fish) was pretty filling for a light dinner. We didn't participate in any of the activities at the hotel, but did take a three-hour horseback trip through Maui Stables. The guide was great, but it was my first time on a horse and I am never doing THAT again.", "title": "Very nice, but restaurant is disappointing", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "jackarch", "date": "April 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7282023, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 solitude", "disliked": "\u2014 restaurant"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Best Place we have ever stayed!!!!", "text": "I read the earlier postings about mosquitos, but we didn't have a problem.
