The hotel is clean, well maintained with friendly staff and good breakfast. The furniture in the rooms is standard for each 3-star hotel. There is not anything special at the hotel to justify 4 stars. I made \u200b\u200ban unpleasant impression of the following facts: * When we arrived the sink was clogged and it was removed on the third day of our 4 day stay in Milan * The location of the third bed / I had booked a triple room with three beds! / Was opposite air conditioning! We were forced my son to transpose, part of the furniture to find an approachout of bed. These are not much bigger trouble and in no case can distort the pleasure of holiday, but its still annoying.

The room was noisy with traffic as it was close to a large road junction which we had not expected.

This hotel is actually 3 star rated in the hotel rating book. Personally, I would rate at best a 2 star. We stayed for one night and was thankful of this. There were bed bugs in my bed and when asked to change rooms, the staff stated no other available rooms to move us too. Breakfast was standard with cornflakes, bread. Staff were not overly friendly. There are no restaurants near this hotel and would not recommend walking anywhere in the neihbourhood after dark. If you are lucky to get a bed without bugs, would be maybe bearable as a stop over for a night and to head to duomo in the day.

When we insisted that we booked month and half ago and are not willing to share, the receptionist gave another key and asked us to see for ourselves if that room was adequete. The room was located at the ground floor next to the reception and elevator plus when we opened the curtain, only view I get to see is the rubbish bins.
