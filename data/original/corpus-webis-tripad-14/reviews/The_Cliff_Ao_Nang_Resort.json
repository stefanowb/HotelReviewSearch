We had read that the location was abit misleading from the website but as it turned out the hotel is situated at the top end of the main road that runs straight down to the beach front. It's a 10 min walk or 40baht tuk tuk ride!! There's lots of shops, bars, restaurants on the way to keep you busy..... The Cliff resort is very beautiful, secluded and quiet , which to be honest was ideal as you can see that some of the hotels further down the road by the bars etc could be abit noisy at night!!

Only about 20 rooms and all are cabins set in woodland and rooms are styled with interesting touches, lots of glass and wood and a wonderful copper sink in the outdor bathroom. Lovely pool and lounging area with perfect views of cliffs. Bar/restaurant was open all day and served lovely food. Great breakfast. A little short on loungers and more children there than I expected so not as quiet as I hoped at the time I was there. Not keen on Ao Nang though it was no worse than I expected - too 'touristy' for me but some nice restaurants and the hotel is out of the centre which was good for me but still just a 5/10 min walk to the heart of the town. Really pretty hotel, great start to the holiday but if you prefer quiet places like me just do a couple of days there like I did.", "title": "Sublime small hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "AlYorks", "date": "January 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6558060, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Poolside views", "disliked": "\u2014 Ao Nang location"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled solo", "text": "pros:", "title": "ok hotel / nice service", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "anilegna", "date": "December 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6457630, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the service at the hotel (especially the girls behind the front desk)", "disliked": "\u2014 the mosquitoes & the rooms did not provide privacy"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "~ nice view of the cliffs that Krabi is so famous for at the pool area", "title": "Disapointed with the Cliff", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Valerie-and-David", "date": "December 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 6439929, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 choice of breakfast at room or restaurant", "disliked": "\u2014 walls too thin - enabling every word spoken next door to be heard"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "~ cute /boutique hotel -- much more character then normal corporate hotels", "title": "Great Small Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "oneofurbest", "date": "December 10, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6359105, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great Standard of rooms and service", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "~ good food especially breakfast that they deliver to your room (so that you can sit outside the room to eat)", "title": "Lovely! just go!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lazybird", "date": "November 17, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6146614, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the atmosphere once you have entered the building", "disliked": "\u2014 bar closes too early"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "cute boutique hotel", "text": "very nice litle hotel. when dining in the restaurant terrace with fulmoon I thought I was dining in my veranda alone with the stuff providing me anything before I even asked for it.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jorgoskon", "date": "August 22, 2006", "id": 5693988}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "Very good prices in the restaurant with excelent quality.", "title": "A very pleasant place to spend a few nights.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "SASerF98", "date": "June 5, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5304758}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "The C iff was great.
