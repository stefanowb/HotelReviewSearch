My flight was delayed so I was put up in this hotel. I expected it to be a dingy motel, but to my surprise, the rooms were clean and even a little spacious. Obviously it wasn't the Ritz Carlton, but I can't say how relieving it is to come to a clean, comfortable room after a ten hour stay in an airport terminal. The continental breakfast was excellent. If all you want is a clean place to stay without the frills, and especially if you're a business traveler, stay here.
