Newly renovated. Full kitchen. Shop locally at the Grande Marshe in Phillipsburg to stock up on fruit, breakfast and lunch items. Air conditioning and ceiling fan. Nothing to complain about. Fresh towels and lots of them daily. Our check in was fine. Great place on the island . Central and close to all the action. Taxis are really cheap to get around, although we rented a car for a couple of days to tour the island. The car we rented was $35 a day. Drive on the right hand side , so same as home. Speed bumps everywhere so nobody speeds. No traffic lights. Few stop signs. Lots of traffic-circles. All drivers are very courtious. Easy to drive around on your own. Divi staff was friendly. Eugene at the Activities Desk was most helpful and honest. Lots of water sports right on site. Snorkeling to see pretty fish right in the Divi bay. Some saw fish on a small reef 20 feet off the Divi beach. Food in the Seaside Cafe was good and reasonably priced. Food in the Tuscon Restaurant was just ok. Eat there a night or two, but lots of choices in Phillipsburg.. a $6 taxi ride. Everything is American currency, and prices about the same as a U.S. city.

Like many other people we were very hesitant about staying at Divi Little Bay. The resort has the potential to be an outstanding resort -- neglect from previous management has left the resort in need of repairs. However, we were extremely fortunate. Our room was absolutely fabulous; 1 bedroom casita that was recently redone. In fact we were only the second people to stay the newly remodeled 1 bedrooms. During check in I told the front desk attendent that I was a little concerned about our room and they told security to take us to the room to see if we wanted it. We opened the door and saw a nice living room with a high-def flat screen TV, small kitchen with cherry cabinets, king bed with 42 inch high def flat screen. Needless to say we took the room and couldn't have been happier. The view from the porch allowed me to look at the ocean while enjoying the morning coffee. If you need ideas for things to do, go see Eugene (she is in charge of helping you plan your activities off of the property). She is great and her suggestions are spot on. The spa at Divi is great. My wife and I enjoyed a massage the first morning we were there and it was a great experience. The following day my wife had a pedicure and commented it was one of the best she had ever received. The food at Divi is okay. We always enjoyed having lunch at the Seabreeze pool. Food was good and the wait staff really enjoyed their job. Breakfast and dinner are at Toucan's. The staff and the food was just okay. We only had breakfast once and it was pretty good. Dinner on the other hand left something to be desired; my advice is to enjoy dinner at one of the local establishments because the food and service our great. We used the taxi for the first 6 days then grew familiar enough to rent a jeep for the last three days. The taxi drivers were really enjoyable to speak with and never tried to rip you off. Two rules to pay attention to: always negotiate the price prior to getting in and only use taxi's that have taxi xxx on their license plate. Using other cabs isn't advised (that's what we were told). Divi provides a 3 hour island tour and I would highly recommend it. It allowed us to become familiar with the island along with areas to be careful in. We rented a car from Thrifty on property and I really felt uncomfortable. The individual went really fast and the car we received was a piece of junk. Needless to say we only had a one day rental. Later in the week we used Original Car Rental and the experience was great. Dorsette is great and is extremely helpful. The next time we go there we will schedule our rental car ahead of time and will pick it up at the airport. Price for jeeps will run $65 a day and an extra $12 for insurance. The beaches are beautiful and there isn't enough time in the day to enjoy all of them. Divi is undergoing major restoration; we were told restoration will be complete in 2008.

Although they did give me a room for the night and I did have to check out and get a new room the next day, they were pretty accomidating with all things considered. I am not completely sure this was their fault or Orbitz, but someone went wrong somewhere. The first night in my room, I awoke with over 8 mosiquito bites on my face, chest and arms! The meals at the resort were just ok and the service was the same. We took the advice from other Trip Advisor reviews and went to the end of the Divi to the other small resort and ate at the Gingerbread Cafe. Great food, espically breakfast. The resort was under construction, rarely did the room keys work with the first 3 - 5 tries. Buckets and brooms were left in the room by the maid the entire stay, and some days we would get 2 towels, other days sometimes more towels, but no wash cloths. We requested extra pillows 2 different times in 1 day and when they finally came, the one pillow smelled terribly of cat urine. The activities were ok...the managers party had next to no food for the amount of people attended as well as ran out of beer within the first 1/2 hour of the 2 hour gathering. I can go on and on...but as my title says lots of little things begin to add up. Last but certainly not least...the rental car. If no one gets anything from this review other than what I am about to say and show you in the pictures, I will be happy and can believe that I have saved a few lives. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT rent a car from Thrifty. Although you might think it is convient because there is a Thrifty right on Divi's property, take my advice and don't. After driving the rental for 3 days we find ourselves stranded on the French side of the island with our tire hanging on the car by the hubcap. Unable to pull off the road completly and beg 2 locals to help us, we realize the car they rented to 2 twenty-something girls (one who is pregnant) had the front rim completely rusted and eroded away to the point where not a single lug nut was keeping the tire on the car! Needless to say after paying people to change the tire and paying more locals to put air in the flat spare we counted our blessing the entire drive back to the resort. After being relieved of making it back alive, we get blamed for causing the damage and are told we are responsible by the Thrifty rep. I didn't know rust can occur in 3 days time! After lots of arguring and getting nowhere...Divi Gen. Mngr. stepped in and was very helpful with the situation, but now being home, things are still not resolved with the charges I incurred from Thrifty. After checking out and being charged for the entire stay when I paid through Orbitz ahead of time was another hassle to get resolved but did quickly once the mngr came in for the day. Friends of mine were charged $156 internet fee, which didn't apply to them being neither had a pc and then was deducted once something was said.
