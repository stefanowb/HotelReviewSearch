The hotel is in a great location, only a few minutes' walk from the town and beaches, the main road with buses to Antibes and Cannes (one euro), and the railway station for trains to the same and other destinations (Nice, Monaco, Grasse etc). With its lush green gardens full of palm trees and cacti, it's a tranquil oasis away from the hordes. The hotel is well maintained, professionally run and well organised, and offers free wi-fi. The pool area is idyllic and management keep an eye out to ensure it stays that way - for example, if groups of children start shouting and splashing, they'll be asked to keep the noise down so that other guests can relax in peace - very civilised! After the so-called three-star hotels we've stayed in in Paris, our room here was a pleasant surprise: plenty of space, basic but adequate furnishings, a very comfortable bed, and two lovely surprises: a small balcony area which we hadn't expected, with a lovely view over the gardens and pool; and a fridge, which proved invaluable - so nice to have cold drinks on tap! My only complaint was that although overall it was quite clean, there were some parts of the room that had not been cleaned for a long time (don't look under the bed!!). Disposable beakers were never replaced once used; glasses were never washed or replaced; shower gel was only replenished twice in 14 days; and some of the towels were very thin and had definitely seen better days.
