The hotel was too busy to change room but a very nice friendly receptionist assured me the noise would die down and it did. The food from the bistro - I had crab cakes - was awful, though cheap - very disappointing. But there was a trio of Irish musicians who played and brought the whole place to life. The ironing board I was given had very little padding and left a pattern from the underlying metal grid on my outfit - not a good look! I slept well, breakfast was good and check-out was painless.
