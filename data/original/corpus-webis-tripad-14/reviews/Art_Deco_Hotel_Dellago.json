The hotel is located on lake Lugano, which is great! The hotel restaurant is also very nice, with nice staff and great food! But the rooms are terribly loud and uncomfy. I got the impression that the hotel was a newly built facility, but I could have gathered from the hotel website that this is not the case, it is in fact a renovated building. Unfortunately, whilst renovating they must have forgotten to isolate the rooms as I could not sleep a single minute due to cars outside and other guests inside (I sleep lightly). Breakfast made up for a bit, but still, sleep is of importance in a hotel for me. My advice: have dinner here and sleep somewhere else!", "title": "Dissappointing", "user": "Wasbeer", "date": "June 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 7869042, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location", "disliked": "\u2014 The rooms"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled on business", "text": "In those early morning hours between asleep and awake, my thoughts turn to the Hotel Dellago, and beautiful Melide, The incredible and entirely individual rooms, the views, the veranda for breakfast and coffee, the deck for lounging, the day beds, a perfect spot to enjoy a nite cap before retiring.........I cannot wait to return, and try another room in this Fabulous hotel.", "title": "Hotel Del Lago........FABULOUS!", "user": "VeryFineFeline", "date": "June 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7831513, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 EVERYTHING!", "disliked": "\u2014 NADA"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Almost like heaven", "text": "Outstanding Hotel, great view over lake and mountains, amazing rooms all designed differently (we had booked Lemon & Lime, which was perfect for a small family with 18 months old kid).
