This hotel is not directly serviced by the Downtown Airporter (shuttle between airport and downtown hotels) but the hotel immediately next door (the Warwick) is a stop so you can get off there and then walk the 1/2 block to the Andra. It's a lovely boutique hotel--appears recently remodeled. Very modern lobby with cozy fireplace. The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. My room was spacious with 2 queen beds, sitting area, bar area. Decor is very modern---kind of Ikea-esque. View of neighboring construction site, unfortunately, but interestingly enough I never really heard the annoying sounds of construction. Pretty small bathroom compared to other hotels but nice nevertheless. Frette towels and Face Stockholm bath products---luxurious! They had a very small business center with 2 computers and printers--free of charge. I didn't use the gym so I can't comment. Had to pay a daily rate for in-room wireless. Lots of great eating options within walking distance. The restaurant in the lobby, Lola, is AMAZING! A Tom Douglas establishment that has a mediterranean theme and definitely lived up to the hype. There's also another Tom Douglas restaurant across the street, Dahlia Lounge, that had the most amazing donuts on the menu for dessert, served warm with marscarpone cheese and green apple butter. Again, amazing! Adjacent to that is the Dahlia bakery, which is great for that cup of morning coffee and a pastry.
