It took almost an hour for the main course (fish) to arrive and when it did it was cold. We had to send it back and wait another 15-20 minutes for them to try again. It was a little better second time around, but still not right and by the time it had arrived we had finished the wine and didn't feel like ordering more. It seemed they had real problems in the kitchen that night. This was probably because it was the weekend and - the hotel mainly being aimed at mid-week business users - many of the key kitchen staff would be taking their nights off. In my experience this is an issue with other business hotels. There is, however, no excuse for poor service, especially given the restaurant prices. One other moan about the restaurant - there was no atmosphere at all. A little music would have helped. To his credit , the restaurant manager responsed to our complaints in a very professional and courteous manner, but he obviously didn't have the staff to resolve the problems.

It's in a great location in a beautiful part of the city, just enough off the busy roads to give you a sense of being in a neighborhood, while still being close to any exploring you would want to do. But what really sets this place off is its friendly and helpful staff, from the efficient front desk who greet you personally, to the wait staff in wonderful Butler's restaurant. We were fortunate to have our daughter, her boyfriend and two of their friends join us at the last minute for dinner, and Butler's sat us right away at a large table in a nice area that made it feel special. We had a great waiter with the perfect personality who took a personal interest in our group, brought meals quickly to two who had to catch a train, and even accommodated my order for something that wasn't on the dinner menu! That meant a lot to us. Often in a big city you don't get such personal attention. Our room was not large, but that is very typical of London, and it was impeccably decorated and nicely appointed. The Chesterfield is not a large property, so each room is decorated individually, as opposed to a large chain hotel. This gives the hotel a unique personality, and true English charm.

My favorite was the Scottish eggs Benedict (that is a muffin, poached eggs and Scottish smoked salmon). The hotel is about a five minute walk to the Green Park tube station and about a fifteen minute walk to Piccadilly. The hotel is lavishly decorated; we felt as if we were staying in a 19th century mansion. Of course, there were all the amenities: sat.

In fact our expectations were exceeded, from Ben and Darih in Reservations who made the process so straight forward and were so nice, Chris our concierge, who was charming and extremely knowledgeable, sharing the old joke that you can even get an elephant from Harrods, and he would try if I really wanted one, to Armand who searched high and low for a cocktail recipe for my friend even ringing the establishment where she had last drank it. The receptionist was also lovely, unfortunately I did not get her name, but she remembered ours when we returned from our sightseeing and were so tired. So many hotels talk the talk but very few walk the walk, The Chesterfield walks to walk. Thank you to all at The Chesterfield for making our stay so special, from being able to request feather pillows and duvets to lovely club sandwiches from room service. It was like staying in a lovely country home with old friends as hosts.
