Our room on the first floor overlooked the sea (through the trees) and had a double and a single bed although we had only booked a double. The ensuite was fairly small and you didn't need to be too fat to get through the curved sliding shower doors. It had obviously been updated of late and was smart. You were served breakfast but it came quite quickly with a fair range of food for 2 star. The staff in particular were most friendly and most helpful. There is some hotel parking at the back with access through the ballroom. This is a two star hotel - don't expect 3/4 star decor/appointments. The fact that Exmouth Rotary & Round Table both meet here must say a lot about its local reputation.", "title": "Good value for money seaside hotel - super staff!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jj-the-jetsetter", "date": "August 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 170359443}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "I stayed with two family members in May 2013. The building is very old so a bit quirky (for me that adds character) but well maintained and clean and tidy everywhere. The staff are unfailingly helpful and friendly. The food is good with a varied choice on the menu and good sized servings. The room price included a three course breakfast and four course dinner - amazing!
