CONS::: Lack of service around the pools, lack or service in the restaurants. Lack or help anywhere and not enough staff. Dinner at the buffet was horribly dry and for a five star hotel more is expected at $55 after tax$service per person. Furniture is wore out in the bedrooms, in the lounge and in the lobby. Pool tiles were missing and no services at the pool. Also if you stopped to have someone get you something they will make you feel like they are doing you a favor., SAVE your money and go to the Marriott next door or the Crown Plaza.

Loud piped music relayed across the extensive site (it can even be heard from the Dead Sea) gives it the ambience of a low-grade holiday camp rather than luxury hotel. It is worst wherever there is a pool with a restaurant. We found the quietest, most relaxing place outside to be the Sunken Pool, where there is no food outlet to attract the flies either. But piped noise also infects the large Obelisk restaurant, which is a bit like feeding time at the zoo. Breakfast on the Codes restaurant terrace was civilised (but closed on Sundays). We didn't find a restaurant entirely to our liking for dinner but we enjoyed a light meal on the balcony of the Summerian bar. Our room (with balcony and sea view) was spacious but very grey: it looked like a very large prison cell. And some things just didn't work; for example, the minibar was never cold, despite an engineer's visit & water in the shower drained the wrong way. It was as if designers and architects had conspired against practicality and common sense. On a positive note, the staff were delightful: friendly and unfailingly helpful; the pool boys keep everyone supplied with complimentary water. But this Russian monument to excess (some \"interesting\" clientele) is supposedly modelled on the hanging gardens of Babylon; we hope ancient Babylon was more peaceful.

From the second we arrived till when we left my wife and my experience at this property was a complete and utter disaster. To start off, when we arrived it took them well over an hour to get us checked in, then we got to our room which had a broken and empty 'complimentary' mini fridge. The sliding glass door to our ground floor suite had a broken lock so anyone could come in and steal all our stuff if they so wished (to which the hotel told us to lock up everything in the safe lol). We went to the pool (which was the only nice thing at this joke of a hotel) and decided to have lunch at their poolside restaurant, the food was also terrible, first they brought us burnt hamburgers with barely palatable french fries, the meal came with a \"Salad\" which was a coffee cup filled with lettuce and absolutely nothing else. The dinner was equally disgraceful. The next day, we were so unhappy we decided to leave early, but not before I complained to the hotel's manager. After hearing the horror story of our stay, he simply looked at me and said, \"if you don't like our hotel, next time, don't stay here.\" Very unsatisfied by his response, I went home and send two emails. The first to the General Manager of the hotel, and the second to Kempinski International HQ. To the first email, I received a quaint email from the gentleman in which he asked me to let him know when I would be coming back to his hotel so he could make sure they gave us good service (I'm never going back there obviously) and as for the second email, I never got any response from them (great job quality control). Two things are certain, regarding the Kempinski Hotel Ishtar Dead Sea, I will never go back there, and regarding Kempinski in general, I will probably never go to any of their hotels worldwide.
