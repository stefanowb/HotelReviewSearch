This place is fabulous- nothing bad to say!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "quaint secret gardens", "text": "The moment we arrived I felt at ease and was amazed at how beautiful this hidden paradise was. We were greeted by Carlos who provided us with Mimosas as we checked in and received a tour of the grounds. It is so rare to find people who actually care in the service industry and I was massively impressed by the commitment of everyone that we met there. A special thank you to Carlos (who knows EVERYTHING to do in town!), Billy (the best darn bartender and boat captain), Alicia (who has the best turtle stories!), and of course to Kate- we see why you are so proud of everyone and everything there.

A quaint place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of Duval street and its many tourists. We stayed in the garden rooms where it was a lovely retreat. It was peaceful and elegant. The staff were so kind and very helpful. They gave you the history of key west and the very best reccomendations to dine, drink, and explore. Carols was very helpful and reccommended only the best places to go. The grounds were beautifully maintained and the staff made you feel like you were home. The rooms were very well kept. Marble bathrooms, Aveda products, hotel collection towels, cozy beds with fabulous pillows, and old world charm. This place definately felt like home away from home. Breakfast was available daily with a variety of fruits, muffins, juices and coffee. I found this lovely retreat in the book 1,000 places to see before you die. If you travel to Key West it is the place to stay. High class without the pretentious attitudes. For fine dining we reccomend the A&B Marina, Michaels, Loui's Backyard (If you ignore the reviews the backyard is something to see and we are Jimmy B fans and had to be there!!)~ to drink we enjoyed Turttle Kraals (loved Chucky) conch republic, sloppy joe's, Hog's Breath Saloon, green parrot was okay if you want to be with the locals and we thought we did but their not too friendly. Hemingway House was great but definatley stick around to get the tour because, if you don't, you won't know what the hell your looking at and its definately interesting. Sunset tour is great and we used Fury for our excursions. We definatley enjoyed their 2 man band Cory Heydon was great to listen to and watching the sunset. I am a little disappointend that Key West doesnt equally revere Jimmy Buffett as much as they say they do. I'm sure they're tired of the Jimmy Buffett questions but, being from Philly I thought that they would show a little more respect to someone who put them on the map( obviously Heminway did but that's a really long time ago) I am a big JB fan. I thought they would at least be kind to him. That was a disappointmen! Carlos gave us great advice and steared us to where we wanted to be. Mr. Z's (from Philly) the best pizza and cheese steaks. Great fries too! He was so kind and very helpful also. Also if your going to go jet skiing check out the Wilkes Barre boys down on the Marina. Can't think of the name but their located right next to the tikki bar on the end.", "title": "Lovely!!!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "sschilling", "date": "September 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8850888, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Intimate and Peaceful", "disliked": "\u2014 No complaints.
