We were met by a very able porter, who deftly delivered our heavy baggage to our accommodations, 82 steps down the cliff-side, and by \"Rose\", the owner/proprietor of the Chelidonia Villas. Thus began a seven day adventure that dreams are truly made of. Rose welcomed us with a fine bottle of Domaine Sigalas Assyrtiko white wine in the refrigerator, sweet green grapes, and a very pungent blend of imported German coffee in the kitchen, for the next weeks worth of breakfasts... we provided the Greek yogurt, bananas, peaches and honey from the market down the street. Next to the market is the bakery featuring a vast array of home made breads, cakes, sweets, and the best baklava that anyone could imagine. Our traditional cave-villa was cozy, clean and very comfortable: a living/sitting/dining room, fair-sized bedroom with a very comfortable bed, large bathroom with enclosed stand-up shower, and a small step-down kitchenette. Throughout were antique wooden furnishings: desk, wardrobe, bureau, along with several unique lamps, lighting fixtures, candles and lanterns... very romantic! The daytime heat was pretty intense, especially the afternoons (90 - 95 degrees Fahrenheit) but the air-conditioning was well up to the task. Nights were about 20 degrees cooler and we slept wonderfully. Views from our private patio were stunning... a jaw-dropping vista of cobalt-blue water and boats of all shapes and sizes, with the cliffs of Thira/Fira rising beyond and far above the caldera. Rose was very helpful to offer his suggestions of favorite restaurants (1800, Ambrosia, Roka) and local sites of interest (Domaine Sigalas Winery). His wife, Erika, was especially attentive to the details of booking our stay and in arranging our transfer to Chelidonia from the port where we had arrived by ferry. They made it easy for us upon departure as well... a porter lugged the bags (again up 82 steps) and a taxi-van was on-time at 5:30AM sharp, for a twenty minute trip to the airport. Oia is heaven on earth and we really hated to leave, but we promise to return... to Chelidonia!!
