It was an ideal stop on the first night of our trip down through France on our way to Spain. The village is beautiful and the hotel is right in the centre just before the bridge over a beautiful river. Our bedroom looked out (from the bathroom admittedly) over the river and we had french windows leading to the gardens adjacent to the river. Wonderful location. The bedroom itself was not huge but nicely decorated and adequate.", "title": "Fabulous Location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "S_G_Taylor", "date": "August 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 38761400}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Normandy", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 4, "very good": 9, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 4}, "slim_ranking": 0.75}
