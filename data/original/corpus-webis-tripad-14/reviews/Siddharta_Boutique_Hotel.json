The breakfast is very good and once again served by staff always with a lovely smile on their faces. We ate in the restaurant one night of our stay as well and it was also good food, reasonably priced to the restaurants in town. Would recommend using the tuk tuk drivers the hotel can organise to use for the day, they are available from sunrise to sunset and are lovely people and at $15 for the day this is a excellent price. It was nice to come back to a friendly face awaiting us after visiting the temples, with a nice cold bottle of water. Ask for Phan You, he was a lovely driver. Overall this is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in travelling around the world, they even had a surprise birthday cake in our room for my partner on his birthday! It makes such a difference staying in a hotel where all the staff are so friendly and genuinely appreciate your stay.
