Our apartment was large and everything you wanted was there. Modern too. The views are without a doubt, the best I;ve stayed in - ocean ocean and more ocean. The lovely hot spa was a real treat after shopping - soooo relaxing. Will definitely be back - maybe bring the children next time and stay in a 2 bedroom apartment.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "matt074", "date": "April 2, 2010", "id": 60214806}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We recently stayed 7 nights .The pool and grounds were beautiful but our apartment needed a makeover .We were told on arrival the dishwasher was not working and a repairman had been called .He didn't arrive and it was out of order for the week.(no one kept us informed)The main bedroom furniture was old and having to hold the curtains closed with pegs to keep out the light was annoying. It all also needed a good dust. When we booked we asked for an uninterupted ocean view but we were given a side front corner. Beautiful views... but. Also we have never heard of being charged an extra fee per night if we wanted airconditioning or DVD player.Reception service was ordinary. The balconies are long but if you have a bunch of friends holidaying together they are way too narrow for a gathering.It is nice & close to the restuarants & shops and the beach is just perfect.", "title": "Apartment needs a makeover", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Sunnyloves", "date": "January 29, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 54649094}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We recently stayed 11 nights in the Boulevard Towers, while the view and the pool area was wonderful the particular apartment we had was shabby, tired and grubby.

Unfortunately, weather put a downer on our holiday as we only saw the sun for 3 hours one morning! Boulevard Towers best features are it's excellent location to beach and short walk to shops and restaurants. Also the pool, spa and BBQ area was very clean and modern having recently been renovated. The view from our very roomy 3 bedroom oceanfront room was amazing thank goodness as we spent a lot of time in there. Now for the not so good. Service is pretty much non-existent. Very unfriendly and unhelpful staff. The place was pretty empty when we were there and we were told we couldn't have late checkout because they were full as it was school holidays. Unfortunately, our apartment was very dated and dirty with a many faulty appliances, unattractive furniture and fittings. The balcony was very narrow. Tiny, slow elevators that didn't fit our 4 cases. The indoor pool is the size of a spa and a dirty green colour. I feel the 3 bedroom apartment was extremely overpriced. Friends holidaying with us paid much less at the new Wave apartments which were beautiful and modern with lovely large balconys with outdoor chairs and tables, flat screen TV's, two pools and a gym.
