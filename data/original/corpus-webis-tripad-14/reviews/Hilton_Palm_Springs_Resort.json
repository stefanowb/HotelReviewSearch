Hotel is conveniently located just one block and easy walking distance to the Convention Center. The Hotel is very large and extensive and depending on where your room is located can be quite a hike from the lobby. Signage in the lobby wasn't that great considering its sprawling footprint. It is a nice 3 story hotel and my room was on the 2nd floor with a balcony overlooking a magnificient pool area. Room was clean and well appointed although the renovated wing (at least from the outside) looked very nice. Towels were generous and soft and the bed was very comfortable. The TV's need upgrading in this day of inexpensive flat screens. It was an older, smaller analog TV with terrible picture and reception. Room was very quiet with no issues. Lobby was appointed very nicely and the staff was very friendly and courteous. The pool was basically empty all of the time but the staff at the pool was helpful, even offering to \"make up\" a lounger chair for me. Drinks are availabe at the pool which makes things very nice. Parking is an extra $12 per day for self parking and $18 for valet. I thought this was a bit expensive since Palm Springs is an expansive area.

For those who are unable to sleep without a total blackout, you may also find this challenging, as there are no curtains. The bathroom was clean but also dated, and the sofa and chair in the room had faded and stained upholstery. The bed was a notable exception, with a very comfy mattress and pillows, and nice, soft linens.
