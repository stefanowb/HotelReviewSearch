The staff is great, the view is breath taking, the grounds are immaculate. The hotel is sooo beautiful The transportation to and from the airport, and for tours has improved greatly! We only ate at the Orchid, all buffet, restaurant, which is so enjoyable. Being a true Southerner, I wasn't crazy about a lot of the food, but I always found something I enjoyed. The maitre' d is a pleasure and gentleman. The open air cafe on the beach was so enjoyable. The fact that there was unlimited daiquiri's made everything seem very peaceful! There is not a LOT of entertainment or shopping on site, but some.

The food was excellent and very plentiful, the a la carte resturants were fantastic. our room was beautiful and kept clean at all times, we had turn down service every night which was nice. The staff were all wonderful, very polite and friendly, the beach was fantastic, the pool was great, no flies or any bugs which was great, we were club golden and we were treated like royalty. Free internet every day, we did the shopping tour which was really nice and I won a bottle of rum which was nice, good rum. Our check out was a breeze and we were already checked into our rooms as soon as we got on the bus at the airport because we were club golden members, we heard a lot of bad reviews before we went but we can honestly say that this hotel should be rated higher than a 5 star in our opinion. We had stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe in DR which was no where close to this BP in Jamaica, we have been to Cuba twice which I loved but I have to say Jamaica was way better, the Jamaica people are just so down to earth and very friendly, we were not bothered by anyone like we had heard you would be.", "title": "Excellent Trip!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Missy C", "date": "August 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 37972530}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "It was so relaxing we didn't want to leave.

It was our first time out of the country and what a time we had! Im glad our first trip like this turned out as well as it did! The resort is fairly big, very clean and well kept. The staff was so friendly and made you feel welcome as soon as you arrived. Our room was at the top floor, it was very spacious with a lovley balcony. The bathroom was very nice, it had a separate stand up shower and jacuzzi. We also had an amazing view from our room, it overlooked the pool and beyond that was the beach and ocean.. simply breath taking. Our maid did a great job of keeping it clean for us, but only got one towel art when others got them every day, a little dissapointing. But the mini bar was stocked daily with water, beer, soft drinks and chips.

We stayed for one week and didn't leave the hotel. We just had a fab week relaxing !!! The hotel and location was fabulous and contrary to previous reviews we found the hotel staff very friendly and happy to help and sometimes embarrased to accept a tip ! We went at the end of July and the complex seemed very quiet with no problem getting loungers & although the pool areas did get taken up early half the beach was empty daily and thats where we went as it was quieter (lots of party music and activities by the pool) The weather was great and the water was gorgeously warm in the bay. All the rooms are the same at this complex and classed as junior suites and they are very spacious and comfortable. You get a mini fride in your room with all-inclusive beer,pop& water which is a bonus and some rooms have tea/coffee facilities too. There is building work going on at this complex but we were as far from it as possible so didn't even notice it and i would think as its only on going in the day you can escape to the beach and still not be effected by it. We were in block 18 which is farthest from building work if you want to specifiy a block in any advance request/correspondence with hotel. The only downside of this holiday to me were the mosquitos. Now i have been all round the world and have had the occasional bite or two from mosquitos but i found the mosquitos in jamaica in a league of there own. On arrival we were allocated a ground floor room and as soon as we entered we could see mosquitos flying around. I was bitten quite badly the first two days even though i was covered in deet, had insect repellent in my sun lotion, put plug ins in the room and got spray off a maid to spray room. I told our rep Patrick (he is fab by the way!) this on day 3 and by noon we had been moved to the 4th floor. Great service. You could tell as soon as you walked in this room that it was better as no splat marks of mosquitos on walls/ceilings unlike the ground floor room which was covered :-) I still got a few more bites during the holiday but having a room high up (there are 5 floors at this complex) really did help stop me being eaten alive. My husband on the other hand didn't get a single bite !!! A previous report by someone of blood on their bed must have been mosquito related !!! For those of you that way inclined there is a nudest beach at this location with its own beach bar but we are not that way inclined so can not give a review of it only to say it is well out of the way and you would have to really go that extra bit to get to it, it is private so no worries about children, nuns, etc stumbling on it :-) Overall i would really recommend this hotel, it has one of the best reputations on the island and i cant knock it because of mosquitos (thats mother nature for you) Have a fab time :-)", "user": "Derbyshire-MrsS", "date": "August 24, 2009", "id": 38660297}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "First of all, if you're looking for the Ritz then go some place else.
