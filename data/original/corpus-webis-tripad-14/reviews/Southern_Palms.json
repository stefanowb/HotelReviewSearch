The hotel has a parrot, fish and lots of resident cats. In addition the water sporst center has sand toys, floaty toys, balls and boogie boards for kids. THere is miniture golf and a lovely beach. The beach is frequented by turtles, and my husband and son managed to snorkel with them one morning when the water was calm. This beach does tend to have larger surf than Rockley or the West Coast beaches. The room itself was pretty basic, although large. The paint was sloppy and furnishings spartan, but the balcony was great. THe location on the beach and on the St Lawrence Gap was excellent.
