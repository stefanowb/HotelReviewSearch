The hotel is only a few blocks from the main train station (Hbf) and we had no problems even though we were rolling suitcases. It is true that you pass by some sports betting and adult entertainment, but it was not seedy and we had no issues. I was surprised how large the rooms were and it was nice to have the small kitchen (which even had a dishwasher). There are 2 grocery stores within a few blocks so it was easy to get food. We stayed 4 nights and therefore did not have daily maid service (only get that for 3 nights and below) so we just left the Murphy bed down the entire time. The bed was comfortable which surprised me. There was a closet and plenty of space to store things and it seems like we even had extra room available. Our room was right outside the elevator but we never heard anyone the entire time we were there so don't worry if you get that room.", "title": "Great price, location, and stay", "user": "robstrash", "date": "January 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 149790705}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "The room does not have wifi but does have an ethernet jack and the front desk offered us a cable but I brought my own.

They gave us a detailed city map as soon as we got to the hotel so don\u2019t bother queuing up for one at the tourist centre and paying for it. There were lots of sightseeing leaflets opposite reception. The apartment was very modern and clean. Kitchen was very clean and equipped with fridge, microwave, cooker and dishwasher. The kitchenette was also very well equipped with utensils which came in handy as we were in Munich for New Years Eve and New year\u2019s day and most food venues were closed.

The sofa could be two singles as one is a trundle bed and when out not a great deal of room, however there was only two of us and therefore one got the large bed in the small separate bedroom while the other made up the sofa bed. The kitchen is only big enough for one person but that was fine and it served our purposes. Bathroom was separate and off a small walkway near the door. We ordered a back apartment away from the main street as we arrived after a 21 hour flight and needed to sleep.As it was, we were out early every day of our remaining three and back late so the size did not concern us. Everything worked fine and the shower was hot, the building is reasonably new...We expected no turn down service or linen change and we had to take our rubbish out, but that was just down the hall. Small sitting area downstairs and dining room but we didn't require either...best thing was it was only a block away from the south entrance to the main train station and a bit further to get our two day tour buses out to Bavaria and Salzberg...plenty of shopping as the Aldstadt is in walking distance straight down the end of the street..Aldi in the street, shops in the main station and takeaway eateries and this also meant we were away easily on foot with luggage to the station to head to Innsbruck. Consider the size for a family though and prices went up in the week before the Octoberfest. Fortunately we booked well in advance and got a good price.

The bed pulls out of the wall meaning that during the day you have a little lounge which to me is nicer than having to sit on the bed all the time. The hotel was really close to the train station and also to the main pedestrian centre of Munich (an easy walk). Unfortunately no wifi in rooms only wired (the hotel can provide you with a network cable). Wifi is available free in the lobby though. The hotel also provides 2 washing machines and a dryer but there is a laundromat around the corner that is half the price and very easy to use so I wouldn't bother with the hotel. Other negative was the cleaning service, if you stay 1 - 3 nights you get daily cleaning but between 4 - 7 you get nothing, not even a towel change or extra toilet paper. They say this is how they keep prices down, but I stayed 5 nights in Berlin for less and got daily cleaning so...

There was an iron and safe in the room. The staff at the hotel were lovely and were happy to give you directions and suggestions. The street was a little noisy so a room at the back would be suggested. On the day I checked in the Oktoberfest parade was on so could not gain access to the hotel. After sitting for a while, I managed to see a lady on the street who worked at the hotel and who managed to get me and my luggage across the road. They also let me checkin early which was great.
