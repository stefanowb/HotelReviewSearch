We very much enjoy coming back year after year. The rooms are very nice. Clean and well kept, with maid service everyday. They have plenty of room and good size kitchens. We stayed in a two bedroom. Some two bedrooms have a king bed in each and others have a king bed in one room and two twins in the other. The one or two bedrooms have a pull out couch in the main room. The beds are quite comfortable but the pull out couch is not. Good enough for kids, but an adult would not be too happy on one. There are two main pools. One is relaxed and more for adults. The other one has two large water slides and organized activities going on most of the day i.e,, bingo, pool volleyball. My 8 and 11 yr old very much enjoy the goings-on of the activity pool. The beach is right there and the waves are just big enough to do a little boogie boarding, but the current is never very strong so the weak swimmer can feel safe. I really like the friendly service. The staff always seems more than happy to help. Room service food is very good. The pool side food is very good and at a good price. The restaurant \"Mayapan\" has been disappointing, the Tulum restaurant is better. Monday nights they have a Mexican Fiesta which has a floor show with Mexican music and dance. it is fun night if your a first-timer.", "title": "Great for Families", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Bruin84", "date": "August 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19560461, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Rooms, pool, friendly staff, price.", "disliked": "\u2014 pull out couch, time share presentation offers."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The last two times we went we have been going out to restaurants in the area.

The key is how to avoid the issue if that is what you want to do. The wristbands are a signal to the \"pink shirts\" that are aggressive (they chased us our the front door one day) if they think they can get you to a session. We followed the advice of a prior post and cut them off after the second day. The key is to put them in the safe as you have to turn them in when you leave. You may lose the \"discount\" (5%) if you do not have them on, but the hotel did honor the discount anyway. You do have to look out for the guys at the tiki hut at the entrance as they will try and get you to go to the timeshare sell as well. Overall the hotel is nice. They did put us in a room that was below what we had reserved (we had a king suit, they put us in a tower with two doubles), only to move us back to the main complex and a king suite. The only problem was they gave the same room to someone later and they walked in as we were getting ready to go out. No foul, and felt bad for them.
