I had the melon and red jelly terrine, the melon was tasteless and it was not a great combination but it was pleasant enough for a starter.

The main course arrived but the shared vegetables had a coating of nuts and so we were asked if we wanted them changed, bit odd considering we had ordered one portion without nuts due to an allergy, bit of a wait to get fresh nut free veg.
