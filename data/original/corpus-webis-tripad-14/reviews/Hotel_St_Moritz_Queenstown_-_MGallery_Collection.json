Value for money was certainly not there - staff were helpful but the room was not inviting or up to the standard we expected. Room was verging on small, beds were adequate but pillows good. The bathroom looked a little tired and lacklustre. We expected much more for the money we paid. The added car parking cost was again rather a little rich considering the tariff paid already ( no way would you use the internet or pay $26 per head for breakfast!). Queenstown is an interesting place , much more advanced than my last visit in 2002. When there is snow falling and the Remakables are dusted white it really is spectacular.
