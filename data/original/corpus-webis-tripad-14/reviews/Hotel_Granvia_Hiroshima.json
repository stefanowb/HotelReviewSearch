I was torn between the Hotel Granvia Hiroshima and the Sheraton. I read good and bad reviews about both. I'm SO glad that we chose to stay at Hotel Granvia Hiroshima. It's very convenient to the train station and not difficult to find at all. We stayed on the 17th floor, which boasted nice city views. There are six elevators that are all extremely fast, so we never had issues getting to our room. There are several restaurants at the hotel to choose from. We had breakfast included in our package, so we only dined at the Western style breakfast buffet. There was plenty of variety and the food was good. We visited the hotel bar once. I thought that the drink prices were a little expensive, but if you go during happy hour (5-8pm), drinks are half price! Additionally, the service at the hotel was impeccable! There was always someone willing to help with a smile. We got fabulous restaurant recommendations, directions, train maps, city maps, etc. We asked for room service to send up wine glasses, and they were knocking on our door within 5-10 minutes. We also wanted to order a movie on TV, and someone personally came to ensure that we knew how to purchase the \"movie card\" and knew what the time limit was (1,000 yen to have the movie channel for 24 hours -- I believe there was a choice of 8-10 movies). After our movie started, we realized that the volume on the TV was stuck and we couldn't hear the movie well. It was almost 10pm, but a maintenance man came straight to our room to fix the TV.
