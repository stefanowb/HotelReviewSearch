We used to stay in the city and migrate out to the airport at dawn the morning of our return flight, or worse, spend the night sitting at the Air France gate to be sure we didn't miss the early flight that was the one we invariably were booked on. We nervously wondered if the shuttle would come, if there would be congestion on the road, if the cab driver would kill us before we got there. NO MORE! We are now a lot older and wiser. We found this hotel via our Starwood American Express Card (can you say \"points\"?) and have been there several times. We did upgrade ourselves to the club floor which entitles you to snacks and drinks in the evening and breakfast in the morning. The hotel is attached tp the terminal and you can roll your baggage to the check-in desk for your flight.", "title": "A Great way to End a Paris Visit", "user": "Truffle4_12", "date": "April 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157243113}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel gives the feeling of the interior of a huge ship.

The rooms are large, modern and comfortablewith coffe and a stocked refrigerator. We absolutely will stay there in the future since most flights back to Texas still have an 8AM or so check-in time. I have witnessed passengers refused boarding because the Metro was delayed, the cab went to the wrong terminal, the shuttle waited for a passenger and was late, and they missed check in. I have actually been able to enjoy the trip home and last minute airport shopping since we discovered this hotel. We normally say our fond farewells to Paris in the evening before our flight, leave our baggage checked at our hotel in the city, call a cab or have arranged for a late shuttle pick-up, informed the Sheraton we would be late arrivals, and had a hassle free departure.

Had we paid the advertised price on their website (upwards of \u20ac219), I would have been horrified- and not due to the price, as one expects to pay a premium for airport hotels. The service at reception was poor- little to no eye contact, and the member of staff preferred to speak with the person she was training rather than me. When I had problems with my 'foreign' credit card, she smirked, and rolled her eyes at the trainee. When asked for my loyalty card, I said I didn't have it with me, and she didn't offer to look it up.

Check in was efficient and professional. Corridors are lit mutely and very calming. Rooms are comfortable, lots of light, tv, tea and coffee making facilities and a mini bar/snacks for which of course you have to pay. We got a very good rate via Hotwire so feel very lucky we got into this hotel. Also they very kindly accepted to keep our luggage for a week until our return on the outbound journey. Wifi is not free except in the lobby...$19 Euro is very stiff for what should be standard in the room. Breakfast in the restaurant; there was no explanation about buffet/a la carte...I realise this is standard in most places however I had to go and get a waitress in order to ask for the a la carte. The menu states that the buffet has eggs cooked to order or you could have scrambled eggs but there was no chef and no eggs on the buffet for at least 15 minutes. The chef was somewhat grumpy and did not like it when his bonjour to a japanese lady was not met with a return bonjour and he said \"I said bonjour\". I think he would be better off behind the scenes. He did however make me an excellent vegetarian omelette..one of the best I have eaten. As we were leaving I asked for the check to sign - they had put us down for 2 buffets (which by the way were 32 Euros each) instead of one buffet, one a la carte. They corrected it very nicely and efficiently but be aware. Eating here is expensive so you are better off walking through the terminal to find cheaper fare...though there is not a whole lot of choice.", "title": "Excellent location for travel out of CDG", "user": "natmicstef", "date": "May 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159359717}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled on business", "text": "It's a good hotel as one can expect from a Sheraton or Starwood property.

This is a hotel within the airport. It's on the runway, about a one minute walk to Terminal 2. The after hours (11 pm) menu is bizarre and overpriced especially when nothing else is open. The staff was fine. The lobby was bustling. Wi-fi is only free downstairs and not in the rooms. The room was well equipped but also well worn and kind of awkward. It made me laugh - there were so many closets and drawers for a short-trip airport hotel. The storage took up most of the room! We slept there for about 5 hours so I would say it's the best location for a quick turnaround. Also if you're transferring to Orly to CDG, the Air France buses are easy and clean. They run every half hour directly to CDG and cost about 20 euros vs. 80+ euros for a taxi.
