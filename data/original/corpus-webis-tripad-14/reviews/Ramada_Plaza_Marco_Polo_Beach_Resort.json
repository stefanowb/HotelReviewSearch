Also, the valet parking is a hassle. I found the staff to be extremely friendly. Everyday we saw Mary cleaning the floors and the bathrooms on our way to the pool. She's always smiling and the place was very clean. Edweena worked as a housekeeper on our floor. She was always chipper and also works incredible hard. As for the pool staff, Kelly always takes good care of the guests...He's also very kind and friendly. The only problem w/ the pool is security. The townspeople seem to always use the pool and they are not guests. it is a real problem. Why not have a gate that locks. When you come back from the beach, you can use your room key to open the gate. I've never been to a hotel that allows riff raff and kids to just come in an use the pool. Also, non guests valet park for $8 and come use the pool for the day.

We should have booked somewhere else after reading all of the terrible reviews, but since we have had luck two other times on this website, we decided to stay here anyways. I cringe every time I think about the hotel. Our room was HORRIBLE! There were bugs on the night stand on several occasions, and hair all over the bathroom upon arrival!!!! The balcony door didn't open or close properly and we couldn't leave it open at night because it rattled so hard we thought the glass was going to fall out. I was so grossed out by everything that I couldn't sleep. Talk about a NON-relaxing vacation! The hallways reeked of marijuana and cigarettes on several occasions, and the kitchenette including the refrigerator was really old and all rusty so I refused to keep anything in it. I wouldn't even walk on the carpet without sandals on because it was so gross, moldy and squishy. On top of there being bugs, the room was so old and dingy that I had to keep everything packed in my suitcase and set on the table over the course of 4 days when we were there because I was scared of bed bugs coming home with me in my garments! On top of this, the continental breakfast was disgusting. Talk about NO variety and BLAND! This vacation was a joke. It was more stressful getting through the nights than if I would have stayed home and worked! Oh, and be careful, if you can do without a car, DO IT! It is VERY pricey to park your car there overnight.
