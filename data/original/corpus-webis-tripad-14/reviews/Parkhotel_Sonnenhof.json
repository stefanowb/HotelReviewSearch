Not disappointed at all! All my expectations were surpassed. Fabulous food served by Hubert's knowledgeable and wonderfully helpful staff! It is an extremely comfortable, tranquil hotel about half mile from train station. The 'well-ness centre' has an indoor heated pool, sauna and an infrared room. There is also yoga and massage available plus lots of other papering options. The best bit is all these facilities are a two minute walk from your room - in many similarly equipped hotels you have a longish trek and then a changing room before you arrive at the pool - not here - just slip on a comfy bath-robe and two minutes later you're in the 'well-ness centre'. So easy to have a quick swim before breakfast or a sauna before dinner. On the first night, we were welcomed at dinner by the owner. Without exception everyone went out of their way to provide the thoughtfulness that makes for a memorable holiday. 'Luxury hotels' need to work hard to justify their premium - the Park Hotel Sonnenhof has all the usual ingredients - amazing peaceful location, fantastic talent in the kitchen overseen by an amazing chef (the tasting menu is quite sublime) and great facilities - but what made it special for me was the genuine warmth and interest of every single member of staff that I met in making my stay special. The hotel website talks a lot about it being a family affair - and it is absolutely true. I would also venture that despite the price it offers very good value for money because of the supremely high standard of what you get. I look forward to returning for a longer stay.
