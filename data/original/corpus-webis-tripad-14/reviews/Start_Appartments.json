It is in a quiet area just back from the main Ovacik road. Blink and you will miss it as it's not very well signposted, which is why I think it's a hidden gem. The apartments are clean and comfortable with maid service daily. Small pool area and children's pool but even in peak weeks we always seem to be able to get a sunbed. Because it's a small complex it is a very friendly place and a laid back fun atmosphere. The staff are wonderful and very helpful and friendly. Olu Deniz lagoon is breathtaking and Hisaronu is bustling of a night but great for families and couples alike.
