This hotel is not new but kept in rather good shape, maybe the A/C unit was a bit noisy, but not that big of a deal.Check in was a breeze as was check out. The beach, as other reviewers have said, is not very nice to swim since you need shoes to get in and out. This hotel is paradise for divers since you have a dive shop on the premises (Dressel Divers, see my review for them). It is absolutely wonderful to walk out of your room with your wet suit on and your vest on your shoulder, walk on the boat and the tanks and weights are already there, nothing to carry basically. The staff is quite friendly contrary to other reviews I have read, not to offend anyone, but maybe if you give a little tip here and there to those people who are working hard for not a whole lot, to make your stay enjoyable will help them put on a smile. We also rented a Jeep from Less Pay rentals to tour the island. We paid $50 for the day insurance included, they picked us up at the hotel, we went in San Miguel to fill out the paper work and we were on our way. They also drove me back to the hotel the next day when I returned the Jeep. We went to Sin Martin beach which is absolutely amazing with huge waves.

Upon walking to our room for our recent one week vacation, we observed a man stomp out of one of the icemaker alcoves, shouting, \u201cDoes anything in this damn place work?\u201d Not an auspicious start for our vacation. And there\u2019s quite a list of things that don\u2019t work. Here\u2019s what does: The Star Friends, who are relentlessly upbeat, despite the heat and indifferent guests, especially Pedro; the groundskeepers, as the place looks well-manicured 24/7; the wait staff at the buffet who do their best in ridiculous heat, especially the muy charming Adi. What doesn\u2019t work falls into some general categories and, while lazing at the pool, it\u2019s easy to compare other guests\u2019 list of complaints to your own \u2013 and you won\u2019t be doing this with a cold drink in your hand unless you get up and get it yourself, as only one very harried barmaid works the both beach and pool areas, where dirty glasses and plates are in piles. The showers can\u2019t hold a temperature and frequently scald? Check, everyone says that. Something didn\u2019t work in your room? Also check (for us, the safe didn\u2019t work). Not getting minibar refills as promised? Yep. We were told every-other-day refills when we checked in. I complained at the desk on the second day and was haughtily informed that I had calculated the days incorrectly. Hmmm\u2026Saturday arrival, Monday is the second day, right? I was assured that it would be refilled on Tuesday\u2026nope. Finally, on Wednesday, I left a note for the maid in Spanish pleading that it was our fourth day with no refills and we were rewarded with 2 beers. And yes, we tipped the maids 500 pesos daily. The food is fine, but it is monotonously similar day after day. Sometimes, we recognized the previous night\u2019s dinner food at the lunch buffet \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t seem safe in the heat, but none of us got sick. The dining areas are not air conditioned and, in the case of the Steakhouse, the area we were seated in had broken fans \u2013 just another thing that didn\u2019t work. We couldn\u2019t even finish our food due to the combination of oven-like heat and relentless sand fleas. [Hot Tip: OFF apparently doesn\u2019t slow down sand fleas, wear DEET to a Steakhouse dinner.] The drinks are so weak that I frequently could detect no difference between my daughter\u2019s virgin daiquiris and my own \u201creal\u201d drink despite tipping the bartenders as instructed on Trip Advisor. [Next Hot Tip: Franklin and Rita at the beach bar pour the strongest drinks.] I think the thing that made us the most disappointed is that the Iberostar promo literature says it is such a great place for kids. Small kids, probably; Lucy\u2019s Club seemed interesting for the young set, maybe age 7 or under. Teenagers would be fine with the expansive grounds and activities like archery and volleyball, which are for ages 14 and older (although you don\u2019t know the age cutoff until you arrive at the activity and leave with your disappointed tween). My 9-year-old and 11-year-old were clearly too old for the cutesy stuff at Lucy\u2019s Club (despite Iberostar\u2019s stated age range) and too young to roam the labyrinthine grounds on their own. Hence the \u201cI-zero-star\u201d from my son.

It seemed that most of their divers were repeat business who had dived with them before, and, while I dont' dive a lot, I dived with DMs from overseas who were very pleased with them. Their boats are a little slower than some other shops, but you get personal attention (6 divers on the boat), and they charge about $75 for two tanks with gear rental included. No one that I dived with (I dived for several days) had any problems with gear that they rented. The drawback is that if they pick you up at the dock at the resort, they are charged a fee by the resort, so it's best if you have transportation to town. We found renting a car to be fun anyway, since this resort is kinda remote and it allowed us to tour the island and go into town for a couple afternoons.
