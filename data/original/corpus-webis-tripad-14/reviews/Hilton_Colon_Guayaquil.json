I checked in at midnight and at 12:30 a.m. I was woken up by my next door neighbor which had six men drinking beer and being very loud. I contacted the front desk THREE times to resolve the problem and they did nothing at all. I had no sleep that night, and they never offered to move me. Marco was the person at the front desk. The room was ok. They refused to give refund. Finally after contacting Hilton in the US, a compliant was filed. I talked with managment via email and they said they were going to refund me. It has been over a week and the refund has not posted. Becareful staying here. I reccomend the Radisson or even the Howard Johnson.
