We stayed in room 1005 in tower B wich is the \"sun-set\" tower. We had a perfact view of the bay the mountians and the ocean. Our room was always clean... however we did find that the maid always did a better job when we left a tip. The beaches are always clean (the are raked daily) there are pleanty of chairs for everyone, there is no need to bring towels, you get a towel voucher when you arive. We played in Volley-ball tournements, we went snorkeling everyday almost... if u go you have to go around to the other side of the wave breaker rocks, we saw some magnificent fish, but watch out for sea urchins and baracudas because we saw quite a few of those. There is Nightly entertainment, which was always fun. On mondays if you are a guest at the resort they will give you a wrist band that gives you free transportaion to and from Marguritaville, free entry and free shots all night, which was alot of fun.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 29, 2005", "id": 3721731}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not worth the money", "text": "Don't listen to the bad reviews this place gets, you cant please everyone, from our experiance we had a wonderful time and enjoyed every minute of it, we had fun no matter if we were snorkeling, relaxing at the pool bar, browsing through the gift shop or visiting the spa for a massage... which may i add was GREAT!

This is not the worse fate because the lunch and dinner menu are changed daily, while leaving some staples readily available. The food here is often quite delicious. It has some of the fare of your typical buffet while always providing you with something surprisingly good, if you have an open mind. The service here is pretty good with create-your-own-pasta bars during dinner and a very good omelet bar in the morning. The tomatoes and cucumbers at the salad bar are excellent. But the fruit often leaves something to be desired. The wait-staff here is very helpful coming quickly with coffee mugs or water or juice as you need it. While the food is delicious and the views are spectacular, don't expect to have a quiet meal here. There is always a child in some stage of breakdown and generally more than one. Also, there is generally a cacophany coming from the entertainment area which is adjacent, during lunchtime, it is whatever is happening at the pool, and in the evening, the \"entertainment\" is an absolute din. If you get to experience the restaurants, which are generally much quieter, the \"Asian\" food is completely forgettable, but the Caribbean and Italian restaurants are delicious with an excellent staff. You won't be able to completely skip the Beach Grill, so have the jerk chicken. It was delicious and tender with a great, spicy sauce. The french fries are very good there, but everything else is at best... odd.", "title": "not to great", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Trianne Y", "date": "July 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 166284400}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The beaches are actually wonderful.

At first it was like pulling teeth, but after getting them to understand that this was our anniversary and I'm sure the fact that I was a travel agent didnt hurt either.

The beach was very rocky though. So here are my tips: 1. If you want quiet-request the gardens 2. Bring cash-the atm charges US $6.00 fee, 3.

Drinks were great. Rooms were a little outdated but there is too much to do and the weather was great, who wants to spend their va-ca in the room. Service was OK except for the bartenders who had nothing but smiles and kept the drinks coming.

Horse back riding was great and so was swimming with the dolphins and dunns river falls. I wouldn't do the booze cruise again..but we made the best of it. There isn't much of a nightlife in the hotel but the bars are open pretty late so what else do u need? There are also shuttle buses to Margaritaville every night which is a bar/nightclub type place.

The male staff was GREAT! The women...they're another story! The food and drinks were plentiful! I loved the strawberry banana daquiris with extra rum...ha ha! The beaches weren't too great, I wasn't aware they were man-made beaches. A lot of rocks and stones and pretty small. Unfortunately, the storms around us brought in warm waters...which brought in JELLYFISH GALORE! So I never got to snorkel or jet ski in fear of getting stung all over. We did paddle boat though almost everyday which was cool. The coral reef was beautiful but there were thousands of jellyfish out there. A lot washed up along the shore too which made it hard to swim. The entertainment was good. Bands, talent nights, theme nights, Local Jamaica Fare taste testing nights, etc. The guests were really nice too. We met a really nice couple on their honeymoon from Canada and hung with them a lot. The casinos were cool. That was the only place I got to hear some music that I like since Jamaica tunes were on all the time. I was totally missing my music!! They had an Italian restaurant we went to twice. AWESOME! The Chinese Restaurant was okay. We went into town to shop and it was sad. Very poor country! But the vendors are like white on rice once they see you. Grabbing you telling you to come see their shops and asking for tips for doing absolutely nothing. I hated it in town! Vendors do come to the resort and set up a couple times a week but they're pushy too. We witnessed a wedding in the gazebo which was nice. They have an open air lobby which is really nice. The winds blow through there all the time and make for a nice, peaceful atmosphere. The swim up bars were cool. The rooms were gross. I know I am an anal freak, but those rooms would be gross to anybody. The jerk chicken is very tasty!! It did rain from like 1-2 everyday in the afternoon which I found to be weird. But laying on the beach and under the palms set up all over the beach for shade was very nice.
