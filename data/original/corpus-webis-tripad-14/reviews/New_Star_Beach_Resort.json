We enjoyed this week as much as possible, and we thought that this hotel was as close haven as possible. We hardly noticed any contstracions. The beach was beautiful, and empty and pool was perfect. Staff were very friendly and helpful. My husband had 50`birthday there, and in the evening two members of staff knocked to the door, sang happy birthday to you and brought a choclate cake! What a nice suprise! The hotel is little far away from shops and restaurants, that\u00b4s why I woudn\u00b4t recomened that for family with teenagers (I woundn\u00b4t book that for my whole family), but hotel has free transformation to center of Chawng once a day.

New Star is an excellent place to relax and discover the beauty of Koh Samui. The resort is simply wonderful ( spacious rooms, beautiful beach and swimming pool, excellent spa ) but what we'll never forget is the kindness of the \"always smiling\" staff, everybody was so nice but special compliments to the staff of the Pool Bar (Aew is the best!!) and to the staff of the Spa (try their treatments!!).
