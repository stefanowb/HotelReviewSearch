The staff is friendly. The hotel is a little on the pricey side. If you are there making Hilton Honors points or your travel destinations are near the airport, it's an acceptable option.

The staff were very courteous and the room was very well appointed, very clean and the beds were quite comfortable. Although the hotel is near the airport. I only heard one airplane during the night. We had the room closest to the front desk and breakfast area, so the microwave beeping during use was audible throughout the night at various intervals. Additionally, the ice machine and vending area was next to our room so that is also a consideration if staying there to try and select your room away from these areas if possible. As we were just stopping in with no prior reservation, we pretty much had to take what was available and by the look of the parking lot the hotel was probably rather full the day we stayed there. We did not have a Laptop computer with us so I can not comment on the availability of the wireless Internet service, and I do not know if a computer is available for guest use (I did not see one at this Hampton Inn but did at another one we stayed at later). If you will be traveling, I would highly suggest taking a laptop if you have one, or if not, then buying one to take with you. We REALLY could have used one on our trip. I looked for the exercise room as described but could not find it, although I did not search out the entire hotel, just where the provided hotel map stated it should be. The morning breakfast was fine as far as we were concerned, but we do not eat a huge breakfast when traveling. it consisted of the usual fare of cold cereals, an assortment of baked goods such as bagels, white and wheat bread, muffins etc. along with what appeared to be egg and cheese omelets. My wife was particularly pleased that they had Activia yogurt available. There are apparently no eating establishments available within walking distance, but we had a fast dinner meal at the McDonald's just down the street. I imagine if you have a GPS unit when traveling that you could easily locate many other places to eat by using the Point of Interest option on the GPS unit. We did this in another city and it worked out very well. Overall we were very well pleased with this hotel and if I was in this area again I would definitely stay here in the future.", "title": "We'll be staying at Hampton Inns again", "user": "dklawitter", "date": "October 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 45815475}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Basic Hampton Inn", "text": "Stayed here for 4 nights in August 2008. Its a basic, no frills Hampton Inn, the same one's you'd expect to get in every American City. Nothing here really stands out.
