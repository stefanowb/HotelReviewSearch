We were even invited to join his family for his father's birthday celebrations at one of the pubs across the road. Had a great time enjoying the friendly atmosphere and the traditional irish music, was great fun and a memorable experience for us. The rooms are large and we had a beautiful view of the bay and surrounding countryside. Also enjoyed the spectacular views from the large bay windows in the dining room while eating a freshly cooked big breakfast. Would highly recommend a stay at Camp Junction, very relaxing, spectacular views and nice walking along the beach in front.", "title": "Excellent B&B", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AussiesOS", "date": "June 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7989927, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 New, clean and spectacular views", "disliked": "\u2014 all good"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed with John Doyle at Camp Junction House on18 May.
