This is a Madonna Inn (San Louis Obisbo, California - fairly tacky, touristy) with cobwebs. We were scheduled to stay here for 2 nights but, at 4:00am, on our first night in a 16th century bed, flies all over the place, and creaking floors, I announced to my wife that we were out of there in the morning. In its defense, the staff was wonderful and accomodating, offering us all types of options to stay. No way! The dinner at the restaurant was very good (say, 13/20 Gault-Millau) with large portions though overpriced. Tour buses come and go, gawking at the facade and the worn, bizarre lobby. And the grounds, while extensive, are no prettier than any nice state park. And the place, especially by Portuegse standards is a fortune. (We stayed at a lovely hotel in Porto - 4 stars - for 2 night for 1/2 the price of one night here.) For sure, a $100 million might make this property into what it claims (and would like to be).
