Right down the road from the notch and hiking but on the river which drowned out any traffic noise. Nice screened in porch and the people who run the place were really nice.

What a wonderful place! The staff is always extremely friendly and will do everything possible to accomodate any and all requests. They are very knowledgable about the area and able to provide directions, ideas, and wonderful conversation. The Pemi River runs along the back of the cabins and is one of our favorite things in the summer. It's great to just get your feet wet and to sit and enjoy the tranquility of the river running through. The cabins are very country and rustic - most of them with fireplaces and screened-in porches. Some have kitchenettes while others have a microwave - so you just need to pick the cabin that fits your needs. It's a great place in the summer or winter time. Different activities for different seasons. Close to everything in Lincoln and Woodstock and are short distance to a plethora of activities and sight-seeing. Not to mention they have a wonderful gift shop! Prices are just fantastic and they haven't changed much over the years. It's one price year round.

When we went to check in I fell in love with even that little building. Knick-knacks everywhere with a really country and woodsy feel. I bought a beautiful canvas and little wood saying in there! When I ran into the cabin to see it cause I was so excited I was immediately pleased. The cabin not only was clean but it smelt SO good. You would think that little cabins like that may smell musty, but it had a vanilla/clean smell. I loved the living area with the gas stove that was very easy to control and worked so well to keep it warm when it got a little chilly outside at night. The bedroom and bathroom were perfect for two people in the cabin we were in. The back screened-in porch is connected to the bedroom and when you're on the porch you are directly above the beautiful flowing river :) We had the windows open even when it was closed at night because it was SO peaceful to hear while we were sleeping!! We used the grills to cook lunch and dinner the second day we were there and they worked out perfectly. It is mandatory to recycle in the cabins, so that is a wonderful bonus for anyone who appreciates the earth! Unfortunately, we only stayed for two nights so we weren't there for too too long, but the two nights and three days we did get to spend there were magical. We didn't even want to go around the town because our cabin was just so relaxing and perfect. CANNOT WAIT to go back this winter!!! GREAT JOB to the Caston's!! THANK YOU!", "title": "AMAZING!
