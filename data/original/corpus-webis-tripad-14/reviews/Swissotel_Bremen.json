Checkin and checkout was fast. The front desk staff were very efficient and polite. The hairdryer did not work in the room. I reported it to the front desk before heading out for the day and when I got back it had been fixed. I was quite impressed. The staff gives you a map of the area and some tips on what to see. They all spoke excellent English. The room was a very nice size. The breakfast was excellent. Everything you need to get a good start on your sightseeing. The location was amazing. You walk out the front door and across a little bridge and you are in the heart of Bremen. Everything you want to see in Bremen is in very easy walking distance of the hotel. We had some excellent meals in Bremen as well. But one place in particular was not condusive to keeping your weight down (lol). The hotel offers parking but it is not attached to the hotel. It is one street over. When you leave the parking structure you would enter the hotel from the back door. Saves walking around to the front.
