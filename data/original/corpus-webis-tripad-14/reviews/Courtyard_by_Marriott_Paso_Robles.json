With no further transportation, and no hotel shuttle service, we were still able to use the low-cost City shuttle. With bags in tow, we were dropped off a fairly long block from the hotel entrance. The room was typical Courtyard with not quite the stellar bedding. The food service was Courtyard as well but the Chef was friendly. Most people crowded the breakfast buffet with not much interest in the after 5 service. luckily the Town Square was a gem with many local restaurants and one movie house. Upon departure the bus service was not working due to a holiday. There was only one Taxi service and it was difficult to hire. The absolute best part of our trip was discovering that the best wine tasting rooms were the free one's at the train station.", "title": "Discount stay for your wine tours", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lorilovely", "date": "July 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 114940078}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Courtyard by Marriott was a lovely place.

The hotel also made some restaurant recommendations that turned out nicely. The room was exceptionally clean, the bathroom spacious and there was also a mini fridge in the room.

It wasnt far to walk which we did for dinner - always good to work up an appetite. Breakfast wasnt included (why not?) so no idea if it was any good. There was a fridge in the room and ice down the corridor. The swiming pool was hogged by 6 children so far too crowded to use it, but the gym was quite good with new equipment which we used.

Though the hotel looks brand new and everything is spotless, there were a couple basic amenities they need to look at. First the heater, on a chilly night the heater was only spewing out \"cool\" air even though I cranked the thermostat all the way up to 80 deg F just to see if it will actually work as a heater; ended up just turning it off. Secondly, Coutryards are supposed to be business hotels and even though I wasn't there for business, I would expect their Wi-Fi to work consistently. In the 2nd floor the signal was spotty and kept going in and out. I've stayed in less swanky places in South America that had better Wi-Fi reception.
