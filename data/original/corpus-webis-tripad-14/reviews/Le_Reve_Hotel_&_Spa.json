Thanks to Jetsetter we got a great deal, but I would recommend this boutique resort even at retail price. There are I believe 4 types of rooms \u2013 garden, balcony, master suite, and beach bungalow. We stayed in a garden room, and I think I would prefer it to the balcony room because there is a large outdoor soaking tub that gets hot water\u2014the Jacuzzi section of the *gorgeous* infinity pool does not appear to have heat, so if you are looking for the hot tub experience, this outdoor tub is great for just relaxing in the evenings with a drink or a book. The value of the service at Le Reve is amazing. The staff/guest ratio is so high, at peak times I think there was a staff member on site for each of the 25 rooms! The staff is extremely well trained to attend to your every need, but no one was at all overbearing, annoying, or sales-y.", "title": "Relaxing Boutique Resort with 5-Star Service", "user": "JVestal", "date": "February 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 95206900}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "As far as food goes, I am used to Chicago food prices and these seemed reasonable to me. One thing to keep in mind is that all prices include tax AND gratuity. The chef was excellent. I was at first a bit nervous about the food as I had heard it was mostly American-influenced and I like authentic Mexican food. No problem\u2014each evening after dinner, our server Ismael and the Chef worked together to give us authentic options to plan the next night\u2019s meal. We had pork cochinita, a whole roasted fish for 2, barbacoa, chlles rellenos, chicken mole, and barbecue ribs.
