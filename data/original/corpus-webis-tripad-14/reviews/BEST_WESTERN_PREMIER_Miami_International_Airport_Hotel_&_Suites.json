We arrived at the hotel after a 10 min. drive and were greated with friendly smiles and wonderful atmosphere. Our room was very clean and tidy, the bed was the best I had ever slept in. We stayed there for two days before our cruise and had a chance to tour Miami. Publix & CVS were only two blocks down Flagler. We took the number 11 bus to downtown Miami, the cost was $2.00/ $1.00 senior rate. The bus stops near Bayside Market, which is a great place to visit with lots of places to eat, party, shop and book tours. the bus ride is about 40 mins. We booked our shuttle to the cruise line at Best Western for $10.00 per person, and with the driver for our return shuttle, we had to call him when our cruise ended, he was there in 10 min. We stayed one night after the cruise and again returned to Bayside and ate at the Hard Rock Cafe. When the time came to leave for the airport, the shuttle runs every 30 mins, so we just had to be at the front desk 10 mins before it left.

We arrived at the Ft. Lauderdale airport and within 5-10 minutes were boarded for Miami. The hotel itself was beautiful,and safe, but the neighborhood left a little to be desired for 2 females traveling alone. There is a restaurant/bar on the premises. Drinks were $8.00 a piece, but they have a happy hour later on in the day. We ate lunch there as well as their buffet breakfast, which was MORE than adequate. Eggs, meat, fruits, juices. croissants, rolls, etc. We chose not to eat dinner there. Instead we walked across the street to the Burger King. Our room had a microwave and fridge. There was an outdoor pool, with a privacy fence, that several people ventured in to. It appeared clean and well kept. We didn't use it only because we were already packed for our cruise. Transportation to the cruise line was easy and timely for us, but a large group that was also \"bussing\" to a cruise ship appeared to be having difficulty I don't know if this is a function of the hotel, or the cruise lines.. Our only complaint was that I asked 2 different staff people at the desk if they had sharps containers for diabetics to put their disgards in and were told 'No, just put them in the garbage\". I'm hoping they will read this and change their policy. I'm leaving the \"location\" portion \"unclicked\" because it's good location related to the cruise lines but just doesn't seem to be the best neighborhood, and I don't want to unduly influence people.", "title": "Pre-cruise hotel stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kimmer26", "date": "May 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 130191592}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled solo", "text": "I arrived late, they had my room ready, wonderfull room, great location, very close to airport, highways", "title": "good location in miami", "user": "Hernan1", "date": "May 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 130185638}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012", "text": "After reading many of the mixed reviews, some people must be very hard to please!", "title": "Pleasntly surprised...

There is something wrong with the whole floor, the carpeting is very musty and have an unknown odor. I literally got so sick and couldn't breathe. I'm not sure about other floors but 7th is very bad. I'm not sure about this Best Western but I think the staff is very inexperience. The only good thing I can say about this hotel is decent breakfast but the menu never changed and shuttle to/from airport. Housekeeping is poor, they would clean 40% of the room if you stay more than one night, nothing is changed unless you ask for it. Restaurant food is mediocre, inexperience Chef/Cooks. Business Center is located right next to staff room so they would constantly slam the door. I regretfully chose this hotel out of so many choices. I totally disagree with the majority of the reviews. I will never stay here again, even if it was FREE. The room odor is so severe that I think I would literally get sick from mildew. Don't take the provided transportation, instead take a Taxi.
