The restaurant is wonderful...it makes you feel like you're on a tropical island from the tiki-style set-up of the area. The beach is literally a step outside the door and the view is also phenomenal of the ocean. The food is outstanding....a little on the expensive side, but well worth it! Our room was not an ocean front room, therefore it was a little stuffy. I would recommend an ocean front room if available. But everything is clean and in order. The receptionists are helpful, you just need to ask them. PARKING...make sure you ask the desk how to get in to park because the hotel is in a gated-in community (for safety, i presume).

The room was not as spacious as the room upstairs and it opened right up onto the deck of the restaurant!! I told the receptionist that we would keep the room we had upstairs.
