Lovely kids pool which our 2 year old loved and great play park/sand pit to keep him occupied for a while. Super market was well stocked but not open long enough - closed at 7pm and because it was a walk to the nearest big one it did get a bit annoying if you needed something in the afternoon and it was closed between 1pm and 4pm as well.

The \u2018STRIP\u2019 is approx a 10min walk from the hotel, there is an array of Chinese buffet style restaurants along with Steakhouses, Caf\u00e9s, Fresh(ish) looking Fish restaurants and Irish run pubs!

This picks up outside the hotel at 11am and returns around 3pm (even on Xmas day), 2 euros return per person to a fantastic beach a few km away, well worth a visit.
