We live in Louisiana and wanted to take the kids to the beach yet, not have to drive very far to get there. We usually vacation in Florida but, due to the high gas prices we opted for Mississippi instead. After researching all of the hotels in the area, including Casino hotels, we chose the Isle of Capri. The price was better than most ($89 a night) and it seemed like a nice place from the pictures on the website. The first thing I noticed was that it was at the end of the strip, literally. The Biloxi bridge is just after it and is out, apparently due to Hurricane Katrina. The Isle is situated in the middle of a marina, which means you do not have access to the beach from the hotel. We had to drive down the road to go to the beach. That was one of the major problems. The other was that you have to travel through the casino to get to your hotel room, very inconvenient when traveling with children and several bags. You have to park in a parking garage, walk down a covered walkway into the building and through the casino, up an escalator(or stairs if you're carrying luggage) to the elevator on the other end. The room itself was a nice size, although the decor looked cheap. The theme is tropical but the colors are too loud. We had 2 queen beds in our room and there was plenty of space to move around. The bathroom was also roomy. The room was clean and well stocked with towels and toletries. There's no childcare available at any of the casinos so don't bring kids if you plan to gamble, unless you have someone to watch them. My sister came with us and helped out.
