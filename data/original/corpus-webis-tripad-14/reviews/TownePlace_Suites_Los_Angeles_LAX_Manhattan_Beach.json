We entered the lobby which was smaller than my kitchen. Anthony at the front desk checked us in and we went up to our room on the 2nd floor. Well... the first thing we noticed was how dirty and stained the carpet was. The couch was so dirty and dingy, we were afraid to sit on it and were afraid to even open it up. The chair was worn and scratched. The kitchen and bathroom were in decent shape. The bathroom appeared to be updated. One bedroom was smaller than the other and did not have a television. The air conditioner control in our friend's room was not working properly and Anthony came up to check it out. He was very apologetic and tried to help as best he could. He is probably the best asset the hotel has to offer. We kept our suitcases closed and off the floor that night. In the morning, we pulled the curtains open to discover a view of train tracks and commercial buildings. We had a quick breakfast of fruit, cereal and yogurt in a very small and cramped breakfast room. We had learned upon arrival that the hotel was \"dog friendly\", but were quite surprised to see one person walk 5 dogs through the lobby and outside. Seemed a bit excessive and left us wondering.... We then spent most of the first day of our vacation driving around town trying to find another hotel to stay at. The front desk graciously let us cancel the remainder of our reservation and we enjoyed our next four nights at the Manhattan Beach Marriott.
