Overall we were very pleased with our stay. The carriage ride from the security stop to the hotel was very nice. The hotel staff greeting was warm and check-in was painless. Our room, a Suite on the second floor was spacious, impeccably decorated and well equipped. A warm bath with rose petals was waiting for us when we arrived. Little touches like both terry and cotton bathrobes were a very nice touch. The property is beautiful and grounds are perfectly maintained. The spa is exceptional. The gift shop is very, very nice. The big disappointment was service and food quality. Having staying in several of the Taj Palace properties (Taj Mahal Mumbai, Lake Palace, Rambaugh) we had an expectation of the quality of facilities and service we would find at Falaknuma \u2013 sadly, we were disappointed. The food quality, while very nice, was not the exceptional standard of other properties. The table service was very friendly but not efficient for example, from when we ordered it took 10 \u2013 15 mins for morning coffee to arrive at breakfast; one night our cocktail order took 20 mins. the next night 30 mins. this was accompanied with apologies and explanations that the delay was because the type of vodka we had requested was located in a different bar. I should note that in each case it was not sufficiently busy to account for the service. In every case the staff was very pleasant but it left us wondering whether it would be better to strike a balance between courteous/helpful staff and efficient service. Finally, the communications for the New Year\u2019s Eve festivities (which were great fun) was very poor. No one we spoke to was clear about what time it would start and whether seating was reserved or not and therefore what time we should plan to arrive to ensure a nice table. As it turned our tables had been reserved in advance, ours was lovely and the evening was great fun. The next evening, a price fixe dinner was being served on the outside dining area \u2013 we could not find out any information about it in advance. Finally, unlike every other Taj property, we were not asked to provide feedback on our experience \u2013 very odd.", "title": "Wonderful royal stay at Nizam's palace 'taj falaknuma'", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "puneet_Sharnameye", "date": "January 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150320129}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "i stayed with a friend on 17th jan 2013 ..It was an amazing place to be...the welcome was unique and interesting you are taken to the palace on a horse carriage and the shower of rose petals on arrival is very special...you are treated like royalty.
