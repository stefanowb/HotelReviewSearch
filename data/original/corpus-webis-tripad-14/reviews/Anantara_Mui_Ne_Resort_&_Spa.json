We were welcomed right from the moment we stepped out of the car on to the forecourt and were made to feel equally welcomed and at ease the whole duration of our stay by the reception staff, the restaurant staff, the poolside team and the cleaning team. We felt well and truly spoilt and very much enjoyed the very thoughtful little touches like the floral display on our bed when we entered our apartment, the short stories of local folklore and messages of 'sweet dreams' written on leaves by the night service and the extras we got whilst relaxing by the pool like fruit kebabs, iced coffees and cold water. The quality of the room and the facilities was always faultless and catered for our every need. We would love to return one day.
