The service here is some of the best that I have ever come across at a Doubletree property and I use Hilton properties often, as I am a Diamond Member. The rooms were huge, the beds comfortable bathrooms very clean and modern (i even had a bidet twice) and the staff helpful and efficient. It is about a 15- 20 minute walk to the beaches, but a quick cab ride. It cost me $20 usd to take a prearranged cab from the airport - about a 30 min drive. Great restaurants and stores within blocks. Take some time, just wander around and watch what the locals are doing...Kennedy park, 3 blocks away, has \"events\" on the weekends. I would stay here again.
