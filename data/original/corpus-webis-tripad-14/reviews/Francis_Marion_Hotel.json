Jessica did a fantastic job of staying on top things during my investigative phase. She negotiated on things she could negotiate on and when she couldn't, she was up front about it. I respected that. We are a group of construction guys, and as much as I plan things out, they change, and the hotel was great about being flexible when they could. Service was top notch. Meals were great. The hotel is ancient, but they have done a great job with their updates and there were no complaints on the rooms. Parking is what it is, downtown parking. You have to use the garage next door, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. There were cops all over the place it seemed, so it was totally safe to walk around.
