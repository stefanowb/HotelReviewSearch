Unfortunately, the room was not as nice as those depicted in the photos. Our room was smallish but probably normal for Paris, the bathroom was nice and modern. The walls were thin and I could hear people talking at normal voice level. I will say, I liked the decor of the hotel lobby which incorporates French style with modern charms. I do think now that the hotel is a bit pricey for the room. I might have enjoyed our stay more if I had a better idea of what the room would be like. I think hotels, in general, should include a range of room photos and not just the higher priced suites.

I had sprung for a delux room on the 5th floor and the room was classic french with beautiful heavy draperies and lovely chandelier over the bed. The room had a walk in closet with plenty of hangers. Excellent water pressure on the shower. However...... the room carpet had several stains and probably needs to be replaced. I put my only pair of shoes out for polishing the night before and had to make 3 calls the next day before they were returned at 11:00 a.m. During the 6 days I was there, the fire alarm went off on four separate days. During these alarms, the staff stayed at their stations and did not provide any assistance or explanation unless asked. On alarm #1, the guest across from me called the front desk and was told to ignore it. On #2 and #3, I called down and heard it was false. I finally asked the concierge what was the problem. He said they had installed a new alarm system and the installer was required to come whenever they pleased and pull the alarm to ensure it was working. So the staff knew there was no fire and the concierge acted a little surprised that I was complaining. The hotel had not informed the guests this would occur and did not take into account that the guests would react when they heard the alarm. Because the hotel did a poor job of managing guest relations they get a poor review from me.

Our first night was a bit of a disaster as despite our room on the 5th floor and assurances that NO guests had ever complained about street noise on this street side room, we were awakened at 4am with loud noises of garbage pick-up , bottles being tossed en mass, motorcycles/scooters, barely warm water from the bath. Then we find out that the beautiful dining room is only open for bkfst,/ lunch as their Michelin rating is gone. Dinner can be served to guests in the salons outside the restaurant only. No lower level bar as was advertised on other sites...they lost that along with the chef. We kindly voiced our complaints and were then put in a spacious, coldly modern jr suite...but it was very welcome indeed and we appreciated their response. All in all, the staff were kind and helpful, the bkfst was very good, the light dinner we had in a salon one night when we were too tired to go out was actually very good, and the whole place rather grew on us and became a tranquil and pretty elegant oasis as the end of the day. My sense is that it is a hotel in transition from what it was to where it may be going. The place needs a bit warmer palette and more of what is going on in the salons , a little richer overall feel. Let it be what it wants to be. The designer fell into the \"taupe trap\" and the mauve really does not work, esp in the dining room! It needs more richness, more warmth. Maria at the front desk the woman in the dining room at bkfst could be less officious ...the rest of the staff were simply terrific.
