We found this hotel to be one of the cheaper options in Rio. but we were happy with the room and the service given price we paid. We arrived at the hotel around 6am after an overnight flight. We didn't expect our room to be available so early in the morning but they let us wait/sleep in the reception area. To our surprise our room was ready within an hour and a half (I guess after a guest had checked out early, and the cleaners had started work). The room was basic, a reasonable size with a desk and storage cupboard and air conditioning. The bathroom was a little cramped, but everything was clean and tidy. Breakfast was a a large buffet - only 2 cereals to choose from, but a range of bread and spreads, fruit juices, hot food and cakes, hot drinks etc. The hotel is a short 5-10 min walk to Copacabana beach and about 10mins to Ipenema. There are a few restaurants and a supermarket within 5 mins walk of the hotel. The staff were professional and helpful when arranging taxis and tours for us.
