Anyways, once we found the hotel we were quite impressed with the location. It's only a 5 minute walk from Union Station which was convenient to get to all the sites.

We were not disappointed at all and were delighted with our stay. General Manager and his staff always seemed to be in the lobby greeting and helping guests and later assisted with 'wine hour' , a nice amenity, and they were there in the morning thanking guests and offering assistance. Our room was immaculate and lighting in the bathroom was great. It was a cold night when we stayed and the room temperature was perfect as was the comfort of the bed allowing for a great night's sleep after the evening event we attended. Valet was quick with our car both with arriving and leaving. The hotel is right next door to Union Station which also has a Metro station . If the weather was bad or we couldn't find a cab we knew that we could take the Metro however cabs were readily available and it was a quick and inexpensive side back to the hotel ( we walked there and it was a pleasant 10-12 minute walk). The Bistro Bis restaurant that is connected to the hotel was a nice surprise. It is a well rated restaurant with a nice decor, great food (both at dinner and breakfast) and a fabulous alternative to what you might get in an upscale hotel like Marriott or Hyatt. We look forward to an opportunity to return to the Hotel George and enjoy the staff's gracious service.
