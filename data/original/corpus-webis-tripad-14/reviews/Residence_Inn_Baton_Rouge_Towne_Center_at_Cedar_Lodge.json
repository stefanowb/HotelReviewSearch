Traveling with pets can often provide challenges in locating clean, quality lodging. After 8 hours in the car we were pleasantly surprised when we pulled into the parking lot of this new, well kept hotel in a nice area. First the location is great ! It is close enough to the highway to provide easy access, but far enough from the roads to provide for a very quiet night sleep. Across from the hotel was a large open area that was a great place to walk the dog. I felt safe even walking around at night. The hotel is adjacent to a very nice shopping area with a number of restaurants to include: Flemings, CHAMPS, PF Changs, Carrabbas and Starbucks. There is also a Whole Foods. We stayed in a 2 Bedroom suite that contained a small amply equipped kitchen ( Dishes, Pots and Pans, Toaster, coffee maker, etc.) with a stove, microwave and full size refrigerator. The hotel offers a shopping service where you can turn in a list of groceries that they will purchase on your behalf. The room was very clean and spacious. Included in the price of the room was a hot breakfast buffet (Eggs, Waffles, Bacon, Cold and Hot Cereals, Fruit etc.). Free in room wireless Internet was also provided for guests. The staff was very friendly and helpful. While not an inexpensive option for travel with Pets ( they charge a mandatory $75 Pet fee ) for me, the cleanliness and location made it well worth it.", "title": "Great Location, Pet Friendly", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "FirstClass59", "date": "March 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25380106}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Recently spent one night at the Residence Inn - Commerce Circle in Baton Rouge.
