This is definetely the place to stay: service by the owner Andre is warm and welvoming and all facilities are top class. We were pampered by delicious meals every evening since we bought the full-board package, but you can also prepare your own meals in the communal kitchen. The place is clean, modern, comfortable and you get to meet other like-minded climbers there, what else can you ask for? I highly recommend!", "user": "Losviages", "date": "June 1, 2012", "id": 131098000}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed here for three days whilst booked on their three day introductory ice climbing course. The weekend was what I expected and more, the course and tuition was well paced and challenged us at the same time. The accommodation was great, like staying in someone's home, underfloor heating in the bathrooms, great showers! The food each evening, a three course meal, was restaurant quality and delicious! The whole place has a great atmosphere whether its relaxing on the sofas with a cup of tea or downstairs with a beer in the bar area.", "title": "Great stay in ParadICE!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Denty1", "date": "March 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125708542}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "Andre and his team were very accommodating, on the first evening we arrived 2 hours after the scheduled dinner but the meal was held back for us when we arrived.

Dinner (like an alpine hut) is a single sitting 3 course fixed menu; tasty and sustaining when I was there. Breakfast is self service and you are encouraged to make sandwiches for lunch and fill a flask. The beds are very comfortable. It is, in effect, a shared house and as a result it can be noisy in the morning when people start getting up and sorting gear, but if you are climbing that is probably no bad thing. Equally when it is full there is a bit of pressure on loos and showers but it works well enough. It is really well placed for the upper Gorge which is a short walk away.", "title": "Best Ice Climbing accommodation", "user": "himalheidi", "date": "February 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 13903042, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 little touches that made it feel like home", "disliked": "\u2014 n/a"}}], "location": {"country": "Norway", "region": "Eastern Norway", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 7}, "slim_ranking": 0.5}
