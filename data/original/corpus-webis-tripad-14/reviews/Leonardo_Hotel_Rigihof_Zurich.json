It was very stylish - especially if you're into Bauhaus. Room was clean, and stocked full of bathroom supplies... including a duckie for the bathtub, which was a funny touch. We had large balconies on both of the rooms we booked, and it looked like every room had a similar balcony on our side of the hotel (facing the back). The breakfast was very nice - especially for a buffet-style hotel breakfast. The hotel is pretty far from the old town/train station - but there's trams right outside the front door that can take you there. The neighborhood seemed pretty quiet, and after 8pm most things were closed except for the restaurant next door. So if you want to go out, be prepared to take the tram or a cab.

The variety at the breakfast was average but you could also order an omelette or waffle if you wanted. The receptionists were polite and the housekeepers left lollipops on our pillows every morning. Maybe because of the Euro 2008. Lastly, the painting on the wall was a pretty detail in the room, as also the magazines on the desk.
