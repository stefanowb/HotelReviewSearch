Decor is more trad pub than modern pastels ( a refreshing change for this pint of ale drinker), lots of choice of alc, fixed price lunch menu and specials. Such a range almost makes one think 'it can't all be fresh' but our choices certainly were. I might argue that it all took a long time but in fairness we had 2 courses each and weren't in a hurry - but although busy it wasn't full - so I trust staffing increases for w/e evenings.

Well we were certainly not dissapointed and I wonder looking at some of the reviews here whether some people have the wrong pub!. For us this is the perfect place to go especially on a cold winters day as it was for this visit. The staff were just about perfect for us, helpfull and knowledgable unlike some places, the menu was excellent as was the wine list. The food we had was just about perfect I quite like to have to wait for food to be cooked rather than have it delivered in seconds as you know it has come via the microwave.
