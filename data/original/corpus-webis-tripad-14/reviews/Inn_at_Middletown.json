We are originally from Ct and moved to Virginia. We had about 4 or 5 rooms reserved for relatives from different states as well. So basically it was kind of like a family reunion also. This hotel definitely made it memorable for everyone. If you ever need a place to stay where it is convenient, clean, and classy this is the place to stay. The prices do vary but affordable for this type of place. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It also has valet parking in which isn't so bad considering that parking on the street isn't such a good idea especially when it snows. Our kids loved the pool & jacuzzi. The restaurant had very good food and the bar was very relaxing. Overall , if you are tired of hotels that are overpriced and not worth the money and don't really have that relaxing feeling then you will not be disappointed at this one.
