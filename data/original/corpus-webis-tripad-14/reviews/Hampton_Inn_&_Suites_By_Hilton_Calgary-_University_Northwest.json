The welcome was very friendly and they were always ready to help with a recommendation for a meal. Try the Diner 5 mins walk away. Can't think what it was called, the hotel will know.The Red Lobster was not up to much but the home cooking at the diner can be recommended. I loved the swimming pool at the hotel and they are in an excellent location. You MUST make the 90 mile trip to Drumheller to visit the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleantology. It is a World class dinosaur museum set in the badlands. An excellent day out and for $10 an absolute bargain.
