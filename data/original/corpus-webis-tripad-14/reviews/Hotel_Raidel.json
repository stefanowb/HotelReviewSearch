The room was spotless, with a nice balcony with geranium-filled windowboxes. It was extremely quiet, the breakfast was simple but fresh and good, and the location was extremely central - 5 min. to anything in Rothenberg. The adorable old man that ran the place was something out of a book, spoke/understood English just fine. You can book easily in English via the Romantic Road website.", "user": "pepoling", "date": "February 7, 2006", "id": 4445853}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great value and location", "text": "What a gem this hotel is, a few minutes walk to the main Marketplatz and just staying in a 600 year old hotel with it's traditional decor made our stay all the more wonderful. My husband and I stayed there just before Christmas for 2 nights and were totally enchanted by Rothenburg. It was snowing as we walked up from the train station,a casual 10 minute walk. Staying inside the wall is a must.", "user": "Aussiepal", "date": "January 21, 2006", "id": 4367432}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 11, "very good": 20, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 25}, "slim_ranking": 0.4}
