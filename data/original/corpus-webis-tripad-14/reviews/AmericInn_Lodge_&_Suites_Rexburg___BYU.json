Immaculate, comfortable, homey, quiet. The staff was friendly and very accommodating for any questions we had. Discounts offered to nearby restaurants. This was comparable to Marriott quality, if not better. Stayed here as our base for a day in Yellowstone. It was a nice drive into the park and definitely a great value and superb accommodations. We love Rexburg, and now it's even better.

Dining choices in & around Rexburg are limited, so the Applebee's is very busy. But carry out is quick & very popular with other guests. The room had a small fridge & microwave as well.

I understand that reservations are made on a central booking web site, but there could have been some sort of notice posted on the hotel web site - there was not. I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff when I checked out and they acted like it was a novel idea to let guests know if these sorts of things.
