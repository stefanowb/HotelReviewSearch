Our family went to the Paradisus during spring break and our experience was pretty mixed. The resort was way overcrowded that week, but Americans seemed to be the minority, so I'm not sure how much of this was due to spring break. It was difficult to get into restaurants that you wanted. There were alot of scenes of very upset people unable to get into restaurants. We kept the same grimy beach towels the whole week because every time we went to exchange them, the hotel was out of beach towels. We had arranged through the hotel to have someone pick us up at the airport and no one came and the hotel had no explanation why and no records of who even was supposed to pick us up. Our room had an adjoining door to the room next door and when the guy next door was on the phone, it sounded like someone was in our room. My husband had fairly bad stomach trouble for over week during and after our trip.

After we landed it was a little confusing trying to locate our transportation to the hotel. The hotel lobby was beautiful and check in was a breeze. I had read some complaints about delays in getting a room but as we did not arrive at the hotel till 5:30pm everything went smoothly.The only issue I had was the \"map\" of the hotel which described all the restaurants, policies and amenities of the hotel was in Spanish. I asked for the English version and was told we don't have one. Kind of annoying. The grounds were impeccable and the grounds keeping staff were very friendly. Our room was immaculate at check in and the following morning I left a $10 tip for the maid asking for bottled water and coffee everyday. Everyday upon return to the room was an overabundance of both as well as a super clean room! The beach was beautiful no issues with cleanliness at all. The place was packed as it was spring break but never an issue of getting a place to sit. The food was okay, my biggest problem was a severe shellfish allergy and all the food descriptions were in Spanish at the buffet. When attempting to explain my situation to a waiter I felt that they did not understand the question and just say yes or no not realizing the implications. The best were Chinese and buffet for us. I think that the staff there want a tip upfront before you are served to kind of\"ensure quality service\" which is not my policy. I will tip you after I am served on the quality and attentiveness of the staff, not before. The regular waiters at both restaurants received generous tips. The only other problem which was not a big deal was on the hotel website and confirmed through my agent, we were told they had wireless internet.

I research mostly through tripadvisor and the \"Royal Service\" feature of the Paradisius was very attractive to us. I will begin by saying the resort has many wonderful qualities. Our check out started at the wrong place. I thought after telling them we had royal service that we were at royal service check in but after completing all the paperwork found out royal service check in is in a completely different building. Once at the proper place, a very lovely VIP buiding, we sat down at a nice desk with champagne and air conditioning and did the check in all over again. We made dinner reservations and were then transported by a golf cart trolley to our rooms. We had two rooms as requested side by side. Our bellboy/butler was very informative and our rooms were spacious and clean. We found out during our stay our made Francescia our maid was wonderful! each day she spent time dusting, cleaning, washing the floors and anything else that needed to be done to make our rooms spotless. We were happy to have brought some fun school supplies for her 6(!) kids. The first night we ate at the Hibiscus buffet. Big mistake. the food was horrible!! If you have to eat there order the pasta. Its only thing edible. It did get better after that. We had reservations at the Japensese (great), French (good but you will leave hungry), Chinese (Great food horrible service), and Mexican (great), Italian (great and open until 3am), we had lunch once at the italian and a late night snack once also, the minetrone soup and eggplant parm is delicious. We had breakfast and most lunches in the Royal service Lounge. The breakfast was buffet but they will make omelets if you ask. The lunches were very good especially the chicken marsela. There are no sandwiches though so try another place if you want something on that idea. My biggest complaint though was the drink service at the Royal Service beach. The royal service beach is a bit of a farce. No one checks to see who goes in an out of the royal service beach or pool and people save chairs the night before. There is no drink service on that part of the beach. When I inquired they said there is and introduced me to the \"beach runner\", he however stayed at the pool bar and we had to walk up almost everytime we wanted a drink. When I did complain at the royal service front desk, another guest overheard me and said she was served one drink on the beach the whole week she was there. I did notice the beachrunners on the other side working very hard. Someone from management needs to spend a few hours watching and correcting this situation. Any other resort we stayed at we had drink service and only had to tell them once what you wanted and they served us all day.
