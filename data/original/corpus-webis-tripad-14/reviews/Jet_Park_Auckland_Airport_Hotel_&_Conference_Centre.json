We were so pleased with our stay that we booked another night when we returned to Auckland from our holiday. We didnt eat in the restaurant but had a couple of drinks and the burgers in the bar. They were a little more expensive than your average bar but the service was flawless and the meals were served promptly. We would visit again as a couple.
