My friend due to his business stays is a Platinum member and received our stay as a complimentary room. The Hotel is very new, off 95 South a bit, so it can be a little hard to find, and the site won't register with older GPS units. Overall, it is a nice property with a friendly staff. The suites are large and clean. A complimentary bag of Sun Chips and Water were left in the room. The bath products were of very good quality (for example, Paul Mitchell Shampoo), and the beds were comfortable and their were two flat screens in the divided space, as well as a desk and wet bar sink. We both had the hot breakfast in the morning. Plenty to choose from: Oatmeal, Eggs, Sausage, Make your own waffles, and muffins, toast, bagels, cereals, etc. The area was clean, well stocked, and the hot food choices and coffee were hot and tasty. The site has a pool and a fitness center that we didn't use, but took a quick glance at, and they appeared decent. Parking on site is complimentary, but the front of the building is a little weird with a fence dividing the main hotel lot from an overflow lot. So, if you have to use the overflow lot, it is not well lit and a bit inconvenient in having to navigate around a high white wooden dividing fence.
