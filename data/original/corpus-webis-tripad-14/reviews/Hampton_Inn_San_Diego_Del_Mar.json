The beds were very good. The flat screen t.v. was nice, but no HD channels, and in fact, only about a dozen channels. Could use Discovery and Fox Sports San Diego. The breakfast room downstairs is very big with a good breakfast, (although I would have liked some donuts or something sweet!). I thought the towels were very thin, and could use upgrading.
