We booked this trip (budget package) through our auto club travel agency and thought everything would be great, although the club did not rate the accommodations in Hawaii. We were given a one-bedroom ground floor garden condo. First thing we noticed upon entering the unit: the bedroom was dark and airless with only one long relatively narrow window strip containing louvered glass in one corner of the room near the outside walkway and front door. The ceiling fan provided inadequate cooling and that explained why a table fan sat on the dresser. Later we learned that having a window opening to a walkway near the parking lot does not provide much privacy and we could hear everything that happened outside. The toilet flushed periodically by itself, the rusted dishwasher door cable snapped and the door would fall if I didn't hold it. Two burners on the stove did not work, and cockroaches crawled around the kitchen and bathroom sinks and dishwasher. There was black mold in the shower door frames. Had we been more experienced travelers, we would have demanded an upgrade on a higher floor where security might have been better and then we could have left our sliding doors in the living room open to keep the unit cooler while we were out. As it was, we felt we had to lock the door when we went to bed or left the rooms. We did complain about problems needing correction and the workman was able to repair the toilet problem. The stove and dishwasher were not fixed (dishwasher was deemed too old to repair).", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 6, 2006", "id": 5435001}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006", "text": "Staff were without execption OK and friendly.
