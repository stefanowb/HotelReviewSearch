We originally planned a different treatment and even booked it. Before paying we changed our minds and they were good about letting us change. We both did the Haapsalu Curative Mud Treatment that is 15 minutes. The woman who did it was very kind, helpful, and professional. I am larger but she never made me feel uncomfortable. She checked on each of us during the treatment to be sure we were ok. Everything was so well organized and pleasant. Neither of us had ever done anything like this before so we didn't know what to expect. But overall it was a very pleasant, relaxing experience. I know there are other places in town that offer the mud treatments as well. But if we ever return to the area I would go back here because I know they are good. English is limited but with trying some Estonian words, them trying English words, and lots of gestures it all works out.", "title": "Excellent staff at the spa", "user": "SJNK", "date": "September 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 140951992}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is very simple, almost feel like staying a dormitory.
