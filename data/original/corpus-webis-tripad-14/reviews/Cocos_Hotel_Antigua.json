Food at Cocos was superb - a different breakfast every day, and sufficient choice in the all-inclusive so that we did not even consider the a-la-carte. Staff were friendly, considerate of our needs and smiling happily. The free internet room and well-stocked library were a bonus. We loved the beach bar with attentive service of drinks. Nothing could surpass the views from our room, with 270 degree views. Mosquitos were not a problem as long as we gave ourselves a light spray of DEET.

We were in room 9 (standard room) with a view of the pool and beach and next time I would try and get further up the hill looking out over the sea. The food was great, as were the rum punches. It is perfect for a romantic getaway (my boyfriend proposed on our last day) and if you want to be sure you made the right choice just wander along the beach to the jolly harbour resort and you'll be very happy you chose Cocos. On our last night we had the most amazing dinner at Sheer at the neighbouring hotel Cocobay. We were at a table in our own cabana looking out over the sea to Montserrat.
