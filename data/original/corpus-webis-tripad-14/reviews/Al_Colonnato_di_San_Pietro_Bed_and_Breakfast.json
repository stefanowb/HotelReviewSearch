Rosa Maria was fantastic. After sorting out confusion about where the taxi dropped us (we had the B&B address by mistake instead of the apartment bldg), it was a truly wonderful experience. Rosa Maria gave us a map, information about local restaurants, transportation tips, and booked reservations for us at the Borghese Gallery. As others have said, the apartment was spotless, and stocked with fruit, milk, water, butter, jams, crispy toast, etc. We bought bread at the nearby supermarket and were able to make our own toast, coffee and tea in the morning. We meant to check out the B & B but were so busy we never got the chance. When we had trouble withdrawing all of the cash needed to pay for the apt. at the end of our stay, Rosa Maria graciously offered us a discount. We could not have asked for a warmer, nicer, more helpful hostess than Rosa Maria, who loves Rome and obviously loves helping visitors learn to love it, too. We will definitely stay again if we return to Rome. As far as the location goes, although it is a bit of a trek from the Vatican side of the city to other sites, we enjoyed walking across bridges and exploring the different neighborhoods (e.g., it is a very reasonable walk to Trastevere and to Campo di' Fiori for dinner).", "title": "The perfect apartment to call home in Rome, with the perfect hostess.", "user": "Hilary G", "date": "April 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27255033}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled solo", "text": "This place was exactly what I was looking for, clean, nice, central and good public transport.

We had a wonderful but too short (2 nights) Roman vacation, and stayed at Al Colonnato di San Pietro. Actually, because we booked so close to our trip, we stayed in the Sun Apartment, in a building about a block away from the B&B, with a mini kitchen (single burner) supplied with some comestibles including biscotti and marmalade, cereal, a heaping bowl of fresh fruit, milk, tea, and coffee, etc. Rosa Maria, the hostess at the B&B, also lets the Sun Apartment and the adjacent Moon Apartment just down the street from the B&B. The room was spacious by European standards, spotless, with a nice bathroom and plenty of privacy. The quiet neighborhood is mostly populated by \"locals\" as opposed to tourists, so you can get a feel for the real Rome, but it is a very short walk to St. Peter's (San Pietro) Basilica, the Vatican Museum, and also a short trek across the bridge and the Tiber to old Rome. We kept pinching ourselves--can you believe we are sleeping within shouting distance from Michelangelo's Piet\u00e0 and Sistine Chapel?! In fact, you can hear the bells from San Pietro from the room--what a wonderful alarm clock! From the moment we arrived, exhausted, we were whisked by Mercedes from the airport (we highly recommend the car service Rosa Maria arranged for 40\u20ac). We were made to feel comfortable by the warm welcome from Rosa Maria when we arrived at the flat. We tried both of the neighborhood restaurants that she recommended, which were excellent and quite reasonably priced for Rome. One in fact had some of the best pasta we've had in Italy! Rosa Maria and Meldi, her charming assistant, invited us to have a cappuccino to chat and talk politics in the B&B apartment on our last morning there, when we dropped off our luggage, which was a treat. Next time, we will make arrangements earlier and get one of the lovely rooms in the B&B itself (which we took a peek at)!", "title": "Quiet Romantic Retreat, A Stone's Throw from the Vatican", "user": "Incurable_Romantic", "date": "January 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23149490, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff, privacy, location", "disliked": "\u2014 can't think of anything"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed here in June, what a find.

First of all the room B&B is in a great location. Quiet, good restaurants within proximity and within blocks of Vatican City. So close in fact, we enjoyed walking over to St. Peter's Square for a after dinner stroll. The room was plenty spacious, very clean, neatly decorated, and very comfortable. The we had the bathroom outside the room which wasn't a problem at all. It too was clean and spacious. I always looked forward to the breakfast in the mornings which Medli brought to our room via a cart. The fruit cup was fantastic! It also included your breads, yougurt, jams, orange juice and a delicious cappucino. I always asked Meldi for one more which she gladly provided. She is always so cheerful and always greets with a smile. But what I liked just as much as the other great things, is the attention and service that Rosa Maria gave to us on our stay. She was always helpful in plotting the best routes to our sightseeing tours, gave us helpful tips on transportation around the city, and made sure if we ever needed anything to give her a phone call. She also set up our taxi ride to the airport which she absolutely tried to get us the best price given it was so early in the morning. Rosa Maria and Meldi truly were wonderful people.
