They are not! Because as everyone should know stars are attributed based on infrastructure, not service level or attentiveness. This hotel does not have a pool!!! Every 5 star hotel needs to have a pool. They also do not have a Spa which also is demanded by today's discerning traveler.

It was strange being in a hotel pretending to have the highest security procedures (codes to enter the hotel and the rooms) and being STOLEN. Some money was taken in our safety case by some member of the staff. The last day, when packing, we discovered that an ipod was missing. Even if they found it back they implied that it was us who had hide it! The location is great although if you need silence to sleep this is not the place. There is noise all night long in the galleria Vittorio Emanuelle. The staff is nice and gentle but for a hotel pretending to be a seven stars hotel there was some lack of professionalism.
