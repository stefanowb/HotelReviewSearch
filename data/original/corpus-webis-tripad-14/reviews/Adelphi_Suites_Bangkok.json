We will use the adelphi again when we come back to bangkok, as the location was perfect, only three minutes walk to the nana sky train. Travellers need to be aware of the constant badgering by taxi drivers, take note they will take you to unofficial ticket touts as they get a commission off tours, you need to be firm and say no you have already bought tickets for your trips, we were followed by taxi drivers insistant on getting a cut on the tours, in the end we had to be very firm to the point of being rude, which isnt in our natures to do so, so beware, the best way is to organise your tours through the hotel or the various excursion shops dotted around bangkok, as they come with a guide, the little shop round down the road (soi 8) round the corner, just before you come to nana sky train, they provided us with really good excursions and the guides spoke very good english. The best and cheapest way to get around bangkok is the sky train, beware of the tut tuts, a lot of them seem to be unable to know directions, we took one and the driver insisted on dropping us off outside the nana sky train, we had to give him directions, plus it didnt feel very safe and you get a mouthful of the city fumes, so all in all not a very healthy way to get around.", "title": "Home away from Home", "user": "kcmidi", "date": "April 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 15493974, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Huge Suites"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I just spent 10 glorious nights at the Adelphi Suites.
