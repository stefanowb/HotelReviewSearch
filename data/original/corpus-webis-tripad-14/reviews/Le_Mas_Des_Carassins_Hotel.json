The hotel is minutes from town and a great base to explore Provence. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful every morning and the staff was very friendly, accomodating and helpful.

This is the part of France where you slow down the tourist agenda and simply enjoy being there. If you must fill your days with touring, there is plenty, just don't forget to slow down to enjoy it.
