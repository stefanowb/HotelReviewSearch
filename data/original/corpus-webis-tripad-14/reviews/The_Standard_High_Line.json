The rooms are smaller than the Gansevoort, but they are newer and quite comfortable (once you get over the fact that your room is exposed to the world via the floor-to-ceiling windows, that is). The bathrooms have glass walled showers that abut the bed and if you're staying here with someone you're quite intimate with, this can be fun. The shower has very good water pressure despite being one of those stupid \"rain shower\" heads. The one problem with the shower is that it is not enclosed so water that sprays off of you or the wall just pools up outside the shower soaking your bath mat. The sink in the bathroom is kind of silly form-over-function-esque but not nearly as foolish as those in the \"Dream Downtown\" rooms. Beds are comfortable, but unfortunately very low to the ground. I despise that trend in hotels. There is a built in \"couch\" and a small table to eat your unbelievably delicious room service on. That is something that should not be overlooked, by the way; the room service. It is the best I've had at any hotel, both in terms of food quality and the service itself. The staff are so nice and are always very prompt. The food, well, it's just incredible for room service. Do yourself a favor and order at least one meal from room service here. You won't regret it. The rooms have giant LG flat screen tvs mounted on the wall with difficult to use remote controls because of some inexplicable delay between the time you push a button when the tv reacts to that command. I have stayed here several times along with several colleagues in different rooms and it's the same for all of us every single time no matter what room we stay in. It's so strange. The front desk must get hundreds of calls a week about this awful inconvenience. The other bad thing about the Standard is the free wi-fi service. It is PAINFULLY slow because they want you pay $20 a day to upgrade to the faster connection. This is extremely frustrating, especially if you need the service for work. For a modern hotel, they sure do fail in the technology department.
