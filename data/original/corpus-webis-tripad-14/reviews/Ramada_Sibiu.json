It was positioned just a short walk across a park to the Historic centre. We were able to park securely on site (small charge) but it was reassuring that the hire car was safe. We were upgraded to a gorgeous suite on the 13th floor without asking. The suite had a duel aspect full floor to ceiling view over the park, historic town, and the mountains. I have stayed in some lovely rooms but the views from this suite were just amazing. We had two bathrooms, a lovely bedroom (again with views over the town) and a sitting/dining area all with great facilities including 2 large flat screen TVs. I had read other reviews mentioning stained carpets, but I can assure you that the condition of our rooms were 100% The hotel is modern, and well serviced. The staff were very polite. Breakfast was a full buffet selection, and very tasty. The scenic lift took you to your floor, the ground floor, the gym floor and the restaurant. 100% Ramada Sibiu.
