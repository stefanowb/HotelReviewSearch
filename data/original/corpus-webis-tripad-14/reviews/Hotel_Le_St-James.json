The doorman complete with shiny brass buttoned coat and white gloves escorted us through the lobby to the front desk. An equally sophisticated front desk staff awaited us there. The check in was quick and we were on our way, but not before being presented with the most beautiful hotel key I have ever seen! A heavy brass key chain with a luxurous red tassel. The luggage was taken up to the room by yet another professional staff member. Upon entering the room we found soft music playing, the perfectly made bed with crisp Frette sheets and the beautiful overhead halogen lighting glowing made the room look absolutely divine. IOur room a junior suite had a bedrrom area with an adjacent sitting area with a desk and chair. The bathroom, a large marble one had a separate shower and deep tub with dual sinks. Everything in tis hotel is of the utmost quality! The towels are thick and gorgeous. The sheets are Frette and the quality of the decorations and furnishings was over-the-top. Upon returning to the lobby area where we found the hotel's restaurant, the XO. The XO is exquisite! A breathtaking dinning room with very high cielings and chandliers. A mezzanine level sits over the restaurant where one can either sit or have coffe, drink etc. The first day, we had breakfast and the service was exceptional as well. The breakfast was beautifully and artfully presented. The portions were small but adequate. It is slightly expensive but a real nice treat of refinement to start your day off right! In the evening, the library adjacent to the entrance is an absolutely divine place to have an after dinner drink as you let your eyes be dazzled by this beautiful room. The hotel houses a rare collection of books and many newspapers are available every day, along with current magazines. It is just a treat to sit down here in the evening or on a rainy day a great place to read a book and cocoon yourself away! The hotel is also very centrally located in the heart of the old section. Its a 5 minute walk or less from all the sights. Notre Dame a gorgeous Basilica is just a couple of blocks away. When in Montreal DO NOT miss the dramatic light show which is presented nighly at 6:30 and 8:00. It is beautiful, dramatic and educational. It will present the history of the church and of Montreal and it is a MUST do! While we were there we did not have a bad meal. I would highly recommend the Pierre du Calvert Restaurant, housed in a 300 year old mansion. Food, Service and decor was outstanding! Gibby's a steak house housed in the Youville Stables is excellent as well. Another hit was Bonaparte which is open for both lunch and dinner. By the way, the Concierge at the hotel named \"Phillipe\" is wonderful (I wanted to take him home with us!) Very knowledgeable, refined and service oriented. He seemed to know what we needed without asking and always gave great recomendations. Along with Phillippe the entire staff was outstanding and we cannot rave about this property more. It was a wonderful 3 days in heaven. I would go back tomorrow! Do yourselves a favor and stay at the St. James when visiting Montreal. A tip: The website lists rack rates which are quite high and Expedia never seems to have them available. I called the hotel directly and spoke to the genral manager which gave us a very reasonable (for this 5 star plus hotel) price of $350.00 (canadian) per night. They upgraded us to a junior suite which although not huge was spaciuos and very comfortable. A great stay at a great hotel!!

The room at any other Hotel in New York or Paris would start at $700, our rate was considerbly less. Walking distance from any type of restaurant (formal - casual). My wife and I looked at the Negilan and the Ritz Carlton when we were there. The Ritz Carlton appeared to be tired, The Negilan had a heavy smoking ordor.

This hotel is quite beautiful and located in the old section of Montreal. Quite convenient to the airport - about a 20 minute ride with no traffic. Upon arriving at the hotel when you enter the hotel you get the feel of yesteryear as this was once a bank - very grand. I must admit that they do pay attention here to the little things regarding their guests. When I arrived from the airport via cab the doorman proceeded to remove my bag from the trunk of the cab - in doing so he made note from my luggage tag of my name and was quick to address me by my name - a little thing - but it definitely shows you something about this hotel. When I was brought to the reception desk for my check-in it was handled efficiently - though I had to wait a few minutes to make sure that my room was ready (which was odd to me as it was 5pm). My room which was a deluxe king was lovely - large and tastefully decorated. My only qualm was that I was given a room that was right near the elevator (I had made my reservation through Leading Hotels of the World where I am a member - my profile and reservation state to be placed away from elevators - reception needs to pay attention to this - though I will be honest as it did not become a problem because it was extremely quiet and I never heard any noise in relation to the elevator). In detailing my room which was large, there was a large king bed with delicious linens (very European), a desk, a small sitting area with two chairs and a large closet. The bathroom again very large with soaking tub and spa shower stall (with the rain shower fixture) with wonderful products for use. My room was extremely clean - and one very odd thing is that there were no do not disturb signs for ones door - but that did not matter because housekeeping never interrupted you while you were in your room (this usually happens in most hotels at around 7pm as they will come around for turn down service) - but when you went out in the morning as well as in the evening for dinner - you came back to a room that had been attended to. The hotels dining room \"XO\" is breathtaking (I believe some refer to this as the Grand Salon). Very stately for all meals as well as a formal afternoon tea or for drinks (there is also the Library for drinks as well). Please note - if you plan on having breakfast a the hotel do not bother with their continental breakfast (which consists of juice, coffee, and pastries) as their breakfast menu is superb! From presentation to taste - I never had such a fantastic breakfast. I did not dine in the restaurant for dinner but can only imagine how wonderful it must be and next time will try it. The concierge staff is tops. Prior to my arrival I had phoned with some dinner reservation requests which were taken care of perfectly - even a reservation in the top restaurant in Montreal Toques'. The location of the hotel is really quite convenient and just a ten minute walk to the historic area which is filled with shops, galleries and restaurants with a very Eurpoean feel.
