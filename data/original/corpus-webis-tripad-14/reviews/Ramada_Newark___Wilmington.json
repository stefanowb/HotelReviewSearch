Well thanks for the 6 days of notice...but I will pass on the Days Inn. Also instead of the $199 for the one night I was going to pay at he Ramada..he said I can have a room at the Days Inn in Wilmington at a cheaper rate of $169. (keep your $30 and honor my reservation!!) I went on line and they were offering rooms at $117. When I told Dwayne he said for me to go on line a reserve it. Dwayne is that how you treat your confirmed guests 6 days away from arrival? Who else did you move? You told me I was not the only one. Wow that made me feel better!!! I can't say \"walk\" because you are not paying for the move. Who else did this happen too????
