There are some good restaurants near enough to the hotel within walking distance. The rooms are...as expected with the Ritz C...large, comfortable and spotless and well equiped.

The Marta stop is about a block and a half from the hotel and is a very easy walk. The shopping mall directly across the street from the hotel was also very convenient.

The lobby seemed small, and it took a while to get checked-in (by Ritz standards.) The drinks in the room were not cold, and the bathroom was very small. I found that the bathrooms at the Intercontinental were more spacious, and let's face it, the Intercontinental can be a lot less than the Ritz. This one is located in the heart of Buckhead, very easy to get in and out of, considering it's location. I would stay here again, but I prefer the Ritz in Midtown over this one. In Midtown, we were greeted like royalty, our car was cleaned out (all trash, etc. removed), doors were opened for us, etc. It was a good experience, and everything was very clean, but it was not a GREAT experience. I was hot the whole time until I got the fan, and I was dying for a cold drink, which I could never find one.
