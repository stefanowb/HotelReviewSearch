This was the fourth time one or more members of our party had stayed at the Wengener Hof over the past 10 years. Once again we were not disappointed. Rooms are comfortable though not luxurious, south facing have wonderful views, staff are all very efficient and friendly and the food was superb. It is only a short walk from both the station and the cable car, ski's can be left at the sister hotel next to station if you prefer.For some reason we failed when we tried to book through the usual websites, they all came back as \"no vacancies\".
