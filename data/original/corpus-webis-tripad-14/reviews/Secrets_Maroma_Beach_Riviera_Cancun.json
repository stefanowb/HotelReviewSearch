We had a huge sash over our door the entire stay that said honeymoon and we came back to our room after dinner to drawn baths and rose petals all over the place.

After sitting down with the concierge, having a piece of dessert and a glass of champagne, we were given a small tour of the facilities. Wonderfully landscaped. The pools were great and the beach was the best beach I have ever been to in my life! Not rocky at all like in CT. The sand was white and SO soft. The water was warm and crystle clear. The swimouts are highly recommended. Its wonderful to be able to go for a night swim whenever we wanted to. The food was great. The staff was friendly and EVERYONE...and I mean EVERYONE who walked by you said hello and good afternoon. Everyone was a such a pleasure and there are no complaints. We had the opportunity to go scuba diving (HIGHLY recommended). We also went to Aqua World which was great fun as well. Entertainment was good as well. They celebrated July 4th with a huge beach party and a great live band. We had a private dinner on the beach one night - be aware - its not EXACTLY private. There can be anywhere from 5-10 more couples not a couple of feet away from you...but you are still RIGHT on the beach. Still a VERY romantic night for the two of us.

My stay is a work in progress but I would warn those considering booking a trip to this resort. I have been reading every review since the resort opening and to those of you that follow trip advisor know, everyone has different opinons and you have to read through the reviews to get the general consensus. We had booked on American Express through Newark, 4500 for 10 nights ocean front room. This was a great price at the time that I booked it in the first week of August. We could of had partial ocean view for 3250 but decided to splurge. I heard reviews that ocean front seemed to be a problem for some people that booked it so I called AE 3 weeks before leaving so that they would call the resort and make sure the ocean front buildings were open etc. They confirmed. So low and behold on our arrival there apparently was a flood in our room and they had no ocean fronts available. We said, fine just refund us. They told us it was between us and american express. They offered us another room and 200 spa credit and wanted us to sign a waiver. We wanted them to get AE on the phone they gave us the rep at the hotel who was equally as useless We told them to call the 800 number on our reservations which they finally did, AE called the hotel and they finally micraculously found a oceanfront room. Now we had not booked a swim up and we purposefully didnt due to the mosquito problem. The only room they had was in bulding 16 room 1710 and is a swimup which is in the ocean front building however there is a tiki hut on the beach along with equipment that occludes the view of the ocean, not to mention that it butss up to the neighboring hotel service buildings so we have a chain link fence on our side with the service people from the hotel going back and forth down the trail alongside the fence. Do not let them give you this room. So now we are waiting for our room to get fixed which they said could take up to a week or more because they have to change all the plumbing. They said they have no checkouts until Nov 8 and then we will be moved to the room that we actually paid for. But of course I meet someone who is in a ocean front and is checking out today but they played dumb when |I went to them with this information and asked me what room he was in and was he checking out early. I will not go to a secrets again. Are we enjoying ourselves. Yes we are not letting this ruin our vacation but I would not stay at another secrets again when you cant trust them and get what we paid for. I am still wondering if I should call EX again but want to just enjoy myself and not get caught up in all this.

This resort is beautiful, fun and a great get away. We absolutely loved the accomodations.The restaraunts were good and staff was friendly. The beach was pretty but rough waves kept us from enjoying snorkeling or other activitieson the water,so we spent alot of our time just relaxing . I would highly recommend this resort but I would definetly use the safe as we had about 150.00 stolen from my bag as well as my ipod. We left the resort and did not realize they were missing until we arrived at the airport .I have called the resort twice since we have been back. They are \"investigating\" it but have yet to hear any thing back from them. So, if you go keep your valuables close.

I have been to Riviera Maya many times, stayed at Royal Hideaway, Excellence, Dreams Tulum (now closed) , Blue Parrot , Secrets Capri and Riu Palace. I was very curious about Secrets Maroma. What most of the other reviewers said was true, horrible mosquito problem, mediocre food. Fantastic beach, personnel incredibly friendly,entertainment moderate. What may not have been mentioned is that the hotel was just too Americanized!! They tried to gear everything to the US traveler and they just went overboard. Music was mostly truly elevator music, little salsa or latin. Felt like you were in the hospital at one flew over the cuckoos nest. Fajitas and tacos are better at Taco Bell. If you ask the server, they will bring jabaneros, sour cream and other hot sause to \"spice things up\". Food was okay, just nothing special. My second complaint was that things in the room just didn't quite work correctly. Toilet paper roll was set too wide and evertime you pulled the paper the entire unit would fly across the floor, which was always wet because the shower floor was angled the wrong way and instead of water running down the drain, it collected (deeply) under the vanity with no hope of drainage. The ceiling fan never worked. Appeared that the switch had been worked on many times without success. There were light switches that didn't work and switiches that had no apparent purpose. Lights on the porch had no switches at all...Asked the room service person and he said the light switch for our porch was located in the room next to ours, as was the secret room service door (we had none). It seems that this resort has potential to be a very nice resort. But for such a new resort, they should take more care in fixing the little things that can be very annoying. But I'll say it again, the beach is awesome and hotel personnel great. Would I go back to that resort? probably not. For the $$$ there are much better all-inclusives in the area. One more thing, Hot water was only in your imagination. Had this beautiful huge hot tub in room and even bigger tub on deck, but alas, only ice cold water for most of the time we were there.", "title": "Need to make serious changes", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "garyandsue515", "date": "November 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 21697440, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The beach", "disliked": "\u2014 Various items that were brokien in the room"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I are in our mid 20s and have been going to a Secrets resort every year since 2004.
