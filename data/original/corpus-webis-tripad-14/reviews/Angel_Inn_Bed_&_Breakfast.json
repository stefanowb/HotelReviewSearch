I can't find enough words to express our satisfaction and gratitude to Kathy's amazing professionalism and welcoming attitude. The location is perfect and the house is beautifully decorated. The Gabriel room where we stayed at is cozy and very comfortable. Some people may find the restroom too small but we come from Europe where hotel rooms are tiny so we were not really shocked. Besides, the Jacuzzi is awesome! Kathy served a wonderful breakfast that, in addition to being different every day, brought me memories of my childhood (cakes, pastries, hmmm). In the evening, we were indulged with a nice glass of wine and some crackers and cheese, which we could take to our room or to the beautiful porch in the lakefront.", "title": "Sweet...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LuizTrip", "date": "August 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 38051226}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Really, we wanted to keep the secret to ourselves but we also want that Kathy and her husband stay in the business of providing guests with an unforgettable experience.", "title": "Can't Wait to go back again!

The Inn was beautiful! I wish I could have spent more time there...I didn't want to leave. Sitting on lake property, the views are spectacular. It felt very relaxing and serene. I enjoyed my breakfast (which were delightfully delicious) out by water every morning...what a great way to start the day! The rooms were beautifully decorated, very clean, fresh and new. To unwind in the ultra bath was a relaxing way to end the day. The owners, Kathy and Dave were truly gracious and very hospitable. This was a great B & B. Best of the best!
