You stay in houses that were converted into 4 mini condo's, our room was clean, didn't encounter any bugs. The walls are very thin, heard our neighbors clinging pots and pans during the evening... not a very big deal since it was quiet during the time we were sleeping. The employee's at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful, going out of their way to make you feel at home. The pool was nice, although you are surrounded by tree's so there are lots of bugs... but nothing too crazy, you learn to just deal with it. I believe they may still be renovating since the TV in our bedroom was an older style TV while the TV in the living room was a flat screen, not a big deal... but we found that a bit odd. The only problem we came across was when it came time to the typical time share up sell/upgrade. Two guys came to our room, knocked on the door about 15 minutes after we checked in. One of the guys started off by being pushy, asking why I haven't upgrading since I bought the timeshare and said I was suppose to based on the package I bought. His tone and words just turned me off and I told him I wasn't interested in a presentation during my stay with them. He wouldn't take that for an answer, he said it would only be 15 minutes (LOL) and they would give us breakfast and gifts. I told him we were only their for 2 days and didn't want to use up any time with a presentation when we have no interest in upgrading at the moment. After a little more back n forth he finally told me he would put a \"Decline\" on my account and that was that. He turned around and left looking annoyed and never giving me the Welcome Kit I was told I was going to receive (not sure if that was out of spite or not). So, everything except for THAT experience was very nice and I would recommend this Wyndham to any timeshare owner looking to visit Williamsburg for a few days.", "title": "A nice Wyndham to stay at when visiting Williamsburg, VA", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jason8478", "date": "September 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 80319209}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Travelled here with my mom and sisters for a little weekend girls getaway.

The concierge just listed the times on a piece of paper. We got a reminder call on Saturday morning, and when we said no we weren't interested, she said okay and wished us a happy visit/stay. We had a 2 BR Lockout Unit. Perfect for our group of 5. Both units were very clean and well stocked (dishes/utensils) with everything we could need. The extra pillows I requested when we checked in arrived within minutes of us getting to our units. Only one puzzling thing was the 1776 Hotel that is also on the grounds.
