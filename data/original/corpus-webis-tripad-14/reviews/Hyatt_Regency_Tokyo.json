This was not our first trip to Tokyo , and this hotel outweighed the previous ones. The neighborhood is very quiet at night as its located in the business district of Shinjuku. The service and staff was excellent. The fitness room was more than adequate and the pool was relaxing, but the hot tub was a bit small. Everyone was attentive and courteous. My boyfriend lost his JR pass, and we thought it was on the shuttle. We told the staff and they turned the bus inside out looking of it. The food was good as well, but like every hotel, expensive. There is a McDonald's in the basement of the building on the left in case you crave fast and cheaper food. The hotel is located right next to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government tower. Tower #1 has an amazing observatory deck. The hotel is a 5 minute shuttle ride from Shinjuku station. The bus runs every 20 minutes and starts at 8am and the last bus leaves the hotel at 9:40pm, while the last bus from Shinkjuku station is at 9:50pm. In case you miss the last bus, don't fear, the hotel is just a 5-8 minute walk to the station using the tunnel which is right next to the hotel. The tunnel will take you right into the station. Very convienent. In terms of rooms, they are large for tokyo standards and if you can, get a room with a view. We had the city/park view and it was a sight to behold. I would highly recommend it. The beds were a bit too firm in my opionion, other than that, everything ws perfect.", "title": "This hotel is definitely one to consider in Tokyo", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Delorian", "date": "June 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5317739}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "We stayed here from 25 to 30 March for the first five nights of our holiday and found it to be well located, with a direct train from Narita and good train connections everywhere.

Nice and quiet room. During the Easter holiday, there is no one king bed size room for the first night. We have changed from a twin room to a king size one bed room for last 2 nights. Everything is fine, except the TV channel. It's really surprise that they don't have NHK TV channel, which is a famous local Japanese TV channel I love to see. We can walk to the JR Shinjuku station, Toei station underground. It is much more easy and quick, but it is quite difficult to find a right way.

Room comes with a king sized bed and city view. I went with 2 sons aged 8 and 10. Staff very willing to help and makes you feel like a VIP. I even left my 2 kids to swim alone in the hotel pool by themselves cos the staff on duty told me they would look after them and need no parent's supervision. ( Note that there's a charge of 1050Y per child, 525Y for rental of swimming trunks per child though there is no time limit ) The free shuttle bus to Shinjuku Station was punctual to the minute. Even the complimentary breakfast (American) was good. When we complained about the heated room they promptly delivered an electrical fan. Room by Tokyo standard is spacious enough. Can't find a single fault with the hotel.
