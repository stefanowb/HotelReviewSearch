But there is very little to complain about this little gem. We had to stay overnight in Jakarta on our way to Palangkaraya and thanks to other reviewers I chose this hotel. Booked a room via fax and received return fax confirmation within the hour. Our flight from Bali was two hours delayed but hotel staff was waiting for us upon arrival to take us to the hotel. Had problems hooking up to the internet, but technical support was at the door within minutes of the phone call, not once but twice! I\u2019ve been away for work for a week, and it was fantastic to relax using their well equipped gym, pool, huge sauna & steamroom, 25 feet hot tub, cold plunge pool! Lockers provided with amenities such as shorts, towels, slippers, robe. Not sure about ladies lockers. There is a karaoke lounge and a bar as well.", "title": "What's there to complain?", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "gabchong", "date": "December 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 22336846, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Fantastic as a transit hotel in Jakarta", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled solo", "text": "My experience mirrors all the previous posters, and I based my decision to stay here on those reviews.
