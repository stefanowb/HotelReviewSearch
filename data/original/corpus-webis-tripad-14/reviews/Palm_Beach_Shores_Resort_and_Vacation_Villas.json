But the building is quite pink so we found it quickly. The hotel is perfectly right on the beach. The elevators were being replaced when we were there so we took the stairs a lot, but we didn't mind. We were only on floor 3. The old elevators work they're just slow. The pool area is nice but very full of kids. We ate at the restaurant on site on night. It was just okay. The drinks at the pool bar were good and strong. We cooked most of our meals in our room and the kitchen was well stocked and well functioning for what we needed. ONe night the handle fell off when I opened the convection microwave. We called the front and a man came up and replaced the whole microwave in minutes. We also did the timeshare presentation. They offered us free breakfast and a $75 visa gift card for doing the presentation when we arrived. We didn't schedule it then. On Tuesday morning (the day they wanted us to do the presentation on) when we woke up we thought maybe they would still let us do it. We called the front desk and they said if we could be down in the lobby by 9:30 that we could do the presentation and they would give us free breakfast and $100 visa gift card. So if you know how to say no in these presentations drag them on a little and they'll offer you more money to do it. Our salesperson was very polite until we said no. THen she flipped a switch and became quite rude and pushy. We expected this as we've done these presentations before. Just be prepared for them to be suddenly pushy when you start to say no and they will try to guilt you into it. BUt if you don't mind the 2-3 hour breakfast and presentation it is easy money and a free meal at the restaurant. THe building is old but the interior has been recently updated and it is well cared for and very clean. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. Oh, and wireless internet is free in the lobby.", "title": "Great Beach, Nice Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Rndthewrld", "date": "May 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 29203045}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled solo", "text": "I am an RCI member and owner of timeshare at the West Palm Beach Resort and Villas.

I'm really not sure what property many of the other reviewers below stayed at but it wasn\u2019t Palm Beach Shores. Only thing I can figure is they are mega picky and are extremely paranoid\u2014I mean extremely. We found the property clean, the staff friendly (especially Maria at the front desk) and very peaceful. There is a great one man band at the pool daily (different guy every day) that played a variety of music. The Pool is great (not very big) but just the right size for the resort. The pool bar staff is very friendly and they keep the drinks coming. I couldn\u2019t believe how cheap the drinks were\u2026 $2.00 for a Beer, $4.00 for a mixed drink and $6.00 for a frozen drink\u2014wow what a deal. They also delivered to the beach. We did get 2 chairs covered by a full Canopy on the beach. It was $30.00 for both of us for the day\u2026not bad at all, Chairs at the Pool are free, and you can rent just a chair on the beaqch for much less or lay on a towel for free\u2026. The room was Great\u2014very roomy and had the best beds we\u2019ve ever slept in. The Restaurant was good and prices were very reasonable. And it is absolutely safe to walk outside the property. My wife and I walked to the Marina several times at night\u2014never a problem\u2026. BTW, go to the Marina on Thursday Night\u2014they have a craft fair with several venders and the food and drinks are great\u2014quite the happening place. This is not a large resort, so don\u2019t go with the expectation that there are 5 restaurants and tons of bars. If that\u2019s what you are looking for, this place is not for you. If you are looking for a small quaint property, where you can relax and drive into town (5 minutes) for nice restaurants and nightlife\u2026this is for you.

Nothing is close by. The rooms are very nice, with HUGE bathrooms. Two BIG bugs, now deceased, were the only icky arrival surprises. The kitchen is sparse: no oven other than a microwave w/ convection capabilities. Only two burners. (I like to cook A LITTLE). Our room was noisy. It backed up to the elevators and we heard the \"swoosh/DING\" all day/night long. One day we had NO water. Washer/dryer access was a nightmare. As an RCI exchanger, I'm spoiled by our home resort (Eagles Nest, Marco Island, Fl...awesome!) and expected better than the lowest floor w/ view of the parking lot (also noisy). Otherwise, the ocean was unswimmable due to wind, drop-off and sharks!. Beach was nice. Cabanas worth the money ( very windy during our stay. Cabana helped greatly). Staff extremely friendly. Pool is very clean, tho no chairs available after 9am. Spa was \"foamy\" by early evening...yuck. Restaurant, not bad and specials were above average. The facility was clean, expensive for extras, and you can walk NO WHERE for dinner/entertainment/shopping other than two rather \"dive-y\" bars. Somewhat sketchy area over the bridge. A terrible resort for older teen/early 20's children.Truly, nothing for them to do (OK, it does have a fitness center) unless you drive to Palm Beach.
