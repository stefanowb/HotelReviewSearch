The property is \"off the strip\" and shares the pool area with the Flamingo. The weather was junk while we were there - cold but the HGVC pool and hot tub were heated and open, while the Flamingo pool was closed. Valet parking is $9 a day but there is free parking in a parking garage shared with O'shea's and the Imperial Palace. We self parked and had no problems finding space. The property does not have a casino which is a nice respite from some of the casino hotels. There is a small but well stocked canteen but there were groceries nearby (~3 miles) if you planned to cook. The kitchen in the one bedroom was well fixed - full size stove and refrigerator, plus a microwave. We cooked breakfasts to keep the costs down.
