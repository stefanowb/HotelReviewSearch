The hotel staff was consistently warm, courteous and helpful. The property is in excellent condition - well-maintained and well-decorated in a classic style. It's a relatively small hotel which works to the advantage of the establishment - it's managed in a very professional way and no one crowds your space, but there is a human scale to the experience.

Pretty good for the first afternoon! We took a quick cab ride the next day to the Hard Rock Cafe, where we had to pick up our on-off bus pass. By the way, it cost us 80? in a taxi from Paris CDG. The hotel staff said they could get us a car for 85? and a cab would be 60?, so she recommended a cab.

I dont know anything about hotels in Paris, but for the price we didn't feel that we got that much. The hotel and rooms are just really old, which was a disappointment to us. To some extent the charm was great, but new carpet would have been a major improvement. In order for the AC to work, you must keep the windows closed. It automatically turns off when you open the window. It took us awhile to figure that out! Like others have said, the toilet is in a separate room from the bathroom. I felt like it was in a closet. The shower was very nice and had plenty of pressure and hot water. In general, the room was very clean and housekeeping knew when they could come clean because whenever we left the hotel we were asked to return our room key \"for emergencies.\" I thought that was a little strange, but we did as we were asked by the reception desk and they gave our key back each time we returned. When you're in the room you have to put the room key (card) in a slot to run the lights. It's a great way to keep their electric clsts down, but don't plan on charging any electronics while you are gone for the day. We had our breakfast delivered to our room. It was prompt and served hot.
