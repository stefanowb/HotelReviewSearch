It was a good choice indeed! The property is perfectly located just outside the bustle of Patpong Area, 5 mins. walk to Silom Rd and to Subway and Skytrain. Being the hotel founded in 1967, it obviously shows some signs of age, bathrooms to be renovated, here and there some decoration to be modernized: however everything is more than compensated by the excellent staff, perfectly trained, polite, warm but not pushy, worth a 5 stars hotel. Extremely recommended also the Ruenton Coffee shop, with a wonderful top quality thai+western buffet, committed waiters. Small but very nice the Bakery Shop which offers 50% discounts after 6PM on good snacks and cakes. Pool -which seemed to me renovated since last year- is not large but adequate. Absolutely recommended unless -as I wrote in my previous comment- you're a contemporary minimal chic addicted. Remember: forget some signs of age of bathrooms and corridors and cherish the service offered. It's the staff who make a hotel's reputation, and at the Montien they all work so well from doorman to bellboys, receptionists, cashiers, waiters, maitre d' and so on that you really feel perfectly at the right place.", "title": "Good location, not too busy.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LozzaMelbourne", "date": "January 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 12782583, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 It was in an interesting location", "disliked": "\u2014 The hotel's restaurants were expensive"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a good experience at Montien. We arrived very early in the morning after an 8 and half hour flight. The travel agent had requested early check in but I didn't hold out much hope to get our room that early in the morning but we only had to wait until about 9 before we could access our room. Last year when we arrived that early at a hotel I paid for an extra nights accommodation so we could have a rest so we did appreciate not having to pay for the priviledge. The room was spacoius and comfortable with a nice bathroom. Everything worked well and we had a good view out of the front of the hotel. It is in a part of Bangkok which is not as hectic as some as it seems to be an area with lots of office workers. It is opposite a street which has the red light district with lots of girly bars and boy bars down the side streets but even though we wandered around the night market in the street there was nothing offensive. We were more concerned about how youung the girls in their white bikinis were that were out the front of the bars. There was a muck up with the hotel reception thinking that breakfast wasn't included in our deal and I couldn't prove that it was. We were told to have breakfast and keep our receipt and it would be refunded if need be but we went for a walk instead and found a McDonalds. When we got back we were called over and told that it was included as they had emailed the travel agent to check. It was our fault we didn't do as we were told. We were leaving early the next morning so didn't have much time to enjoy the buffet breakfast but everything we had was great. There were plenty of small places out in the streets to have meals rather than the more expensive places in the hotel and lots of street stalls if you are adventurous enough. The night market was not as good as the bigger ones in other parts of the city. The variety was not good and the prices comparitively high. Best to shop near The Indra Regent and Baiyoke Sky. It was a good hotel and a nice place to stay if you don't like crowds.
