Ok standard of appearance but the bath had a constant drip; to the extent that the bath was water stained as it had been dripping longer than a few days.

Glad to report, however, that we didn't experience any of the niggles that have affected others. Check in was handled well. Bedroom was comfortable and clean, if a little dated. Our stay included a champagne cream tea. We were served this in one of the lounges one of the staff even lit the fire for us. Now to dinner: glass of champers in the bar, where they took our food and wine order promptly with no problems. The restaurant itself was lovely- we were seated under the \"starlight\" part of the ceiling- very romantic. Even though the inclusive menu sounded and looked nice enough on other diners plates we opted for a few of the courses where supplements applied. The food was excellent. Beautifully cooked venison and halibut amongst our choices. The only negative is the price of wines by the glass- a little steep to say the least. However I would definately return.
