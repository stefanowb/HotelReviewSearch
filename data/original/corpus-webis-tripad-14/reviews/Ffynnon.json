The bed was very comfortable so slept well and the shower was powerful and hot. The B&B is in an old rectory that has been beautifully decorated & furnished. On the ground floor there is a lounge with hewspapers & games and a lovely breakfast room. On the first floor there is a butlers pantry (next to Sydney room) where there is a fridge containing fresh milk, a wider selection of tea/coffee and where you can eat a takeaway if so desired. For breakfast there is fresh fruit, cereal & juice selection and lovely brown toast. The hot breakfast was a choice of pancakes, potato cakes, porridge as well non + vegetarian full Welsh. How refreshing to have alternative cooked choices than just the full English/Welsh so this was a definite positive for us! We have marked this as a 4 rather than a 5 for 3 reasons only: 1. it wasn't possible to just wash your hair without taking a shower as there was no hand held attachment to the bath or shower (and we had a quick turnaround to go out for a meal) 2. we found the bedroom to be slightly on the chilly side late evening (note, the welcome booklet does say that the temperature is set depending on the season but if you speak with the owners it is possible to over ride the standard setting but as we were only there for 1 night we didn't have chance to do this). 3. there is a lack of space/shelving in the bathroom to put toiletry bag/toiletries. However in light of the beautiful building, lovely rooms, nice welcome, good breakfast these are minor quibbles and we would recommend this B&B without hesitation and would happily return.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "pooCheshire_England", "date": "July 25, 2012", "id": 135354405}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012", "text": "Beautifully restored house with well integrated modern touches.

We arrived here after a very wet and windy cycle ride from Porthmadog and Debra could not have been more welcoming and nothing was too much trouble getting ourselves dried out. The hotel is just beautifully furnished and very comfortable throughout. Our room, Annis, was spacious with top notch bed linen and the sorts of little touches here and there that make a place stand out. I loved the way that they made the roll-top bath double as a shower - I'm not a fan of shower curtains normally, but even this really worked. Tea and welsh cakes in the sitting room was a great way to unwind and the butler's pantry functioned as a good dining room for our takeaway curry! An excellent night's sleep almost goes without saying and the cooked breakfast did not disappoint. We also took a packed lunch away with us for the next day's cycling and it was delicious.
