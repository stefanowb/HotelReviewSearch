While the hotel was under renovation during our stay - that wasn't even the issue. The front desk staff were so rude! The woman who checked us in (early afternoon) seemed so put off when I asked if she had a map of Florence (this was in stark contrast to our stay in Rome and Venice). There always seemed to be two people at the desk in the evening - an older gentleman and a kid (I'm sure he was older than a \"kid\" but to me he looked 15). The older man couldn't be bothered to acknowledge us and the younger man seemed uncomfortable to be there. The breakfast was by far the worst of the three hotels (Hotel Nazionale in Rome and Hotel Doge Orseolo in Venice) and barely edible. Stale bread - ugh!
