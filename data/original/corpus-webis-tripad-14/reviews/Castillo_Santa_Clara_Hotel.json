Please be aware however that a steep hill or lots of steps have to be negotiated to reach either beach, not bad on the way down but a struggle on the way back. Its position means that most apartments have wonderful sea views. We could not have wished for a better view from our fairly large balcony. The staff who man the office are polite and courteous. (It is worthwhile noting that if you are arriving on a nightflight you should NOT book these apartments, after midnight you will be unable to get your key until 8.00a.m.!!! Getting a taxi if you have to leave before 8.00a.m is also a problem. I had to stand alongside the main road for 40 minutes waiting for a vacant taxi to hail at 7.00 in the morning - there is no receptionist to call one for you). There is a nice pool and an on-site supermarket with limited provisions open from 9.00 a.m to 9.00 p.m.", "title": "Basic apartment / self catering", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "hesketh27", "date": "August 17, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 5619403, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 View from balcony", "disliked": "\u2014 Size of complex"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "Downsides of the apartments are the limitations of the reception as outlined above, the whole complex is VERY drab, dark and dated.
