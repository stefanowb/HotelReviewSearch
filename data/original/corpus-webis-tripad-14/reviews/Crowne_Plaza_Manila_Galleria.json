We were scheduled for the Holiday Inn but it was overbooked so we were overflowed to the Crowne Plaza. It was definitely good fortune for us as the CP is a higher quality hotel. We were walked from one hotel to the next and escorted through the entire process. Each day.. it didn't matter who we passed in the hallway at any time.. I was ALWAYS greeted by the staff and wishe a good day, or evening, or \"morning sir.\" It seemed authentic and I haven't experienced this in a while (certianly not in the last year of my travels in USA and SEASia). The staff was always attentive and helpful. I had ants invade my mini-bar area and made a call to housekeeping. Less than 5 minutes later someone was there to deal with it. There were some issues with my deposit (I had only brought a debit card) and they were kind and understanding that I needed to get some cash from an ATM and waiting patiently (over 24 hours) for me to do so. The internet service was a bit spotty and would not work on my hotmail account but I had not problem walking over to the mall and using their free (yes free) mall wide wireless service. Just sat in Starbucks or outside Gloria Jeans to do what I needed to do. The breakfast buffet (with room) was complete and the staff made me any manner of ommelette or fresh juice concotion I asked for. The hotel was hosting some tabloid magazine in their ballroom for an awards complete with hi-so and entertainment types, cameras, t.v. coverage, etc. I would have expected to be kept away and made to use an alternate route to the mall.. but alas, was not. The staff actually noticed I did not \"belong\" to this even and helped me make my way thorugh to the mall and back. Bravo. One thing.. the Concierge was nice, warm, and attentive (and cute) but he didn't know much about Manila. They had not map of the transportation system or a city map. When asked about an event (basketball) he asked the other workers who \"thought\" it was happening. They should be more informed about basics like city transportation.", "title": "REally a good experience....service was notable!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Smile0507", "date": "April 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4829862}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "OK with great potential", "text": "The hotel is in a great location adjacent to a mall.

If you're just looking for a nice, clean, and a good location hotel, then you'll be happy with the Crowne Plaza Manila. However, if you're looking for a nice hotel with great service, then you may be disappointed with this hotel. It's not that they provide bad service, it's just that there is still room for improvement, especially if they want to compete with the Shangrilas, the Mandarin, or the Peninsula.
