I loved the whole atmosphere with the hotel, so chic, so trendy. I also read about the rooms being small and I will disagree again, not at all small. I got the standard room with two double beds and there was plenty of space. Who cares that there is no drawers, who really unpacks their stuff while on vacay. If things like that bother you, then I can see why this hotel is not to your liking. I didn't get a chance to eat at Asia de Cuba but I have eaten at the Miami location and it is excellent food! Location wise, this is the best place to be, so close to so many diff places and all within walking distance. Westfield Mall is a huge mall about 5 blocks away.
