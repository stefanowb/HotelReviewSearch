The villa is extraordinarily gorgeous with perfect decorative details, rendering each space and room distinct. Most beautiful is the restaurant, not only the space, paintings, layout and furnishing itself, but the creative and simply fantastic menu. Marie Helene and Patrick are perfect hosts and so helpful with navigating the neighborhood, city and trips outside of Beirut. Patrick is a wonderful chef, producing delicious, organic and creative dishes and Marie Helene is an insightful and brilliant resource for all that is Beirut, culture, and going out.
