Located next door to the JW Marriott, the Courtyard Hangzhou offers great value, a modern hotel, and an alternative to the more expensive J.W. Marriott next door. The service is excellent. Concierge is very helpful. Staff English skills are very good. The breakfast buffet cost is 147 RMB (Cafe MoMo), a good value considering the expansive nature of the offerings. Eggs made to order. Lots of fruit, breads, pastries, asian food section, cereals, cheeses, etc. The Concierge lounge is nice. Breakfast is not served in the lounge, but if you have lounge access one can enjoy the breakfast buffet downstairs for free. The buffet breakfast at Cafe MoMo is better than a Concierge lounge breakfast ever was. West Lake is not too far away. About $2 in a taxi there, or a twenty minute walk or so. If you have a high floor room you might be able to see West Lake from your hotel room. A high fashion shopping area is one block from the hotel, Hangzhou Tower. There is a lot to see and do in near the hotel. It is a nice, vibrant, central location. I wish all Courtyard hotels were this nice.

Their housekeeping staff also did not know how to close it and had to call a staff from Engineering to \"fix\" it.
