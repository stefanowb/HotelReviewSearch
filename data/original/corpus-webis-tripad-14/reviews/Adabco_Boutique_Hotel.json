It was calm, clean, pleasant and very comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful, giving advice about transport, parking, local restaurants and trips to the Barossa. Staff at the desk described it as the maiden aunt end of the CBD which was a reference to the quietness of the area and the ease of parking at the front of the hotel, despite being in a main street. There is no off-street parking which I thought would be a problem but I was able to park in front of the hotel every night and it was perfectly safe. The breakfast which was included in the tariff was ordinary - 3 cereals, tinned fruit, 3 different breads, spreads, tea, coffee and fruit juice - but I normally have coffee and toast so there was no problem. There is a kitchen on each of the 3 floors so it is possible to cook your own meals if you want a full breakfast or to eat in at night. I would defintely stay here again.

It is very centrally located so we could walk to anywhere within the four terraces very easily, and it's also an easy walk to the zoo to see the pandas. I loved that it had a guest kitchen, as after all those wine tours during the day (with big lunches) we didn't always want a full dinner out every evening, so it was nice to be able to make some cheese on toast or kangaroo sausages/emu burgers some nights, but without having to book a more expensive hotel with private kitchen that wasn't needed every night. The breakfast was great - even though it was continental, I was pleased that they had 3 choices of bread for toast and two types of cereal (including a very delicious muesli) with fruit. There is a computer that you can use to check your email/Facebook etc, and I never had to wait for more than about 10 minutes to use it, so that was also appreciated.
