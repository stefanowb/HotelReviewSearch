The hotel had some rough around the edges qualities that didn't really detract from my stay but make me hesitant to recommend the hotel. The room itself was very comfortable and clean. The price was not too exorbitant. Our room rate included breakfast which was an above average hotel breakfast buffet. We traveled for tourism and found the hotel well located. We walked to a few different restaurants in the area and it was also convenient to the Nanjing metro which made seeing the city a breeze. Unfortunately, the hotel had a few less than positive aspects. One night we headed to the 78th floor bar but it was overwhelmed with cigar smoke. No problem, there is another bar area on the 45th floor. It was amateur hour down there. We ordered two drinks, a manhattan and a mai tai. These drinks are not rocket science but it took two bartenders, the print out of the recipe, and my wife speaking some Chinese to get the mai tai right. If the staff can't be trained to make simple cocktails they shouldn't be on the menu at more than $10US per drink. Lastly, if I stay at the Intercontinental it's not because I am trying to save money but the prices to use the internet were just laughable. $10US for a half an hour and aprox $30US for 2hrs of service. Looking on the bright side, I guess it was nice to check email for a weekend. If I have occasion to head back to Nanjing, I think I'll try the Westin.", "title": "Bland Luxury", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "badwaiter", "date": "November 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120524027}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is situated in the center of Nanjing.
