When I left the hotel I had accidently left my Face wash & body wash, both branded items. I called back to ask if they found it in the room. Wathsala promised to call me back, but never did, I called them back, then she said she was too busy to call. The answer I got was, that it wasn't found, which I thought was strange as any hotel in Sri Lanka holds items they find in guests rooms for at least 2 weeks before they throw it away. It's just not possible that they could not have found what I left behind in the room. All in all, It's a beautiful hotel. I would say one of the best down south. Location is perfect with the most wonderful settings & rooms, but the staff are not too friendly towards Sri Lankans & I think they find it hard to be nice & helpful to Sri Lankans & I'm sure they make an extra effort to be nice to the foreign guests.
