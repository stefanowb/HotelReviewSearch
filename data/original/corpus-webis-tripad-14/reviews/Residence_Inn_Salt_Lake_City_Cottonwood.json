We decided to stay at the Residence Inn Marriott Cottonwood because of it's location to the ski resorts, Snowbird, Alta and Solitude. We decided not to rent a car because the hotel offered shuttle service. We had to find our own transportation from the airport to the hotel. We called the hotel prior to our visit and they told us about City Express. They were very accomodating and on time about picking us up. We arrived around 10:30 pm on Sunday from a 12 hour day of flying. Upon arrival the desk clerk was very helpful and courteous. She saw that we had nine pieces of luggage (including ski and boot bags) and had the bellman bring them up to our room for us immediately. Through our whole 4 day stay, we got exceptional quick service. Whenever we needed a ride to the parking lot to pick up the UTA bus to the resorts, it was done immediately. When we needed transportation back from a long day skiing, all we had to do was call and they picked us up immediately after the UTA bus dropped us off.", "title": "Great Value and Great Location for Cottonwood Canyon Ski Resorts", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "CathyMPennsylvania", "date": "February 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 6808986, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness and affordability", "disliked": "\u2014 Breakfast sausage"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "3 story Hotel with 1st and second floors subject to noise so ask for top floor room!!!!!!
