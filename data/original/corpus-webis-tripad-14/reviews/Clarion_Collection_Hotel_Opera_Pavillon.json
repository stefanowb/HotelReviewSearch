It is a great small hotel, with accomodating staff who speak English quite well. They gave us directions, called for a taxi and catered to our needs. The Breakfast bar in the morning had fresh fruit, croissants, rolls, meats, cheeses, juice and coffee, plus cereal, yogurt and much more. My teenage daughter and I shared a double bed and had plenty of space. There was an adequate closet, terry robes and slippers, chair and a desk, mini refridge, plus tv which we never turned on once. We could walk to Galeries Lafayette and Printemps and there was a bakery and mini grocery store around the corner.

We did not have breakfast at the hotel but we discovered a GREAT restaurant Wepler one block away. Location wise Montmarte is wallking distance, so is a metro station, we didn't have any trouble getting where we wanted to go. The receptionist was helpful and kind.
