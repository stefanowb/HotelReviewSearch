I don't want to hear my neighbor cough, talk on his cell phone, have sex, or hear what TV show he's listening too. This is what we had here. The \"sharing\" door between rooms (in case we wanted two joined room doors) gave no buffer at all, the walls seemed fine, but we heard all sorts of noise like the occupants where hanging at their shared door and the TV was right next to the door, etc. Beds were comfortable. Room was clean. Check in was fast. Desk staff were pleasant. However, I would not stay here again, just because of the noise. I marked down sleep quality only because the neighbor listened to TV until 2 am and up at 5 am, so then we were woken too.", "title": "Neighbor Noise", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Bobkatevan", "date": "March 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 155447134}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I'm in long distance relationship with my boyfriend and we stay at this hotel whenever I visit to just get away so we get our privacy and aren't always surrounded by family and friends 24/7. One thing I absolutely love about this hotel is how roomy and spacious they are. I've been to quite a few hotels and I swear the newer they are, the smaller the rooms get. I don't feel like I'm in any tight space with a load of furniture everywhere. I've probably stayed here at this hotel about five times and the fives room I've been in have been consistently spacious. The only thing I find annoying is that the last time I stayed there (in November) I accidentally forgot to pack my iPad into my luggage and left it on the table in the room. We checked out and didn't realize it until a few hours later. I didn't receive any phone call or anything that I had left my iPad. They had my cell phone number. I honestly didn't appreciate the fact they couldn't call. I had to be the one too. What if I never called? would they have kept my iPad this whole entire time? Other than that, I've alway enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

Though when I went to ask for another night, the older woman at the desk asked me not to yell at the housekeeping maids through the window. At first I just thought she was letting everyone know, then she told me her maids said I was rude for yelling through the window and next time to open the door. I told her they probably had the wrong room because we had been gone all day. I let her know that we didn't receive any towels like I had asked and she continued to tell me that it was because we didn't open the door. I tried to explain one more time that it couldn't possibly have been us because we were not there. After all that, I was then charged twice for a roll away bed when it should have only been once. A second woman helped me out with that and was really polite and apologetic about it.
