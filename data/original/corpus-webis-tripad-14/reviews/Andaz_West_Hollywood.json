I would highly suggest that on your first day, you take the Hop on Hop off , double Decker bus (no Roof) for $25. One of the stops, is right in front of the hotel, and will take you to Rodeo Drive and other shopping areas and tourist attractions. For $35, the bus will take you to the Santa Monica pier, Brentwood, 3rd St. promenade (worth the trip). This way you will get a chance to see where places are located and your ticket is good for 24hrs. (Highly Suggest). We also did the \u201cHome of the Stars\u201dtour.
