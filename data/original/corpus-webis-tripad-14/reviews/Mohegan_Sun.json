After 3 hours no one had come and it was time for my group to meet for dinner. I decided to call again and after TEN minutes of trying to get through the person at the front desk apologized assured me someone would be up and I did NOT have to wait for them. I made sure the the do not disturb was NOT on and stored my items in my sister's safe in the next room. I came back from dinner around 11 and no one had been there. Needless to say I was not happy. I then decided to leave a note for the maid with my daily tip and still nothing. I basically gave up asking but to top it all off when we checked out the front desk could of cared less.
