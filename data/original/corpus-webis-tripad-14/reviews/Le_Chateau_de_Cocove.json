The last time we stayed there we had a very large room in the old part of the chateau - shabby chic at it's best. This time I wasn't sure what we would get as we paid a rate lower than we had 7 years previously....we were in a much smaller but delighthful room with upholstered walls and ceilings in a new wing. The bathroom could use better ventilation and more bleach and elbow grease, but I adore the Chateau de Cocove and there is NO better place to stay if you are crossing over by ferry or chunnel between countries. The food is great ....a perfect French meal and service, the wine if very hgh priced but if you save on your hotel by checking all the websites and booking smart (we only paid USD$55.00 for our room!) you don't mind that the meal costs so much more than the room!! We used to cross back and forth all the time and we never found a nicer place to stay!! The entire experience - if you have a meal there - is worth 5 stars. Perhaps 3.5 - 4 stars if you do not eat there - but that is why you stay at the Chateau de Cocove!", "title": "Alwys the the Chateau de cocove", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SadieDelaney", "date": "May 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 16007712, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great restaurant and great localtion to chunnel!", "disliked": "\u2014 Bathrooms could use some attention"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved the Chateau", "text": "Having read the recent reviews I was a bit concerned about our forthcoming stay.
