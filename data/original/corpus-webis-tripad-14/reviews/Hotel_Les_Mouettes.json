Just a small square window in the adjoining shower room which overlooked the pool. Thankfully it misted up as anyone could see in otherwise. The doors to the outside patio were \u00a0covered by a curtain. \u00a0 The inner doors had to be attached by a hook to the heavy black outer doors to enable you to lock the doors. \u00a0Once shut all natural light was blocked out and you were effectively entombed in your white \"cell\". Air con was freezing cold and did not adjust sufficiently. If off the room was muggy and hot and airless. One room key was used for the door and hotel gates if you got back late ... 10pm! \u00a0On enquiring if this meant the key also fitted everyone else's rooms the receptionist became extremely irritable and lectured us about their \"system\". \u00a0At least there was a safe in the room! If the doors were opened to let in the light then anyone walking past from the ground floor rooms, the pool area and the breakfast patio area could all look straight inside -so no privacy at all! No dining room at the hotel and it's a 30-45 min walk to the centre of town for the best restaurants unless you want a beach bar. \u00a0Good points are a nice pool area and good wifi and the room was clean \u00a0The hotel is situated on a main road right next door to a Total petrol station. The car park is a dent in your car waiting to happen as it is small, on a hill and difficult to manoeuvre. Also beware the nasty departing surprise of the city tax charge. In our case 7.20 euros for 3 nights at the insistence of the frosty receptionist. \u00a0On checking later our holiday rep said we should not have been charged for this! \u00a0We were very glad to leave this hotel.", "title": "The perfect combination of French and Italian hospitality.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "toni a", "date": "August 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 138929985}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The final long stay, 3 nights, of a 5 week trip to Italy islands and Corsica.

A garden room with a rear view. According to the picture that the hotel shows on the websites one thinks that is far away from the city, and that a garden room would be green with some flowers. They posted only one side. When we approached the hotel we could not believe that, first of all the hotel was directly next to a major GAS STATION which made us nervous and on a major street. Second, when they took us to our room after they opened the door it was a great disappointment. Basically the room was very,very small with a tiny terrace surrounded by a wall facing the major street. What a rip off!!. We had to leave immediately although we had already payed. We went 10min by car further down from their hotel and found a Fantastic hotel Dolce Vita, High End Best Western. Room were much spacious, modern, clean, very quite and with a fantastic view.
