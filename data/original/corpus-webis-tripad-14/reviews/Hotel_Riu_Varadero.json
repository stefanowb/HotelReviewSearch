Of course we had to push the two double beds together which was pretty funny. The Royal Restaraunt was very slow. We tried eating there a few times and the a la carte service took up to 45 minutes.

We were in block 22 and were very happy with it. It was close enough to the beach, but close also to the main pool, and the lobby and restaurants, perfect location for us. The room was spacious and very clean. The mini fridge was always stocked, we never ever had the water cut out, as some people experienced, and hot water all the time. The pressure in the shower is also excellent! Air conditioner worked very very well. Only tiny issue we had, was after day two or three, the winds were strong and our patio door, for some reason, would rattle. Pushing the coffee table against it helped some. So all in all, loed our room. Also, after the first day, my husband left the maid a little gift I had brought her.

Ohter thing is, there are not enough beach chairs for the amount of people. We walked by other hotels who had piles and piles of chairs. At Riu, every single chair was either in use, or had a towel/beach bag, to keep it reserved. SO I think they should invest in getting more chairs. I also think people should be more considerate.

I was in a horrific accident and had to spend time in a hospital after skydiving, we landed in trees. I realize it was a freak accident and that the Cuban people at the hospital did the best they could for me til I got home. The Riu and sunwing rep made several phone calls to the hospital and made promises that they would send a car to the hospital to pick me up and guess what, they phoned back and said catch a cab. I had a very bad broken arm and leg and several stitches, plus I was in shock. My husband had no shoes or shirt and we were out on a street trying to wave down a cab. Once we caught our 55 minute cab ride the Riu made my husband pack us up and move rooms. I was in a nightgown and could barely manage to move, we were flying out in 6 hours. Once I got home I spent a week in our hospital and 8 months off work. Sunwing nor Riu did anything really other than try to ignore me. The other tourists were horrified when they seen me get on the bus to the airport.There were 45 of us and everyone could not believe how I was treated. The Riu is deffinitely not a 5 star. As for management look for the little guy that looks like a bell boy, he is the manager and my husband watched in horror when he told the staff we had to move rooms. What a nightmare! If i could I would love to post pictures of the shape I was in.

The concept of a \"line\",\"waiting your turn\", or tipping the staff, or just having common courtesy for other people seemed to be a foreign concept to them and this we found frustrating. Everyone we talked to at the resort greatly shared this same feeling and most had had their own personal negative experiences - like the elderly couple who was pushed off the sidewalk due to a group of french travelers who refused to move over and share the sidewalk. Like seriously, who does that? News flash - the world doesn't revolve around you - wait your turn and be patient and have some manners! Someone had to say it.
