I have also been to a wedding here which was beautiful and the staff were very helpful and made it a lovely day. The restaurant has recently had a revamp and is now quite modern, which is all very nice but doesnt suit the old character of the hotel. If there is a large party of you they tend to give you a table smaller than you'll need and you end up banging elbows with ur neighbour, but if its just a few of you its very nice. We only live 15 miles away or so but we have been to stay here once for a weekend really just to use the leisure suite, it has a fantastic fully equipt gym, swimming pool (inside only) which has a jacuzzi corner, sun beds (at extra cost), sauna and steam room. We had fun, although its pretty pricey to stay there. You can use the facilities the all untill 8pm even on the day of checkout. The rooms are beautiful the bathroom we had was gorgeous, 2 sinks, power shower, AND bath. Dressing gowns in the rooms. We stayed on the top floor so had the odd shaped roof from the ceiling which was great but had to be careful after a few drinks not to bang our heads in some places! Room service is pretty snappy, there is a charge but you have a lot of choice. The bar area is laid back and there are some comfy sofas or chairs and tables. if you want to know anything else feel free to message me!", "title": "Use it regularly", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kayliesteve", "date": "June 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 16789350, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The facilities", "disliked": "\u2014 The new design of the restaurant"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We found a special offer on travelzoo which included 2 nights B&B in a deluxe room with unlimited golf.

Met with a cocktail as we checked in which was a lovely touch. Staff on Reception really friendly. Room was pleasant and we had a small patio area so were able to take advantage of the afternoon sun. Leisure area really nice, loved the fairy lights in the steam room. We were booked in on a DBB rate, so had dinner in The Brasserie. The DBB rate allows you a 3 course carvery or you can put the \u00a318 towards the 'normal' sit down menu - we received an email explaining all this along with a price list for both the food menu and the beauty treatment menu. Restaurant was very busy with a hen party going on, which sort of dampened our romantic meal for 2. The food was very good, with a good choice for all 3 courses, then coffee and mints to follow, excellent value. We were warned the wine was very expensive, but we had a lovely bottle of Shiraz for \u00a318. The only down side to the stay was the disturbed nights sleep. The bed was really comfortable, as were the pillows, but all through the night, the noise from the corridor was a real pain, it seemed as soon as I had got to sleep I was woken by noisy guests, talking loudly!!! walking past our room, this happened right up until 3am. Breakfast is only served till 10am, which I thought rather early for a Sunday, and it was very busy. I was disappointed in that there was very limited fresh fruit available, just a few very thin slices of melon, but apart from that it was pleasant enough. All in all a very pleasurable experience, and there was no noise the following evening, so I guess that means avoid a Saturday night!", "title": "Lovely weekend break", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "juliebabes33", "date": "April 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15060153, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 fairy lights in the steam room", "disliked": "\u2014 noisy guests!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "OK - So this is the first review of a UK hotel I've made - What a great location - so near to Norwich city centre, yet right in the country - What a beautiful setting - you can see why so many choose this as an ideal location for a wedding ceremony!", "title": "So near - yet so far!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PIJLondon", "date": "March 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14485558, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "What makes this hotel so good (a four star) is not only the beautiful building (18th century Elizabethan!) but the staff.
