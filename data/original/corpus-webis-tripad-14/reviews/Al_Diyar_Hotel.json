This hotel is about 5 km from the centre of Nizwa, and everything you'll want to see in Nizwa itself is in the centre of Nizwa. That said, I don't think there are any hotels much closer to the centre of town anyway. The hotel is on the main road (ask for an inward facing room). The staff are helpful, and the hotel restaurant is pretty fair doing the usual grilled meat with salad fare - Nizwa doesn't seem to have any particularly good restaurants (unless you count Bin Ateeq). There's also an excellent juice bar 2 doors from the hotel entrance. Rooms are OK - bland but functional. For tourists, a cab to/from town costs no more than 1 rial (I'm sure locals pay less, but I don't speak Arabic !). Getting a taxi from the hotel to anywhere sometimes means a 10 minute wait, but getting a taxi from the centre of town is always easy. There's a pool (functional but nothing special) as well if you need a dip after the sightseeing", "title": "Reasonable, if nothing special", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "pmbma", "date": "April 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 27687452}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Overall - friendly staff, functional hotel (and probably closest to where you want to be), but nothing particularly memorable.", "title": "Good option for a comfortable night in Nizwa", "user": "Bunge13", "date": "January 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23210937, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Large clean comfortable rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 Internet access not always available"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here for just one night.
