The Riad has a fairly 'shabby-chic' feel but that's not the point - it is insane value for money. The guys who run the Riad are very friendly and you don't feel stressed at all as it's got more of a 'hostel' feel. We wanted to stay in a Riad with our two teenage girls and ideally wanted an apartment sized room so we could be self-contained. One night we had dinner around the corner in the amazingly beautiful Riad Kniza (yes, Brad Pitt and Will Smith hire it out when in Marrakech yadda, yadda) and overheard a very posh pair braying that their two young daughters were deposited in rooms on the opposite side of the Riad to them. Couldn't really see the funny side of that one. Therin lies the problem with most Marrakech Riads, they are not set up for family accomodation or co-joining rooms. That's where this place delivered in spades. The three bed accomodation is huge, with a spacious living area, surrounded by 3 bedrooms, a TV lounge and a day bed large enough for all four of us to doze/chat and read on. It's like a mini Riad within a Riad! OK the furniture is a bit shabby, the shower is basic, but it was quiet and I have never seen such an gargantuan lamp in my life hanging in the domed living area!", "title": "Charming Riad", "user": "Gina407", "date": "July 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 133664603}], "location": {"country": "Morocco", "region": "Marrakech-Tensift-El Haouz Region", "continent": "Africa", "city": "Marrakech"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 5, "very good": 8, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 22}, "aka": "Dar El Assafir Hotel Marrakech", "slim_ranking": 0.498896247241}
