We stayed in room 10 -the Bullfighters Room, with a narrow balcony overlooking the square. The room where those famous bullfighters stood to receive the accolades of the crowds below , where Napoleon once slept (well, the bed is suitably short), where Charlotte Rampling's bare bottom graced the furniture when she posed nude for Helmut Newton and where Picasso took his bath -yep, he must have been splashed by the gushy taps too! Antique furnishings, placed with care by an artistic eye. Bathroom old fashioned but fine and spacious. Yummy breakfasts on the terrace and a manageress who is engagingly friendly, helpful and knowledgeable are strong plus points. I can understand, having read other reviews, that this is not the type of hotel everyone will enjoy. Some complain the prices are too high for grandeur so faded. Be warned, if you want mod cons and perfect maintenance, go stay elsewhere, with smart modern, although probably uniform, bathrooms and bedrooms filled with flat screen tvs and wireless internet. At these prices, yes you can surely get that elsewhere. But for me, and many others like me, the Nord Pinus is heavenly, even without those things. Like living and breathing a funky, glamourous history lesson, I adored staying there. Every nook is furnished with eclectic objects and historic fittings, but the hotel does not have a manufactured \"retro\" ambience. It is not some kit interior or exterior faked up in decorator \" shabby chic\". This is the real deal - a piece of the town's history -with a bohemian charm and glamour that has formed over time and still remains. Now, if you think all that sounds a bit romantic and fanciful, ask yourself, next time you are sitting and a bland, boring hotel room, wouldn't an atmosphere of romance and fancy be so much better? -you are on holiday after all! Undeniably parts are a bit careworn and crumbly, but not to a degree that I found it a detraction at all. I tend to stay in deluxe hotels, so my standards are high and I would rather stay here in Arles than any other hotel in the area. Sitting on the terrace with a glass of champagne in the evening sun is simply such great fun! It is the coolest spot in town for people watching as folk pass through the square or settle into the restaurants. After dinner (the hotel does not have a restaurant, but there are plenty right on the doorstep) you can retreat into the bar where the Peter Beard wildlife photos are truly moving. Yes, it is expensive, so if you feel that the quirks of old buildings need to be ironed out smoothly for you to feel comfortable paying 300euros a night, don't take the chance - stay elsewhere. But if you want to soak up the unique atmosphere of a grand old legend of Arles, do give it a try.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "madamefifi99", "date": "March 13, 2010", "id": 58473850}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The rooms are pricey at the Grand Hotel Nord Pinus, but the ambiance and charm are worth it.
