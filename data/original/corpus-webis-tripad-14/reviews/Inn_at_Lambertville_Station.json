The hotel is in deperate need of an overhaul..the heat/cool system does not work properly. When we opened the window it fell out of its track and hung, suspended, in the frame. The towel hook fell off the wall after putting a hand towel on it. All the nap on the carpet is gone. We found a pretzel on the floor near the dresser...obviously the carpet had not been vacuumed. Stains and splash marks adorn the walls. The saving grace - the bed is very very comfortable and the morning coffee service, delivered to the room at no cost, is delightful. Stay here if you care to but don't remove your shoes!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Criticaltraveller", "date": "November 23, 2005", "id": 4140568}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "Nice peaceful place to stay (I stayed with my husband and daughter for about 10 days). The cleaning ladies were great for a chat and really kind to my daughter. However, the rooms could have been cleaned more attentively (but they gave us more than enough towels which I appreciated). The aircon is noisy and the screens need replacing. Like other reviewers I liked the continental breakfast delivered at whatever time you want (included in the price). Staff took phone messages EXTREMELY efficiently. Location wonderful on the river for walks. All in all I was glad to walk in to this hotel at the end of each day. Would definitely stay here again, because althought it isn't old, the hotel has a certain charm and a bit of character.

The place lacked personality and I had no choice but to go to my room and spend my time there. I found the staff to be pleasant but nothing outstanding. The positoning of the inn building allows for very awkward views of the river. I would have rathered dtayed at a charming Bed and breakfast or boutique hotel.

It's an intimate, romantic place, and whenever I'm there I feel I've taken a trip back in time. The lobby is more like a sitting room with a fireplace, overstuffed couches and chairs, and an honor bar. The dark woods and deep colors are offset by the raised ceilings and views of the river from every room.

I usually stay here in the winter months, so coming in from the cold to the warmth of the lobby is a great pleasure. From the moment you walk in the lobby you feel the homeyness. The fireplace is usually roaring with some seating to enjoy it. There are newspapers laid out on the table and an honor bar. The rooms are nicely kept. The double rooms are larger than the king rooms. They are filled with antique reproductions and each room is named for a country or city that the furnishings represent. A nice touch is the continental breakfast offered and sent to your room upon desired time. The last time I stayed there they had a nice array of bathroom amenities. They must still do. Now with some experience staying at this place I do ask the staff upon reserving if there will be any kind of function (wedding, company meetings) going on that specifice time. If there is I caution you. The hotel gets rather loud. If you like this then make those reservations. I stayed here through one wedding (held in there reception hall and one of the guests staying in the room next door extended the party to the wee hours. Need I say we did not sleep well and the staff coundn't contain them. A small consolation is that when I write the hotel about our misfortune they awarding us with a $75 voucher on our next stay. We also encountered a car dealership bash, but that was kind of fun. And that ended early. Anyway the hotel does try to make everyone happy and I do commend them. The surrounding areas of antiquish and retro lamberville is great as well as New Hope. New Hope has seen better days, but it's still a nice visit. Take the 20 min. drive to peddlers village, nice shops too. All in all The Inn is really a nice place to stay.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "needtotravel", "date": "May 6, 2004", "id": 1878777}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pleasant Getaway", "text": "Inn at Lambertville Station is nice older hotel w/good size rms, furnished w/antiques & repros, overlooking Delaware River.
