We stayed one night at the new \"ocean view studios\" section of the Sunset Motel in Bandon, Oregon. We loved it! The room was very clean, not fancy and it had a nice fireplace. The room was on the second floor and far enough from the beach front to not be bothered by the surf's loud noise but close enough to enjoy the view of the beach. The sunset from our studio room was awesome. We stayed June 16, 2004, their off-season, and the rate was $125.00 a night. The spectacular view was worth every penny we spent. We would definitely stay there again. As far as the older rooms, they were not impressive to me as we walked by heading to the beach. But they are probably 40 years old too.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 10, 2004", "id": 2288436}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Storm watching", "text": "For more then 10 years I've visited the Sunset.

It's not a five star hotel by any means, but still rates an excellent from us because of the spectacualr view, good-sized room with balcony, fireplace, table, kitchenette with dishes and pots, acceptable price in high season (about $160/night including tax) and very pleasant front desk staff. We were only there one night, but with the kitchenette, it would be great for 3-4 days. We had two queens, but I think the king rooms have a sofa too. Evening provided a stunning sunset and our lucky timing provided a morning with one of the lowest tides of the month, revealing a close-up look at thousands of starfish and anemones at the base of the basalt rocks. We had a very good dinner at the cozy and nicely-decorated High Dock in Bandon.

We stayed in room 204 in the older-economy wing of the motel. The room was quite small, and the fixtures were old, but we were plenty comfortable. Although the economy rooms aren't considered \"oceanview,\" we could actually see a bit of the beach out of our window. There was also a viewing deck outside. To get to the beach all we had to do was walk across the street and down some stairs. As the name claims, we did view a beautiful sunset from the beach. For dinner we ate at Lord Bennett's right next door. It was expensive, but tasteful and convenient. We had to go into the downtown area for breakfast.
