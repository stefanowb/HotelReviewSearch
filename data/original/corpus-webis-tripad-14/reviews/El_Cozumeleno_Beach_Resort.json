The purpose of our trip was rest and relaxation, we weren't trying to accomplish to much in terms of site seeing, etc. since we also had our two young daughters with us. That being said we still had fun with the activities that the hotel offered. There were movie nights, dinner shows, and of course the pool and beach. The staff is courteous and friendly, I really appreciated their hard work. The food was pretty good, mostly, but there is a menu to order from if the buffet is not your thing. I liked the family feel of this resort, plenty of vacationing families. Our room was neat and clean as well as spacious. Housekeeping did a wonderful job at keeping our room up to par. My family enjoyed our stay, it is eye opening to see and appreciate another culture, hopefully we will visit Cozumel again in the near future.", "title": "Nice Hotel!!!!

We enjoyed the short trip to town and the airport. Our room was great. We were on the 5th floor which I had requested via email about two weeks before we arrived. We have no complaints about the service we received anywhere at the hotel. The front desk staff were friendly and easy to talk to. The bartenders and wait staff were excellent.

Called for help but since she didn't understand english she thought i said i needed a glass of water instead of there's water all over the floor. When someone finally showed up to the room they looked and turned around with out saying anything so we are sitting there waiting wondering if they are going to return. Finally he comes back with a bucket, mop and squege, took him 30 minutes to clean up and we missed our hotel meeting. The food wasn't all that great it was outside buffet and it made it for cold food. The drinks were the best bahama mama. The hotel was lovely other than the problems we had. Beautiful view with balcony. The water was clear other than the hotel beside us was full of sea weed, so we were lucky.

We stayed for 7 days and had a wonderful time. The hotel was beautiful, clean and very comfortable. The staff was friendly and extremely willing to be helpful in any way. I read complaints in earlier reviews about the food but we found it to be very good. I think some Americans go to foreign countries and expect American style food. I have traveled to China and to Mexico before - and I felt the food here was well prepared and there was an opportunity to sample many delicious local dishes. I especailly loved the fruits and fish! We ate at La Veranda, the formal restaurant, 3 times and enjoyed the experience and the food there very much. Cozumel was incredibly beautiful even though it was still recoving from Wilma. The snorkling in front of the hotel was extraordinary. It's fun to take some bread from the buffet and walk along the concrete pier to feed the fish. They come by the hundreds and put on quite a show! The shops in San Miguel are lots of fun and most of the shopkeepers are probably very honest but we did encounter one dishonest man. I was buying 6 bottles of vanilla (Mexican vanilla is wonderful) and the guy took it away and wrapped it up for me. When I got home I found they had replaced the bottles I'd picked out with dirty, opened bottles, only partially full. Yuk! Inspect everything you buy carefully. I felt really dumb. Another tip: Vanilla can be purchased at the airport gift shop for $3.95 (small bottles) and they are asking for $6.00 a bottle in many of the shops. We will return to El Cozumeleno as soon as we can.

The \"fancy\" restaurant tried really hard, but the food was nothing special. Half of our group was sick before we left. We have stayed at many all inclusives in Mexico and Jamaica and never had any stomach problems. I would be VERY careful what I eat and drink at this hotel.

They said Mexico was beautiful and they were absolutely right! Let's start with the hotel, we stood at an all inclusive, El Cozumeleno!! The hotel was incredible. The staff was awesome! They were very accommodating with every need we had which were few! We couldn't ask for more! The rooms were amazing. We had ocean view which looked out into the aquamarine waters. Food was always available so we never worried about being hungry. The indoor resteraunt which you have to make reservations for is well worth the reservation but make sure you do it! The food was great. The buffet outside offers a romantic/lovely ambience of oceanfront dining but the food was average. You can find enough to fill you up though. I had a bedside massage in my room by a highly skilled massage therapist that El Coz called in for me. It was reasonably priced. We did all sorts of things like parasailing, glass bottom boat, Xel-Ha, Tulum, horseback riding, and snorkeling which is something you have got to do! We went through Loma's travel svcs which I recommend going to the dive shop at El Coz as we found out the day we left that we could have gotten a better deal but oh well, EVERYTHING we did was well worth every peso we spent and then some! Overall, for anyone reading this all I can say is I couldn't hardly find a flaw in the hotel and it is well worth trying! I would not even attempt to stay at another resort. I would fear being disappointed as everything at this resort met and exceeded my expectation. They are so very clean I could have eaten off the floor! Tipping well helps as these guys work long hard hours with very little pay and they are so appreciative of even the small things we can offer! I went with my husband and another couple and the resort was great for us. There were many families with children of all ages and everyone was enjoying themselves. On our next trip we plan to take our children along. This resort caters to children, couples and anyone wanting a relaxing getaway! There is so much offered for activities that one could not stay two weeks and get everything done! We have never really traveled this far from home but I will say that the beauty of Cozumel blew our minds as well as El Cozumeleno and it's staff. We will visit Cozumel as often as possible hopefully once a year or so! It was a vacation I will never forget for the rest of my life! Thank you to everyone in Cozumel who made our trip so special! You guys are the best! Good luck and best wishes! We will see you guys again soon! A few tips for saving yourself trouble, bring plenty of small change for tipping or buying things in town. It may be hard to get change. They really prefer U.S. dollars even over their own Mexican money. Don't take the first price they say when buying stuff because they will always say a higher price and then barter down. Take planty of film and even some underwater camera's. These things are really expensive if you wait to but them there. We went at the end of April and the weather was perfect, not too hot but not cold or breezy whatsoever! All I can say is that I was very skeptical and read every review on Trip Advisor out there but once I got there I could not understand what some of these people were saying. I think these guys wanted the Hilton's or something. If you want a clean hotel with plenty to do and a staff that is out for your best interest try the El Cozumeleno!
