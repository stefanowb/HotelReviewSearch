We had the Govenor's Suite which was a large sitting room and bedoom. The Inn just opened recently and the furnishings are wonderful. A large king bed, lots of pillows and two comforter made for an easy night's sleep. The sitting area had room for us to have friends back to our suite after dinner. Overall it's a really nice get away spot.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "lbillies", "date": "February 19, 2007", "id": 6814401}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Saint Peters"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 4, "very good": 2, "terrible": 11, "excellent": 17}, "aka": "Inn At St. Peter`s Village Hotel", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
