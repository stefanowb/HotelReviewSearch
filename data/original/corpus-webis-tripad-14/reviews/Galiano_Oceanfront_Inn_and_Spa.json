For $299 a night we enjoyed a huge king size bed, soaker bath tub, an amazing view of the ocean and passing BC Ferries, and a gourmet breakfast. Breakfast wasn't served until 9 a.m., but no problem, because we received a basket of muffins, scones and jams at our door at 7:30 a.m., plus there was a coffee maker, coffee and tea in the room. The mini bar was fully stocked and we enjoyed the hot tub. Although the restaurant (Altrevida) was closed for a private function, an employee let us borrow his car to go out to dinner, since we came to the inn by private boat. We had an enjoyable time but agreed $299 was slightly overpriced for the amenities.
