Despite the brochures and the web photos, this tiny hotel with tiny hotel rooms has paper thin walls (NOT sound proof-as was claimed-we could hear conversations from the lobby from the second floor!), filthy (rooms were not cleaned when we checked in, despite checking in after the check in time, the single chair in our room clearly falling apart, wallpaper peeling, mismatched, patched, windows filthy, carpets terribly stained), and was terribly served (elevators out of service for most of our stay, and despite many prejudices about Paris and the French, Parisians can be quite charming and friendly-with the exception of the hotel staff of the Unic Renoir, for some reason). And by the way-the parking which the hotel claims it has? It lost the contract with a neighboring garage last year-you'lle have to go to a city garage-quite a hike if you have baggage and children. I have been a visitor to Paris for 25 years and have enjoyed every single visit-but there are no conditions under which I would recommend this hotel. The staff and management ought to be ashamed.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 26, 2004", "id": 2601092}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "ok overall", "text": "after reading to older reviews after i had booked/paid i was apprensive. however i was pleasently impressed. staff-great and helpfill hotel renovations complete except 6th floor (not being used).

My room was clean, adequate and delightfully air-conditioned during a heat wave. I told them I had work to do, so they gave me an ultra- quiet room on back overlooking a courtyard.

This was part of a 5-week trip through Italy and France (Normandie and Paris) with a 5-day break to attend a conference in Britain. I rented two rooms at the Unic Hotel, one for us and another for our young adult children. They had problems two nights in a row with loud people in a nearby room. I can honestly say that one can just about make out the conversations of people in neighboring rooms when they were speaking in normal tones. The room has some soundproofing to windows, but it was useless on a Saturday night with loud drunken folks at a nearby creperie till beyond 1 a.m. The hotel is aware of the noise problems and it is posted on all floors to be quiet inside the rooms. At another time of year, when there are less tourists on the street and more locals, I imagine that noise would be less of a problem.", "title": "Beware of paper-thin walls", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JoanieCat", "date": "August 19, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3789002}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pleasantly surprised !", "text": "Very clean place, but very small rooms.
