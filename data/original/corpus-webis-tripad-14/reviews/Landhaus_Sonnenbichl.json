{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 16, "name": "Landhaus Sonnenbichl", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We were looking forward to staying at the Sonnenbichl for five nightd during our recent trip in Europe, and using Mittenwald as our base of operations for exploring southern Bavaria and the Tyrol. In the main, even though we saw little of the hotel as we were up early and returned late, we were quite pleased by our experience there. The owners speak little English, but are very friendly (indeed, the place seems to cater to a German clentele more than an international one, from what we could tell.) The rooms are ample in size, quite basic, but extremely clean and well-maintained. There is no air conditioning, but you can open the windows and the bracing mountain air provides plenty of exhilaration. The breakfast room is lovely, and we had a wonderful table by the window, overlooking Mittenwald, every morning. There is also a very nice outside deck where you can breakfast as well (but it rained nearly every morning we were there, so there were few takers for the deck, alas). The breakfast itself is a standard German adffair, with all the usual suspects-- boiled eggs, wonderful dark bread and rolls, various cheeses & cold cuts, a limited selection of fruit (I would have liked a toaster, too). So, all in all, I have no complaints about our stay. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way took place about a month before our arrival, when I asked if it might be possible to stay only four nights instead of five. The owner informed me that, if we did so, we would still need to pay 80% of the rate for the cancelled night-- this a MONTH before our arrival. That didn't seem too accomodating to me. But our stay at the Sonnenbichl was fine, and the price was reasonable. (I wish we had put aside more time to explore Mittenwald, though, as it seems a wonderful and charming town.)", "title": "Nice, Friendly Guest House in a Charming Town", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "revjeff", "date": "August 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 75650376}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had noticed the great setting of this hotel on a previous trip to Mittenwald and were not disappointed.
