However, if you were staying here while going to Disneyland Paris, it would be quite convenient, as Disneyland Paris is one or two stops from the RER and the RER station is right down the street from the hotel. Another bonus to this hotel was their excellent breakfast. If you were going to Disneyland and didn't want to spend a small fortune on eating there, you could have a very nice breakfast of fresh fruit, croissants, pain au chocolate, cereal, eggs, meat and cheese right at the Tulip Inn.
