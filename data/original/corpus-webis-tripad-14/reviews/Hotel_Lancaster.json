Standard of housekeeping was excellent and I found the staff to be extremely courteous and obliging, ( in fact they were fun) particularly the concierge desk which made reservations for us all over town with no problem and which offered their own helpful suggestions. The crowd at the hotel is nice - lots of brits and italians, unlike the louche group at the Plaza Athenee. This hotel has more of a Venetian look to it than other hotels similarly priced - the colors are faded and tasteful, not loud and bright, - and for the price gives excellent value for money. In fact the word 'gloomy' comes to mind in describing the bar area but 'tasteful gloomy' - lots of ochre, deep reds and mauve - very hip, with a nice outdoor bar. Breakfasts were copious and very tasty and the coffee was excellent thankfully - the restaurant here becomes the kitchen of famed chef Michel Troisgros at night and I regret not having taken more meals here.
