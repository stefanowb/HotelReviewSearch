Greeted warmly without pause and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Four rooms in a large home overlooking the Mississippi River. Lovingly restored and decorated in the period it was built. Private baths, excellent beds, your own TV/DVD and tons of classic movies, full breakfast, classy pool table downstairs. Get the room with the private porch. Jacuzzi room was booked but loved the porch even better. Easy to find, neighborhood is somewhat in transition but this gem stands out. Local cultural attractions and several good restaurants closed on Sundays and Mondays. Gracious hosts. Would definitely book here again. Not listed on most travel websites so the phone number seems hard to find.", "title": "Authentic B&B in the Quad Cities", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Laurie50", "date": "October 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3988335}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Davenport"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 3, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 14}, "aka": "Beiderbecke b&b", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333}
