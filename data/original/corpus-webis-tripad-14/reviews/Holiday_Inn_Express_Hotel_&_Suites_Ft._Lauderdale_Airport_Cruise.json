This was far beyond my expectations. Nice location close to I-95 and FLL, and at a very short driving distance from Las Olas Blvd. and Fort Lauderdale beaches. The staff at the front desk was very nice, especially Daneila, a young woman from Costa Rica. I was received with a small present for being a member of IHG rewards program. This will be my first choice for any future visit to the FLL area, and I hope sweet Daneila is there when I check in again.", "title": "Simply awesome", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "golflover26", "date": "September 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176241006}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel looks in excellent condition.

When we got there, the lobby was cool and the front desk was very nice. We checked in within minutes. However, my first room, 513, had a broken AC. The temperature was set to 73 and it was 83 degrees in the room. Hot air was coming out of the AC. I went to my parents' room, 515, and their thermostat was set to 73 and it was cold! So, I called the front desk and I was told someone would be up to take a look. After fidgeting with the thermometer and lowering it to 60 degrees, he told me to wait 1 hour! I walked over to the AC and hot air was still coming out. And, the temperature went up to 84 at this point! I refused to wait at 10PM to see if the room will cool down... and I called the front desk. They immediately switched me over to a different, cool room and it was great.

Small kitchenette with a micro, sink and small refrigerator, allows you to stock up a bit---at the Winn Dixie right across the street. Laundry on the floor was only a buck for washer or dryer, and the machines were good. The shuttle will pick you up or take you out to the airport whenever needed, and they also were available for side trips to our offices on the airport but not at the terminal.
