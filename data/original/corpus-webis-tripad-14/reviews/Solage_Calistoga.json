First time was a girls trip, this time with my husband. They have 3 pools, kids, adult and at the spa. Service at the adult pool was excellent, from being greeted, brought ice water and a carafe which the staff would stop by and poor refills of water from. The lunch options were good and they had nice strong drinks. The fish tacos were quite good. The room had a nice patio with comfortable furniture and a branch covered awning giving it a Eco friendly feeling. The patio overlooked a wooded area and was very peaceful. Great for reading a book, having a glass of wine and some cheese. The complimentary bottle of Cabernet wasn't bad. The inside of the room had a large flat screen t.v., 2 leather chairs and a table at the end of the bed. The bed was not very comfortable, it was too hard. There's also a desk and chair. On the other side of the wall that the bed is against, is the bathroom. There's a large tub, large stone floored shower but only a single sink in the bathroom. There's a separate commode room. There is also a minbar, coffee maker and at night during turn down service they bring mint leaf infused bottles of water. The restaurant was excellent for breakfast. One day I had the lemon ricotta pine nut pancakes with blueberry syrup and fresh blueberries. So good! The other morning I had the continental that included hose made granola that was atop of the yogurt. there was also fresh fruit and a muffin. The fruit had blueberries, raspberries, plums, nectarines and pineapple. Not the boring standard fruit that many resorts and hotels do. It also included juice and French pressed coffee or tea. For lunch we had The Lucky Pig which included sesame crepes, butter leaf lettuce to be used as wraps for the fall apart pork. Accompaniments included, spiced peanuts, jalape\u00f1os, noodle/cucumber slaw and a spicy sauce to top it off. Unusual and good but too much food for lunch. I would recommend having it for dinner in their lounge area. For dinner we started with the la plancha shrimp and the fried green tomatoes topped with shrimp and avocado. I had the Alaskan halibut which was perfectly cooked. The next night I had the truffle stuffing, stuffed chicken. At the spa I had a raspberry lemonade scrub and massage, which was nice and relaxing. After breakfast we would ride bikes around the property. Each room had two courtesy bikes to be used by the guests. Fun and added to the Eco friendly environment. When we were checking out, the bell men kindly placed bottled water in our vehicles. It's an upscale resort with all the amenities and services but manages to maintain an unpretentious laid back vibe.

The outdoor jacuzzi was very private and also out of eyesight of any neighbors. The bikes at each cottage was such in interesting touch! The staff is happy to have you use them either on the grounds or to take them off on your own adventure. Each room was very nicely appointed in a very contemporary, simple yet complete way. We were surprised at just how well they had used the space. Bathrooms were huge, indoor sauna. The staff was fabulous! All very kind and friendly. No request too huge and they were always willing to do whatever it took to satisfy the customer. My advice, make sure to stay at least 2 days so that you can really experience the relaxation intended. This is not an overnighter place.

Motel 6 does a better job than this place. No one seems to have a clue as to what they are doing. The management I think is more clueless than the line staff. The restaurant was horrible.

The rooms.....hmmmm where do you want me to begin....the concrete floors are freezing, the minimalistic decor is going to be dated in a year or so, the bathroom with no light privacy HUGE Issue...the patio that looks at everything in the resort and the poorly landscaped grounds....It looks like CAMP. My friends said it right when they said it reminded them of a Methodist retreat. Not to mention the event space that is right by all the rooms...Could you imagine if they were having an event? The entire resort would hear everything. They have this big white barn thing and if there was an event in there unless you rented out the entire grounds......you would be miserable if you wanted to go there to relax....It is just a joke.
