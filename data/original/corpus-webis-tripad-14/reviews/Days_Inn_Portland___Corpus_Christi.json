The first room they gave us had this terrible odor (like a cat house), so we asked for another room and they were very accomodating. The room was clean and had a microwave and small fridge. The pool was also nice. Breakfast was a little skimpy, but that's ok with us because the price was right. We paid $80/night, whereas the Hampton Inn next door wanted $125/night. There aren't many hotel choices in Portland, but this is a good one.", "user": "tpitboy", "date": "July 31, 2006", "id": 5533202}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 1, "very good": 11, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 6}, "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "2 Story."}
