It was fairly clean, and seemed secure enough. But in reality it looked like a truck stop motel. It is right off an I-95 exit ramp in an industrial area of Stamford. There are little to no facilities in the hotel, the front desk staff seemed indifferent and spoke choppy English. The room was large enough, but bland and stunk of smoke( even though it was non-smoking). The bottom line here is that this hotel cost me almost 100 a night, and for the price what you get is a joke. This hotel should be no more then 60 a night. I know Fairfield county is expensive, but this hotel was just off the highway in a rather rundown area of town. They should not be overcharging like the rest of the area hotels. Overall this is a lousy value, even for a Super 8.", "title": "Way , Way overpriced.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "icem2829", "date": "May 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 5192847}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here in december 2005, it was ok.
