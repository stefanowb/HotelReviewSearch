It is a great hotel in one of the most stunning settings, the views were breathtaking. I cannot fault much about this hotel. The rooms and facilities were spotless and of great quality. The food was excellent (with a kids menu too). We found service in the restaurant good, not perfect, but when is it ever perfect? The staff were very friendly, in fact it felt quite a family atmosphere after a few days. The staff were also very helpful when we had a few problems.", "title": "Wonderful", "user": "sjwoolnough", "date": "August 26, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 76994016}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have no complaints but would warn anyone intending to stay there of 2 things:", "title": "Good, but not perfect", "user": "jolochka", "date": "August 24, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 76628910}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "1. There is little control over the air con (you can change it by + or - 3 degrees). On our first night we could not get the room cool enough and had to open the windows which led to a disturbed night from external noises. However once we mentioned this to reception they turned down the thermostat in our rooms and we were fine after that.
