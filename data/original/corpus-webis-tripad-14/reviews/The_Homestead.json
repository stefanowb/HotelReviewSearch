The food and service was first rate. I had a facial for the first time in my life and I can't believe what I've been missing. My two sons had a great time on their beautiful golf course. My husband and son went Clay Shooting and really enjoyed that. My granddaughters went horse back riding and loved it. The indoor pool fed by the warm springs was relaxing and comforting. The breakfeast buffet just can't be beat anywhere. Dinner in the Dining Room was spectacular. The 4th of July BBQ didn't dissapoint. The entertainment was good but the fireworks show was the best I've seen in a very long time. Truly a memorable weekend for all. One I will remember for many years to come.
