We had spent 3 days in Rome then 4 days in Florence, and took the train back in to Rome from Florence for our one final day in Rome before our return trip home. We then took the Leonardo Express train from Termini to the airport in the morning. The hotel is on the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, which has a metro station. It is not far from the Termini train station but we ended up taking the metro from the hotel to the Termini when we left because it is probably about a 6 or 7 block walk from the entrace to Termini, which is kind of a pain even with small rolling suitcases. The area surrounding Termini and the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele is a bit seedy. Next time I would just stay near a metro but would not try to be near Termini.", "title": "Fine for the budget traveler who needs to be near the train station.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "2009Traveler", "date": "June 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 31871649}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled solo", "text": "The hotel (which is really a bed and breakfast) is very difficult to find.
