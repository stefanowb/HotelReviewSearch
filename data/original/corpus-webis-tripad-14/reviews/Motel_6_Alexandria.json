The bed frame did not fit the mattress and metal bars stuck out 6 inches into the walking space. Staff was nice and friendly. Our problem was the next door neighbor. We arrived to an almost empty Motel 6, and were put next to an occupied room. That fella had to be running some operation out of his room, shady dealing. He would sit outside his door on his cellphone for long periods, that night he left every hour or so, slamming his truck doors just outside our room. Then when he returned there was a steady stream of the sound of high heals coming and going from the room. This was from 10 pm till 4 when we collasped from exhaustion finally. Cancelled sightseeing the next day we felt like crap. Also the back parking lot was a hangout for teenagers after dark. I felt very unsafe.
