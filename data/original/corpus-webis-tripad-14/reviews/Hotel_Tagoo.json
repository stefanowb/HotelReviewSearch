Her husband Yanni is your personal chauffeur to and from your port of entry, and can also be found dancing up a traditional Greek storm poolside with Anna. Speaking of the pool, it is the hub of this great hotel, Jimmy the bartender runs a smooth ship, with just the right blend of music, and drinks to keep you happy all day long, and he sets just the right atmosphere to relax in after a long day of touristing through the narrow streets of Myconos. This was our first stop before heading on to Santorini to get married, and we both agreed, that had we known how truly great Tagoo was, we would have planned to have been married here instead, without hesitation. 6 of us stayed and played at Tagoo, and we still talk about what a magical place Anna has created, and how sad we were to leave. We will be back to Myconos in the future, and we wouldn't dream of staying ANYWHERE but Hotel Tagoo. Thanks to you Anna and your wonderful staff for all you did to start our month in Greece, and our married life so perfectly.", "title": "Hotel Tagoo is a great reason to go back to Mykonos", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "ScubaJocK", "date": "July 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8036158, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Hotel staff were friendly, helpful, and added to the wonderful experience of our Greek Island visit.", "disliked": "\u2014 Only a couple of parking spaces at the hotel, but, staff gave us access to an area we could park just a minute's walk away."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Cheers", "title": "A truly wonderful small hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "RichardSCalgary", "date": "June 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8029578, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location and setting", "disliked": "\u2014 uphill walk from town"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Dave & Janelle", "title": "Our Favourite in all of Greece", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Smartcar", "date": "June 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8023954, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great location!", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}], "location": {"country": "Greece", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 19, "very good": 58, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 814}, "aka": "Tagoo Hotel Mykonos", "slim_ranking": 0.0232558139535, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Hotel Tagoo is a small family run complex of 20 rooms, of which some are standard or superior, with 2 single beds or double and queen size beds, some with common sea view terrace area, or private balconies, built on different level, in the cycladic architecture style.
