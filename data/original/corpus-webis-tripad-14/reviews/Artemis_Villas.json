The day we arrived, we were greeted with such hospitality. Anything we needed, the staff went beyond our expectations. We stayed in he honeymoon suite. Amazing views from our balcony. The special touches were having breakfast on our balcony, seeing the creation of sculpted towels displayed on our bed. Most of all, they let us use a room since we were departing late in the day, mad our last day hassle-free. Highly recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway. Not your Carriben type vacation but the views and sunsets are the best I've seen ever.

The rooms are impeccably cleaned every day, with a lot of attention to details. There are many lovely touches here, including the complimentary welcome drink and the complimentary evening snack at sunset. Stay here, I see no reason to stay anywhere else! Also, Imerovogli is by far the best town to stay in on Santorini. Fira and Oia are very busy and commercial.

The family run business is not your run of the mill hotel, it is much more than that. They have 10 rooms of which are located in a cliffside with the most fabulous view of the Caldera. Each room has its own balcony and magnificent view of the sunset in the evening. We were very fortunate to have room 113 which is located at the top, just underneath the swimming pool and sun bathing deck. The room is wonderfully decorated, with an amazing bed and furniture. Each morning we had breakfast brought up to our room by one of the 3 hard working staff (Eddie, Gazi & Julietta), they simply knocked the door to let us know that breakfast was on our balcony, we would open the door and sit on the balcony with the most amazing view of the caldera. We also had a jacuzzi on our balcony of which is optional. The owners Angela & Chris are simply lovely people and cannot do enough to make your stay as amazing as possible.
