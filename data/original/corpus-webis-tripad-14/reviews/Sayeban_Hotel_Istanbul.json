It's first asset is the location,. situated 10 minutes from all the main historic attractions (the Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia, the Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace and so many other places). The neighbourhood is typically popular and full of life, in the oldest part of the district (which for us was a plus, since we love popular atmospheres!). The decoration is simple but with great taste, bedroom was clean, comfortable and adequate, though we know there are even better rooms (so next time we'll choose them!).When the weather is nice, breakfast is served on the terrace overlooking the sea and the old neighbourhood, and consists of a varied buffet which includes some of the local food. The price/quality relation is thus great. If this did not suffice, the hotel's main asset is it's wonderful staff, which consists of young people in general, all included, but especially Fatih and Ali, who speak good English, and have truly made our stay unforgettable. They provide you with all necessary information of where to go, what to see, even where to have a nice meal, and always in the kindest and gentlest way. They were really excellent! The hotel can only improve with time, and apart from one or two details, it is a wonderful place, given all these features. It really contributed to making our stay truly unforgettable and also for the love we felt for Instanbul ont the day we left.A truly great place!", "title": "A most wonderful stay and a most wonderful staff!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "nando2", "date": "May 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129806606}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "It's a new hotel with a great location. The design is excellent - it's not a \"Resort\" type property, but the rates are reasonable. The rooms are not large, but seem large due to the good modern design. There is a good convienience store just across the street for bottled water with a large stock of fresh bread - great baguets. The hotel is family owned and operated - and the family cares about your experience - their service is great. The view from the 6th floor breakfast area is not to be missed. The breakfast is good with a nice variety - and attentive service. Internet service is strong - with antennas for each floor - you can pick from 1-6 for the strongest signal. The satellite TV service is good, but the 2 remote controls are a bit difficult to figure out. There are international channels, but most are Turkish. Good value for the stay.

Rooms are rather small, but have everything you might need, you can have a good night sleep (beds are very comfortable, and area is rather quiet during night) and breakfast is excellent.

And again, like in May, the staff, Ali, Fatih, Muhammad and the others were extremely kind and gentle, providing again for a second and very pleasant stay. We brought two new guests, acquaintances we had made during our second trip to Turkey, and they were also pleased with everyhting. There are bigger and smaller rooms, with different prices, but the quality/price relationship is really great. In the last day we had to leave earlier for the airport, and the staff went to extremes to provide a nice breakfast before we left, opening the buffet earlier than usual.
