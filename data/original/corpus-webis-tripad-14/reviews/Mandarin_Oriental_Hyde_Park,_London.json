We had four Knights-bridge rooms and we all had a great time. All of our rooms were on the 9th floor, and all of the rooms were different. We enjoyed our views, decor, and baths. All baths were large with seperate showers and tubs. The fabrics were beautiful and I loved the Irish linen sheets. The only complaint was that two of our rooms were on the buildings end and were much smaller and plainer than the other two, though they were all priced the same.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 10, 2005", "id": 3654738}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We were a friends and family group of 5 women, and 3 young little girls! 8 miami women off in London for the first time!
