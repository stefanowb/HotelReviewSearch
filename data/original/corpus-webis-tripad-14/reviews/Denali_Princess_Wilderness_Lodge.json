I had reserved a day trip for our family for the 11-12 hour round trip to Kantashna through reservedenali.com. The itinerary they emailed me stated we needed to meet at Denali Main Lodge entrance at 7:00 am. We were there by 7:00 am along with a multitude of other Princess Lodge guests awaiting their buses to take them on this excursion or others that were occurring that day. We were unsure of which bus to take so we approach a princess travel assistant named Steve Fisher. He was so flippant with me when I asked him a question about the buses. He specifically asked me if I had some sort of document princess prints out for their guests to aid in their travel itinerary. He specifically used the term \"it's your lifeline\" and when I did not have this document he promptly turned around and left me standing there in pure disbelief. I still cannot believe that a person that is hired to aid in customer service handled this situation so poorly. Yes, I did not have the \"lifeline\" I needed but he could have taken a couple of moments to help me out - I was after all a guest within the princess lodge and maybe a potential future cruise line customer.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jackirmic", "date": "July 7, 2012", "id": 133680536}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Compared to all the other Princess Lodges (Kenai, McKinley and Fairbanks) this is by far the biggest complex with many individual accommodation blocks on site.

There are also numerous gift shops, cafes etc across the road which cater for the tourist trade quite well. One thing that did annoy us was the noisy adjoining room's shower and toilet.

We are in the middle of our Princess land tour. Got in from the Princess Mt. McKinely lodge after a painfully slow 2 1/2 hour bus ride. Rooms, however, were ready and we were able to get our room overlooking the mountains in Block 10 on the second floor. The lodge is newer than the McKinely one and really beautiful. The room had all the amenities, although it did resemble a Motel 6 in the lower 48. Since we got a good price on the cruise and landtour, the lodge is a good value. Food is expensive and not included. Worst however is the poor organization of the land tour operation. We had a free afternoon yesterday--Princess wanted you to book overprices land excursions. In order not to take business away, Princess does not provide any information about Denali National Park. There is a free shuttle bus service to the park entrance. From there you can hike, take tours, go to 2 information centers with free films and of course the free dog show. The following morning we had to get up at 6 for a boring 4 hour park historic tour: saw nothing but rain. Were done at 10. Rooms, however, have to be vacated at 11. Our train is not till 4pm. We are sitting in the lobby for 6 hours doing nothing. Each day is poorly organized. A big problem is the luggage: it has to be out way before you are doing anything. This trip is great for older travelers or people who have difficulty walking and/or carrying their own luggage. That said: you could never see that part of Alaska for the less money.

After an enjoyable train ride from Whittier, we arrived at our room in the early evening, although it was hard to tell with 20 hours of sunlight. The grounds of the lodge are very compact with all buildings within a short walk; however, there is also a shuttle that circles the complex. The main lodge is very impressive, as are the log buildings and grounds, and has many design elements of those in the National Parks. On a river with views of the mountains, the site is ideal for a short stay. The room, although clean, would be the equivalent of a motel in the two-star range with rustic furnishings and inexpensive fixtures. We attended a dinner performance of Music of Denali with the six performers also functioning as waiters. The boarding house setting included salad, biscuits, fish, ribs, potatoes, vegetables, drink and cobbler, which was quite filling but had a bland taste. The actors/singers were excellent and the plot revealed the details of the first party to climb Mt. McKinley. The quality of the songs, like most productions, contained both winners and at least one turkey. The Natural History Tour was included and consisted of busing 17 miles into Denali Park with stops for a film, a ranger presentation at a cabin and an Indian talk, which blended the past and present. Of course, the animals that were sighted highlighted the excursion. Be prepared for an assault by mosquitoes. For breakfast, we had pastries/cereal at the main lodge and for lunch, a well-made pizza at a restaurant next to the lodge. Across the street is a strip of businesses including restaurants.
