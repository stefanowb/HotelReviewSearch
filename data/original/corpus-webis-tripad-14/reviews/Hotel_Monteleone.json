She answered all our questions, offered helpful hints and advise and all with a delightful sense of humor. If you are looking for a hotel where you truly feel pampered and special - look no further, the Hotel Monteleone is all that and more. It's location is close to everything. We walked to the aquarium, River Walk shops, the French Market and many of the sights of the French Quarter. You are so close to everything. It was also easy to catch a streetcar to the Garden District (thanks for the help, Miss Eva). The only challenge I feel this hotel has is that the rooftop pool (spectacular) is quite small compared to the number of guests the hotel welcomes.
