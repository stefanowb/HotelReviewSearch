The rooms are very basic, almost verging on youth hostel standard but are 5* prices but walking onto the beach within 5 seconds of leaving your room is what you are paying for. We saw the dolphins up close but if you are after that kind of experience I would recommend going to the USA Everglades/ The keys, where you can swim with them. We had beautiful sunsets and a great time enjoying the little boats where you lie on your belly and look through the glass bottom at the stingray's and sea snakes below you.....no sharks \"!!!!!!!.

We paid $195 per night for a flea pit with dirty fraying carpets and a filthy room. We should have known there was trouble ahead when a large notice in the office proclaimed that people vacating the resort early would not receive a refund under any circumstances! The only positive thing about the stay was the opportunity to observe the dolphins and the resort seems to exploit this as much as they can. As with previous reviews the Bough Shed restaurant was a disgrace serving overpriced rubbish. It took 15 minutes to remove our dirty plates even though there were only 4 couples in the restaurant. If you want to see the dolphins then my advice is to buy a $6 day ticket and stay in the much friendler town of Denham.", "title": "Over priced dump", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "MemberOxford", "date": "January 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6640501, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed at the Dolphin resort for 3 nights in mid December 2006.", "title": "Nice Beach but ...", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "misemark", "date": "January 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6574166, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 proximity to sea", "disliked": "\u2014 The resorts restaurant and early closing during off-peak of small shop"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006", "text": "The accomodation is of a reasonable standard and there are lots of super views of the sea.

There is spread out accomodation but the best places are the ones on the beachfront, a little more money, but worth it. You'll wake up in the morning, and if lucky like us, the first thing you'll see is a dolphin swimming past. Basic yes, but a fantasic location. Very frienly and helpful staff.
