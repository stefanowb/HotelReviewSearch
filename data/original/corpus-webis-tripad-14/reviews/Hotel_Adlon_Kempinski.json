Our room did not have a great view but it was quiet and met our needs. The Concierge made my stay perfect. The help and guidance I got each day helped me plan the perfect stay for me and the weather. The food here is very expensive. Breakfast is $30 a person-not unreasonable for this kind of hotel. However, we had a hamburger and club sandwich in the lobby area and it was $$$$.. The location is right near the Brandenburg Gate but that can be a plus and a negative as everything happens there. If you are walking, it is perfect but if you need a cab they can't always get near the hotel. However, I am not sure you could find better service than the service at this hotel.

The room was 'just' a hotel room, with slippers, bathrobes, and all the other things. Expensive mini bar, but no chocolates on the pillow at night.
