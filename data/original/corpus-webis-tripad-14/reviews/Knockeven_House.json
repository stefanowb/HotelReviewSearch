Her beautiful home in Cobh is just a few minutes from town and is absolutely lovely. It is clean, well-kept, nicely appointed and Pam is a fantastic cook. The en-suites are very large and personalized. Pam welcomed us into the formal living room upon our arrival and offered us tea, coffee, scones. She also took the time to find out what types of attractions we wanted to visit and offered suggestions for sight seeing and dinner.
