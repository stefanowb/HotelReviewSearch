Rooms are standard Japanese style (read : small) but with all you would require. Prices are reasonable too. Only cable LAN, no wifi in most rooms, as in the case in many Japanese hotels. Carry a pocket router if you want to use wifi on your iPad, phone, etc. Very handy in Japan. Free wifi in the lobby area. Breakfast spread is fairly extensive and has both western and Japanese selections. Nothing to complain about, other than hard pillows, which I was am sure I could have gotten changed, but was just too lazy.", "title": "Great location and service", "user": "sankar", "date": "April 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 158090667}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "For us, Sendai was a rest stop for our Sapporo to Fukuoka JR train trip. We needed a hotel that was close to the Shinkansen and clean and reasonably priced. this hotel fits the bill. to me, this hotel is just good for sleep and shower. Its nice and clean but I didn't feel really comfortable in the room. Perhaps its because its an old old hotel and did a so so job at upgrading. So it feel \"semi-new\" but not comfy as that I would want to curl up with a book and relax in the hotel room.

It is a fair price for a Japanese business hotel. As per most Japanese hotels the service borders on fawning, the cleanliness is immaculate, and the standard rooms are small by American standards. For a single business person, the size is fine. The big downside is that Wifi is only available in the lobby, but it worked flawlessly.
