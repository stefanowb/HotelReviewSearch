After arriving to Nurnberg by train, we headed down the street to the hotel and found it easily. Upon check-in (which was efficient and easy) we were upgraded to the top floor suite! The hotel has an elevator which takes you up almost to the top, just a few flights and then we were at our room. The location of the hotel is great, close to all the things you want to see in Nurnberg (except for Zeppelin field which is an easy bus ride). The room, being at the top of the hotel was a bit stuffy and, it being July, also rather hot. In the room, there was a small air conditioner which we used, but it was not very powerful, so we were a bit warm, nothing a cool shower couldn't fix though. The room had a beautiful claw foot tub at the foot of the bed (a little strange for placement) but it was nice nonetheless. Small in-room tv, internet was slow and only available in certain parts of the room. One side of the bed was unlevel and super uncomfortable (I kept rolling to the middle of the bed where the beds meet), so I switched with my husband and it was fine. Nice view from the windows! It was also strange to have the sink in the main room area, so after using the washroom you needed to come out and wash your hands.
