Met by owner on arrival and given personal guide through the apartment as had booked the suite. The suite was better than could be expected. Both the bedroom and lounge were furnished to \"Royalty\" standard. The full bathroom includes a shower and a deep jacuzzi bath. It was great. There is also a large conservatory off the lounge which gives access to a large secluded decked area which attracts all sorts of birds and other wildlife. When I stayed it was visited regularly by a family of red squirrel. The house does not cater for meals (although snacks are provided for the very late arrivals). However they recommend some local hostelries. We choose the Victoria in Dinnet which was also first class and very reasonably priced. Breakfast was served in a communal dining room The menu was very extensive and all that was served was fab. A large kitchen / pantry is available to use for teas / coffee etc as and when you wish. This area also incorporates a large selection of wines (including champagne), beers and spirits which you help yourself to and are paid for on an honestly basis. The prices are very little above High Street shop prices so no need to take your own.
