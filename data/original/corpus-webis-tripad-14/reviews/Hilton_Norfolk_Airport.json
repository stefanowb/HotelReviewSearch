Checked in for a one night stay and was greeted by folks at the desk who were friendly and professional, this however is the only positive part of my experience at this hotel. Upon checking into the room, it was apparent that the hotel is old and outdated. The doors and walls are paper thin so every noise coming from the hallway, neighboring rooms are easily heard !! I even clearly heard a guy in the neighboring room cursing people making noise in the hall. There is a bar near that lobby, and the design of the hotel is such that you hear all the noise and conversation coming from the bar...at least on the second floor. The doors are so ill fitting that light shines underneath. Additionally, the bathroom was dirty. There was hair in the shower, somebody else's shampoo was in the shower, and there was some kind of red substance around the light switch. The airconditioning system in the room was loud as if there wasn't already enough sound to keep you awake all night. This Hotel isn't up to Hilton standards at all, and certainly isn't worth the money you'll pay to stay here !

My pillow had yellow stains and io called down but two hours later I still have not received a new pillow. There is open space to the rooms from the bar and I can hear the drunk people laughing and being obnoxious. I mean also some good things were that the hallway was quiet. Or creepy, however u wanna put it. The gym was very hot as well. The only things I found that are positive is the lobby is wat u would expect of a Hilton the beds were comfy and the tv and furniture was nice but the entire building needs to desperately be renovated. But of course once it is the prices will no longer be reasonable and it will become the way a Hilton should be. Overall this hotel LOOKED clean was very outdated and was quite trashy.
