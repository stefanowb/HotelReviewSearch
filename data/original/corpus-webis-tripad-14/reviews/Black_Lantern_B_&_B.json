The rooms were recently re-done and were very charming. The location riverside was quite scenic. And the breakfast was delicious. But it was the hosts who made our stay especially memorable. They are two exceptionally friendly and helpful hosts who take great care of their guests. We went for a ride in our friend's vehicle and left ours in the driveway with the windows open. Well, it happened to rain and we expected to return to wet seats. Tom, the owner, realizing that he couldn't close the windows without a key, covered our car with a tarp to keep everything inside nice and dry.

The second morning we indulged in cinnamon streusel bread, a fresh fruit salad, and a crustless quiche. The innkeepers are sensitive to special dietary needs and make every effort to accommodate them. A special treat was the chocolates we received each day in our room. Besides providing us with amazing food, the innkeepers were so helpful in helping us plan our stay. We had not planned much ahead of time, and Tom gave us tips on the best place to explore the Maine coast and the best restaurants in the area.
