Our group had a total or 5 rooms for the weekend, 4 being in the Forest Lake area and I never heard a sound from the other rooms and we had friends next door that I know can be loud. I wouldn't recommend these rooms to families but that's only because the Oasis pool area is where the children in our group wanted to be and the pool area is across the main road leading into the Resort.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jacklamb33", "date": "May 17, 2011", "id": 108647447}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The Cafe by the pool makes an excellent burger.", "title": "A true resort experience close to home", "user": "tri4macs", "date": "May 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 107991947}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The disappointments were that you have a $10 charge for internet and you have to ask for a refrigeration.", "title": "Nice resort and the Oasis pool was awesome!
