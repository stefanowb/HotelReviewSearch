Having been camping on numerous occasions we thought we would give the camping pods a go as they had been recommended by a friend who works for Hoburne. We found the pods to be fairly comfortable although small but agree with a previous review that they could have done with a bit more storage. The pods probably aren't in the best position being near the playground and in the shade so difficult to find any sun around the pod. We had a great time in the area, which is a lovely part of the country and especially enjoyed riding on the steam train and our dog loved the beach. Unfortunately we didn't get to use the swimming pool as we were too busy, it would have been better if it had stayed open later in the evening, 5.30 is a bit early in the summer holidays. Would certainly recommend to others but not sure if would come with kids again probably better for 2 people.", "title": "weekend break in a camping pod", "user": "minkey_8", "date": "September 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 175538537}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We had been looking for a reasonable weeks holiday at the end of the summer holidays when I found Hoburne holidays. We have stayed with Hoburne before somewhere else but had been impressed then so thought we'd give them a go again. Although quite cheap,\u00a3550 for a week, we were pleasantly surprised. Our caravan was exceptional very modern and had an en suit in our bedroom which we weren't expecting. It had lots of kitchen equipment and comfy movable chairs in the living area. Although no entertainment we didn't need it, we love walking so kept us entertained and the beach was only a stones throw. Our caravan was right next to the reception and shop and it didn't bother us at all, no noise. One thing we didn't know before we went was that you cant park by your caravan but the car parks are close by and plenty of them.", "title": "Excellent caravan", "user": "Gemma U", "date": "September 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 175396760}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We chose blue anchor for our family holiday this year for a couple of reasons, 1 we love the whole general area, 2 the location of the site (we all love the beach & trains so being able to see both from our van was just perfect.) All of the staff we encountered were very lovely, polite & helpful. The site is lovely & clean & also quiet which for us is perfect (even though we have children we don't like all the big fuss etc on larger holiday sites) the van we stayed in A32 was lovely & clean & also very cosy & comfy we all slept very well. We loved our holiday so much that we are already planning next years. We didn't use the pool but from what we saw it looked fab, the park was a huge hit with our children (8 years & also 19 months) the kids also loved seeing all the bunnys around the site. We found the beach to be perfect for us & when we wanted to do sandcastles we made sure we took buckets into Minehead.

The swimming pool is warm and perfect for children. The big 'mushroom' in the middle which pours out water is great fun. I agree with a previous reviewer that the showers could be improved but this is only a slight negative. The staff are friendly and welcoming. It is the perfect spot for exploring Exmoor, Dunster, Minehead, Lynton and Lynmouth. There's a fab fish and chip van that sometimes parks on the seafront which sells delicious fish and chips too!

The sofa bed was not a sofa or a bed it was a thin plastic mattress that folded in half, one step up from sleeping on the floor. Camp beds were hard and felt like sleeping on a concrete slab. There are no storage areas apart from the fridge, nowhere to store clothes, food, cups etc. Be aware if you are with small children that the kettle is on a low shelf and there are steps in and out of pod.

Following that she continued to shout at people for them just having fun, like I said before I understand she needs to make sure everyone is safe but speaking to people in the way she did and shouting at them, not even giving them a warning, it completely unnecessary. I never saw her smile and she made me and my family feel extremely uncomfortable. An 8 year old nephew in my family wouldn't go near the mushroom because he was scared she would shout at him, I don't understand how thats fair when he's meant to be enjoying his swim on his summer holiday.

The Pods are wooden huts with 2 electric sockets, a fridge and kettle. 2 small camping style beds and a small sofa bed. They are great shelter if it rains (which unfortunately it did on our first day) Having electricity meant that it was easy to charge phones and of course make a cup of coffee in the morning.
