In warm weather it is stifling!!! Most hotels if lacking air conditioning like this one, will normally give you a fan to help cool you down, no not here, nothing but a nice thick duvet!!

It looks like a lot of money at some point has been spent on the foyer and reception area, lift and heated towel rack (like they needed heating) which you cannot turn off and rather easy to accidently burn yourself on!!!
