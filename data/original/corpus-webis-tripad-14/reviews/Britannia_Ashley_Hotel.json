When we arrived at the hotel, at about 5.30pm, we were given the key to a room. When we opened the door of the room, we found that it was already occupied [so much for personal security]. Returning to reception, we were given the key to another room. When we went into this room we were shocked at what we found. With three beds, it was more like a dormitory than a bedroom. Linen was dirty, the bathroom floor was dirty, the bathroom was badly stained, and there were multiple tiles missing around the washbasin. We immediately complained about this, and were told that there were no other rooms available to us. As a result we had to leave and make alternative arrangements \u2013 though having now read other reviews on this site, we are grateful that we made this escape! We have complained both to the hotel and to the chain\u2019s head office \u2013 no response.", "title": "A lucky escape", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Sarahjane6", "date": "August 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 5581465}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "When we arrived I was already sceptical, the hotel was attached to a Somerfield supermarket and was a very ugly building.
