Front desk personnel tripped over themselves trying to accommodate our every desire. Breakfast was adequate. Unfortunately, I'll never go back to this hotel. BEWARE. I'd booked a block of rooms for my daughter's wedding three months prior to our stay and explained at the time of the booking that my daughter and her bridesmaids would need Friday night reservations for two rooms and would need them until 2:30 pm Saturday afternoon for the 4pm wedding--i.e., a late checkout. The week before the wedding, I was verifying our personal bookings and the late checkout for the two rooms my daughter and her bridesmaids needed, and was told the late checkout was impossible unless I wanted to pay an extra $75 per room. Although we secured AT LEAST 22 bookings (over $3,000) for the hotel, that made no difference whatsoever. All the surrounding hotels were booked at that point, so we couldn't transfer bookings. I left two personal voice mail messages during the week for Darcy, the General Manager, who failed to return my calls. Finally, after I was checked in, she did take my phone call, at my insistence, and verified that she would not give my daughter and her bridesmaids a two and a half hour late checkout--she wasn't even willing to provide one room with late checkout. I begged her to simply schedule either of those two rooms last for cleaning, but she said she was in business to make money and she wouldn't let the girls stay in the rooms unless I forked over ANOTHER $150. They got all our bookings and left us high and dry. My daughter and her bridesmaids had to lug all their stuff to my room, check out of the hotel and then get dressed and do their makeup while I was trying to do the same in my own room. (They'd had hair appts. earlier in the day but had to check out upon their return to the Hotel.) The entire experience was incredibly stressful and could have easily been avoided. Darcy was unresponsive and borderline rude and despite our having steered probably $3500 her way, wouldn't meet my request that I'd expressed from the get-go. I'll NEVER go there again, nor would I ever recommend the Lancaster Arts Hotel to anyone, including you!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Mary U", "date": "October 21, 2011", "id": 119547977}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Beautiful lobby, beautiful room, great breakfast, great personnel AND a rose on the pillow each night.

It's unique design, rooms with interior brick walls, comfortable beds, etc...give it a classy feel. It's location is also a plus since it is within an easy walk of the many restaurants located near the F&M campus and downtown Lancaster. It's a 10 min walk to the Iron Hill Brewery across from F&M. Also, guests of the hotel have access to the YMCA located directly across the street. The Y has one of the best fitness rooms I have ever seen.

We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but it seemed to be very popular on a Friday night. The morning breakfast (included) was really good, in my opinion. They had breakfast burrito wraps, waffles, and hard-boiled eggs, for example. It was more than sufficent for us (two adults and a young child). The surrounding area near the hotel is not as attractive. I guess I expected the downtown area of Lancaster to be more attractive, based on web sites that I'd searched.
