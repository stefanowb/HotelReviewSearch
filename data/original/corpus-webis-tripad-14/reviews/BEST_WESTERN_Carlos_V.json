The hotel presents itself as a basic 3 star facility and that's exactly what it is. Room 306 was small, very clean. On the front of the hotel we did hear quite a bit of noise from the street. Bathroom also small but clean. Wifi included. Breakfast was not included in our rate but for a little under 10 euros per person was fine with hot and cold dishes. Staff was pleasant and spoke English well. The main drawing point of the hotel is the fantastic location. We walked everywhere we wanted to go. We looked at a larger room but noticed it only had more floor space, not more room to put things so we stayed in the original room we were given. If I had it to do over again I would have selected a 4 star property maybe, but overall I think the reviews are pretty accurate.
