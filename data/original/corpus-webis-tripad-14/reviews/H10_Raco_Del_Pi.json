Our flight arrived in Barcelona very early local time, so when I confirmed our reservation in writing a week in advance of our arrival, I requested early check-in. Nope! They couldn't be bothered to arrange this, not even with a week's advance notice. The hotel did not let us check in a second before 2:00 p.m. Exhausted and unbathed, up for more than 24 hours straight, we had to wander around Barcelona in a sleep-deprived stupor before many places were even open. You can't tell me they couldn't have compromised and had a clean room for us by NOON, with a week's notice, at the very least. Our room was a colossal disappointment. We had room 101, which must be very different from the guest rooms described by other reviewers. It was a dim and depressing 9' x 9' not counting the bathroom. There were no luggage racks, only two tiny sock drawers, and no place to conveniently stow luggage out of our ways, even on the floor. The \"two beds\" I'd requested were twin beds with about 2\" of space between. If the tile floor was ever swept or mopped the whole time we were there, I'd be surprised, because my socks turned black walking on that floor. The air conditioning and air circulation was beyond abysmal; the air reeked of stale smoke and never, ever changed. Even overnight, even cranked, the air conditioning never quite cut it. Window was locked shut. The front desk staff seemed polite, professional and made earnest attempts to accommodate us, but the housekeeping staff was puzzling at best. Although there were two people in the room, the housekeeping staff only provided towels for one. When we finally got them to start providing enough towels for two, we still couldn't get them to give us an extra washcloth. We left a note with a tip of 3 Euro (we tipped every day about this amount) asking for \"por favor, uno mas toallita.\" We returned about 2:00 that afternoon to find both the tip and the note GONE, but our room still not made up. A few minutes later, a housekeeper came by with two more towels, not washcloths. Our Spanish was not so awful that we couldn't hear her cackling to the other housekeepers outside the door about the \"weirdos in 101\" who wanted all the extra towels. From then on, we did not leave tips! Although the tile in the bathroom was lovely, the loose-fitting shower door inevitably allowed a lake of water to leak onto the floor during every shower, and a sole towel hook meant that one of us always had to hang her towel in the closet. The room was also poorly insulated against sound, and late-night partiers lurching around and yelling to one another through the stairwells easily woke us. Our conclusion is that this is a 2-star hotel that charges and masquerades as a 3-star hotel. Although the Barri Gotic is a fascinating neighborhood and very walkable, if you're looking for comfort and cleanliness, I'd recommend going elsewhere.", "title": "Can this be the same hotel everyone else here stayed at?", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Madre_di_Dios", "date": "September 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5836713, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Very cramped and inconveniently designed"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "Pros:", "title": "Excellent Hotel !", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "jlafata", "date": "September 19, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5816297, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Bathroom", "disliked": "\u2014 No taxi service into hotel"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Location is excellent in middle of gothic quarter, tons of restaurants, shops, plazas, within walking distance of everything.
