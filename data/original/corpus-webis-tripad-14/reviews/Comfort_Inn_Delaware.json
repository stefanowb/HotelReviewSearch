I was in town on business and needed to stay over so I just walked in to see if they had rooms. The bed was comfortable with many pillows. The TV was pretty big and the motel is equipped with free wireless internet. There is a decent size indoor pool but no workout room. There was a World Gym next door but the staff member was unsure of rate for guests.", "user": "MIRay", "date": "December 2, 2007", "id": 11201398}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Bed Bugs!!!!!!", "text": "The motel is located right next to a strip mall with Damon's - good food and they had the NFL network to watch the Packer's/Cowboys game.

Well, once we arrived we saw that there was trash all over the parking lot, and the staff was very unprofessional. They were not dressed for business thats for sure. Then, each floor smelled like pot. I haven't smelled that since college but their, I knew someone was high. Then we stayed in the room and the next morning both my wife and I had bites all on our bodies. I pulled back the sheets and checked the mattress and on the seams I found blood tracks and once I pulled the seams back I found bed bugs. We checked out right away, and I demanded a refund, the gal at the front desk refused to give a refund and said that was a lie. So I went to the room, got one of the fellows in a cup and sat it on the front desk. \"Show that to your guests\" I said. I got my money back after arguing with them through the credit card company but I will tell you, this LOCATION IS NOT FOR YOU. I should have read these reviews before booking, and I did not. When we left we sprayed our belonings and spent the remainder of our stay with the Best Western Delaware Inn, much nicer.", "user": "3T", "date": "August 24, 2007", "id": 8499276}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Needs some renovations", "text": "I took a group of ladies for a church meeting.
