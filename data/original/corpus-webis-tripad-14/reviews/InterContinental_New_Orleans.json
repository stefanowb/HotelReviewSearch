Secondly, I'd like to thank everyone that contributes to this site. So, i landed in N.O on 8/19/08. The cab ride is appr. $15 pp, & there were 2 in my party for that ride. We stayed at the New Orleans Intercontinental Hotel, located on St.Charles st. Lovely hotel! I haven't anything bad to say about the place. As soon as I checked in my friends and I went seeking Pat O'Brians thanks to this site. We were looking for the infamous \"Hurricane\" drink. Sorry to say that it left little to be desired. Not at all what i expected. Now, if you want a REAL hurricane, then I suggest you head over to a little spot on Gravier st. It's next door to the Holiday Inn and it's called Dominic's Bar. It's 2 blocks from the hotel. Trust me when i tell you that you really only need one. I had 2 in one day and missed a date with a nice guy. Bourbon st. is another world. We went during the day, and it was a regular neighborhood, few people out and about. At night, OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! it was a COMPLETELY different world. Seems like most everything is legal on Bourbon. There's a spot right next to the hotel (if you come out and go to your right) cheap breakfast. I forget the name but it's the first place that you can buy food if you come out and turn right. Had breakfast at MOMMAS. Really good food. My friends did the Katrina Tour, I declined. Just don't feel comfortable giving my money to a bus company when it doesn't benefit the victims. Anyway I didn't get to do half as much as I wanted to. I will say that I LOVE NEW ORLEANS!!! I can't wait to go back, and have 1/2 of a Hurricane! PS.
