Plenty of pillows and extra blankets in suite. Outside sink area is large in bedroom, which makes for ease of sharing space for multiple people sharing one bath. Bathroom itself was small, but good shower. Used the airport shuttle for pick up late one night and was very prompt with nice driver, the next day they weren't prepared for our party and we had to go in seperate trips back to the airport (no big hassle), but this driver certainly was not so cheery (maybe it's the early, early shift and Starbucks doesn't open till 6am at the hotel).", "title": "Is this really a Sheraton?", "user": "Pinaki", "date": "November 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 10588573, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 bed comfort", "disliked": "\u2014 location"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Overall good quality, up to date, well maintained.
