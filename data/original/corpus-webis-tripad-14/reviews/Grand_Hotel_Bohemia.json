Everything you could want was at your fingertips. Very attentive staff, very clean rooms and the location was grand right in the center of the activities but enough off the path to keep the night noise to a minimum. Could highly recommend it. We did not eat in the resturant so I cannot comment on that.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mooresville", "date": "January 22, 2007", "id": 6642149}], "location": {"country": "Czech Republic", "region": "Bohemia", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Prague"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 12, "average": 23, "very good": 192, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 441}, "aka": "Grand Hotel Prague", "slim_ranking": 0.0683506686478, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Grand Hotel Bohemia is a 5-star luxurious hotel in the heart of Prague's Old Town.
