The hotel was then administered by Thistle Hotels and was excellent. There are some plus point about the location in that your room will either overlook the Thames, The Tower of London, Tower Bridge or the touristy St Katherine Docks (these being former spice docks that now house expensive apartments, speciality shops and restaurants in a marina-style environment). The rooms are well furnished and the buffet breakfast very good. The windows are however a 1970's design and single glazed. Unless your room faces the Thames, traffic noise and revellers late at night in St Katherine Docks will be a disturbance. Be aware however that the location is in the business-district of London and the West End with it's theatres, shops and all other attractions are a \u00a34 tube ride away or a 20 minute taxi ride. My visit this month to the Tower was a business trip. The hotel is now part of the Gouman Chain. What a disaster! On arriving at the lobby I was confronted by a huge queue. I elected to leave my bags with the Concierge and check in later in the day. When I returned mid-afternoon the queue was equally as long. I joined the line and 20 minutes later was at the desk. The clerk apologised for the delay and cited a computer failure. I was asked to fill out a registration form and the clerk disappeared for around 3 to 4 minutes. When she returned, she greeted me and asked how she could help. She had clearly forgotten my face or that she had left me at the counter for several minutes. I explained that I had just completed a registration form and gave her my surname again. She again disappeared and returned to explain that the registration form which I had completed minutes earlier was lost and invited me to repeat the process! Eventually I was given a room key to room 228, which overlooked the St Katherine Docks, with a side window to the Thames. I undressed and ran a bath. As the bath was running I heard a noise at my door and on peering through the spy-hole noted a middle-aged gentleman repeatedly trying his key-card in my door. I remained silent and he left. I returned to the bathroom only to find my room door suddenly spring open and a bell-boy usher the same middle-aged gentleman into MY room. The gentleman looked at me in a bathrobe and asked \"who's that guy in my room?\". The bell boy apologised to me for the intrusion and ushered the guest back out into the corridor. I resumed running my bath and then there was a knock on my door. I opened it to find another man who introduced himself to me as \"hotel security\". He enquired as to MY surname. He then wrote it on a piece of paper and walked away. On turning on my TV, the opening screen welcomed \"Mr Possewhite\" to the hotel. I have no idea who that may be. Perhaps it was the gentleman whom the bellboy had escorted in earlier. I tried to contact reception repeatedly, but despite ringing their number for 20 minutes, with no answer I rang the alternative Guest Services number. Again no answer, despite ringing for 5 minutes. In desperation I rang the hotel operator and asked to speak with the duty manager. She indicated that he was busy and would return my call immediately. 30 minutes later, with no returned call, I rang the hotel operator again. She repeated that the Manager would get back to me. After 30 minutes I tried again. Once more I was told that the manager would return my call. After a further 30 minutes, I rang reception, the Guest services numbers and also the Concierge. No-one was picking up the calls, despite my holding for minute after minute. I then decided to go and get a drink in the bar. Afterwards, when I returned to my room, my key-card had been invalidated and I could not get back in!! I went to reception and noticed a lady with a name badge walking around with a walkie-talkie. I asked if she was a supervisor and when I explained my repeated problems, she escorted me to my room, used a pass key to open the door and asked me to check my luggage and belongings to see if they were still there! Fortunately nothing was missing. She arranged for me to have a replacement key. As a reader of this review, you may wish to look at some of our other hotel reviews on Trip Advisor. You will see that we try to make them well-balanced and helpful. We do not go 'looking for problems to report'. This review is I hope a well-balanced and complete appraisal of the Tower Hotel. Unless you simply must stay at ths establishment, I would suggest that you look at any one of the hundreds of other excellent hotels in London, which generally have excellent service.

My first Guoman experience will likely be my last, unless it's the only option. I had booked a Standard room through my company travel agency, figuring it would be a typical double room. I did not realise that at the Guoman, this meant a tiny single bed crammed into the corner of a microscopic room. The bed was touching the small nightstand which touched the arm of a small fabric-covered chair - which touched the window wall. Literally, that was the size of the room. For the price charged, \u00a3200/night when I booked, this seemed absurd. There was a single drinking glass, a single teacup, a single towel. I would have appreciated a second glass - one for drinking from, one for my toothbrush, and a second towel. Small things, but in a hotel that rates itself as the height of luxury... ummm, not with this type of room. Good points were that there was a window that opened overlooking the harbour. (Unfortunately people had thrown rubbish into the window well, which had clearly been there awhile and was unpleasant). The room was clean, although the grout in the bathroom floor held a lot of trapped dirt. Housekeeping team members whom I met in the hall were quite pleasant, although front desk staff were just OK and seemed mildly annoyed that I did not like my room assignment. I have colleagues who have stayed here at other times and had a more \"normal\" size of doube room, but when I asked about having this option, I was told it would be an extra \u00a350/night for a non-refurbished room or \u00a3100/night for a refurbished room... which was not in my company travel budget. BTW, only shower gel and shampoo are provided. No hair conditioner or moisturiser, so bring your own if required.", "title": "Just barely average, not impressed", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SW10UK", "date": "September 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 118261040}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I stay here occasionally for business, and always find the rooms to be clean, spacious and comfortable.
