He said only the restaurant in the hotel, or a truck stop down the road. We checked in and proceeded to the on location restaurant where we were told that they were in fact closing, but we could have something from the bar menu to take to our rooms. Wasn't exactly what I had hoped for to eat, and then we found out the next day that there were many restaurants in fact still open on the south side of town. The room was clean but had that dirty rug smell. The gap under the door to the hallway was quite big and the light shone into our room in the bed area all night. The worst was the breakfast the next morning. The coffee was watery, barely a hint of beans in that brew, the bagels were overtoasted, and freezer burned tasting. Only one choice of topping, strawberry jam, not even cream cheese! I've stayed in worse rooms, but the meals were terrible. We found many better lodging choices the next day when we went to the south side of town to the mall, and guaranteed we will stay at one of them", "title": "Could use an update", "user": "Travellers007", "date": "September 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8717046, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 comfortable bed", "disliked": "\u2014 room smelled like dirty carpet, and terrible restaurant on location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel was fantastic.
