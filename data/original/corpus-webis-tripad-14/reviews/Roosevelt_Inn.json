The buildings and rooms are immaculate. The motel is an older, 1950's-60's style without a lot of amenities and somewhat plain rooms, but the place is family owned and run and the proprietors show great pride in their business. The room was very spacious, TV worked just fine, and the bathroom was sparkling. Self-serve breakfast (coffee, rolls, bagels) is provided in a large, clean room. The motel is near the town center of Hyde Park, and a few blocks from the FDR home and library.
