This time we planned well in advance and we booked at Housekeeping camp. Though we aren't adventurous campers we had so much fun - cooking, 4 adults and one baby sleeping in a tent. Fear of bears, Bear storage, everything the atmosphere of housekeeping camp on july 4th weekend was so nice. We had fun. We'll probably stay sometime in Winter at Wawona.

We arrived at 1 pm and they told us we would have to wait until 3 to check in. I know hotels have a check in time but I've never been turned away from checking in early unless the room wasn't ready. This wasn't the case. Oh well. We went to our site anyway and got yelled at by the rent-a-ranger. Also, don't try to hang a hammock in the trees. We got busted for that too. It seems the only rules they don't enforce is putting out fires and making noise after 10. My only real problem with the place was the smoke from the campfires. It was so bad we decided to not make ours. I left the campground to get away from the smoke because it was so bad. Depending on your location (we were in the middle) the smoke can be horrible. It would be a health hazard for little kids. I left the city to breathe fresh air and I got more pollution in Yosemite! Go figure. The second night was better as there were much less campers. I found the place to be way overpriced ($89 after taxes). If you're going to charge that much then do some maintenance on the place, like changing the canvas on the rooms once every 10 years. They were covered in mold. Next time I'll camp and save some money or stay at curry village were they don't have fire pits. I will say that the showers at Housekeeping were nice and the store there was great. The staff at the store was very friendly.
