I'm not sure the exact age of the building, but it has been really well maintained and is by far the most unique hotel in downtown SLC. Staff is incredibly nice and very helpful.

We stayed at the Peery for one night, and I am so glad to be back. The city itself is undoubtly gorgeous, but the hotel, which is quite misleading from its lobby has some of the smallest rooms I have ever seen. Our room was basically 10X10, (not exaggerating in any way)..the bathroom is directly infront of the bed and the sink does not even fit in the bathroom, so it is placed next to the bed. The rooms are fairly old and not up to par like other hotels rooms (i.e. Marriott..). It was very hard not to feel clausterphobic. If you must stay here, choose a room with a king bed, not a queen, unless youre traveling alone. The location is great, but there is a Marriott just around the corner that looked a lot nicer, (I find that Marriott's are pretty reliable hotels).

It beats any of the other so-called first-class hotels I've stayed in. The service was uncompromisingly friendly and helpful. The accomodations were superb down to the last detail. The views from second or third floor rooms of the mountains and city were spectacular. This is an historic hotel in a location that can't be beat in Salt Lake City. It's walking distance to any number of great restaurants, as well as a wondeful restaurant called Christopher's just off the lobby. The lobby itself is somewhere you'll want to sit in and just relax. Other niceties: free high speed internet at the business center, Starbucks stations on each floor in the morning, classical music in the lobby.
