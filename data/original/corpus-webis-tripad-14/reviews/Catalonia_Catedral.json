Most important - very clean. We were 3 and they set up an extra bed for my son. The staff was very pleasant and accommodated all our needs. If there is a downside, it was only that they couldn't give us our room when we arrived at 11am and we had to walk around town exhausted while we waited to be able to check in at 2pm.
