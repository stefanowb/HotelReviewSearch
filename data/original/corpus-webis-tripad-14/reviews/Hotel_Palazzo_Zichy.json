First off the location: very well situated, within walking distance of the centre, in a calm area. The building itself is nicely renovated, with good taste, the decoration of the rooms also hits the perfect balance beween elegance and comfort. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, but in a natural kind of way. the rooms are kept perfectly clean, and as far as i could understand there is good communication between the cleaning personnel and the supervisors. One minor issue is that the breakfast area could be a bit larger to accomodate the hungry crowd, but this does not mean you have to wait to get a table. to resume: i highly recommend this hotel.

We had a superior room which although it wasn't huge was very nice and tastefully furnished very modern and had all the amenities you could ever require with a very nice bathroom and a view from the window into the square. The hotel provided a fruit bowl for my wife for her 50th birthday which was a nice touch. We thought the breakfast that was included with our room rate was excellent and very well serviced by staff.

Not only were they so helpful and friendly, but they were actually very interesting and fun to get to know. The cute, young bartender was great. The other cute guys at the front desk were superb. (I'm partial to the cute guys, ha!) They even tried tracking down a cab driver who ripped me off. Btw, ALWAYS CALL CABS IN BUDAPEST! Don't worry, it wasn't a big deal, I just argued with the cab driver and didn't give him all the money he wanted. Anyway, stay at HPZ, it was great. Note to the hotel, please please keep your rates where they are, don't raise them too much! I paid 99 Euros for 2 nights (weekends) and negotiated 69 Euros for the other 2 nights. They were nicely flexible and cut me this deal. Breakfast buffet alone would have probably cost at least 10 Euros elsewhere, it was so good!", "title": "Very pretty hotel but strange location and TERRIBLE beds", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Travellingmaestra", "date": "July 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 72290464}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We were really impressed with the decor of the hotel. It was very beautiful. But the room was average to small and the bed was so hard I only slept a couple of hours. The location was odd-- on a residential street a few blocks from public transportation. Maybe we were slightly biased because we had just stayed in a 5 star in a nice location the 4 nights prior to our stay here, but Hotel Palazzo Zichy was a disappointment. We honestly would have been perfectly fine with the location and room size if the bed had been more comfortable.
