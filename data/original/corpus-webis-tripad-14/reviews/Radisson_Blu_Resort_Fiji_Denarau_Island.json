There was 7 of us travelling my husband and I plus 3 young kids (1yrs,3yrs,5yrs) along with my Mum and Dad (Nana & Poppy). We took a 2 Bedroom Lagoon suite and Mum and Dad took a Lagoon Room (rms 101/102 & 103) Amazing would be a good description to start with, our rooms overlooked the waters and were next to the restaurant and pools!! Upgrade to a Lagoon if you can stretch the budget!! I used to work in travel and have travelled extensively around Australia and overseas so I can honestly say I had high expectation before we left and they were all happily granted upon arrival. A few bullet points - rooms are all huge, comfortable, sound proof and make life very easy with a young family - top loader washing machines and dryers, small dishwasher and microwave/fridge, 2 plate electric cooker. Few things I would recommend if travelling with young kids - take snacks,biscuits, crackers, noodles, pretty much most things you can take except honey or fruit, meat and veg - just declare it going through upon arrival into Nadi. Water Ice blocks that you can freeze (i.e juice) are great because buying ice creams can get a little expensive and a treat for the kids between meals or when it is hot. Big things that made a difference for us - food is not that expensive on the deli lunch menus $8fj for a sandwich $15-22 for a burger or stirfry...they always have an alternative menu for the kids which is cheap and offers great choice..plus they help fill special requests if you have a fussy eater.... They have a small store behind reception with egg/bread/wine/beer/snacks/ham/bacon/cheese lots of small things you could make a meal with...I wouldn't bother going down to the Marina to shop you don't save any $$ in the end and just get more than you need. You can buy water from their shop it is the same cost as the Marina and cheaper than getting it duty free - plus you don't have to carry it! The Japanese Asian restaurant near reception is outstanding, fresh and cheap. Radisson buffets are the best along the resort Strip from $64 fj pp kids under 4yrs eating with parent are free. The Sheraton buffet was terrible $88fj pp food choice limited and turnover limited so I would recommend eating at the Radisson. Our kids are up early so we did most bfasts in our room toast cereal. Fresh fruit and veg is very limited unless eating in the restaurant so keep expectations low on buying lots to cook in room with. Kids club girls are fantastic and our 3 boys loved visiting they do most of there activities around the resort and on the beach. Beaches are fine, sand grey/dark, but the sound of the waves is beautiful in the afternoon. Fish and Chips cheap and great location for a sunset drink. Must do -10am-12pm and 2-4pm $20fj massage by the beach for 20 mins the girls are amazing and so cheap!! Day trip out to one of the Islands - if you want Castaway book early or before you go because we could get on because it was booked out. 1/2 day Nemo trip good but rushed stay for lunch if you can afford or if your kids are older. Take suncreen and zinc and put it on the kids before kids clud. Lastly, it is very relaxed over there so pack your bag, take everything out and take a quarter of what you think you need. If you have chosen the Radisson you will have a great holiday. The resort staff are brilliant and can't help you enough, they know how to make you feel welcome and special....We have already booked for next year and are counting the days.", "title": "RADISSON FIJI - BEST RESORT CHOICE ON DENARAU ISLAND", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "nikkicurrimundi", "date": "May 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 63456392}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with family", "text": "My 2 adult children and I spent 4 nights at the Radisson before going to Musket Cove Resort.

The buffett breakfasts offered a good selection of foods plus they cook your eggs to your liking, or you could have an omlete and the pancakes were delicious. We ate at the Cross where the food was of a high standard or if you wanted something casual the fish and chips or the pizzas were good at Neptunes. Don't miss the Happy Hours - two for the price of once cocktails, no wonder everyone gets happy. All the staff delivered exceptional service, all greeting you with 'Bulla' and willing to accommodate requests. The torch lighting ceremony held every evening gave the resort a special atmosphere. It also has a great area to sit and watch the sunsets. The beach is fine, just don't expect the pristine white sands and crystal clear waters for snorkelling, you need to take a trip to the islands for that experience but there were catamarans and kayaks available. The location is perfect as it is close enough to walk to the other resorts to try their restaurants or bars. We did have a meal at the Flying Fish (Sheraton) which was outstanding and also enjoyed their bar Chime which had lots of lounge beds to make yourself comfortable while having a drink and listening to the band. You could also catch the Bulla Bus FJD$6 for the day which would take you to the other resorts or to the marina which had a variety of restaurants/takeaways and a supermarket. Note most of the tours eg island hopping etc leave from Denarau (unlike the Coral Coast which had limited tours unless you were prepared to take the 3 hour round trip to Denarau).
