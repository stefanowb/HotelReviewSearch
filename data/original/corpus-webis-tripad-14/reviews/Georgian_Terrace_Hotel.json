We did not eat at the restaurant, but enjoyed sitting on the front terrace with a cocktail watching the street below. Took a tour of the Fox Theatre across the street, which was very interesting.

(Those that do not order food or go to the hotel restaurant give high scores). We were meeting friends to see West Side Story at the Fox. The 2 bedroom suite was ideal except it had only one bathroom. While our room was not the greatest (rain came in around the window frame and soaked window treatments and carpet to the bed-mold and mildew) and the kitchen was very outdated with 0 supplies, I really have no complaints. We were all smiles with the great service we received from the incredible doormen and the front desk. The hotel is thrilling if you are a Gone With the Wind nut or just love historic hotels (our 1st choice if possible, so we are used to not -so- perfect). Our favorite doorman delivered ice rapidly with great fun and jokes. Since it was Sunday and we couldn't find a restaurant nearby that was open and since we didn't want to be late for the show, I suggested the hotel restaurant. I have never been so embarassed in my life. It was very expensive (O.K., Atlanta-meal with friends), but it was absolutely terrible. We ordered 4 different meals, tasted everyone's, and each was worse than the last. The only thing good about it is that it provides ongoing laughs. Even the rolls were bad and Creme Brulee with peaches was very bad vanilla pudding with a piece of peach sugar-candy on top. After our $40.00 dinners we had to buy popcorn at the Fox to fill up. When the show was over, we went to the hotel bar, hoping for a snack. I ordered a White Russian and when I asked for more Kaluha because I only tasted milk water, I was told they had none. What did they give me? At any rate , 3 of us had one drink and 1 had 3 drinks. Then things stopped being funny. When my friend asked why we were charged for 10 drinks when we only had 6 (4 people knew we had 6) he was asked rudely \"What is your problem??\". He didn't want to make an issue since they were visiting with us, but if I've heard it I would have requested they call the police before I paid. That was another $80.00 down the drain. The bartender had friends visiting that I think we treated.

The hotel is convenient to the Fox, being right accross the street. The room was okay but the service is horrible. After our concert it was late and nothing was open to eat so we decide to go back to the room for room service. You can order room service till midnight, we ordered food at 11. Room service wants you to leave a message with your order so we did. 11:30 rolls around so I call again to make sure they got our order, leave another message but also call the front desk. He says they should have our order shortly. We are starving at this point but wait. To make a long story short we ended up going to bed hungry, only to be woken up by room service telling us our food was on the way. They delivered our food at 1:20 am and acted like nothing happed.
