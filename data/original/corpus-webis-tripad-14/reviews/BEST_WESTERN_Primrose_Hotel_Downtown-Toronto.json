I asked if it were possible to put me in a room that I could also remain during our tour; so as to forego a room change. Well, I was assigned a room on the 6th floor, which was dirty (we kept our shoes on), and badly in need of renovation. The first night, the room next to ours had a get-together at loud voices talking at 3 am. I called the front desk to complain and things finally piped down. The next day when other tour members arrived, I mentioned my disappointing room and was informed the 'other' rooms were better. Sure enough, the rooms up on the 21st floor did look like they had been renovated. Unfortunately, there were no rooms for us to change until the last night. Ugh. I was just grossed out by the room and bath. When we were changed, the view improved, the neighboring rooms were quiet, but the overall cleanliness of the hotel was pretty bad. The elevators were frighteningly slow; and with 48 or so tour members trying to come and go on time, was just impossible.", "title": "Avoid this hotel and its elevators", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Liz1953", "date": "August 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 8357782, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 lack of cleanliness and slow elevator"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is rated as a 2-3 star depending on what reviews you read.
