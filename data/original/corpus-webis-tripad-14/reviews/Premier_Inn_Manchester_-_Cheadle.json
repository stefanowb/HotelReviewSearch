The room was just like most Premier Inn's and was clean. We went for breakfast in the pub just outside the door, (didnt have to out in the rain) The breakfast was one of the best we have had. Started with fresh fruit (there was also cereal) toast and then a freshly cooked breakfast with a freshly cooked egg. Plenty of juices tea and coffee.
