To be honest, hotel is beatiful, room was great, spa also, but- service is not ao the same level as in Amarvillas, Vanyavillas, Rajvillas or Delhi. In fact, something missing. We asked for our pool towels- helou, theey should be already there, and housekeeper took our white towels from bathroom and gave ithem to us....At breakfast, my husband finished with the fruits and started ate eggs-waiter gave to him old knife and fork! This is the best hotel in Asia, and such mistake is out of mind. And spa, beatiful decorated, run by Banyaan tree, great treatmants, everything perfect but- in spa menu they offer waxing. I tried to do it, ( I was 2 weeks on my trip) but no waxing-at all. They sent me to Trident hotel,..... Overall, hotel is great, room with private pool is great and if you planning to go there definately choose room with pool, other rooms without pool look the same, but the difference worth money, but service is just on the same level we used to it at other Oberoi hotels.", "title": "not on the same level as other oberois", "user": "nes", "date": "June 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 31536320}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Supeb!", "text": "No words can sufficiently describe how beautiful this place is!
