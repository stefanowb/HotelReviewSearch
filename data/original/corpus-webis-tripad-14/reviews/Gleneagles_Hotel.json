The bathroom was well appointed and again, what you would expect of a deluxe hotel with Asprey soaps / shampoos etc. Breakfast in the main restaurant is delicious, and offers a wide range of foods. The staff are attentive and nothing is ever too much trouble. The clubhouse and Deseo (where you can choose from a varied menu which includes delicious tapas, and the children can even make their own pizza) were good dining choices in the evening and for lunch with the kids.

Shooting also has wonderful facilities. And there are very few places that I know of where you can do hawking. Don't miss it. These activities do come at a high price, but they are all memorable, and Gleneagles provides all gear, down to Barbour jackets and wellies if you need them. Believe me, they have your size!

We have seen the hotel come back to life over the past 5 years in particular and we put that down to extra revenue that glenmore has brought. It gives trade to the hotel even on off season mid week nights which is great. The golf is fantastic. Our fave restaurant is the Emporium side of Deseo which is the quiet area. We always order whatever we like in terms of seafood and meats and the team never let us down even though it's not on the menu! A lobster and huge piece of fillet after a winters day round the queens course is the perfect way to end the day! Last year the clubhouse was revamped and it is pretty cool and modern now with very good food to be had and the Dubai-es que smoking area is fun!
