I could sum up Las Brisas in one word, PERFECTO! My wife and I stayed in casita # 504, a Jr. suite, just steps from the Sunset Bar and could not have been happier. Between the bay and lush landscaping, the view was magnificent. Definitely the casitas nearer the top of the mountain are more desirable. The best feature of our casita was, without a doubt, the almost absolute privacy. The only prying eyes are of the squirrels and, at night, a raccoon-like critter. Do not leave your food unattended or it may very well get snatched! Insects were not a problem although we did leave towels on the floor outside the bedroom door at night at the suggestion of a former guest- probably wasn\u2019t necessary. The pool was big and the surrounding deck was huge and included a large, comfy, shaded lounge area. Each day the pool man put fresh flowers in the water.The service from the entire staff was impeccable. Any requests were answered promptly and very courteously. While we never had dinner at the Bella Vista, we had breakfast there, and it was very good with a beautiful view, naturally. Because we hated to leave our casita, we ordered in lunch several times. The turkey sandwich is really good, as was most everything we ate. The banana daiquiris are heaven! In the evenings we called up our driver, Julio Cesar, a very reliable and friendly man, (044) 744 160 08 95. Highly recommend using his services, very fair prices and great guy. We ate dinner at Kookaburra and Baikal, both have great food and lovely atmosphere Do not eat at La Perla by the cliff divers. Not a nice area or atmosphere. Also, for $80 with out drinks the food was okay at best. To sum up you don\u2019t need to look for any other hotel.

We were in the beach club casitas #467. I would highly recommend staying up here because nobody looks down on your casita. We toured quite a few other casitas and there were only two that I would rather stay in. One was #469 which was a master suite and had a indoor/outdoor pool. It had pretty much the same view for $1000 more a night. Then there is #510 which is a two bedroom suite. This unit has an indoor jacuzzi and is set on two levels for$1500 a night. We paid less than $200 for #467 and were extremely happy. Make sure you get down to the beach club for a swim and lunch.
