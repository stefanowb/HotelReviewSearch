From the outside it is NOT impressive .. sort of looks like a tacky road motel with parking spaces butting up against the back of the one-story building. But enter into the courtyard, and suddenly you've stepped back in time to a beautifully-landscaped inner sanctum with wannabe has-been movie stars hanging out around the pool. Orange-painted accents are everywhere , giving the Mohave a funky art-deco feel. The check-in and check out clerks were matter-of-fact, seemingly a bit hurried for our one-night stay. The room was spacious with mini-kitchen, and had a comfy bed. The bathroom tile looked somewhat dated in color and wear. Regrettably, I was welcomed into the shower by the sight of a dead creepy-crawly -- this is a ground-level older 'resort'.
