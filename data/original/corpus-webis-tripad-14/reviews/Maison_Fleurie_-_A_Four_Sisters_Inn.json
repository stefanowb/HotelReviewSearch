The location is perfect--access to the entire Napa valley, wonderful restaurants within walking distance, all within a charming little village (Yountville). The breakfasts were hearty--eggs and potatoes as well as cereals, breads, coffee. Wine and cheese in the afternoon was great and there is a second floor outdoor patio on which you can enjoy the afternoon treats. Coffee and cookies are available in the evening, as well as chilled soft drinks all day long. The newspaper is delivered to your door each morning. Maison Fleurie is a beautiful 3-building inn with flowers and vines growing all over the property. The hot-tub is nice too. They also have bikes you can borrow and we very much enjoyed leisurely rides on country roads flanked by vineyards. We highly recommend Room 13 in the Carriage House.

It was dark, the carpeting had numerous stains on it, the bathroom needed some serious cleaning and updating, and the \"white\" sheer curtains were in desperate need of washing --they were gray. Add to this, the room smelled very strongly of deodorizer. Both of us have allergies / asthma. Within minutes, my husband was wheezing --there was no way we could have spent the night in that room. We brought this to the attention of the front desk who firmly informed us that we should have notified them in advance not to use any sprays in the room. (I've never heard of any such thing). After some discussion, we were given a portion of our $ back, less than half of the cost of the reservation. After the last two \"amazing\" reviews, I finally had to speak up.
