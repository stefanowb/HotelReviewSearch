Honestly in my mind I thought Rome was going to be my least favorite, I thought, 'there's probably going to be a lot of crime and the hotel, ...the picture didn't even do it justice!\" (The hotel is safely located with lots of police because of the embassies near by) This hotel was amazing! It looked incredible with old fashioned winding stairs, a nice older gentleman took our bags, and we got in this terrific old elevator, that looked like a cage, the elevator was like a box pulled by a cable. The room was really big, and it felt like I was staying at a room in a really fancy, incredibly big old house. The service at the counter is these 2 amazing girls that are really cheery and the older gentleman also operates the bar in the room furthest back on the first floor, it's a very comfortable lounge. It felt like a place straight out of -I don't know what analogy would be best maybe- \"Harry Potter\"!!! When you eat in the mornings you go downstairs, in this amazing layout of a floor plan that makes this place by far the most intricate and unique hotel we've ever stayed at. Oh yea, ...and I loved the location, it's only a 3 minute walk to Trevi Fountain and also a bus stop is on the next road over, just turn down Susanna and get on Barberini, and at the end of the road is the bus stop.

I would definately recommend choosing a superior room or junior suite if you can afford it as the first room we were shown was very small and tired although it was very clean. If you arent a fan of elevators, ask for a room on a lower floor as the old fashioned elevator, whilst very charming may not be to everyones taste! The hotel is on quite a busy street but it has its own sign and is quite easy to find. Its about a 20 minute walk to the first 'main' sight of Rome, the Trevi Fountain. You can also pick up a tube from the nearest station about 10 minutes walk away. We didnt use the buses. The breakfast was very good and plentiful, with lots of cakes/pastries and a couple of hot choices. The coffee and juice were from machines though and not the best.
