The innkeeper was very friendly and inviting, even offering us a choice of available rooms. We had a room just inside the front door. It was very cozy... not a spacious room but suited our purposes of just hanging out and relaxing. The breakfast was wonderful, including quiche and belgian waffles! It's also a \"kid friendly\" place as well. There were two little ones seated at the breakfast table in the morning.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HMTY", "date": "February 21, 2007", "id": 6822917}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 8, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 15}, "aka": "Captain Sawyer's Place Boothbay Harbor, Maine", "slim_ranking": 0.9375}
