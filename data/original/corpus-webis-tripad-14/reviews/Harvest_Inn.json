Spent 2 nights here and 2 nights at the Villagio Inn and Spa in Yountville. The Villagio was first so this place had alot to live up to. We were on vacation with another couple and each had our own rooms. Let me first say I don't like the decor of this place and probably shouldn't have stayed here. Having said that it was ok at best. We were upgraded to an executive sweet and who doesn't appreciate that. Room was 2 stories and filled with all the problems you have making a bedroom in the attic with a bathroom. It had charm and character but for the price I expected more. The View from the balcony of our room was Wonderful! Right in the vineyard that is for sure. Nice grounds assuming you want to walk through a wedding reception on the way to your room everytime. Our friends had some problems however. When we got to their room it really smelled like fireplace smoke. More like burned out building smoke. They called and someone came and sprayed something to make it smell better. MY MAIN PROBLEM with this place happened to my friends who returned in the afternoon at 3pm after being gone for more than 6 hours to find that their room had not been cleaned. Oh they started but then closed the front door and left without making the bed, cleaning bathroom etc. Did you notice I said Front door. Yes the door leading out to their porch with a view was left wide open and yes it is on the ground floor. I'm horrified just thinking about it. Noone was around either. It's not like the staff went next door for a minute. Bottom line this is NOT a first Class hotel. Will never stay here again. Villagio blew them out of the water in every way. Same price.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 20, 2005", "id": 3926098}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very Nice", "text": "This hotel is very nice. It offers nice cottage rooms that are very large and beautifully decorated. I felt that I had plenty of privacy and the grounds were lovely. There were flowers and fountains and small ponds throughout. You can also get rooms that look out into their working vineyard. This is not the traditional hotel at all, I would think of it as a place where small cottages are scattered thoughout the grounds. You will receive a complimentary half bottle of wine and they offer in room massages, etc. The breakfast was included and very nice, it included most everything I would want for breakfast: bagels, eggs, coffee cakes, muffins and on and on! The people were a bit stuffy and quiet, but you can take your food and eat on the outside patio looking into the vineyard if you'd like. I didn't notice that I was bothered by too much noise. I heard some people in the morning for 10 minutes, but that was around 9 am. I got a nice nights sleep. I guess it was a bit pricey, but St. Helena is that way! For a lovely wine country experience, I would definitely stay here for a night, we paid $269, from their website.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 28, 2005", "id": 3811956}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Harvest Inn so out of date", "text": "It was very pretty, but it was outdated. The room was big but very dark and was just one large room when you walked in. (and it smelled like fireplace smoke) The bedroom area had no privacy. It was VERY old, great if you were a senior traveller. There are other more current places and I would definitely seek them out rather than overpaying for this type of lodging.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 10, 2005", "id": 3752824}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Harvest Inn, the place to stay in Napa Valley", "text": "My wife and I recently stayed at the Harvest Inn in St. Helena and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

We had a cramped, dark and smelly room adjacent to the massage room. It was right on the road and every car, motorcylce and truck that passed felt like it was going to run through our room. They also did not mention that the hotel was under construction during our stay. The only aspect that I appreciated was its' proximity to Downtown and the restaurants of St. Helena.
