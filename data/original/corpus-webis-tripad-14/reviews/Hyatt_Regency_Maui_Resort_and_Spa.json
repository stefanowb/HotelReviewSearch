I wrote a review to that one too if you are interested. The hotel is on Kaanapali beach. A 10 minute drive to Lahania and Front Street. Upon arrival we were escorted to the front desk. Since it also happed to be my birthday they gave us a Hawaiian style photo album. Really nice touch. The grounds are beautiful with tropical flowers and nice landscaping, birds, fish ponds, flamingoes, penguins. We got an ocean front room in the atrium tower (middle one). It was ocean front indeed. It felt like you could touch the ocean. The balconies are very small. Just enough room for 2 chairs and a small table. The beach is very narrow, in some places not even wide enough for a beach towel. I guess that's why they put a lot of money into the pool. The pool was huge. It had waterfalls, water slide, caves, pool side bar. Not actually a swim up. They had lots of chairs some with canopies so you didn't have to roast in the sun if you didn't want to. They were so close together and they were pretty full each day. They had women serve drinks and food to you chair. The breakfast which was included was similar to the breakfast at the Hyatt in Kauai. It had anything you could want. There was something there for everyone. We ate at the sushi and steak restaurant (i forget the name) for my birthday dinner. I really liked it because I like sushi and and husband won't touch it. he's a steak lover. The next night we had champagne and fruit delivered to the room. The fruit actually made me sick later in the night. I think it may have been the yogurt dip. We got a couples massage next to the beach. It was ok. I would have liked it if the huts were futher away from the people lounging by the pool. The spa in Kauai was way nicer. All in all we enjoyed out time at the Hyatt in Maui.

We have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Maui during several previous vacations, and until now, we have always been delighted with the resort. This time, however, missed the mark completely. We booked the room through a third-party website, which failed to disclose the noisy construction taking place just outside of our room, noting instead an \"obstructed view\". There is a significant difference between an obstructed view and noisy, disruptive construction that begins at 7am every day of the week. The information was not available at the time of booking, but as of now, the website includes the information (maybe too many customers complained about false advertising?) I can understand a resort's ambition to upgrade their grounds and build additional units for time shares, but keeping guests in the dark about these changes and their impact on a vacation is unacceptable. Speaking of upgrades, while they are sprucing things up, why not start with the room interiors? The rooms feel dark, outdated, and unwelcoming, despite the stunning lobby and amazing landscape. I feel deceived by this absence of information, as well as the clerk who checked us in at 10:30pm the evening we arrived and assured us not only that we had one of the best rooms at the resort, with a lovely view included, but also that the parking lot we had used in the past was inconvenient and that a more distant lot would be more suited to our needs.By the way, parking now costs between $14 (self-pay) and $20 (valet), a stark change from the past, when parking for guests was free. Parking isn't the only thing that the resort overcharges for; meager cocktails, which include a copious amount of ice and a small amount of fluid, will cost you around $14, and the breakfast buffet, at $25, is limited, boring, and sadly lacking in healthful breakfast items. Both the management and staff have some work to do in the customer service department. Housekeeping didn't come one day until I called the front desk to request service. If you choose to stay here, remember to ask for new sheets daily if you want them, because they will reuse the same bedding several days in a row otherwise. One of the perks of a vacation should include fresh sheets and towels daily, in my opinion. If not for the sublime gardens, the Hyatt Regency wouldn't have much else to attract visitors. I find it heartbreaking that a place with the potential to be heaven on earth has chosen to create unnecessary headaches for its guests instead, many of whom have saved up for special occasions and deserve better than what they get. In the future, we will look for a resort that lives up to the expectations we once had for the Hyatt Regency Maui.

But it sure is nice to sit in your cabana on the beach and have drinks/food brought to you at your request. The only negative comment I could make is the construction that was going on around the pool during our stay.
