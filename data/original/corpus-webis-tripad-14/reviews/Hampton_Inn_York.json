Like everyone else I search the internet for good deals. We had to use the Housing Bureau to book our rooms for the Keystone Games we attended in York, PA. We decided on the Hampton Inn - York because of the breakfast, the pool, the mall and the restaurant next door. However, when I researched them on line I came upon this site with the information about the bed bugs. I was very surprised to see what had happened and I wanted to make sure our team would be staying at a good place. After doing some research about bed bugs, I called the manager of the hotel. She called me back. I asked her about the comments on trip advisor. She understood where I was coming from and she told me what they had done to take care of the issue. She told me it was not a cleanliness issue and that it was brought in by someone, and that they had done a lot of things at the hotel to get rid of them. She was very educated on the issue and I felt better after speaking with her. I had to take the time to write this because we had a wonderful stay. The hotel was very busy, but the staff was great. The housekeepers did a very good job with our rooms every day we were there. I loved the breakfast for our kids and the fact that the mall was so close by.

Assigned first to room 431, after a few nights my companion had red, mosquito-like (only larger) VERY itchy spots popping up on hands, back, arms and eventually feet and buttocks. Thinking they were hives, we continued to stay in 431. However, when I also had red spots show up about a week after checking in, we asked housekeeping about it. We were told that there \"may\" have been one or two complaints in the past but that they had never \"actually seen\" any rash; I showed them mine and was sent to see the head housekeeper. This lady was extremely nice and immediately moved us into another room (436) across the hall so they \"could investigate\". She followed up with me to make sure the new room was okay, and even offered to reimburse us for any medications we had to purchase, but never told us that this was bedbugs. We bought Benadryl, hydrocortisone cream, Benadryl gel and finally FIVE boxes of baking soda, which we used to make a paste with water and put on the bite marks every night for several nights (this really helped). I spent hours on the computer researching the marks, and they are completely consistent with bedbug bites. The hotel is great, the staff is great, but this was extremely disturbing and personally a huge problem as the itching was so bad it was nearly impossible to sleep for several nights.
