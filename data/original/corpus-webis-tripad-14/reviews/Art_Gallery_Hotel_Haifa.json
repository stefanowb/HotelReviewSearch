It's in a restored Bauhaus building in older area. The deluxe rooms are of a decent size, the black-out curtains do their job, the refrigerator was handy, and the individually-controlled air-conditioning made the room a welcome retreat from the hot and humid outside. Breakfast is served in the snackbar in the same building - mostly white bread with little individual dishes of olives, tuna, jam, yogurt cheese and butter. Omelets to order. Great cappuccino. No juice (a surprise), only some orange-flavored drink, although freshly squeezed orange juice is sold here later in the day. We supplemented this with dark bread, salami, cheese and yogurt from the Russian supermarket across the street and fruit from the big market on the next street. There's parking behind, from which your car is guaranteed not to get away unscathed! And there are two free computers in the lobby. Danny, the day manager, is very helpful, a really nice guy. We checked out the other hotels in town, and this one is the nicest, newest and in the most interesting neighborhood.", "title": "Boutique hotel with great air-conditioning!", "user": "melody_favish", "date": "August 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19427831, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the building itself and its location in an older primarily Russian neighborhood", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing really"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "+", "title": "Barely acceptable", "user": "alexriderGB", "date": "August 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 19346632}], "location": {"country": "Israel", "continent": "Middle East", "city": "Haifa"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 13, "average": 17, "very good": 34, "terrible": 13, "excellent": 24}, "aka": "Gallery Hotel Haifa", "slim_ranking": 0.5}
