I booked a premium 2 bedroom suite, price range is $440-$660 per night, a rate that did not include breakfast. As far as I could tell this differs from the standard suite, in that the standard has 1 less en-suite, no wash machine/dryer and perhaps a little smaller. The hotel was air-conditioned (quiet) in the main hall (not ducted to the bedrooms). The hotel has only 2 of these rooms situated at the top floor and facing the sea. The larger room with ensuite comes with bathroom (nearly as large as the bedroom) and a bath/spa combination. The other room has an ensuite with a shower. Both equipped with the usual towels, amenities (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and thick bathrobes. Also has fully equipped kitchen with mini bar. It was kept very clean and the hotel is very new. The first thing that struck me was how tiny the LCD TV was (only about 20\"), perhaps having rented an apartment at Taupo the night before for about the same price with a 42\" LCD TV made it seem smaller.", "title": "Noise from construction next door may be useful if you forget to set the alarm", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "poopbunny", "date": "March 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 14149837, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 New, clean.", "disliked": "\u2014 Construction & demolition noise from next door.

I booked directly from the hotel website which promised free wine or something. I did not get this nor did I bother to ask for any. The website displays pictures from 3 sides but not the side where all the construction is happening, nor did it mention anything about the possibility that your stay may be less than peaceful.

Plenty of parking which was included in the rate.

We were told that our room was only 64 days old. This hotel is in a suburb area along the sea approx 5 minutes drive from city centre in Napier. However we were glad to have not stayed inside in Napier. There are numerous restaurants in this area. We ate in caution/shed 1 restaurant based on reviews of others on trip advisor. However we were very disappointed with the service and standard of food available in this restaurant. We would rate this one of our poorest meals and one of the worst for value for money while we stayed in NZ. We were also told that caution restaurant was booked out but we counted at least 15 tables that were free during the night - we got the impression that if you didnt have a reservation you were pushed into the shed 1 adjacent restaurant. The hotel had a great breakfast and the staff were excellent - we would rate the continental breakfast as one of the best we had in NZ and fantastic value for money - 15NZ dollars or 6 euro for each !!
