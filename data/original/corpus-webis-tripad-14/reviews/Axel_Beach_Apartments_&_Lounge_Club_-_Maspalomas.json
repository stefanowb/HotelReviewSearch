Asked for a pool view room and a high floor - both of which we got. Rooms are basic but newly decorated although the decor is quite dark! The kitchen area still has the sink / hob (and possibly all the other items) from when the apartments used to be Liberty Hotel. Unfortunately the kitchen sink stunk probably from rotting food down the drain from when it was Liberty hotel too - we complained about the foul smell that kept coming up but this was never sorted out. In fact we were pretty surprised when one of the cleaning staff came to the room and implied the smell was due to us not flushing the toilet (she demonstrated by miming how to use a toilet!). Bedroom was functional and comfortable although pillows were pretty useless. Bathroom was a good size but that the only plus point - complained about the bathroom sink leaking - again, not sorted out properly. The shower was weak and either blasted you with scalding hot water, or freezing cold or would just completely stop - no matter what time of day you took a shower. There were also no hooks anywhere in the apartment to hang up jackets or the dressing gowns they provided.....would just have been useful. Also we had specifically asked in advance if they had irons and ironing boards which they confirmed they did have. When we arrived, eventually (after some hassle) got an iron - which was a totally useless travel iron - but were told there were ironing boards. In fact we were told it was impossible to get an ironing board and no one else had ever asked for one (really??). After quite some wrangling, I think hotel management went off and bought an ironing board but things like this should have been available anyway and they should not have argued so much with us that they could not supply these items.", "title": "Nice holiday", "user": "Jo2011a", "date": "June 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162946396}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Good sized TV in the room with a good selection of channels - quite intermittent service in that it kept stopping so you got no picture or sounds at all.

These apartments used to be TUI First Choice Holidays Liberty 2 apartments. The transformation is excellent, modern decor, clean, airy and fresh. The Gym and Spa facilities are superb and after being to the area many times before, these apartments provide a sea change to the resort and will help Maspalomas modernise for the 21st Century Gay Traveller in context to other apartments that I have stayed in that are still in the 70s. The Matinee pool party was excellent and the music ensured the location stayed lively over the Pride event which one would expect. It is worth paying the extra for the pool view as good view across the resort in context to the road. As the apartments had just opened there were issues such as no international TV and the Wi Fi is very slow at peak times each web page could take 120 seconds to load, however between 6am to 9am when most people were asleep the wi fi was faster. A larger data pipe to overcome this is required as I mentioned when I was at the Berlin Axel which was slightly faster than the Axel Maspalomas. The check out was painfully slow, the staff are very friendly but they could not tell from the computer if I had paid or not and usual process was to collect payment at check in which we thought we had done. The Airport Bus 66 stops at the Playa Del Sol apartments a few minutes walk away from the back exit of the accommodation, there is also a night bus to airport that also stops at the Playa Del Sol we useful for late or early flights.", "title": "Axel @ Pride", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "RayChapmanHastings", "date": "May 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161046462}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "These are very nice apartments, partly refurbished. The staff are very helpful, everything is spotlessly clean and the food/drink is good quality. The pool area is particularly nice with the high class sun loungers and parasols. There are some bad points though. When we first checked in there were no batteries for the TV remote. Two of the door handles were broken. One of the bathroom wall tiles was loose. Some of the staff don't speak good English and the bar service is very slow when ordering food. There were pool parties when we stayed because it was Pride. I didn't want to sunbathe whilst they were going on, but I would've sunbathed if part of the pool was sectioned off during the parties. The music didn't bother me, but as a paying guest I expect to sunbathe in relative comfort, something I didn't want to do.
