Another thing I liked was that you could open the windows for fresh air - great instead of the usual stuffy hotel air!! We asked for a late checkout and after checking, it was happily granted. A full breakfast was included in our room rate and that was fine - freshly made fresh fruit salad was lovely, cereals, toast, coffee/tea and cooked stuff like bacon, sausage, hash browns etc. I think they do a great job at the Bay Plaza. The quality of the place generally is reflected in the room rate. If you want something heaps better than this then check the rates - you will be paying close to $200NZ+ per night. We paid $135 which equates to only about 45 pounds sterling which you would be lucky of you got a crappy share backpacker room in the UK for that.
