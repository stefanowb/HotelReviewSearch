The rooms and hotel were spotless, the service was excellent, especially the lady in charge called Cora, who would bend backwards to help you. The beds were a bit hard for a lightweight person, and the windows on the road could do with a double glazing. Ask for a room on the courtyard side instead. Good point for the water bottle, the very nice biscuits, and the ear buds complementary box. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend their restaurant either: good genuine local dishes reasonnably priced.", "title": "Small on price, big on service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jeff6076", "date": "May 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 64180303}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Limousin", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 10, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 9}, "aka": "Hotel Restaurant Le Teinchurier France/Brive-La-Gaillarde", "slim_ranking": 0.1, "description": "The hotel-restaurant Le Teinchurier is set in a quiet setting and peaceful surroundings, located just five minutes from the centre of Brive."}
