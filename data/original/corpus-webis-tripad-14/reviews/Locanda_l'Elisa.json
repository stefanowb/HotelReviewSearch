Our room cost 390 euros for one night and although it was nice, it wasn't THAT nice! The bathroom wasn't very clean either. We thought the pool and sumptous breakfast might make up for it but the pool was so cold that I couldn't get into it and my husband had to grit his teeth to jump in. The breakfast was a huge disappointment for such a pricey hotel. i was offered a bowl of museli and a coffee with one croissant and I overheard another guest say that there was cheese in her cheese omelette which she had paid extra for! The hotel has a very small bar area and restaurant but we chose to eat out at the fabulous da Giulio trattoria in Lucca which made our whole visit worthwhile....", "title": "not worth the money", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Kathyweston", "date": "June 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5331318}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "Arrived from Venice for 6 nights in a Suite (maybe a Junior Suite).

Automatically upgraded to the one bedroom apartment style room upon arrival - what a wonderful surprise. I can't tell you how great this room was. It had a very comfortable couch, chair, ottoman, dining room area, separate bedroom area (with very heavy curtains between the rooms, you could close for privacy). The apartment was warm and cozy. I felt like I was in the summer estate of some royal family member. The bathroom was modern and had a tented fancy ceiling that just took my breath away. The shower was heavenly after having to endure \"baths only\" in some of the hotels we stayed at. The living room area/bar off the lobby was a comfortable place to sit, considering the very deep and high backed couch, and wing chair. They actually opened the restaurant for us that night, which was our Thanksgiving Day back home. The restaurant is a very beautiful, very fancy gazebo. Custom curtain treatments, linens, crystal, candles, soft background music - everything you hope a romantic dinner will be. The service was exceptional as well as the food.

We had a delicious pasta lunch in the pizzeria about two blocks outside the opening exit/entrance near the back of the tower complex.

The fresh fruit basket was delicious and much appreciated as we were starving when we arrived. The fine bone china dinnerware set up for two on the dining room table in the room was really the icing on the cake. Talk about \"being made to feel welcome\" is an understatement here. The walls of the apartment are all padded and covered with silk wall coverings. The carpeting throughout the whole hotel was wonderful and made the room just feel that much more like home. No cold hardwood or linoleum here - thank goodness. Some hotels throughout Italy, no matter how expensive, simply don't carpet their rooms. I just don't get it. Also, don't expect soft beds, big feather pillows, small wash clothes or hair conditioner in any hotel (they only provide shampoo and body wash). We stayed in six different cities and realized they simply don't provide these items in Italy (at least we never got them).

We have found her books most useful in choosing accomodations and we travel alot. After reading recent reviews on trip advisor we were so concerned we almost cancelled our reservation. I am SO glad we didn't. From the moment we entered the hotel we were so delighted that I wondered if the poor reviews were about a different place!!! All the staff were so warm and helpful. The hotel is charming and was very clean. Even the pool was clean although it was too cold too swim. We were immediately told that although we were paying for a deluxe room we were upgraded into a small suite--bedroom and living room and complementary fruit bowl. We enjoyed the complementary continental breakfast--excellent latte and delicious baked goods. My only recommendation is that lighting in the bedroom is improved. It was too dim. We really liked the peace and serenity of being outside Lucca and we loved exploring the town of Lucca , bicycling on the ramparts and listening to opera arias in one of the churches which occurs every night.
