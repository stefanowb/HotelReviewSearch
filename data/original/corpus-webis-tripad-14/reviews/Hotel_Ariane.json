Nothing was too much trouble for the staff of this hotel as they accommodated us so graciously with our many and varied requirements, such as allowing us to rehearse in the hotel and store many large instruments. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this area of Belgium. It is situated in an excellent location. Restaurant is excellent and rooms are very comfortable and clean. Will definitely return in the future.

There is good parking outside the hotel and no steps into the hotel which makes it easy to carry luggage. The reception is in a large atrium with good natural light, the receptionists were very polite (excellent English) and helped me out when I broke my travel adapter. The rooms are a reasonable size, mine was modern in outlook and the bathroom was very clean and the shower very good. We enjoyed the included breakfast both mornings, we ate once in the afternoon and was surprised by the speed and quality of the food. The hotel seems very popular with locals to eat for lunch and dinner, which is always a good sign. The bar in the evening was quiet, although we always returned pretty late so it might of been livelier early in the evening.

The rooms including breakfast room, bedrooms, gardens and bar areas were all spotlessly clean. The WWI memorabilia in the lobby and stair wells was well presented and interesting.
