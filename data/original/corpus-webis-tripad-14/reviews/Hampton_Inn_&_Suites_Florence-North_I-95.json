Breakfast was a cut above their closest competitor but not worth the additional $35. The room was no different than less expensive competitors. The Cleanliness, Service and Room Conditions did not measure up to the higher cost. I cannot give a high rating for clean tables when they are no cleaner than less expensive hotels. When I have to wipe the crumbs and syrup off the table before I use it, I'm not happy unless I'm paying bargain rates. I tried to explain this to the staff in an Internet survey I was requested to take. After three email exchanges, he was still insulted that I expected more for the extra money.
