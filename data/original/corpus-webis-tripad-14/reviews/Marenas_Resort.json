I was very pleased with the location, as it was quiet and more residential. (I'm not that old, but was very happy to avoid a place that was noisy/party scene all night, esp since I was there for work.) As a Starwood Gold member, was upgraded to a 1BR suite at no charge. Nice room - well equipped with full kitchen, large American-type fridge/freezer, washer/dryer, separate bedroom, and large bathroom. (Bring your own detergent for the clothes washer.) Housekeeping did an excellent job, and when I met one of the ladies as she was cleaning my room we had a nice chat. The terrace faced South, so look left and see the Atlantic, look right and see the Intracoastal. Beach itself is very nice and clean with soft sand. The lounge chairs were set up with with cushions and towelling covers, and there were umbrellas as well when it was not too windy. The pool area is more of a backyard-size, but this was not a priority for me as the beach is sooo good. As most of my trip was convention-related, I did not dine in the hotel except for one room service dinner on the night I arrived from London. The pasta was quite good, order was taken promptly and they promised \"within 30 minutes\" - my dinner arrived in 20 minutes, a pleasant surprise.", "title": "Good beach, location away from SoBe scene (good for me)", "user": "SW10UK", "date": "July 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 18421076, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Comfortable room with great beach views.", "disliked": "\u2014 Having to work instead of going to the beach..."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Did not have time to try the spa (sadly). The mandatory resort fee is common at all beach-side area hotels in the US which I have been to, so not a surprise. Valet-only parking is consistent with area prices (not cheap), but the attendants were quick to fetch the car and pleasant. Note that if you drive to the hotel, the turn-in is tricky - the town of Sunny Isles Beach does not allow the hotel to have good signposting. If you are coming northbound on Collins, you can turn right into the hotel just north of the Trump property and another residential complex (but before the highway overpass). The drive goes basically straight up, as the valet court is above ground level. Coming south, you will either come down the exit ramp from 192nd St or down Collins. You will have to go past the hotel, then make a u-turn. This would be at the SECOND left turning lane after the overpass/exit ramp. To walk to the Publix grocery, go out the hotel and turn left (south).

We were traveling with our three children so was worried about the size of the standard room. The front desk said we could upgrade to a one bedroom suite for another $75 a night I was hesitant so she called her manager over and I informed her we were there for my birthday so she said we could have it for $40 more a night wich I gladly accepted. The decision was a very good one as the full kitchen was put to good use over the 10 days, very nice granite with stainless steel appliances. Beautiful ocean views from balcony in room 1603. So many colors of blue we all agreed it was prettier water than in cancun. It was an easy 2 block walk from the publix with full handfulls of groceries. The first day had waves in the ocean with a flag out for rip current but every other day was like standing in a swimming pool the water was so clear and calm. A few very comfortable beach beds were available first come first serve basis. We were almost always able to get one at 1030 am. The beach chairs and umbrellas were nice too. Pool bar made great drinks but very pricey $25.40 every time after gratuity added in for two drinks so we got a blender at publix and rum at a liquor store three blocks away. The BICE restaraunt was exceptional both service and the food so were only able to eat there twice. Aventura mall $10 cab ride away is a very nice mall for a rainy afternoon. South beach can be reached by bus from The S line bus that stops right in front of the hotel, took about 50 minutes. South beach had deteriorated since the last time we had been there. Many homeless and a strong smell of urine at every alley. Took a cab back as it was very late $40. We were all lad to be back at Le Meridien so clean and safe feeling, hotel always smelled wonderful and the ambience was very relaxing. enjoyed the relaxing sounds they had in the elevators. All in all this is our favorite destination in the U.S. The kids even liked it better than Iberostar Parisio in Playa Del Carmen. The only place that my wife and I have enjoyed more was Grand Lido Negril but it is hard to compare all inclusives to hotels. We actually lost weight this trip as opposed to feeling obligated to eat your moneys worth at an all inclusive.
