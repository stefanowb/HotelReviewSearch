Greeted well on arrival and our car whisked away for valet parking (not cheap but not much more than 24 hours in an NCP and saves the hassle). We had a standard room, at the back of the hotel - views not great but room was excellent. Modern, clean lines with high-end fittings including Nespresso type coffee-maker. There was another wedding on the day we arrived and when we got back from dinner a band was in full swing which we could hear from across the street as we approached the hotel which worried us. However, once in our room all was silent! Great soundproofing! A wonderful night's sleep in a huge bed with crisp white linen - just what you want. Breakfasts are great too - our rate included full buffet style brekkie which was all fresh and hot. Staff were all very friendly and attentive. The actual wedding reception was great too - all very well run. There is a gym but we didn't use it so cannot comment on that.
