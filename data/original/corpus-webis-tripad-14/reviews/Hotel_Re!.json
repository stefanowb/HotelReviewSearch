We booked like a month ago, and on check in got only single bed instead of queen one; apparently only given on availability. The good thing is that eventhough it was was early, we got out room. .... A super tiny room, i think the 712 was the left over space but still need to fit in a room to maximise the hotel. The shower cubicle had curtain instead of door, just give you the impression of the those really really cheap hotel on the street, the shower head holder was broken and fixed by amateur with a rusty screw, but still not holding the shower head at all(they fixed it properly when complained tho), the curtain was useless. A huge lack of ammenities and since we stayed there before, we asked for them and the obvious reply, we do not provide this,(not sure if that was the training buzz word) to get rid of you.", "title": "Poor staff-great manager", "user": "Davidcsk", "date": "August 6, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 36853660}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The next day, we took the shuttle bus to orchard road, took us 55 mins to get there, a trip worth 20-30 mins.
