This Riad is perfectly located for a walk to busy Medina souks but it is surprisingly quite once you enter the door of the riad. Service is perfect, everyone is so friendly, from the reception, restaurant, driver and the private tour guide. Whole riad is so beautifully decorated with a warm touch in every corner, including our room 7, only rooftop terrace restaurant is not so special, as if was forgotten - still the view and the sphere at the rest of the terrace is fabulous. We had wonderful spa arrangement, hammam and massage, highly recommended.

We were welcomed into the beautiful Riad by Karima who helped make our stay so enjoyable. The accomodations were elegant and extremely comfortable and the meals were excellent. We could not be happier. Our room (number 16) was spacious and the bathroom large and stylish. It is wise to hire their driver to pick you up at the airport and also to arrange a tour guide to take you around the streets of Marrakech. Our guide was Ali and he was fantastic.

My travel companion and I are both in the design world (New York and Hamptons), and both agreed that the decor at El Fenn was outstanding and reflective of the fantastic color and flavor of the city, yet also extremely serene and comfortable. I stayed in several of the rooms and would highly recommend the Colonnade rooms, which were all exquisite. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and it is important to note that El Fenn is very close to one of the main roads with taxi stands - so no walking and winding through long dark alley-ways at night. Dining on the rooftop offered a wonderful view of the mountains, rooftops and mosque and the food was very good.

Things start late enough during ramadan so that your day is very long so you can actually enjoy the breakfast, pool etc without being in a hurry to exit.

It was 2002 when Vanessa Branson and Howell James walked into the almost ruined courtyard of one of Marrakech's formerly great private homes. Nearing dusk and with the sound of the muezzin's call to prayer echoing in the air, they instantly fell in love with the atmospheric house which was being sold with three smaller neighbouring homes. They soon realised that their holiday home was going to become so much more.At the time, only a handful of Marrakech's riads had been converted to small hotels and Vanessa and Howell knew they wanted to open a place offering something different \u2013 a home from home retreat that combined great food and service with the spirit of the building's past and a contemporary decorative twist. During a two-year renovation, local craftsman used traditional techniques to breathe new life into the building. Polished lime plastering was used in a rainbow of colours to create walls, baths and bed frames, original tiling was renovated and carved cedar ceilings restored. Retro furniture sourced from local flea markets was combined with one-off bespoke pieces to create a unique interior."}
