The rooms are spacious (especially compared to other Japanese hotels) with great views of the city. There is an underground tunnel connecting the Nishi Shinjuku station to the hotel; however, it's a several-block walk underground through a near-empty section of the subway. The underground connection is certainly nice, but don't expect the convenience of dashing straight onto the train or walking immediately into a busy section of the station. The Hilton has a free shuttle bus to the Shinjuku station but if you just miss the bus on the half hour, it can feel like a wait when you're anxious to get out exploring the city or waiting to get back to your room after a long day. We had an early morning departure flight and had timed out exactly how long we needed to get to the subway and to Tokyo station to catch the NEX so we were frustrated to find out that the underground connection to the subway was closed in the morning (there were no signs posted about the times and no one could really tell us what time everything opened). There's not much immediately around the hotel - the Hyatt is across the street, as is a Denny's (?!?), but after a fifteen-minute walk around the hotel we gave up looking for an interesting neighborhood and hopped the shuttle to Shinjuku. One of my pet peeves is paying for wifi - (we knew this when we booked so I can't complain too much!) but the reason I mention it is that we really relied on the internet a LOT on our Tokyo trip for subway routes, restaurants, etc., and so the daily room wifi charge added up. Overall, the Hilton met our expectations - great room with excellent service. We were aware of the \"cons\" I've mentioned above when we booked and after staying at a few hotels in Japan with very small rooms, we wanted the view and comfort that we knew Hilton could offer. However, our travel style is most suited to hotels that are steps from the subway and/or in a neighborhood that is fun to explore. We tend not to spend too much time in our actual room and eat only maybe 1-2 meals at the hotel during our trip. We have no complaints about the Tokyo Hilton (the service really was excellent), but we will probably not stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo. Our bottom line is that we're willing to stay in a smaller room and experience some language barriers during check-in if we're in a more convenient location to explore the city.", "title": "Meets Expectations", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "guampanda", "date": "February 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 152232333}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012", "text": "We stayed at the Hilton, Tokyo over Christmas and New Years 2012-2013.", "title": "Great location, awesome breakfast, no wifi in rooms!", "user": "Texcoco79", "date": "February 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 151961252}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013", "text": "As we were travelling with 2 young children, location was very important for us.", "title": "Great Stay for holiday", "user": "Cotpc", "date": "February 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 151948089}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The Hilton Tokyo is connected to the subway station Nishi Shinyuku, making it very conveninent to get on / off tge subway and go to wherever you need to go!", "title": "Average business hotel", "user": "Braddockrd", "date": "February 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 151860163}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013", "text": "If the difference between the Mandarin Oriental and the Hilton Tokyo is a half a star there is something drastically wrong with the way things are rated.", "title": "This is definitely NOT a 4.5 star hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AmandaG55", "date": "February 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 151851568}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled solo", "text": "The overall check in process was fine until what we were told was an upgrade to a better room (because of our gold status) was actually a downgrade.
