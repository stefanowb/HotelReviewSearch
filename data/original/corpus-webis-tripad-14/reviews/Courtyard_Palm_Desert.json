The hotel greeted with a welcoming front clerk. Check-in lasted a whole four minutes. After dropping off our stuff in the room, we headed to the Rancho Mirage, which is a shopping center with restaurants such as Cheesecake Factory and P.F. Chang\u2019s. Because of the hot weather, I got a cone of Chunk Monkey from Ben & Jerry\u2019s. Then we found an air conditioned Borders to relax and read in. After getting ready, we headed for my 7pm reservation at Cliffhouse. We had a $100 gift certificate that we won in a basketball shooting contest. We started off with 2 appetizers, crispy Calamari with jalape\u00f1o dipping sauce and Corn Fritters \u201cOscar Style.\u201d The calamari was tender and not like other calamari you would find at places such as Yardhouse. The Corn Fritters, which consisted of blue crab, asparagus, and b\u00e9arnaise, were small but delicious. I also ordered the Fischerman\u2019s Chowder, which tasted like any other clam chowder but had an extraordinary spice to it. For the entrees, my girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon, which was cooked to medium rare and was super tender. It came with mashed potatoes as well as green beans. I ordered the special, which was the Halibut. It included rice and green beans. The total bill came out to $92, so I guess we did a pretty good job of getting close to $100 without going over. Also, I do not suggest going to this place unless you are willing to spend a hefty dollar because I know that I will not be going back unless I get another certificate.
