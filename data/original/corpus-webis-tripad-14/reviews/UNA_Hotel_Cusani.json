I noted that the towels are not terrific and they did not provide washcloths. The room was very clean and I found the bed and bedding fresh and comfortable. I should note that the bed is firm which is to my taste. Since I am a shopper I loved the location which was about 5 blocks from MonteNapoleone and the fashion district.
