We needn't have worried however, we were in the hands of a real pro and within minutes of arriving, Dr Joseph Pooppally had admonished our absolutely insane taxi driver for overcharging us, swept us inside, offered us tea and given us the low-down on his home. Dr Joseph is in his 70's but thanks to a strict vegetarian diet and daily yoga for many years, is as spritely as most 50 year olds - he is also a mine of information on everything from local politics to where to book a boat trip. His home is beautiful - over 100 years old and built in the traditional Kerelan style with lots of wood. The guests are lodged in equally old bungalows on the waterfront a small distance from the house so we had some privacy and would while away the evenings before dinner reading and watching the water traffic chug past. Dinner was sumptous and varied every night - Dr joseph's wife is a quiet and kindly lady who just happens to be a superb cook. We also found it interesting to chat to the other guests as we all ate together and the conversation flowed apace aided by Dr Joseph's homemade Nutmeg wine! We didn't have time to do a boat trip as well so but Dr Joseph arranged for a 2 hr trip in a smaller motor boat that took us down some tiny backwaters where we got to see much, much more than if we'd been on a big rice barge. I feel if you want a genuine homestay right on the backwaters then this is the real deal.

Dr Joseph is exceptionally kind and warm-hearted, and we were very well looked after. It is worth coming here for the food alone - it's incredible! The only downside (if you could call it that!) is that the amount of food prepared for us was way more than we could possibly eat, and we did feel bad that we couldn't do it justice. We stayed two nights, and would highly recommend it for a relaxing break.

The location is exceptional right on the banks of a wide river with lots of interesting wildlife to watch including kingfishers and various birds of prey. I took the local ferry into Alleppey, which at 6Rs for the 1.5 hour journey is an increditable bargain and great fun. One of the most amazing sights was watching hundreds of ducks with a mind of their own being marshalled up and down the river by 3 men punting in canoes!
