It's practically right in front of the station, so it's very conveniently located. This was the first time I had stayed in an Alpha-1 hotel (it's a small chain). The rooms themselves are fairly standard for business hotels- they're small. They're also a great value. This hotel in particular was quite clean and has some standout amenities that many business hotels don't have. There's actually a large open bath on the top floor, with a pretty good view. At least for the men's side- I do not know if there is a bath of the same size for women. Most of the rooms in the hotel have their own shower, so the open bath is an extra perk.", "title": "Good business hotel conveniently located by the station", "user": "ibmman", "date": "October 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118869938}], "location": {"country": "Japan", "region": "Chubu", "continent": "Asia"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 12, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 0.317073170732, "description": "Parking: 12"}
