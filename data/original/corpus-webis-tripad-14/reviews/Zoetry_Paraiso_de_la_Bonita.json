This is a truly beautiful place visually but not without problems. The worst is management and communication. First our pickup at the airport didn't show for over 40 minutes (Also they don't meet you inside, you have to go outside and look for your name), then when he did show up, we had to share the ride with another couple. So we had no champagne or cool towels described in the other reviews. We talked to other couples and found out some had to wait for over an hour for their ride. When we got to the resort, there was no one there to meet us. After about five minutes someone came to greet us and give us the tour. It really is a very beautiful resort. The suite with the the plunge pool was perfect, except the pool only really gets sun until 1 as does the hotel pool. So you need to get your sun time in early. Also if your booking a suite get a corner one as they get more sunlight on the pool. Ours was named Delhi and was very nice. The marble tub was great but they don't give you bath salts or bubbles for the bath. They also don't sell them in the gift shop. Very strange,,,, to have such a beautiful tub with candles and no bath salts or bubbles. The beach is disgusting,,,, if your going for the beach, cancel. It looks nothing like the website shot. We saw all kinds of garbage (plastic jugs, motor oil containers, shoes, etc) Plus the water is all brown and full of sea weed. There is a John Deer tractor that goes up and down the beach all morning. It doesn't clean the sand but just chomps up the garbage into smaller pieces. I would not walk barefoot on this beach. This is not the place for people who love the beach!!!!! The beach chairs are also plastic and broken. Not what you would expect from this kind of resort and prices. I thought the food was great but the service is TERRIBLE!!!! I think the previous reviewers had great service because the resort wasn't full. The one day they weren't full the service was much better but the rest of the time it was awful. Room Service takes at least a hour to a hour and a half for anything and then they always forget something. One day breakfast just never showed up. The wine tasting was very nice but not the cooking class. The cooking class was just standing around the sushi bar watching him make a sushi roll,,,, hardly what I would call a cooking class with a chief,,,,,LOL. I mean, shouldn't you even cook something? The spa is amazing as was our massages. I heard the resort is under new management so you can't really go by past reviews or all the awards they won as that wining team is gone. We talked to a lot of others couples and everyone seemed to feel the same (One women gave me my review title). The hotel maintenance was amazing, they come right away to fix anything! One last thing, bring lots of singles to tip. Even though they say tipping is included, everyone wants a tip but sadly even if you tip the service doesn't really get any better, they just won't forget to come back, Hopefully.

My only concern here was when we had to eat at Kaax after the 6th day we would have liked to see a second menu, even a rainy day menu so as to try something different. The older waiter even made use feel foolish when on the first day he gave us a look like your going to eat all that and we cut back our order to find we would have been fine. One day we could not even get food as all the bar seats where taken and we had to return to our room and order room service because both restaurants where closed(and we where not the only one's looking for lunch). We where not informed of the daily outing so when we found them on the things to do today sheet we went to sign up. They where all taken and the staff did not say well lets make sure we get you down for the rest, they never told us about then and had to return three times to find out they where all filled. Our daily shopping trip was canceled due to the weather but they had 4 cars owned by the resort and never did the manager offer to drive us in since they never even called the room to tell us the trip had been canceled.

Paraiso de la Bonita was another fabulous resort to add to our list. I do not usually write about our travels. I am adding this blurb to trip advisor because Paraiso de la Bonita\u2019s website is missing very important information that you should know about. There is a man named Charles who lives and works at the resort as a health and wellness professional. Here is his website http://www.thewillssystem.com . I had read about Charles in another review and just knew that I had to meet him. After speaking with him for about 15 minutes, he told us our numbers and how they reveal personality traits about a person. This was very intriguing, because everything he was saying was correct. He knew that I was sensitive, and that I have a hard time letting things go. He knew that I am the kind of person to notice a butterfly behind a crowd of people. Because of his insight, he was easily able to determine how he could help us to manage our health and well being. We set up an appointment and Charles visited our room for about 1 and \u00bd hours. He hooked each of us up to finger clip pulse monitors and connected them to his laptop. He then used this software which enabled us to see our heart beating in real time as well as our breath. Both of us were breathing much faster than what is considered to be healthy. Charles said that most people do not know how to breathe correctly because we are always in a state of fight or flight. He used another interactive program to help us to control our breathing. At the end of our session, both of us showed great improvement when our hearts and breathing were monitored again. It was such a drastic difference that if we implement these practices at home and in our daily lives, we are convinced that we will lead even healthier lives and may even add on an extra 10- 15 years. I would highly recommend taking a few minutes out of your day just to meet Charles. He is an extraordinarily magnetic person who will bring nothing but positive energy your way.", "title": "Art, Romance, Health and Well Being, Exporation, and Fun!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "lisatravelbug", "date": "April 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27829143}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Another thing that you may not know about is the Jungle Place.

We would recommend arranging for a private dinner on the pier. Hector was our server when we arranged for this, and he was delightful. He set up candles and flower petals that lead to the pier, as well as palm branches along the pier. The table was decorated with flowers and at the end of our meal, three guitarists walked out to play just for us. There is a daily boat that leaves from the pier at noon that will take you to Puerto Morelos and returns at 3pm. We would highly recommend taking the sunset cruise on the resort\u2019s private Catamaran. If you have time, you can arrange to go on a private snorkeling trip with Saul. The resort is located right next to the second largest barrier reef in the world, the second being in Australia.
