The bed was very comfortable.The desk clerk was helpful and friendly and there was valet service which we appreciated since we drove into New York. We were very near the U.N. and a charming little park called Tudor Village within walking distance. If you open the window and lean out a bit you can see the Chrysler building. We were in comfortable walking distance to Grand Central Station, which is convenient if you plan to ride the subway. With so much to do and see in NY you will not want to spend much time in your room, so this hotel is more than adequate.I should mention that the rate was much lower due to the fact that we stayed on a Sunday night.

It's central-ish, for a mid-priced hotel (on 2nd/44th, I think) - quite nice views of red-brick high-rises and slight views of the water beyond. It's possible some rooms are bigger, so check before you book, as my room was TINY! And my colleague could hardly get his door open, so he moved the chair and table to outside his room into the (also v small) corridor so that he could get in with his case! As it was, when I opened my door, it banged against the table with the T.V. on it, and the same problem, I couldn't open my door fully as the table was in the way! There was also a little writing table, and a chair, which left virtually no room for anything else... I managed to balance my suitcase on top of the chair, as there was literally nowhere else left to put it. The bathroom was immediately by the bed. It was really the teeniest hotel room I've stayed in in living memory and was much smaller than my bedroom at home, ditto the ensuite!! Which was sort of funny in a way, but I don't think it's suitable for more than one night or for two people, or anyone of a larger build. Definitely ask room sizes if you book here and see if they have anything normal!!! Also, as another reviewer has mentioned, the light switches were very bizarre and I certainly couldn't work out how they worked the entire time I was there. Also same for the a/c, which remained on \"freezing\" setting despite all attempts to warm it up. Luckily, the hotel provided an extra blanket in the wardrobe, which I was grateful for as it was so cold in my room. On the plus side, it was fairly quiet. Everything seemed very pristine and clean, new bathroom, and furniture looked new. The reception staff were also nice. But I cannot give it a high rating as I felt the room was ridiculously small and it was freezing (whilst pleasantly warm outside, I should add!).", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "kimski44", "date": "September 14, 2012", "id": 140282099}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions for business and pleasure.

The stay was pleasant, the staff fairly nice (for NYC standards), and rooms were clean (although in need of a more in-depth refurb). From what I understand the hotel only joined the Hilton portfolio not too long ago and it shows. It seems that all they did with the rooms was stick in Hilton-standard beds and TVs. There are for example power sockets next to the bed about a meter up from the floor but without a table to put anything on.
