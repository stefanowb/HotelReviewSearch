The staff in both the Terrace and middle restaurants were warm and friendly so, although I was sat by myself for dinner, breakfast and lunch, I felt really comfortable with eating alone. There was the option offered to join fellow guests who were staying on their own, at a special 'Champneys' table had I wanted to. I have a dairy intolerance and the menu's were clearly marked to help me with ingredients. There was no suitable dessert after dinner but the chef made the effort to make me a special dish which was much better than the usual treatment I get in similar situations. I had a full body massage, thalassotherapy and cut & blow dry and for each treatment the staff were great - friendly without being intrusive, knowledgeable and offered a great service. Although I was only staying for one night, I really felt like I had been away for a longer break, as I was so relaxed and pampered!
