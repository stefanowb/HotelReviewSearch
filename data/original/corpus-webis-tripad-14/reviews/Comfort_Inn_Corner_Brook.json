It would need some renos in the rooms but that being said, it is very clean, no issue there. This is one of the few locations of te chain in the Maritimes that does not offer the Continental breakfast, free wifi is available though. There is a Jungle Jim restaurant attached to the hotel so you can get breakfast there but remember that it adds to the price of the stay. Staff is great, location is also good if you have to stop on the way somewhere, right off the highway, no need to go in the middle of town. The only negative is the sleep quality, mattress is very hard and not as comfortable as other Comfort Inn.", "title": "Regular Comfort Inn - Good stay", "user": "boisverf", "date": "November 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144973477}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Clean room and friendly staff made this one night stay pleasant.

It is very near a McDonalds and small mall. It is a small hotel and the staff is small, I arrived at the same time as other people which meant it took a little while to check in. Many people expect to be able to walk in to this hotel without a reservation, however, a conference for 500 was in town when I stayed there which meant the hotel was fully booked. Restaurant attached which serves decent family fare. Room was very dated, clean but stuck in the 80s, bedspread pilly and worn, some stains on the desk chair, etc. Seeing the key entry, I went out an outside door thinking I could walk around, when I turned to get back in, on closer inspection the guts were hauled out of it and I couldn't get back in! There is no elevator. You can open doors on the first floor and sit outside, which creates some noise on the city facing side, although people seem to like the view.
