Just prior to travelling down I read some of the recent reviews. I didn't come across any staff who were anything other than delightful and professional. We were made very welcome. The food on both nights was excellent and the service good. It was wonderful to have the opportunity to dress for dinner, especially on the Saturday (dance night). No TV, no mobile signal and no internet - wonderful. The views and scenery are spectacular. It's somewhere everyone should visit, if they can, at least once in their life.

We visited Bigbury again this September and my partner surprised me with a Sunday lunch reservation on the11th. We both felt we were made to feel special straight away - we found Gary -(I think Irish) bar man friendly, funny and patient as I couldn't make up my mind what to drink. Also waitress (didn't catch name but my partner thought she may be French) again very attentive and friendly. For the first 15minutes I was overwhelmed as the atmosphere of the hotel is different to anything I have experienced. You are certainly not rushed and my partner had to reassure me that we were there for the afternoon and to relax, take in the picturesque views, the decor etc. After calming down we wandered around the grounds. The views from the hotel are stunning. I have an interest in the Art Deco era so I felt the hotel didn't disappoint - very unique and I felt confident to mooch around. We were given time without hassle to choose from the menu which I found hard - the choice was excellent. The table we were given was superb - the view was fantastic. When our food arrived it looked good and was of excellent quality. My only doubt was my partner was thinking the portion size was too small but the complete opposite - he did not ask for anymore food all day - looks are deceiving! For us the visit was for no special occasion apart from my partner wanted to treat me and cure my curiosity and the hotel definitely lived up its reputation. We have agreed we will definitely visit hotel again and maybe be book a room for the whole experience that the Burgh Island Hotel has to offer.", "title": "Sunday Lunch at Burgh Island Hotel", "user": "louise p", "date": "September 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 118279897}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband surprised me with a stay at Burgh Island Hotel for my 50th. I love Art Deco and was not disappointed with the hotel and grounds. Because of the authenticity of the hotel the frayed edges can be overlooked. We are seasoned travellers and must say that the location is undeniably one of the best we have been in. We stayed in the Beach house with stunning views over the bay but had it not been a surprise I would have preferred to stay in the main hotel as I found the beach house very over priced. The views were exceptional but not for the price! The bed was too small and as the beach house decor was not authentic there is no reason why a king size could not replace the double.

For the price of the beach house we would have appreciated some fruit and perhaps sparkling water or even a small bottle of wine as a welcome and even a note of welcome..... something to reflect the tarriff. Even the most basic of hotels offer biscuits with their tea and coffee. The coffee and tea were in cannisters and there was no choice or selection. Once again did not reflect the tarriff. Talking about \"little extras\" we arrived after a long journey from London and a welcome drink at Reception would have been appreciated (it did not have to be alcoholic). Many hotels with these tarriffs offer a fruit cocktail and a hot towel whilst you sign in. We were asked by a member of staff if it was a special occasion and when I said it was for my 50th I thought they would have offered a small gift. We have stayed in hotels around the world on many special occasions and have had toiletries wrapped as a gift, a bottle of champagne and fruit, small hand wrapped chocolates.....
