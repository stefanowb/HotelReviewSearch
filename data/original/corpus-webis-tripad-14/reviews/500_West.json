But that presence is the same for the Weston on the next block as well as the Sofia and US Grant a little further down on Broadway. Hey, if you are worried about the transients and drug use - on the other side of Broadway from the US Grant at the Horton Plaza, you an watch their activities.

Learn to observe and be respectful of others and you'll be fine. The shared bathrooms did get overcrowded at times and a long wait, but it was Comicon time and so the place was packed. If you want luxury, go across the street to the Westin and spend $200 more a night. Only recommended for solo travellers as the rooms are about the size of a large closet. Cute little TV set and a closet and table. Even a bible in the drawer.

The hotel is pretty clean, the gym is very big (5$ per visit), the restaurant has great breakfasts and lunches. All in all, it's very good value for money. You don't pay much, and that's why you get the tiny room and shared bathroom. But if you can live with that, the rest is pretty good. If you're looking for nice, cozy, don't go there.
