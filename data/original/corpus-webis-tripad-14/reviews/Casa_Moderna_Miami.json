Location was not bad, although you are about a 15-20 minute drive from south beach, you didn't feel disconnected from everything. You're located right next to American Airlines Arena and the Bayside shopping and restaurant area. The hotel itself is very clean and modern. We only stayed for one night and the beds were super comfortable. Only mishap is they only provide valet parking. It was $32.00 dollars and that price was charged to the room. It is for unlimited/24 hour service. Being that we only stayed one night, Idk if it's for your whole stay or per day price. Be prepared if you are traveling with other people, other than your immediate family, the bathroom is open to the whole room. Meaning no doors. The only separation between the toilet and room is a frosted glass door. Other than that, the rooms are super clean. Front desk were very accommodating. I do recommend! The only reason I state in the title \"you get what you pay for\" is because of the per night rate ($150.00+), a lil more than I would pay normally, but because I split the cost with my friend, it wasn't too bad.", "title": "You get what you pay for!", "user": "Carmensooki", "date": "April 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 157221903}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were in Miami over the weekend starting April 5, 2013 and I was initially struck by the newness of Casa Moderna.

The attentive staff addressed us by name, the car was brought forth promptly and most important of all, even in such a high energy location our little world was remarkably peaceful.

Clean, well designed, beautiful view, walk in closet, soaking tub next to your shower, etc...etc... One of the best jobs I've seen! New, modern, well thought out suites! Killer beds! Restaurant was hot! Like the ac was broke. One breakfast was enough for us. Food was good but temp was uncomfortable. Pool was cold yet they claim it was heated. We soaked in the not so hot hot tub. The other hot tub was hot! Towel service at the pool was a joke! Management must have a budget issue as they can't seem to keep clean towels at the pool.
