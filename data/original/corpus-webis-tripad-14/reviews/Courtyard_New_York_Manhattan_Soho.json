The room was very clean; the bathroom was adequate. the TV was nice. It was just too small. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but if both of us were in the room, one of us needed to be in the bed (unless the other person was in the bathroom). I also picked this location because of it's proximity to Greenwich Village. It is true that Greenwich Village is about six or seven blocks away. However, the hotel is also on the \"final glidepath\" to the Holland tunnel. What this means is if the traffic is backed up in the Holland tunnel, it can take you 45 minutes to travel the last three blocks to your hotel. It also presents a problem when trying to check out. Overall, I would rate this as a fairly serious problem (I parked four blocks away.
