We didn't book, were fortunate enough to just ask when we got there and find one room left - it must have been waiting for us. There was a bit of a panic when we had to back into Advocate Harbour for some cash (no phone lines at the lighthouse so cash only) to find the ATM not working! However the lovely people in the petrol station gave us cashback. So back down the windy dirt track to the lighthouse and we were set for the night. The food was wonderful, the setting divine.....I loved it all - watching the sunset, looking at the stars, getting bitten to pieces by mosquitos, but hey, still had to be done.

Add to that Darcy's excellent cooking and the charming personalities of Darcy, Jack and Marie, and you have a real winner.
