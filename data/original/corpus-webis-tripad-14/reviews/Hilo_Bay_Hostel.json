The staff were friendly and unobtrusive, they immediately responded to any requests. We had a private room- this is a bargain if you are not traveling alone. We liked the location and easily walked to the Farmers Market- a don't miss on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The Tsunami Museum is just down the street and is inexpensive and interesting. I recommend this hostel for all ages. I am 48 and my mother 75. Other guests ranged in age from 20's to 70's and everyone seemed to fit.
