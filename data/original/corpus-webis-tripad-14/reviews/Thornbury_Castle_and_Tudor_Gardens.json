The location is fabulous with lovely grounds to explore and next to a beautiful Church. The welcome was very friendly and efficient and made it special right from the start. We stopped in the Duke's Bedchamber where Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed which is a fantastic room, spacious, spotlessly clean, well equipped, good selection of toiletries, bottled water and a decanter of sherry. Tea/coffee facilities in the room would have been nice but these can be ordered when you arrive. What an experience to think that you are stopping in the very room that they stayed in. Had dinner and the only fault there was that it did take them a very long time to take our order. Having said that this was the only hitch in an otherwise perfect weekend. The food was superb, the dining area intimate and the standard of service faultless. When we returned to our bedroom the bed had been turned down, a chocolate left on each bedside table and the empty water bottles replaced. The fire was also very welcome in the room and lovely to sit in front of and relax before bed. Breakfast was excellent, good choice and served quickly.

I had crisp belly pork to start, filet steak and cheese to finish. All local produce and cooked to perfection. The meals are not huge, but the food is rich, delicious and satisfying. The wines on offer are expensive but even the cheapest bottle (\u00a328) was a really enjoyable Bordeaux which complimented the meal. Also on offer were local ales and wine produced on the estate from the vineyard.", "title": "Breathtaking Thornbury Castle", "user": "frescaMountAiry_Md", "date": "March 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14548616, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The setting, and comfort - beds are very comfortable, with lots of great pillows", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything was all that I expected and more."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a truely luxorious hotel which would be ideal for a romantic weekend or wedding night/location.
