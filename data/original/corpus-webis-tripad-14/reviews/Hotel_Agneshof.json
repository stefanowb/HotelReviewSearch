We were there in July and it was very hot so we had to keep the windows open because the heat in the room was unbereable. The room faced the street so we could hear all of the noise from traffic and passers by. It was a quiet street but there were still some people making noise out there. Very early in the morning some trash trucks passed by at least twice and woke us up. To add to things the room was next to the elevator so we could hear it moving and the doors opening and closing. We also realised that the shower drain was clogged and informed the reception about this, the girl there did not understand what we were talking about and made no effort to try to help us. We had to shower with the water almost over flowing because of the clogg. When we complained again at the reception the girl seemed to understand our complains about the noise when my husband explained our problems in German. We were then assigned another room (this was our second day there) but the did not help us to carry our luggage to our new room and were left to do it alone. The new room was not as noisy but the bathroom was not clean, it had hairs from the previous guests and the wall behind the toilet was splashed with drops of urine. We also asked for a fan because the weather was so warm for us but they said they could not provide us with any even though we saw they had one at the reception. The reception area itself was welcoming and clean and the garden very nice. The breakfast was generous and the lady who served it was very nice. The hotel does have a computer with internet access for the guests to use for free so that was a plus. It's also located very near the Haputmarkt. Most of the male reception employees were very accomodating. We would not stay at this location again.", "title": "Not such a good experience", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "TjLaura", "date": "July 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5490608, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Free Internet access", "disliked": "\u2014 Room was not clean"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "Stayed at the Agneshof for four nights over Easter.The hotel is attractively furnished in a modern style and the staff charming and extremely helpful.Having seen one of the superior rooms I wouldn't say that it was worth the extra money.

The room wasn't huge, but the clean lines of the layout meant that this wasn't an issue. Excellent and varied breakfast. In the heart of the old town, very close to the markets, churches, castle, the Durer house and a collection of assorted and very good restaurants and bars.
