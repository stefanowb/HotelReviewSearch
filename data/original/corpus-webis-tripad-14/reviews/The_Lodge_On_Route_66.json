The next day we were on our way to Las Vegas, so it was a great location. I read all the great reviews of this property and knew right away this was the place to stay in Williams. We were not disappointed. During our week long Sedona-Flagstaff-Grand Canyon-Las Vegas trip, we stayed at a total of 6 different hotels. This by far was our favorite. We booked the Lincoln Room, #18. You walk into the room and have a couch and 2 chairs, plus flat screen TV on a stand, a dining table with 4 chairs, a mini fridge & micro, an L shaped counter with coffee maker, and storage space. Through an arch way is the separate queen bed, and through another arch way is the double vanity. The commode and tub/shower are in a separate room off of the vanity room. Loved the double vanity! That meant my husband and I could share sink space and not be in each others way. The bed and pillows super comfy, loved the sleeping bag at the end of the bed, and my only real complaint is the air was a tad noisy, but not enough to keep me awake. The room was clean, clean, clean. The towels and bath amenities also fantastic. We paid more for this room than any other room along the way, but it was worth it. The property itself is small, which is really nice, and the grounds are kept up. There is a small patio in the middle of the property to sit out on nice nights as well. The check in and out process was easy and fast. We walked along the streets of Williams, stopping at a few Rt 66 memorabilia shops and had a bite to eat before hanging out watching TV in our room. I would definitely recommend and would stay again if given the chance.", "title": "Fantastic Place!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NinaMarie19", "date": "October 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141879032}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The Lodge was a perfect stop for our 1 night stay on our way to the Grand Canyon.

I feel like the pictures they show on their website are a little misguiding. We had a room with 2 queen beds that was very cramped and barely had room to put our suitcases down without having to walk over them.
