We took the train from the airport and got to the hotel really easily. The main train station (near the university) was a good 15 mins walk away however if your bags are easy to carry its fine (if not get a taxi however I didnt see any at the station so im not sure how easy it is to hail one down). What can I say- this hotel was great. The hotel had really nice clean big rooms with a great vew of the city if you are on the top floors. Staff are friendly and give you good advice of how to get the best out of your stay in Milan. The hotel is also very good value for money considering how nice it is and compared to the other hotels in Milan. Breakfast is also very good with a wide selection of hot and cold food (inc english breakfast) and is open until 11am at weekends.The location is not central however you can get to town very easily eaither by tram or train. The train station is 5 mins walk (Villapizzone) and its 5 stops to town. The tram takes aprox 25 mins to Duomo (lovely catherdral in the centre of Milan and also very close to all the shops!) and the tram stop is really close by. The sales are all on in July so we also had a days shopping and got some good bargains ( hight street not designer). We also went to lake Como for the day by train and it was 1 hours travel and 4.50 EURO which was fantastic value- I would really reccommend this trip as it was the hightlight of our weekend. We also went out to some bars on sat night near the hotel (ask the hotel reception) 10-15 mins by tram/ 10 EURO in a taxi - it was buzzing and really busy.
