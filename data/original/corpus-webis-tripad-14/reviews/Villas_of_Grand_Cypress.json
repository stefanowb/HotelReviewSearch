The property is lovely and quiet since this is first and foremost a golf resort. The units are very spacious and nicely furnished. The carpet and bedspreads had seen better days, however, and our tiny kitchen was in desperate need of renovation. Our refrigerator needed to be fixed twice during our stay and the enormous microwave looked like it was manufactured in the 70's.

With ages from 77 to less than a year we needed a place that catered to all tastes and needs. The grounds are absolutely georgous and meticulously maintaned, unfortunately we couldn't say the same for the rooms (we had 4 total villas). The toilets ran constantly, the sink stoppers didn't work, the toaster arced and sparked and the general cleanliness was far less than you'd expect for a resort of this caliber. That being said the rooms are large with plenty of room both inside and outside. Our location on the water with views of the golf course was very relaxing and conducive to our nightly cocktail party. The fireplace was great and used each night due to the cool temps with wood supplied generously by the resort. The pool is secluded and quiet with most of the action a shuttle ride away at the main Hyatt resort. The kids gravitated toward the Hyatt side of the resort and loved the game room and the free 9 hole Pitch n' Putt.
