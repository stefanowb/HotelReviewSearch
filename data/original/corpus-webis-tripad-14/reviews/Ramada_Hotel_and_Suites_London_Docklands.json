The hotel is in an excellent location outside Central London, close to the City Airport, the cable car taking you near the O2 Arena, the Excel London, close to the DLR, the nearest tube station being Prince Regent DLR less than a 5 minutes walk in the hotel. There is so much to see and do in the area, with several markets overlooking the Thames River, however they were not open for long enough and were not quite up to adequate standard (in my opinion). The hotel provided spectacular views overlooking the Thames River, the Excel London, O2 Arena and the City Airport. The location, in my opinion, is certainly one of the best in this rejuvenated part of East London which generally seemed safe and secure, particularly considering that the security was easily accessible standing all night! There is so much to see and do in this area, nor is it too crowded or congested like Central London or other parts of London. Excellent for a stroll, particularly when the weather is warm and pleasant in the Summer. Although it is quite a way out of Central London and the nearby City Airport was fairly noisy at times outside the hotel, it really was not a problem for us and it is most certainly an unspoilt and beautiful part of East London fairly nearby to the Stratford Olympic Park which was held in East London last year. The hotel, although not in Inner London, is still fairly central with the Cable Car and DLR running through it being well accessible by the London Underground; it is not only close to Stratford Olympic Village and the O2 Arena, but easily accessible to both North and South London rather well as well as North Circular Road. It certainly would be first choice if not choosing a hotel in Central London. The hotel offers free parking which was excellent, free breakfast and free internet which was very pleasing. There was a fitness centre and bar area in the hotel which was nice, however no swimming pool which was a shame as it really would have been nice to have one in the hotel. The 4 star breakfast was nice considering Ramada's standards of breakfast, not as good as the Hilton or Marriott 4 star, but I was pleasantly surprised with the substantial amount of breakfast that the hotel had on offer. Again, the bar area was nice and typical of a Ramada 4 star, however the menu for the food was rather expensive (as we expected). Again, it was not quite up to the quality of a Marriott or Hilton 4 star bar area, but it was nonetheless decent and more than adequate for us with a large screen TV and lots of nice places to sit and enjoy. However, we ordered fries from the bar areas and they proved to be a bit too expensive (even for 4 star bar prices), moreover, what was slightly irritating was that the fries took a long time to arrive which was a little annoying for us. The staff were mainly pleasant, helpful and polite, but not always, the reception did seem a little reserved at times, but on the whole they were nice, quite friendly and polite. When we asked for directions to the Museum of London Docklands they even showed us on the map pointing it with their pen and explaining everything to us very well, one a little more talkative than the other, but still rather helpful, which was good to see that the service was not all quite that disappointing. Check in and check out at the hotel was quick and efficient. The waiter was very nice, friendly, welcoming and polite which was good and he served us to our table quickly and efficiently which was impressive. The rooms were small and too congested for us, the bedrooms were tight fitted and the mattress seemed relatively easy to slip. The room does have the normal amenities and did not really provide more than the normal necessities, but no more than that really and it was a lot less than we primarily expected and did not live up to our expectations. The shower was adequate, but not really anything decent for a 4 star hotel, I would have liked it have more privacy and a little bigger would have been nicer, but all of the soaps were provided to a very good standard. The service, on the other hand, was disappointing and let this hotel down a lot, unfortunately. We asked for plates and it took over 45 minutes to arrive in the evening when it was relatively quiet, which was annoying and irritating. We also asked for towels and toilet roll on another day and it took over 1 hour and a half to get just the towels and this was also at night when it was relatively quiet so we had to ask them for service twice; on one hand came the towels and then we had to enquire as to why the toilet roll did not come, fortunately another pleasant man when we enquired about this quickly arrived it in our room. On another day we asked for 3 glasses with ice in them in the evening when it was relatively quiet and, again, it took a long time to arrive and again in took over 1 hour and a half to arrive and, despite us not having to ring them again, this was very annoying and irritating for us, especially because this episode had already occurred beforehand. However, it did eventually arrive. The service was not all that bad though as the staff were quite friendly, welcoming, polite and enthusiastic as to help us out with directions - which is why we are marginally giving service 3 stars. All in all, this hotel is in an excellent location and we will still be trying this hotel again if we are looking in the area and we recommend that you do to, despite the fact that the rooms are small and congested, the views and location more than make up for it, although the service does need to improve significantly. One other disappointing thing for us was when we booked this hotel on Hotwire we were told that it is not a standard, only when we realized when we arrived in the hotel that it actually is a standard room, perhaps if you do not book the standard room the rooms will be will be significantly bigger and less congested, therefore I am not going to hold this against the Ramada too much, hopefully presuming that the non-standard rooms are significantly bigger, which is why we are giving the rooms 3 star? I still recommend in trying this hotel again and we hopefully see if they can improve this from our enquiries and I would still recommend this hotel more than any other in the London Docklands area, as not only what I have mentioned above, but you are also close to the Canary Wharf alongside the River Thames and the famous, historic town of Greenwich. We recommend that you give this hotel at least another chance because of this.
