We arranged a taxi transfer from Puerto Montt airport and that was not expensive either. The Solace is a very new hotel and is in a lovely position overlooking the town of Puerto Varas with Volcan Osorno in the background, only a short walk down the hill to the centre and the lake. We had a huge room on the 5th floor. Everything was perfect: an enormous comfortable bed, spotless, crisp bedding, a large ensuite bathroom, sitting area and free wi-fi. The bar and restaurant provide very good food indeed. There is a good choice at breakfast and the evening meal we had during our 3 night stay was exceptional. It was so good, we asked whether the chef had time to speak to us and we congratulated him on his expertise. The staff are helpful and friendly.

It didn't live up to expectations. Our bedroom was modern and spacious (though without the lake view we requested, and it's a bit of a stretch to call it a junior suite) - but there were no drawers at all, and only very limited shelf space. There were not enough hangers and it took 3 phone calls to get some more. We phoned for an iron, but to our amazement were told that they were not able to provide one !! (The other hotels we stayed in during this trip happily provided irons) .The hotel seemed to be managerless during our stay, so there was no decision maker to whom we could complain. There was no hotel/TV guide provided, so we had to flick through about 100 channels, only to discover that there was not a single channel in English - not even CNN or BBC World ! On the plus side, the bathroom was fine and the bed was very comfortable. The buffet breakfast was a bit strange: fine if you like cheescakes or lemon meringue pie, but the hot food wasn't appealing - though to be fair the chef did happily rustle up some fresh scrambled eggs & mushrooms. The hotel has a computer room with free broadband, and is well located on a hill close to the town centre (we can recommend Restaurant La Marca close to the hotel on the way down to town). So, the Solace was a bit of a mixed bag, but, overall, not as good as we expected.", "title": "Pay in dollars", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "IGetAroundALot", "date": "March 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 59644397}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Solace Hotel provides the perfect combination of quiet location and close proximity to the action two blocks away.

Located on a hill 2 blocks from the main downtown area of Puerto Varas, it does not have the views offered by some other hotels closer to the water, but we had a very nice view of the cathedral from our spacious, warm, comfortable room. Arriving at the hotel after a long stressful day traveling was lie a breath of fresh air. Once we got to the room it was like we could once again relax in a comfortable environment. Hotel would best be used as a base for multiple excursions based out of Puerto Varas, all of which the extremely helpful hotel staff will be more than happy to arrange for you. Breakfast is usually included and consists of a buffet with cereal, good fruit, juice, breads, coffee, eggs, some kind of sausage and ham. Americans should find all their breakfast needs met.
