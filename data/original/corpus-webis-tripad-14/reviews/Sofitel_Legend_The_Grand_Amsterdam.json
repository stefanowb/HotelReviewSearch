We took a taxi to hotel from Airport, and arrived late evening, and checked in without issue. When we arrived up at our room, we had been upgraded to the MOST beautiful suite I have ever seen. Beautiful bathroom, fantastic canal view, with HUGE windows. We spent some time in the pool and sauna area, and this was fantastic as on two occasions we were the only people in the fitness complex. Attention to detail was five star, including the towel and linen changes, the refilling of toiletries, and the general demeanour of the staff. The bed was fantastic.. slept for hours, which felt like days!! The location was amazing, just two minutes walk from dam square, and two minutes the other way to RLD. We had a beautiful champagne room service breakfast the morning of his birthday, and the hotel gave us a delft pottery replica of the hotel as a present with our room service filled with sweets!
