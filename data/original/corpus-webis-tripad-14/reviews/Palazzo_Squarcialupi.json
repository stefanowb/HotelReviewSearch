The hotel is absolutely beautiful, beautifully decorated, really managing to hold on to the history of the Palace but at the same time providing all the modern amenities that you need, air con, wifi etc. They have recently replaced the mattresses on the beds and they are incredibly comfortable. We have got to know Irene in the hotel over the years and she is an absolute star, nothing is too much bother for her and she always goes just that extra wee bit for you. Would happily recommend this hotel to anyone and the rates are very reasonable.

Amazing huge period rooms (we were in 525 I think) renovated recently with exposed beams, a huge bathroom and sofas to lounge around on. The staff were super efficient, (even walking to restaurants to make bookings when the phones were busy!) and really helpful, the pool is small but ideal for cooling off when you get tired of walking around the very nice lttle towns. The added bonus of wine tasting rooms either side of the property is the icing on the cake. We paid \u00a3118 Euros for non-view rooms, I gather the upgrade was worth it, but we spent the extra on the super wines they have on offer. They sell very good local wines at around 12 - 15 Euros a bottle and you can sip the Chianti on the balcony with views over the vineyards. Perfect.
