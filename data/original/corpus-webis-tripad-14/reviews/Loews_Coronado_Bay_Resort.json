The 4 kids LOVED the teen lounge and we could hardly pry them away from there! The Xbox and Guitar Hero were hits and the games were free. We asked for 2 adjoining double bed rooms and were told they don't have these. ? So we were 4 doors down from each other, which was not as good as connecting, but fine. The rooms are huge and the bathroom is gigantic! Our rooms both had the same layout: huge jacuzzi tub, separate stand up shower, plush towels, and plenty of bathroom counter space. Our balconies faced the marina and we had a great view. There was plenty of room in the room. Downside is that we had to pay $10 per day for a mini fridge and it was old and dingy. The linens on the bed were dingy, too, and just didn't seem very new or clean. There was some small debris/trash under the beds and dresser. (Not that I check there when I get to a new room, but my nephew lost a lego!) The resort is far from town and so we spend a lot of time at the resort. The food in the Market Cafe was way overpriced, but tasty. They had a kids buffet every night that the kids loved. Adult entrees were about $15-20. We had the breakfast buffet every morning and it was $9 for kids and $15 for adults. Food was standard. We did play Bingo which was a hotel-sponsored activity and that was fun. Valet parking was $28 a night and we had 2 cars = $250 just to park! Self parking was $22 a day. We all loved the pools, although the family jacuzzi was closed for one day and another day the family pool was shut down. Rumor was a small child had pooped in the pool, so it had ot be disinfected. Not Loew's fault, but still affected our trip. The food by the pool was a good price for the kids meals ($5 each). Our family also went on a gondola ride one evening and that was fun, for $30 per person. Keep in mind that this hotel is 10 mins out of town so you will need to drive to go anywhere. The Internet was $15 in the room but free in the lobby. Go to the lobby! Overall, we had a nice time and the kids loved it. I felt there were a lot of extra and overpriced charges, though.

The bus came back from dinner just before midnight, and the balcony door did nothing to stop the noise. The bus also served as our wake-up call in the morning when the group left - the operator was very consciensous, starting the bus an hour before they boarded, testing all of the hydraulics, brakes, engine, etc. We asked to be moved to another room on day two, and were told that the bus would not be back that evening.

The marina rents bikes, paddle boats, kayaks, wave runners, and you can arrange for gondola and boat rides. EVERY employee we encountered was very nice and personal. We found them to be very kid-friendly and even though some folks had their dogs there, it wasn't a big deal. If you have a car (or rent bikes at the marina), go into Coronado.
