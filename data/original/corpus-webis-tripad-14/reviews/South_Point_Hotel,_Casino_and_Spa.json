About ten minutes later, this housekeeping lady just rushed into our room, her name is Emma (according to her name tag), she did not even knock on the door, she just used her key card and came in, she did not even say hello or anything, the first sentence came out of her mouth was \"What's the problem with the bed? Where are the stains?\" So I showed her the stains and I also mentioned about the hair I found on the pillow, she said the pillows are all fresh and clean. Then she changed our bed sheets with an attitude.

Then without a word to us, she left and slammed our door. I then realized that the small bottle of lotion in our bathroom was almost empty, usually it should be full. So again I went to find Emma, she was just a couple of doors down from our room, before I even opened my mouth, she said to me \"I'm very busy, what do you want?\" I said to her \"Well, obviously I have another enquiry, otherwise I wouldn't be bothering you right now.\" Without even looking at me, she said \"Call downstairs, I'm very busy, don't bother me!\" I couldn't believe her attitude, her attitude went from worse to unbelievably worse!

One postive thing we realized right away is that this hotel is not complicated in its layout, unlike many of the other big resorts that feel like mazes at times. The check-in counter is right near the entrance, and you enter right into the casino. The casino is nice and spacious, well lit, and has an airy and open feel about it. Finding our room was very simple, and not a long hike. Basically thats the way the entire hotel felt. Even though its a big place, everything feels nearby and easy to find. We got a mid-level room.. it was on the 17th floor and provided a good view of the pool and mountains. I would advise others to pay the extra 10$ or so a night and get a room with a good view. As far as the room itself, it was great! Huge and very well decorated. Probably the best room I have ever seen for that price. It had a very large bathroom with the always desired seperate vanity area. No complaints about the room whatsoever. One of the other biggest postives about the south point is their pool. Its not the grandest or most decadent in Vegas by any stretch, but its still very nice. And what made it even greater for me was the lack of crowds. Even on Satruday the pool was at most half full.

One guy almost frightened me he seemed so angry. This is not a knock against the casino itself, just the people they seem to hire. The sportsbook was excellent, but VERY crowded on Sunday for football. Almost impossible to get a seat. And there were hundereds of them. And one more minor complaint is about the shuttle to strip. For some reason it only takes you to Mandalay Bay. Which is great if you are going there or right nearby, but most people end up going to the center strip. So you either had to pay another 10-15$ for cab to take you farther down, or walk the 20-30mins in the heat. We chose the taxi.

A little tip... if you plan to utilize the shuttle going to the sister hotel Barbary Coast, make certain you are out and waiting 30 minutes before departure or you won't get on. These shuttles filled so fast! Also, make sure you check the airport shuttle times from the hotel so you book the best departure time out of Vegas.
