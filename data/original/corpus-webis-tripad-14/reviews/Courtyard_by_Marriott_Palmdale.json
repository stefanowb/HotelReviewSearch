One problem was that we asked for ajoining rooms which we did get, but the doors between the two rooms would only open about 6 inches because there was furniture blocking both of the doors on either side from opening.

Very easy to get to, lots of restaurants and other amenities very close by. Happy hour was nicer than most, because the lobby seating area seems to encourage meeting other people instead of making you feel like you should stick with your own group. Palmdale is a nice town.
