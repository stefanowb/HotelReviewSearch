However, once you enter the hotel you can see that the owners really care for this place and have given it character and a real sense of homeliness. We were on a cycling holiday and our bags had arrived before us and the staff / owners were very friendly and welcoming, and had ensured that our bags had been taken to our rooms, which I thought was a nice touch. Our bikes were locked away behind a metal door within the confines of the hotel. Our room had a balcony, was very clean, had a safe and minibar as well as having it\u2019s own individual character with lovely pictures on the wall. There was also wi-fi internet connection in the room for a fixed price of 5 Euros for our stay.", "title": "A little gem in Tuscany", "user": "Samkirk9", "date": "October 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20815663, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Hotel character, staff/owners, location", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The whole hotel was filled with curios from around the world, but not in a brick-a-brack way, really interesting pieces that you could see had been chosen specifically for the place in which it was on display.
