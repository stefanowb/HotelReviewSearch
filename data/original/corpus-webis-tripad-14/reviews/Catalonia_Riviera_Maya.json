People either forgot about their reservations or just elected not to show up. I would suggest that the hotel start overbooking, so as to allow for all guests to enjoy the restaurant. The only restaurant that actually filled all the tables was the steak place (which is actually the snack bar but with tablecloths.) The steak was very juicy and tender.

This was excellent for us-room 2115 had great air conditioning and, well very basic, was enough for us. The location was perfect-just out the door, down the stairs and 30 steps and we were at the largest pool in the resort. We brought our own one cup coffe maker, coffe and whitener so it was NOT worth $15 per person per night to upgrade for just the difference of a coffee maker and mini fridge. $25 per person per night for the Deluxe room. You do only get two bottles of water per room for your entire stay-so you must refill these daily. A bit frustrating. Especially since the water dispensers are empty frequently and are not kept running in the night-so if you want to fill in the morning you will have warm water. The beds are HARD. But we asked for a bed topper right at check in and they brought these within a short time when they brought the cot for our son. We also might mention that we always stay 2nd floor or above to minimize the bugs that like to crawl under the door at night. The walls are very thin and we had the unfortunate experience one night of listening to a guy beating his wife/girlfriend and another night a group of teenagers (local) destroyed the very same room.
