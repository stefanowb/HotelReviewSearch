The downfall of our trip was a middle of the night illness where we needed to find a hospital, and the front desk staff had no clue where to send us. They finally printed up a map off of a web search that took us the back way towards a hospital through a residential area, and we got completely lost. As my husband said, that is the kind of information that should be right there and very handy for the staff to have. So, not their fault per se, but an awful trip with most of it spent in hospitals. Starbuck's, located in the same parking lot as the hotel, was a godsend. There were shopping and restaurants nearby, though we didn't eat at any. And the highlight of my trip was walking the paths several blocks to Home Depot, where I did some window shopping in the nursery. The geese were fun to see, and they were very friendly to people. All in all The hotel experience was fine, however the room could have been a tad larger with 3 of us staying in it. It was clean, sheets were very soft, and the bed was comfy (since that was where I spent most of my time).", "title": "Worst trip ever, not Marriott's fault", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "QCTrailrider", "date": "March 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4618369}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Typical Courtyard...", "title": "Good value- exceptional cleanliness", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Travel_0002", "date": "July 26, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3700959}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Tigard"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 12, "very good": 26, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 24}, "aka": "Courtyard Portland Tigard Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.3}
