They have a promotion for a long weekend and the price is with 30% discount so the double room costs just 151 euros (without breakfast). The room was very clean and modern furnished. The bed was super comfortable. You can easy to find Ibis hotel if you walk just straight from the square of the Central rail station, where is the main stop of the buses from Malpensa and Orio del Serio (Bergamo) airports. It takes just 10 min walking or you can take a metro (red line) to Porta Venecia station and them just 3 min walking trough via Tunisia, which is on the main shopping street Corso Bueno Aires. You can use metro (red station again) to reach quickly Duomo (just 2 or 3 stops away). The tram stops are very close as well so you have many and easy ways to reach the city center, Cental rail station, shopping areas, sight-seeings and whatever you want to go in Milano. I can't say anything about the free Internet connection or the food and service in the restaurant because I didn't use these facilities but if you're hungry you can find in the area many small nice places for coffee with breakfast, ice-cream, pizza and even Billa supermarket. The only problem I had in the hotel was that sometimes I couldn't open the room door with the card. I saw another customer to have the same problem so it will be good they to change cards time to time or just to check the locking system because it's a bit annoying.", "title": "It's really worth it", "user": "GattaPasso", "date": "September 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 78224113}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I enjoyed my stay in this hotel and if I come back to Milan again, with sure I will stay there.", "title": "Was OK...", "user": "GlobeTrotter933", "date": "August 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 75941626}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I choosed the Ibis Milano Centro after reading comments on Trip Advisor.
