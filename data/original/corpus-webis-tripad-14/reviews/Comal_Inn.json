We stayed in the New Braunfels Cottage and had a blast. Next time we come we will definately bring food and plan to cook there vs. going out every night. Has all the emenities you will need including cookware and a gas grille. Very spacious for my family of 4. Breakfast muffins were excellent however they were gone within the first 5 minutes of our arrival. Only thing is that you are not served a breakfast, but we knew that going in so I'm not going to complain. I like how I was provided with milk and orange juice in the fridge and having small kids that was real convenient. The thing I usually critique most about places I stay is the A/C system.
