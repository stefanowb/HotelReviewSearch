The hostal has a european charm with art wood, and everywhere a nice touch. There is a nice patio, the rooms are clean and have huge windows, often looking towards a small garden and I loved the bathroom (towels included). Thanks for the good breakfast btw. Wifi is great, prices reasonable (12000 for dorm with 5, but you get a luxury version of many others here). Definitly a nice place to explore Santiago, btw also in a good neighbourhood and close to metro.
