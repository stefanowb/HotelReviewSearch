The owner was very nice, and the 24 hour staff was very helpful (those that didn't speak english didn't have any qualms about using google translate to go back and forth with us about needing a taxi to the airport early the next morning.) Restaurant recommendations were good nearby and it was extremely walkable to a lot of great spots in Palermo (we were back in BA later during our trip and wishing we had the same location.)

Best breakfast we had during our stay in Argentina - fresh and varied with plenty of Argentine treats on offer! Small negative - walls are quite thin so we could hear our neighbours occasionally but not enough to disturb us.

Our room was beautiful and spacious, the hotel internet was available to us all the time, the breakfast was delicious, and the kitchen downstairs was at our disposal so storing and reheating food from outside was easy. We cried when we were leaving because the staff truly became our family. This hotel is centrally located in the dining and shopping area of Palermo Soho so was had the chance to walk off all the yummy food in Buenos Aires.
