We were traveling with our service dog, Rags, so it was really important that all 3 of us would be comfortable--and we were!!! The house is lovely, the appointments are just right--not too stuffy, over-doilied or stark and simple. We stayed in Gram's room and she musta been quite a gal because the bed was so comfortable that we forgot to turn the TV on and just lounged around and read as many of the available magazines and great books that were there as we could. This is an unheard of event for my husband. What a delight! we slept the sleep of the tired traveler. Breakfast was hand made--wonderful taste blends of Hatch chilies and maple syrup (yippeee) in an intimate dining room where the 4 tables of guests got to know each other.
