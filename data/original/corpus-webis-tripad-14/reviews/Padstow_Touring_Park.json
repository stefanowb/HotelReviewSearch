It's a nice walk, takes about 20-30minutes depending on how the kids are feeling, worth taking a torch for the journey home, we have been lucky and been able to do the walk in flip flips/ crocs, if its wet may need trainers etc. Wifi availble for a small fee.

The hook up for water was too far from our pitch to run the hose for a constant top up but that was not really a problem as we just filled up on our return after trips out. I am sure we could have moved if we wanted to. On the second morning we discovered that we where on top of a wasp nest.
