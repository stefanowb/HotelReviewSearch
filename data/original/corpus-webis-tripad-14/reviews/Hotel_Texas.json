Fom the time we checked in it was just a mess..... The guy at the front desk was far from polite and acted as if we were a bother to him. We picked up our keys and headed to our room. First off.... the lock on our door was broken, meaning that four single women were going to be in this room with no way to lock the door, either to keep people out or to lock up our belongings while we were out. When entering the room we also noticed that there were no blinds or curtains on the bathroom window..... great for all those \"PEEPING TOMS\" out there !!! The bathroom was tiny and the shower had this pipe sticking out of the ceiling that ran cold water on the one showering. A good cold shower is always nice.....NOT !!! No closet at all.... I guess they think that when traveling you must have NO USE for a place to hang your clothes. During the very short time we were there (about 30 min.) one of us took a shower..... only one of us because when she got out of the shower and was trying to blow dry her hair the breaker blew and we had NO ELECTRICITY!!!We went to the front dest to report the problem and we were told that he could have it fixed the FOLLOWING DAY. We informed him that we had plans for the evening and that we kind of needed it fixed before the next day..... did he care??? NO WAY!!! He did however say that he could put us in a different room but that if we were going to be using the blow dryers that the same thing would happen in the next room too. Again, I guess when traveling you have no need for electricity either !!! We asked for a refund so we could leave and just find another hotel. Mind you, we had been there for no more than 30-45 min. at this point. The guy at the front desk told us that he could not refund the whole amount because of the ONE shower that was taken. He charged us $75 for that one shower!! Maybe this is how they make their money, who knows. This place was horrible from the get-go.

The check-in form asked if we had AARP or AAA which we do, she told us they were too close to the Stockyards area to give discounts. She showed us to our room with two queen beds and we immediately noticed that the light on the ceiling fan did not work. She said it was broken but the lamps worked. (no apology) Parking was on the street. We brought all our bags in, settled in, decided to clean up and found there was no soap, no glasses, and we noticed there were no pillowcases. The bed pillows had shams on them but there actually were no bed pillows. I went back to the lobby and had to knock on her door. She asked what I wanted without opening the door. I told her. She came out frowning and I asked for soap, glasses, and pillowcases. She gave me soap, four plastic cups, and two pillowcases. The next morning, we noticed one of the beds had stains on the sheets. (hopefully these were clean sheets with stains, not dirty sheets.) Also, the doorknob was loose. The next morning we checked out at about 8:00 and there was only cold coffee in the lobby. We had planned to stay two nights but one night's experience was enough.

Some of the descriptions we read referred to the decor as \"authentically western.\" We thought the prices were very reasonable and that it might prove to be a fun little place catering to eccentrics who prefer to stay off the beaten path. Well, let me tell you, it was the worst hotel in which I have ever stayed and that includes trips as a child when my parents opted for the Super 8 and Motel 6 to save money. Please note that three of the four people in my party are well traveled women who have stayed in places where a utilitarian approach to lodging is celebrated. Even those three women had big problems with this place. We arrived to find that two of our three rooms were not ready. The housekeeper was blatantly rude as I approached the door to my room. We then realized that two of has who had paid for separate rooms had been given the key to the same room. The phones didn't work for room-to-room calls, so we had to use our cell phones to schedule activities, sending text messages to stay in touch. We asked to place our bags behind the front desk on the last day of our stay so that we could take in some activities without having to carry our bags around with us. The desk clerk refused to allow it and suggested that we leave them in the lobby all day. The rooms were so poorly appointed as to have made me uncomfortable even thinking about sleeping with the covers pulled up over my body. I would bet my next paycheck that they purchased the draperies and linen from second hand stores. The shower was so small that I had to place my feet one by one outside the shower in front of me to shave my legs. The \"authentically western\" decor amounted to plastic decorative cowboy boots with plastic flowers. For God's sake, they even had fake greenery in the planter located in front of this awful establishment, which puts turning a dishonest buck way out in front of helping to provide a pleasant environment in which the Cowboy Culture, so important to American history, can be experienced.

We were there on a Saturday night and got very little sleep as it was incredibly noisy with returning guests running, shouting, and laughing up and down the corridor throughout the night. The next day the lady on the desk was the antithesis of the young guy the day before. She went out of her way to be as unhelpful and as unfriendly as she could.
