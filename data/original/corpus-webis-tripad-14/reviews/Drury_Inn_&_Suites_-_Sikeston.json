We were there for two nights while I did some family history research. Couldn't beat the price at $99 a night. Check-in was quick and efficient. I had reserved a king deluxe room, but was given a very large handicap access room. The room had a nice LG flatscreen tv. We always appreciate not having to watch tv from the bed, so the lazyboy type chair was a nice touch. The bed was comfortable. The free breakfast in the morning and cocktail hour with appetizers (no need to go out for dinner) were terrific!!

After a long, nervewracking drive in snowy weather, we were very happy to return to this hotel knowing what we would expect - a warm welcome at the front desk and quick check-in. The breakfast consists of hot and cold items, varied selection of pastries, cereals, fruit, etc. No one should leave hungry. The common areas of the hotel and the grounds are kept immaculate. The rooms are spacious and clean; beds are very comfortable. Each room has a small refrigerator, microwave and coffee pot. We stayed again on our trip back through the area and enjoyed their new 5:30pm Kick-back buffet which included free drinks - wine, beer, liquor - and hot appetizers which change daily, a meal in itself. Free internet and long distance are just another bonus.

(our pet room was not a smoking room!) THANK YOU. We stayed there one night, a week apart, each way on our trip. Having dogs, it's hard to go out to eat after driving 8 hours and leave them alone in a hotel room ...with Drurys evening meals and breakfasts it solved our issue. This is the best hotel we've had the pleasure of staying in with our pets. Many other people were swimming with their kids in the pool. The staff was professional and friendly, very clean hotel, and we thought our room was huge! Great bathrooms...sooo clean and new. Very tastefully decorated. Thank you!
