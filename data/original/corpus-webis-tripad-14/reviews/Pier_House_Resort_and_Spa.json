We stayed the weekend between two hurricanes/tropical storms, I spoke with Pier House front desk at least 5 times, about cancellation/rescheduling polices , they were always pleasant and very helpful. The rooms were very clean and very nice only downfall our room was directly above the Chart Room Bar, we were woke up a couple of times around 6 to the workers cleaning up from the night before. It was OK we just finished sleeping it off on the private beach, we never left the beach until sunset. Capn' Dan at the beach bar was great, full of knowledge and made great drinks. We at breakfast and lunch there once, food was very good. Pool and grounds were always very clean and pool and spa stayed open 24 hours, very nice for the late night swim after doing the Duval Crawl. Another plus was location, you couldn't get any closer to the action of Duval St. Overall the Pier House met and exceded all our expectations, we meet many friendly and fun people while there.

We were upgraded since I sent an email to the concierge before we left asking for a ground room because my mother doesn't climb steps very well. There was no problem with that upon check-in. We had a garden room that faced the pool. The room was spacious and neatly appointed. The bathroom was very large, with a nice walk in shower. I can't believe that people complain about the small beach...Key West is not known for it's beaches. I thought that it was a total PLUS that there was a small man made beach at the resort. The attendants were great about setting up chairs and getting towels. You can even snorkel there with lots of colorful fish hanging out near the rocks. My daughter and I did this every day, and we were completely entertained! The pool is VERY WARM (something about solar panels), so in the evening, we would swim there when the beach was closed. The food at the Pier House was very good. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner there over the course of our stay, and the cost was similar to what you find outside the hotel, if not maybe less. Portions were huge and for breakfast, we would share two items between 3 people and still have some left. We ate in the Harbourview Cafe and Beach Bar & Grille, and had room service several times, even one night for dinner when we were tired. We did not use the spa, so I can't comment about that, but free parking is a such a bonus when you are near Mallory Square and Duval Street. And the free internet is also a bonus.
