I'm sure this place is wonderful in summer when using the radiator isn't necessary. But we were kept awake all night long with the pounding sounds of the radiator which never let up (about every 30 seconds) even when it wasn't running. (The inn provided ear plugs but even these couldn't completely block out the hammering sounds the radiator put out. I first thought the noise was someone firing a gun nearby!) When I complained the staff already knew the radiators do that and explained that the sound generally goes away after awhile-no such luck I told them, but they didn't care. (we had the temp. set to 67 degrees) My parents' room had different troubles-the thermostat (placed right next to the bed) made loud hissing sounds when turned above 60 degrees, so they opted for a cold night. Also my parents both said the water temp. in the shower got so hot instantly they both got burned/froze several times during the short showers. When you pay $200/room per night, you expect to get a good night sleep and pretty even water temp. But we were weary and tired until we checked out and into a different and much cheaper hotel. Otherwise the breakfast was pretty good-pancakes and fruit, good coffee. The farm is neat, and my kids got to feed the peacocks and pet the donkeys. The architecture is beautiful and I'm a fan of bed and breakfasts and know this wasn't one of the better ones I've stayed at, but this was my parents first time at a B&B and they don't think they will try one again.

Also saw lots of interesting birds (for those interested, this area, close to the Rio Grande is great for birdlife), and a Coyote. For the obvious reasons, Los Poblanos will always be a special place for us. But the beauty of the property and the service of the staff made that possible.", "user": "rlatuchie", "date": "July 28, 2011", "id": 115925195}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "FABULOUS B and B or wedding destination!", "text": "This property was once a huge farm with lands that ran the gamut of the Albuquerque valley all the way to the mountains. It is now being carefully restored and preserved by the owners and their family members, some of which live and work on site. Organic all the way, the food is outstanding-- lovingly prepared by an award-winning chef who uses meat, cheeses, eggs, fruits and vegetables from the farm itself. There are two types of rooms-- available in either the older adobe section and or a new section beautifully designed to replicate the older buildings. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in-- anywhere, and the rooms simple but well-appointed. We stayed to ourselves while a huge wedding was going on, and there was plenty of room and quiet. The pool is lovely and this is my new favorite place to go in New Mexico if you want to escape the Californication of Santa Fe.", "user": "kdinesDenver", "date": "July 28, 2011", "id": 115923676}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "LOS POBLANOS -A World Standard!", "text": "I can't say enough about this incredible place. My most recent stay was in June 2011. I have lived in France, Germany and Austria and have stayed at some of the best and most unique hotels and Inns throughout Europe. The attention to detail at Los Poblanos rivals the best that I have experienced. From the feel of the hand forged door hardware as you enter the courtyard and here the splash of the fountain and hear the calls of the peacocks, you realize you have arrived at a very special place. The Inn Manager Nancy, sees to it that everything is perfect. She along with the incredible chef and the exquisite culinary creations made from the organic produce farmed on the grounds and served at breakfast make for an incredible stay. I Have stayed here on 3 separate occasions for business and can't wait to check in for a week for my own personal pleasure. If you want to nourish your mind, body and soul, this is the place. Although I prefer the old part of the Inn, the new minimalist bungalows, saltwater pool and gym are beautifully done and have a Zen like feel. Whether it's history, charm or comfort that lead you here, it's the smell of lavender, the crisp white linens and the beautiful scenery that will lure you back to Los Poblanos.", "user": "tvaughn4", "date": "July 28, 2011", "id": 115914339}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What a lovely place!", "text": "Thom-", "user": "MalandJanS03087", "date": "July 27, 2011", "id": 115855111}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Los Poblanos - A Little Slice of Heaven", "text": "Austin TX", "user": "p0nie", "date": "July 25, 2011", "id": 115761627}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Albuquerque"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 4, "very good": 18, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 249}, "aka": "Los Poblanos Historic Inn & Organic Farm Hotel Albuquerque", "slim_ranking": 0.181818181818, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Set among 25 acres of lavender fields and lush formal gardens, Los Poblanos is one of the most prestigious properties in the Southwest.
