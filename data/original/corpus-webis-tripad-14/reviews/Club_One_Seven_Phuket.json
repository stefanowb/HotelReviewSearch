I had such a great time here in early May. Daniel, Mack and the other staff do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and stressfree, which for me, being a first time traveler to Thailand/Phuket, was a great thing to have happen. The service standards are as good as a 5-star hotel, nothing is ever too much trouble, the food is great and the cocktails are lethal (in a good way). The location is very good too - 10 mins to the beach and the centre of Patong.

Daniel, Mack, and all the staff are outstanding from the moment you reserve till the moment you leave. You feel like you are staying at someone's home with the attentive service and the special touches. They recently remodeled the lobby and restaurant area and it is a great place to hang out if you need a little time away from the hub bub of Patong beach. The staff can arrange just about anything you need, all you need to do is ask. They will also do something special if you like - for my birthday, they surprised me with a decorated room, roses on the bed, and a special gift. I've been going to the Club now over the last 5 years and would never dream of staying anywhere else in Phuket. It is great value for the money and there is soooo much to be said for staying somewhere where the staff is more like your friends.

It's more a small hotel with staff who cant do enough for you and who make your stay delightful. At first it seems a little bit far outside the main centre of Patong but really its just a 15 minute stroll to the main bar areas, and less than 5 minutes to the beach. Its location makes it perfect for those who want to enjoy the delights Patong has to offer, but is far enough away so that you can get a decent nights sleep when you want one. Although on a town road, you hear no traffic noise when in your rooms - we had front facing room for our first stay and a garden view on second visit. Downstairs is a smart bar, nice cake selection and a very good menu offering real Thai food as well as some Euro dishes. The rooms are a good size, spotlessly clean, modern bathrooms and seemingly brand new beds and very comfortable mattresses. The pool is more a plunge pool than a swimming pool, but it's ncie to jump in at the end of a hot day and cool off. You can do your real swimming in the sea just a few minutes walk away. Best of all are the staff - every person is delightful, always smiling, always ready to help you and they make it a glorious place to spend time in Phuket.

You won't be impressed by the exterior, but not to worry. On arrival, I was upgraded to a really nice room. The housekeeping team kept my room spotless. I loved the different daily towel arrangements on my bed :)). The room had good aircon, good free wifi signal, large fridge and an electronic safe.
