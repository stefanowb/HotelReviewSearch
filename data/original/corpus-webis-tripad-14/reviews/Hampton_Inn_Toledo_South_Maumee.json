The spare blanket was to rough. The maid replaced the spare blanket with a satisfactory common blanket. The sink was too high for wife. The roll-around chair was too low for wife to use while curling her hair, so we boosted her up with pillows. The toilet was too low, so we will bring a booster seat next time. Too low water pressure.

We arrived at the hotel around 10:30pm and had no problem finding the hotel in the dark; only a few minute drive from the Ohio Turnpike. We were warmly greeted by two ladies at the check-in desk and we were up to our room in minutes. Our room was a nice size for one night and looked newly refurbished; hotel pictures posted on Tripadvisor are accurate. Everything was in excellent working order and we got a good night\u2019s sleep. The breakfast room is very large and we had no problem finding a table for our family. All the breakfast choices we picked were very good. This Hampton Inn is located in a somewhat busy area with gas stations, restaurants and stores within a short driving distance. After checking out, we gassed up and were back on the Ohio Turnpike within a few minutes. I'd stay at this Hampton Inn again if we were in the area!", "title": "Easy access to the Ohio Turnpike", "user": "stevesgirl", "date": "December 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187056476}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Maumee"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 19, "very good": 50, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 75}, "aka": "Hampton Inn Toledo South Maumee Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.277777777778}
