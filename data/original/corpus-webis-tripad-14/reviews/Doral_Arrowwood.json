I go to Westchester Mall near there and go to Build-A-Bear and Hallmark. I even go to Outback Steakhouse in White Plains, New York and I also see my cousin Chris Kollarus.!!! I even went to Nueberger Museum of Art which is a nice art museum and you can see lots of paintings there. At Doral Arrowwood I love the pool, Free Breakfast Buffet with Eggs, Pancakes and Waffles and The Pub which is the restaurant for lunch and dinner and I like the person who works there named Josue. The concierge Ron is nice and friendly too. I love the atrium and the indoor pool tunnel that you can swim under then you are in the outdoor pool. I do lots of laps in the Pool. Josue the person who works in the Pub is nice. My seventh time there was for a family reunion.", "title": "Doral Arrowwood is a Great Hotel.!
