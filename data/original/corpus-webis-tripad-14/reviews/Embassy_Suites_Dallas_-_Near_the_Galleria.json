I really enjoyed the cooked breakfast and I considered the three nights for the price of two deal to be a good bargain. The front desk staff were excellent (and very cute!) and even got me a power converter for free when I didn't have one that matched my laptop. Rooms were clean, bed very comfy etc. Only thing was - no cutlery available in the rooms and if you have any leisure/business in the city and you don't have a car you're better off saving on taxis and staying somewhere closer as the taxis drivers are bandits!", "title": "Good stay!", "user": "Archer83", "date": "June 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 68136435}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled with family", "text": "I think I read someone else's review that stated that this hotel hosts kid sleepovers. . . apparently this is pretty popular . . . the number of kids running around the hotel was kind of annoying.

The swans were beautiful, but I'd like to start a movement to \"FREE BARRON AND QUEEN\". I don't know anything about swans, but I can't imagine that they are happy in such a small space. Breakfast was good, but I think the dishwasher must've been broken . . . I picked up several plates that were DISGUSTINGLY dirty. Someone must've complained, the dishes were a little cleaner the next day. We like staying at E.S., but we won't be staying at this one again.

There's a free shuttle to all of the many office buildings (and the GALLERIA) in the area that runs until 10 p.m. There's a CVS next door for the inevitable items you forgot to bring along. The room service lady, Carmen, made me feel right at home and fed me well both of the nights I was holed up in my room trying to beat a deadline.

On Thanksgiving day when the hotel is packed with a football game crowd and holiday shoppers for the Galleria nearby, security was only provided for part of the night. As soon as the security guard left at 5:00 AM, thieves came through the parking lot and cleaned out more than 5 vehicles without being detected at all. Poor lighting is provided in the parking lot on the side and rear and there is a problem neighborhood nearby. Management seemed to have little concern for the customers who were robbed and did not offer anything to help. We were provided a form to fill out and I was given the phone number for a glass repair service that I had to contact. No additional discounts were offered as some consideration for our inconvenience. I had to ask for a discount and received half off of one night's rate. This seemed like an insult considering what happened and the time and trouble all of the customers will have as the result of the hotel not being willing to provide better security in their parking lot.
