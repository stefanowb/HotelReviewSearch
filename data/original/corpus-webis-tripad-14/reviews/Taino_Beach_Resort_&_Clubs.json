I read many negative reviews about the Ritz/ Taino after my travel arrangements had been finalized. I need not tell you I was \"Very Nervous\" regarding our stay...to my suprise it was much better than anticipated. I also received information from a young lady who had already stayed at the Ritz/Taino which eased my nerves! :-) The room was much better than the negative reviews stated. We had a 2br/2bth which was nice and clean. We did our own sanitizing/cleaning \"touch-up\" upon arrival as well. The staff was VERY nice to us....couldn't understand the guests who claimed to be mistreated at the resort. They were so hospitable that in fact we made a few friends while on vacation. However, we did meet a few \"outside of the resort\" that weren't nice, but hey, you get that in your home town so it was nothing new you just have to overlook people that give you tude and go on with life! :-) Overall the locals were nice to us. :)) We had our room cleaned on a daily basis along with an over abundance of towels. We were very appreciative of the tips on bringing food/snacks/soda from home due to the costs of these items being triple what we'd pay and they were! We had a great time at the Ritz/Taino. The resort is nice in itself. The pool is nice, the atmosphere is as well. There is a deck at the entrance of the beach where you could eat, play cards/games, socialize or just gaze at the stars in they evening hours if not in your room. If you want time for relaxing and do not require 5 star amenities this is the place for you. The beach was reaaly nice. Not crowded at all..it's more like a private beach... beautiful warm water! In the evening this would be a good place for meditation....it's sooooooooo peaceful! If you want action in would be best to stay on the Lucaya side of the Island where all of the action is!! A bit of both... I guess you can figure this would be the place to stay that is if you don't require 5 star accommodations. I usually vacation in Hawaii yearly, I found a great deal on Cheap Caribbean, so, I decided why not take a chance on the Bahamas! I didn't get a chance to fully tour the Island in May...this means I MUST return! I am looking foraward to visiting the Grand Bahama Island soon and will stay at the Ritz/Taino Resort!! :-)))", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 22, 2005", "id": 3220245}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "8-22 Jan05 Fabulous Holiday", "text": "8-22 Jan05 Fabulous Holiday", "user": "Ibbo312", "date": "January 25, 2005", "id": 3085096}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Fraud charges and still awaiting reimbursement for $3,198.00\u2026.", "text": "Enough has been said about the unique style of the rooms at this resort.

We were there from July 10, 2004- July 17, 2004 and would go back again. I was very worried after reading the reviews, but our stay was marvelous. We rented a car ( air conditioned) from Brad's rentals and would do it again in a heartbeat. Rental car is the way to go. We brought an additional suitcase with food staples and washing detergent and bought the rest of the perishables at the Winn Dixie. Food is high, so bring snacks, dishwashing detergent ( yes there is a dishwasher in the unit)and other necessities. Not a problem with toilet paper-but towels leave in the morning and return clean later in the day. Most of the time, we went to housekeeping for ours, easier and we got to hoard a set for nights when we went into the pool. The people at the Ritz were great and being nice to everyone at the beginning got us a great room.
