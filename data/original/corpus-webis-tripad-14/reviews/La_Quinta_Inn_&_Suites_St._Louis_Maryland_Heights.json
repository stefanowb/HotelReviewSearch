Got a double non-smoking from around $60/night. Upon arrival, we were warmly received and promptly checked in by the manager. A problem with the room keys was immediately and courteously remedied personally by the manager. The following morning, I inquired at the front desk about area grocery shopping. The weekend desk person \"didn't know\", barely glancing up to look at me. The next morning I asked the maid about eating in St. Louis. She referred me to the same person at the front desk. Again, that person \"didn't know\", this time even more gruff than before. It became clear to me that the weekend staff level of customer service is far from the managers standards. Hardly 3-star service, which is what advertises. As for the room. It was adequate, although not the cleanest (toilet bowl stains, poorly cleaned base-boards in bathroom and room). But I may be more discerning than most. The amenities on property were better than most, but outside of the manager, service was terrible. Very reasonable stay for the money, but if possible deal with the general manager, she's a customer service pro.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "reddrover", "date": "April 20, 2004", "id": 1793862}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 24, "average": 33, "very good": 41, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 40}, "aka": "La Quinta Inn St. Louis - Maryland Heights Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.533333333333}
