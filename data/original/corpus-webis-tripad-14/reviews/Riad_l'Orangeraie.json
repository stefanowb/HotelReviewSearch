We arrived in Marrakech and were promptly picked up and brought to the Riad where we were met at the gate by an English speaking guide. He brought us to the door and we were greeted by Cyril. The riad is stunning - large archways, polished concrete, simple and understated decorating. There are lots of spots for quiet relaxation- including near the pool and up on the roof top terrace. The staff is incredibly accomodating and were willing to help with anything we needed.", "title": "Perfect getaway", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "AlliecatNewYork", "date": "July 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5424261}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "On our first evening we ate at the riad an had a fantastic meal. The breakfasts are filling and delicious, though by the time you leave you may be craving fruit. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, just be careful if you have stairs - wet polished concrete could spell disaster! The location of the riad is unbeatable - just steps from the souks which makes it easy to bring your packages back and rest a bit before making another go round. The riad is located near a Mosque so you may be awoken by calls to prayer, but I thought that just added to the whole experience.", "title": "Fantastic staff, charming riad", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "4MR", "date": "May 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5079076}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "I would highly recommend the riad for anyone who is looking for a nice, relaxing, and comfortable place to stay!", "title": "A hidden gem in the heart of the Medina", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Deliberator", "date": "May 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5055544}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Returned from my desert trip", "text": "The Riad L'orangerie is simply but tastefully decorated and in a great location a few minutes walk from the Djemna El Fna (the main square).
