This hotel opened recently in July 09 or maybe June 09. It is a full service hotel which means they have a restaurant/bar, room service etc. I had two connecting king suites. The rooms were great. Each room had two LCD tvs, one in the sitting area and one in the master bedroom area. The sitting room had pullout sofas. The service was very good. The staff made it very clear that our comfort/enjoyment was a priority to them. At $99 per night for a King Suite, the price was right.", "title": "Nice, New, Clean and a Great Value", "user": "TheWarriorChief", "date": "August 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 38356241}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Made reservations at Cambria Suites/Aurora while traveling to the Denver area on business (picked at random from a list of hotels online). Husband traveled with me (mixing business w/visiting relatives). Upon entering our room, my husband kept saying, \"What a nice room...wow! This is nice!\" Great room, great nights sleep, a very pleasant stay overall. Will definitely book with this hotel on return trips. In fact, we're planning a surprise birthday party for hubby and will be staying here in the near future (will break the news to him he's going to Hawaii for his birthday). The Cambria Suites Denver Airport hotel is just 10 miles from Denver International Airport (DIA) and minutes from downtown Denver, making it the perfect place to stay for business and leisure travelers. Will definitely recommend this 'gem-of-a-travel' find to others. What more can I say other than give Cambria Suites a try if you haven't already - you won't be sorry!!!!", "title": "OMG what a nice surprise x 2", "user": "0813Bev", "date": "August 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 38299338}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "OMG what a nice surprise", "text": "this hotel just opened a week before we got there, and it's so nice. doing a girlfriend road trip thru to the mountains, and couldn't drive anymore.

It had Zen-like furnishings, a small refrigerator, and a comfortable bed. Everything was spotless. In the bathroom was a vessel sink and a gleaming tub. I found even the lobby to be a nice place to sit and talk or read. The breakfast that was served was fresh and tasty. The people working at the hotel were extremely accomodating.

Our group consisted of 2 adults and 2 young children. A crib was provided at our request. The bathroom was a little small but had high end finishes...not your typical hotel bathroom.

I flew into Denver and during the layover I became very ill. I had to go to the University Hospital in Denver by ambulance. While at the hospital I was so scared. I had no family, no transportation and didn't know where I would go. The hospital gave me a list of hotels and out of the ones I called Cambria was the only one who would send a shuttle for me at the hospital. Not only would they pick me up they were willing to take me to the pharmacy to get the medecine I needed. The hotel staff was so friendly and were truly concerned about my wellbeing. The staff worked together and everyone was treated equally. The man that picked me up at the hospital was actually the restaraunt manager. The room was beautiful. It had a seating area with a flat screen on the wall and where the bed was there was another flat screen. The bedding was so soft and fluffy. I just can't say enough good things about this hotel.
