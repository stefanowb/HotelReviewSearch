The staff, which speaks English better than we speak French, was extremely helpful and courteous. Our room was good sized by European standards, air conditioned and had a wonderful balcony with a table and chairs overlooking the pool area. Everything was clean and nicely decorated. The buffet breakfast is a little pricey, but is convenient and has a great selection to choose from. We did not eat at the restaurant, but chose to walk into town each night for dinner where there are a number of good places to eat. Obernai itself is lovely and in a great location to explore the entire region. We would definitely stay here again if we return to the area.", "title": "Great hotel, lovely town", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "jab31151", "date": "July 5, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2268285}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Alsace", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 18, "average": 26, "very good": 63, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 172}, "aka": "Le Parc Hotel Restaurant Obernai", "slim_ranking": 0.0909090909091}
