High ceilings, crown moldings and those wonderful French windows. The location cannot be beat, next to the Place Vendome walking distance to the Orsay, Orangerie, the Louvre! There is also a taxi stand around the corner. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel because there is an Eric Kayser Patisserie across the street that has amazing croissants, bread, pastries yogurt at great prices...and great coffee.

I absolutely loved the bathroom and the shower. Kind of funny; the Hotel was very modern in an old world type of fashion. If you like to have a drink every now and then; accross the street is the Kitty O'Shea. We pretty much unwinded our day there every night. The location is superb. You are walking distance to many attractions and the nearest metro stop is 5 to 6 minutes away. The Hotel serves a typical french continental breakfast in the morning. I found that it suited there Corporate travelers more. We rather walk around an eat at the cafes. The only problem I had doesn't really have to do with the Hotel as much. Getting there from the airport was quite confusing. You take the bus, but once you get off the bus in the middle of the town it tooks us a pretty long time to get our bearings and find the Hotel.

The room wasn't bad, but wasn't one of the recently renovated ones! The floor had a distinct slope and the heated towel rails in the bathroom did not work. We stayed 5 nights and had a fantastic time - the hotel is just around the corner from Place Vendome and walking distance to Boulevard Haussman, and most importantly, Chanel's main boutique is just around the corner in Rue Cambon! With Bulgari next door, you know you are in the right part of town. We chose not to have breakfasts at the hotel because we felt they were overpriced. There are plenty of bakeries and cafes around, so plenty of options to choose from. Would definitely say here again.

Read many reviews of the hotel and balanced that with my own experience with Paris, its hotels and this neighborhood in particular. First, Paris is an old city. To try and compare the homogenity of a big box hotel found in most american cities with hotels in Paris is folly and a road to disappointment as well as inability to enjoy Paris for its charm. This hotel has rooms with older furniture, its true. I stayed twice this month -- in a superior room which had older furniture but was huge by any standard and perfect for a family with small children. I much preferred the Vendome room, newly renovated and perfect for a single traveler or couple. It was just lovely and I would stay there again. In both cases, the bed was well appointed and extremely cozy and comfy. The hotel is very clean and its staff, the best part. Helpful and very warm. I would not hesitate to stay again.
