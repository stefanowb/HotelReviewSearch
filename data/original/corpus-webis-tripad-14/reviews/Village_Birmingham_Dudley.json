I normally stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Oldbury which is adequate however on this occasion, there were a group of 6 so we decided to stay here so we could use the gym and have a better restaurant. On checking in, I was handed a piece of plastic with a key hanging from a rubber band - not a great first start but a minor issue which I was happy to let go. I was on the second floor and the second I opened the door, I was hit with a stench of stale smoke. I put the key fob into the holder to get the lights on but to no avail - when i tried to remove it, it was jammed. On calling reception, they eventually wrenched it out with a screwdriver and jammed the switch so I could get lights. I was informed, \"they're old and crap so sorry!\" The room was OK but the furniture was badly stained with ring marks etc. I went to wash my hands to find the soap dispenser was jammed and wouldn't work. After a few minutes of pressing it, a dribble would eventually come out. The bed was comfortable enough but the air con didn't work so it was extremely hot and I couldnt open my window as it backed onto the back of Tesco delivery entrance so the noise was unbearable. I then found a dirty great handprint in the middle of the bedroom mirror. Dinner was very average - eggs benedict made with hard boiled eggs was a first and the ribs whilst edible, were not very good. The restaurant staff were pleasant and bubbly which was probably the best part of this hotel. The gym was exceptionally busy so be careful when you try to use these facilities - clearly open to non residents too. Breakfast was poor - a 10 minute wait to be seated, no milk with the tea/coffee, no fruit left and very few hot items out - this was at 7:45am! I later found out that one of my colleagues had no towels in her room - this she found out after showering. My shower was broken so only a trickle of water came out of the shower head while ost of it gushed down the wall. On a plus point - they did have a half decent hairdryer.", "title": "A big let down!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Karen S", "date": "July 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 166292621}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "Overall this was a very disappointing visit.
