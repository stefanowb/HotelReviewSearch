We liked its small size and the slight quirkiness of the rooms and decor. It felt decidedly French! The staff were absolutely lovely and always helpful and obliging. Rooms were cleaned daily, towels and amenities replaced and the bed was turned down in the evening, complete with sweets left on the pillows! Our room included a minibar and tea and coffee making facilities as well. Only downside was that the room was quite dark, with heavy drapes and not much natural light, but in a building of this age and style it is probably quite typical. Having a metro station directly across the road made transport very accessible, but we found we hardly needed it because so much was already within easy walking distance. Special thanks to Sylvia at reception for her tips on good cafes and eateries.
