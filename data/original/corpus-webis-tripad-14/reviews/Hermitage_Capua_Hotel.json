The hotel itself was a little out of the way, but easily found off A1. It is a very nice hotel, clean, roomy rooms, and we had a huge terrace. The desk staff is very helpful and speaks English very well. We had a slight problem with the shower, which they fixed immediately. Bed was comfortable, no noise, WIFI in lobby, and a restaurant on the premises. The breakfast is marginal, though the coffee is great. The dining room has lunch and dinner (same menu which changes each day), and the quality is unexceptional. But it is in a great location for touring, clean, friendly, and there are local restaurants within a couple of miles. We'd stay there again.", "title": "Nice hotel, a little out of the way", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "india1939", "date": "June 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 111272331}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed at this hotel on business and found it just about an average european hotel. My room was ok but only had, besides the bed, one desk chair to sit on. Beds were hard and pillows, well lets just say thin. No internet access in your room so you had to continuously go to the lobby if you wanted to check email. Food was basic, nothing special. I guess I expected moe traditional food especially being in Italy. Restaurant staff was friendly but again they didn't go out of their way especially since I do not speak italian. Laundry service is not the best. It took 3 days to get my clothes laundered. All in all a good trip and not a bad hotel for a short stay but again there wasn't very much to choose from in that area.", "title": "Good Hotel - But nothing Exceptional", "user": "wjak", "date": "May 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 107323078}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Beautiful hotel.
