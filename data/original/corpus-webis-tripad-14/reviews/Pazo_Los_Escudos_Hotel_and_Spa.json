When I arrived, I went to front desk and, while I was checking in, I noticed the very modern design and quality of all the lobby. Then I went to my room which was very luxury... Huge room, huge beds, huge bathroom (which was filled with Bulgary products like shampoo, soap, ...). The breakfast of the hotel was also excellent with a wide variety of foods and drinks. The hotel also has a great garden where one can go for a walk. The hotel is not in central Vigo but with a car one can arrive there fast (maybe 10 minutes away). Overall, I recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to stay a few days at a true 5 star hotel.", "title": "Great hotel...

We were very relaxed and returned to Poland nice and refreshed, and awed by the delightful landscapes. We were amazed beyond our expectations with this hotel. We couldn't have been pleased enough from the professional service given to us by the hotel's staff (especially the cook who prepared the breakfast and buffet everyday). Also, surprisingly enough, the prices which covered all of these were not bad at all. We would strongly recomend room 306 where we stayed, it was very lovely and had an astonishing views of the river.", "title": "It\u00b4s a fantastic place!", "user": "Marzena01", "date": "May 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 16079631}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled on business", "text": "It has been more than a year since I stayed at this hotel, but I just looked it up and thought it would be nice to have some english comments on the page.
