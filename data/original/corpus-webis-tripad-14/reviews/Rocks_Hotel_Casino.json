The staff were very friendly and tried to be helpful, but this was sometimes precluded by their lack of English, both at reception, but especially in the buffet. There was also a lack of appreciation of customer needs there, so if you went in for the dinner buffet, no-one thought to ask you if you would like to see the wine list when they were serving you water, and it was difficult to get their attention - no eye contact. Also in the morning, they seemed unable much of the time, to understand \"tea with milk, please\" as the latter rarely came without another prompt. Small things but simple to cure and annoying for guests.", "title": "Recent stay at The Rocks", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "10TeresaP", "date": "October 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 182926817}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had checked in late Sunday evening and dashed down for the excellent buffet before unpacking. When we got back to the room, however, we could hardly breathe because of the fumes of cigars/Turkish cigarettes. We assumed this had come in through the air conditioning from another bedroom. Give the hotel their due, within minutes an electric air filtering machine had been brought up, and an fresh air spray, and this with the opening of the windows helped clear the air a bit. And in the morning we were moved to another room without delay.
