We had a mountain view room which was great as it was away from the noise of the pool area. People we met said that they wished they had a room on our side as it was sometimes noisy in the evenings. The hotel is expensive for food and really expensive for drinks so next time we will pay for all inclusive.

Although we did have small areas of mould in the bath room. A slight minus was that our room overlooked the main pool which we found to be both noisy and disruptive. Hordes of screaming kids everywhere! I was so surprised to see so many - don't the Aussie kids go to school? It spolt our time in the pools because there was simply no where to swim!

You want to make sure there's alot of things for them to do. The wedding itself was just a dream come true. We hired out Wicked Walu and we were not dissapointed. The staff were fantastic, the food wonderful, the string band we hired (Ofa) was just super! You must ask for Ofa if you want to have live soft music on the night.
