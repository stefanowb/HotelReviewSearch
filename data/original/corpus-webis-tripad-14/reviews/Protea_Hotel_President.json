We knew this going to into our stay here, but it's important to note. Still there were a few restaurants within walking distance, which we went to. We also enjoyed a walk along the water. Since it was spring,we did not get to take advantage of the pool. The breakfast was extensive and probably the best part of the hotel. My complaint lies with the service. I wondered, are people this unfriendly and disinterested in Cape Town? Knowing several Cape Town natives, I know this to be false. Also, is it imperative to whisper? It was excrutiating to try to extract information from the front desk staff and god forbid they offer any without being asked numerous times. When we first arrived we asked for restaurant recommendations and they handed us a giant binder or menus. Ok. We went back to ask about ones that were in walking distance. That was fine. Next day we ask about a specific restaurant and I ask to see the menu binder. They kept insisting on making a reservation at that restaurant. After a couple of back and forths, they gave me the binder. Next day, how much would it be to take a taxi to the Waterfront? Our shuttle costs XYZ rand, but how much would it be to take a taxi? Our shuttle cost XYZ rand. It took at least 3 times asking a question to get an actual answer. Same with asking about the public bus. No one wanted to tell you exactly where it was or any details about it. It was so simple to take the bus to the waterfront and cheap, but the hotel certainly didn't want to provide these answers. Maybe they are trained not to. The front desk staff was not rude, just terrible communicators and every interaction with them was very frustrating. This was also the case in speaking with the tour desk there. Maybe this woman hated her job, but she was so disinterested in providing us information and had quite the attitude when we asked about certain places we wanted to visit. She responded to us with great disdain. THANK GOD we decided to just go to the V&A information booth. We booked lovely tours with the Wine Desk and Mile by Mile tours. Maybe this place is ok if you are staying with a large group that is making all of your arrangements, but if you need to rely on the hotel to help you with anything, forget it.

Our bedrooms were well appointed, and quiet, with good views. There was a good choice at breakfast, and the 'egg lady' cooking the eggs was very helpful, and eggs were cooked to perfection every morning. It was a pity that there was no ramp, only steps to the Buffet area. The pool was a good size, with a good water temperature. It was never too busy in the surrounding pool area. We would return to stay at this hotel again.", "title": "A great place to stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Janet C", "date": "February 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153280377}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Very well situated 10 minutes drive from the Waterfront and a couple of km away from Camps bay, you can even walk to Clifton beach. Pleasant hotel nicely decorated and quite new but it does have a feel of budget hotel. The room was very clean and spacious but I didn't like not having a bath ( just a walking shower), and having a sort of strange kitchen at the entrance of the room with a kitchen sink and a microwave it made me feel like I was in a caravan rather than in a hotel room. The pool was quite nice but the sun beds are the same you get in all Protea hotels which are very uncomfortable, better to go to Clifton beach. I was very disappointed by the gym just a small basement room with only a few weights and static bike not even a running machine. I liked the hotel staff always polite and professional.

For business or leisure there is no better choice of venue. Surrounded by the stunning Lion\u2019s Head Mountain range and Atlantic Ocean, the hotel\u2019s spacious rooms offer all the facilities that one would expect from a world-class hotel. One can enjoy a cocktail in the Senate Bar or a sundowner on the terrace, overlooking the magnificent rim-flow pool to the ocean. Once you have taken in the spectacular view you can let the Islands Restaurant tantalise your taste buds with its sumptuous cuisine. When you are not visiting the famous Clifton Beach, the V&A Waterfront or Table Mountain why not pamper yourself at the Amber Hair Salon, or take in the sites of Cape Town with a tour on the hop-on-hop-off Cape Town Site Seeing Bus. Not only can you purchase these tickets from the Travel Desk but you can also use the bus stop situated right outside the hotel as your starting point. Once you have discovered its remarkable variety of facilities, impeccable service and consummate luxury, you will agree that there really is no better choice of venue than Protea Hotel President, and it\u2019s without a doubt the most eminent Cape Town hotel on the Platinum Mile."}
