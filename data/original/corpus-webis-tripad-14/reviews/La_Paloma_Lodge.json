There we were greeted at the lodge with fresh fruit, juice and cake while they explained the layout of the lodge and the tours included in our four-night package. After checking out our cabin, we went down to an empty beach (5 min hike down hill). The beach is a bit small, but fine for my 8 year old \u2013 the surf can be very rough so we made sure to stay close to shore. That afternoon after lunch we went kayaking up the bay/river from the lodge. Kayaks, snorkeling equipment and boogie boards are provided by the hotel as well as sarongs which substitute for beach towels (they\u2019ll exchange these as needed). Each night, dinner was a group meal, they started serving appetizers around 6 each night (nice view of the sunset from the porch) and many people had wine or cocktails (not included in package price). At dinner we had a soup and salad as well as a choice of two entrees (fish or chicken/beef) and side dishes (rice and beans were also avail), followed by dessert. We thought the food was excellent and they were happy to offer an alternative to our son if he wanted one, although he was happy to eat the regular food the whole time. The service was excellent and organized throughout - everyone we encountered was more than pleased to accommodate our requests or questions. The next day we went on the Cano Island boat trip, starting out at 7:30, with a group of 9 guests, we traveled by boat for about 1 hour then anchored to snorkel. Most of us enjoyed the snorkeling although there was apparently not a lot of fish that day. We then traveled another 30 min to the island where we anchored and had 2-3 hours for beach time and lunch. In the guidebooks it states that there are pre-Columbian artifacts (spheres) on the island but these have been removed, so there was no reason to leave the beach. We then stopped for some more snorkeling on the way home. The next day we left at 6:30 for the Corcovado jungle tour. Our group was split in two so we only had 5 people and a guide on our hike which really allowed us to go at our own pace. Saw monkeys, birds and bugs, and hiked up to a waterfall. This trip was really fun! The final full day, I got a massage while my husband and son hiked a bit and hung out at the pool; then we visited the beach once more and finally did the \u201cBug Lady\u201d night tour (not included in our package) which was great, but not for the squeamish.", "title": "Highlight of the Trip", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "chicago6", "date": "April 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5007813}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "Overall, I can really recommend the hotel for the location, service, tours and food.

As far as child friendliness, there are not a lot of areas where your child can run \u201cfree\u201d, as you are supposed to stay on the paths to avoid biting ants and snakes. There were no other small children the week we were there, so my son had to make do with grown up company and books/games, but the hotel staff was happy to answer his questions and the tour guides made a point of talking to him and helping him on the hikes and snorkeling.

We were there in mid-April and it was very hot and humid but we survived the nights with the ceiling fan and the windows open. We would recommend La Paloma to our friends and family. If you're looking to get away from a brand name hotel with doormen, a/c, and room service, etc.. then this is a great get away. It's peaceful, quiet, and moves at a slow pace.
