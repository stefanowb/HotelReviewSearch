We stayed 7 nights at this wonderful hotel, had 7 days breakfast and were delighted all along. Guests are all ages, there were several families with children at all ages which was nice. Breakfast is excellent (price is high again, but..). We did not eat at the restaurant. The outdoor pool is marvellous, and due to the temparature one can swim even when it is raining. The sea to which you have direct access from the hotel is wild and extatic. Views to the sea are just breathtaking. For those interested (I did not see any comment on this before), the Hammam is excellent and has two rooms, one is nicely hot. The fitness room equipment is ok. We did not use the SPA (apart from a short treatment which was awarded to us). What stood out to us, apart from the beautiful settings, is the excellent service we received at all times. They are quick at cleaning the rooms, breakfast service is friendly, fast and smooth, the valet parking is excellent, we had a little problem with the DVD which was resolved in a fraction of a second, whatever we asked for was dealt with so speedy and smoothly.
