I think this is the first hotel I've stayed in that didn't provide a hair dryer. There was no pool and they only appear to offer valet parking. The remote was pretty raggedy and the batteries were almost dead. There is a refrigerator in the room, which is a nice thing to have, except on check-in they advise you not to open it or move anything or else you'll get charged an arm and a leg for a soda or a candy bar. They really pushed their restaurants when I checked in as well. I kind of felt like I was being nickeled and dimed on everything, but maybe that's industry standard these days.

Another ding: the hotel's extremely friendly and efficient staff seems constantly in motion through the hallways, yammering on walkie-talkies. They are undoubtedly busy taking care of details and heading off problems, which is admirable, but perhaps they can be told to keep their voices down.

The service was perfect from the vallet, reception desk and especially Bessie the Concierge who knows everything about the city and issuch a pleasant person to deal with. Our room was exceptionally clean and had been recently upgraded from top to bottom. The iPad in each room is also a nice touch.

The Inn is only about fifteen years old and while certainly not a FIve-Star hotel, gets four stars in my book.

Its location is perfect, its tons of places to eat in the area, and the staff is so friendly. I've stayed at this hotel about 20 times in the last year and everytime I've never regreted it. The only semi bad things is that it doesnt have a pool:( and also the corners of the bed are kind of sharp, but I'm a little clumsy. I brought my two children with me for each stay and they're under 5 and we never received a single complaint about noise. The only person at the hotel that was a \"problem\" was the older lady at the breakfast buffet. She isnt a good multi tasker. But with that said, I love this hotel, super friendly staff, and the breakfast buffet is one the best I've ever had, and I'm a world traveler, who is orginaly from Guam.
