I wasn't thrilled about it, but my assistant who booked the room had informed me that was all that was available and so I was expecting. All I really wanted was to write some emails, maybe watch the news, and get to sleep early thereby completing my scrooge Christmas routine. And here begins my particular issues with this hotel. Firstly, a very minor quibble, no televisions in any of the rooms; thereby scuttling my plans to watch the news. No problem I thought, I'll switch to plan b and go straight to dealing with the various chores I needed the internet's magical assistance to complete. Bad new on this front too, the internet connection in my room was so slow as to be ineffectual. Not great, but no problem, plan C, straight to bed in a crisp pair of pajamas. As you may have guessed, here is where the third problem arises. The rooms close to the reception hall / main entrance area are so inundated with noise of all types that it renders sleep practically impossible for all but the most drunken of would be sheep-counters. The phone ringing in the lobby, guests chattering as they come and go, various hotel workers gossiping etc. As this had all occurred in less than 20 minutes, I decided that this hotel was clearly not the place for me. I informed the gentleman at the counter that I would be changing hotels because for the approximately $130 (6000r) that I was paying for the room, it seemed only fair that I be able to sleep. The clerk quickly sprang into action and said he would change my room to one on the second floor immediately. Fine I thought, and as he didn't offer me the choice of refunding my money, it seemed the best choice on offer. The second floor features a much nicer room, with one large bed (why they didn't offer it to me if it was free when I asked for a room with a larger bed earlier is a mystery). I took off my shoes an settled in whereupon the windows started shaking with what can only be described as the bizarre sound of an Indian gentleman playing the sort of hits of the 60's / 70's that I strive to avoid in every day life (Think 'Lela' and that song with the refrain 'driving down the road trying to loosen my load' -I'm not sure what that one is called).", "title": "I don't get it", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "koko_lopez", "date": "December 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 22997037}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Giving up on sleep I decided to go upstairs to the restaurant to check out the food selection.
