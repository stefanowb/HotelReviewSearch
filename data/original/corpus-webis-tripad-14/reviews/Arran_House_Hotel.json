With 3 of us crammed into one room, there wasn't a lot of extra space, but the room had been decorated with care and the clean and cheery \"white bed\" look, topped with colorful throws, made me feel right at home. There was a desk and chair and two dressers as well as a cupboard - lots of storage space. The retro-fit bathroom in the corner was a marvel of engineering ingenuity - tiny, but it served well and the shower worked fine. Towels were attractively laid out and ample. The breakfast room was well-staffed and a hive of activity in the morning - there was a great hot buffet with loads of choice, and good cold breakfast foods, plus newspapers to read. A common room on the ground floor had a TV to watch, reading material, comfy couches, and the Internet station (which I didn't use and it was not free.) Staff were forthcoming with information, maps, and directions. The hallways are under renovation right now so they don't look great, but there was no inconvenience. There's a lovely garden at the back and the whole place was really quiet. I would not hesitate to go back - but book well ahead...I couldn't get in for an additional night when my plans changed!", "title": "Charming and convenient", "user": "DLCAlberta", "date": "September 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 41868065}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Our group at Arran House Hotel consisted of our son and his girlfriend, younger son, and us, not-quite-so-young couple. There are 4 tube stops close, closest of which is Goodge St. It's very convenient to British Museum, Univ. of London. There was a college student group staying, but that wasn't a problem- they had a party one evening in the garden and invited my son in. Breakfast was great- it was a buffet so there was no waiting, you could take what you wanted from typical English breakfast items, typical continental breakfast items, rolls, nutella, yogurt, fresh fruit. We had a fourth floor room, so had to lug our bags up, but we did it. Since this was August, the room was a bit warm but a large oscillating fan was provided and we slept well. The room itself was an acceptable size, bed linens and pillows were of very high quality. The en-suite bathroom was one of those molded affairs ; it looked small but was quite serviceable. My son and girlfriend rode bikes from St Pancras station to the hotel. There is a bike route which keeps one off the busy streets. I would certainly stay here again.", "title": "Great location, great breakfast", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "KathleenV", "date": "September 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 41165167}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled solo", "text": "This place was one of a couple I was recommended by the staff at the Ridgemont Hotel, who lost my email booking and then by the time it was found were fully booked and could not offer me a room.", "title": "mixed experience", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "rrw11", "date": "August 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 38682292}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled solo", "text": "On the positives, this place is in a good location and includes a full English breakfast in the tariff.

I was on the first floor overlooking the street. Luckily there was a fan in the wardrobe which helped a bit. However I needed earplugs every night I stayed. None of the staff offered to help move my suitcase upstairs. The staircase is steep and narrow, and it was definitely difficult to get a suitcase up and down, even one that is not particularly large. There was minor renovation works happening at the time of my visit. Though not noisy, I had to walk through this to use the shared toilet and shower facilities and a couple of times I came out of the shower to find several tradesmen on the stairwell painting.
