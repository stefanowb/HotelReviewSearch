We stayed in a two-level room that had 4 beds and while the space was adequate, the beds were clean and comfortable, a decent, newish TV...that is where the positives ended. The rooms were not thoroughly clean (hair in bathrooms, garbage under the beds, dozens of live ladybugs on the windowsills and worst of all, the water was terrible---undrinkable! It has iron or something in it that stains the toilet and tastes toxic. The breakfast was, as described by others, unprofessionally presented (I don't think the Health Dept. would approve) and not maintained thoughout the morning. We loved skiing at Jay (in this year of little natural snow in New England...they have it!!), but I would rent a trailside condo next time and not take a chance with another no-name motel.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "blondfromBeantown", "date": "March 16, 2006", "id": 4627682}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Nothing to Write Home About", "text": "The Pros:", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ryanator27", "date": "March 8, 2006", "id": 4594992}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "The BIG dissapointment", "text": "Friendly staff.
