The staff was great in dealing with kids and also dealing with the melt downs that come along with having young kids.

We just take into consideration that this is a very well-used family resort with lots of young kids abusing the furniture :-) We stayed in a loft room, which while right next to the restauraunt and the stairs, was very quiet with a lovely mountain view. What really sets this place apart is the friendliness of the staff. Smiles, helpfulness and greetings wherever you turn. (The homebaked cookies help, too!!).
