Once you get used to hopping (figuratively) in and out of the tub, it's fine. The ironing board and iron are conveniently stashed in a little wall closet. The bedside tables can migrate to between the arm chairs for comfortable reading with a glass of whatever. Breakfasts are excellent, and the big table seats 10 or 12 (can't remember). Lots of chatter in the morning; have a conversation with Molly if you're lucky enough to have her serve your morning meal. She's got some great stories and is not shy about sharing her thoughts! (Don't get her going on the feds...) There is lots of parking below so do your baggage handling on Topsail through the main entrance, or, like me, you may be the sherpa-chauffeur. Location is good, except for the nasty construction on Topsail towards the harbour. Easy access to restaurants of all sorts.
