The mattress was the perfect firmness and the duvet and pillows were fluffy and comfortable. The bathroom was out of this world. In a city with numerous hotels boasting grand bathrooms, this one trumps them all. The jacuzzi tub easily accommodated two people, and the rainfall shower was very relaxing.

Always one to stay on the Strip, I heard that the Spa at the JW Marriott was excellent (and I heard this while I was at Spa Mandalay, which I think is also an excellent Spa.) So my friends and I decided to stay at the JW Marriott to check it out. Both the Spa and the Resort itself were incredible. Spa first: excellent fitness facilties, fitness classes, treatments and lounge area. I had a body scrub and a clarifying facial and both were wonderful. Hotel and rooms: Who needs the Spa when the hotel room's bathroom has a large whirlpool jet tub in it, as well as a rainfall showerhead in the separately enclosed shower!!! FABULOUS!!! Bedding was soft and comfortable; room was nicely appointed, and yes...the bathroom is DIVINE! The hotel staff were always friendly, always professional, and always \"At Your Service\" when you needed extra anything (towels, robes, etc.) I was quite impressed when I received a follow-up call in my hotel room to make sure that my requests were met. There is also a casino so you really don't need to go anywhere else! AND, if you enjoy golf, there are plenty of beautiful, world-class golf courses surrounding the JW Marriott. Top-notch customer service will always win out, when you have so many comparable, hotels and resorts in one area. That's why the JW Marriott in Summerlin stands out as a class act from others. I stayed at THEHotel at Mandalay Bay the following day after the JW Marriott. Although the suite hotel is swank, the service at THEHotel was sub-par to the JW Marriott...no comparison!

The pool area is nice - decent size pool and there are cabanas for rent. The resort is very quiet, since it's located in Summerlin, a bit west of the Vegas strip.

We did not use the casinos, but we walked through it in the morning to go get breakfast. We are not really the \"gambling\" type so I did not notice much about the casinos. One thing to note: Since the resort is far from the strip, there are not too many restaurants located nearby, so we ended eating at the resort.
