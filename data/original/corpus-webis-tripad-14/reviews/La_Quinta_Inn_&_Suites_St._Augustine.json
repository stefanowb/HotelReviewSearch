Pet friendly too so that was super helpful. Was convenient to I-95 and still close to historic St. Augustine. We initially intended to only stay one night but found the city so charming that we stayed a second night. The front desk staff ended up putting us in a different room the second night because we did have some slight noise issues with the AC in the first room.
