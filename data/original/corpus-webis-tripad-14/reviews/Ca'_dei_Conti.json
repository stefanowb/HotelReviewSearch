The room was smaller than we expected, but our overall impression wasn't unfavourable. Hanging/wardrobe space was restricted to a small cubbyhole that comprised of one shelf, half a dozen hangers and our \"hotel safe\", which I could easily pick up off the shelf without any struggle (security indeed). The en suite showerroom was surprisingly large, however the shower cubicle was more than a bit snug, a shame given the fact that there was plenty of floor space that could have been used to fit a bigger shower. Clean towels, comp products (some of them found to be empty boxes only) and generally clean and fresh smelling. Bed sheets clean, pillows very low and only two in total - we had to supplement by using cushions to get a decent sleep position.
