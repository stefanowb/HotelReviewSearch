I made the reservations and then read the review from the guy who had the bad experience. Needless to say we were a little worried about what might happen. We ended up having a great time. The room was nothing fancy, but was clean. The sheets and towels smelled fine and they didn't appear to have a problem with laundry. When we arrived, we were also given the rules which included no outside liquor (you could bring liquor back to your room from the restaurant). They also didn't allow you to be loud and obnoxious after 10:00 p.m. which was fine with us since we were traveling with a four year old. The restaurant had great food and large portions. Over all, the Ski Lift Lodge is a quaint place to stay and we would recommend it highly.
