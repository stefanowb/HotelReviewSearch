There's an entrance to the subway in front of the bodega (\"94th Street Blueberry Farm\") across 94th from the hotel. Most of the prime tourist action is around Times Square, which you'd take a downtown train to get there. You have two choices: if you pick the express side of the platform, you're there in two stops, and it's very convenient. If you pick the local side, you'll still get there, but you will stop every couple of blocks. Pretty much every subway line connects at Times Square and that gets you anywhere in the city, so once you remember to take the express train to Times Square, you'll love this hotel and understand why they say that they're close to all the action.", "title": "Hidden Gem for the price", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "carcol29", "date": "October 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 46976051}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Surrounding Neighborhood: You're blocks from Central Park, so if the weather is nice, grab your camera and take a walk. Turn left out of the hotel. You'll cross Amsterdam, Columbus, and then you'll be at Central Park West and the park will be across the street. We entered the park at 96th and Central Park West and found ourselves in the North Meadow, which is used for youth soccer games. There's also jogging trails, a nice children's playground, and benches to sit down and take a break. There are some nice places to eat off of Amsterdam, and some friendly pubs to grab a drink that are reasonably priced. One of New York's iconic deli's, Barney Greengrass, is within walking distance. It's not cheap, but if you want a real Jewish deli and not a \"concept\" restaurant, it's worth walking over for breakfast or lunch. (You'll also find a cheaper deli on Broadway with a good breakfast if you turn right out of the hotel and walk about a block past the Duane Reade.) If you grow tired of paying too much for a hamburger around Times Square and want to spend an evening living like a local, you're staying in a pretty nice residential neighborhood, so you have the option of hanging out with New Yorkers.", "title": "Great place to stay at", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jennyfer62", "date": "September 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 43855652}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel itself: As with most New York hotels, the building is old and the elevators are tiny and slow. (I found the same size elevator at the Marriott East Side. The difference is that the Marriott's elevator looks nice inside and the Days Inn looks like someone went to Home Depot, grabbed some cheap plastic that you might use to line a bathroom wall and lined the elevator with it.) The carpet needs to be replaced. If you're in a room across from the ice machine (we were) you're going to hear noise. However, the important basic stuff is A-OK. The bed was comfortable, the pillows were thick and supportive, and hot water was never a problem. There is free WiFi. I couldn't get my phone to connect to the WiFi, but I did see people in the lobby with their laptops, so it did work for some people. There is a business center where you can pay by the minute to use a computer. You will pay for all phone calls, even 800 numbers. There is a tour desk where they'll hook you up with sightseeing or airport shuttles, although I opted to skip that because I've been to the city enough to know where I'm going (or use HopStop to tell me how to get there).", "title": "If you can... pay for a better place.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "TravelChicaNY", "date": "September 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 41416082}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "All in all, we got a great night's sleep every night, and while we were underwhelmed when we first walked in, we had a great trip and really couldn't complain about the hotel and would consider staying here again.", "title": "Clean, but dated, not as close to Times Square as stated but safe area.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "pinkladytracy", "date": "September 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 41127227}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in this hotel for one week and it was just awful!

It reminded us of some cruddy Youth Hostel in a third world country. It ruined our visit to New York and we couldn't wait to leave and go home. It is, without any doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I would gladly have paid more to stay in something decent but that will teach me to trust a travel agent, never again!
