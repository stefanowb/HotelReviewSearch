I was determined to prove them wrong and write a review after I stayed in this particular Motel 6. The price was good and the phone service was excellent. Check in was fine. When I got to the first room I was assigned, the overhead light didn't work. No big deal. But the toilet would not flush. So I got another room (next door). In this room the toilet flushed but the bathroom smelled horrible. The TV remote feel apart in my hand and the TV would not tune in the stations that the one next door did! So, I slept in one and used the bathroom in the other. It worked but it wasn't great.", "user": "SFGroveland", "date": "December 27, 2008", "id": 23023642}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with family", "text": "When you first pull up it looks like every single other motel 6 that you would see. The office even has a free wifi banner hanging above it in order to get you to come in. Once you get to your room you realize you made a mistake. The room smells somewhat like smoke even though they told you it is a nonsmoking room, but yet there is an ashtray in your room turned upside down with a no smoking sticker on the back. The bed is definitely pushed up against the heater/air conditioner. There is only free wifi in SOME of the rooms. And my TV made horrible clicking sounds while it was on. I also had two big spiders in my bathroom and proceeded to get two bug bites while in my room. I wanted to leave yet my family in another room talked my husband and i into staying. What a mistake. At about 5:00 in the morning while lying awake I heard somebody try to get into my parents room, but I thought it was one of them. Then I heard somebody at my door put in a key and try to open the door, and I thought it might be my mom. Then I realized they had moved down to the next room to do the same. We were too scared to look out the window so we decided it was time to get up and get out. My parents thought it might be the newspaper they drop off by your door in the morning, but no my husband even heard them trying to open the door. The sound of a key going into your key slot and somebody trying to push open the door is very distinct. You could not pay me a million dollars to stay here again and I thank my lucky stars my two little girls were still asleep.", "title": "Very Afraid!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Familyvacayer", "date": "April 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 14980222, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Next to the interstate", "disliked": "\u2014 everything else"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Very scary place, People milling around our room and car all night.

I lost my voice for a week, ran a high fever, had to go to a doctor and he told me I got a bacterial infection from how dirty the room was. I did call the motel's manager and was told I would be compensated and still have not been commpensated. I also got skin sores. I was pretty sick. What really made me mad was the manager told me they had a record of a couple of people checking in then back out in 18 minutes and they knew these people had trashed the room yet no one did anything to clean the room.
