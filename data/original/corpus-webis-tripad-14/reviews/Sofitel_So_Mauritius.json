A very undeveloped area of the island, with a beautiful backdrop of the mountains and sugar plantations, surrounding the resort. On arrival, you look down the hill to the resort - to the ocean - and taken by a golf car to the rooms. The resort is low rise, so no floors to climb, and each room is a luxury villa. We had a beautiful room, contemporary with a huge double bed, beauitful linen, stunning bathroom, flatscree, wifi, movies, bose system, outdoor and indoor shower, a lovely eco garden outside your floor to ceiling patio doors which you can pull right open, with an outdoor bath, your own butler, so look after your every wim .... restaurants were great, the food absolutely outstanding, we had dinner every night at the hotel - very cool beach front restaurant. Beautiful beach with stunning lounge furniture. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the sea. The spa area was just beautiful, we both had massages, plus a yoga pavilion.", "title": "Luxurious outstanding new resort different to any other hotel you will find in mauritius", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "StevensonLondon", "date": "April 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 102892892}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Nothing i could fault on this stay.

I couldn't be happier with my stay. This hotel is still in its pre-opening stage and I was informed that their opening is in April. The staff are young and verrry friendly. They memorise your name from Day 1 and wish you using your name. This is called personalised service. My personal butler, Ravi, was always available. He set the tone of my stay right from the beginning. The staff at the restaurants went out of their way when I asked told them that I wanted to try the local Mauritian food, which was not on the menu. The chef prepared a special meal plan for me for the duration of my stay and I had different local dishes served for dinner every night. The staff at the Bar Le Takamaka were helpful too. They had good knowledge of the drinks. For lunch, La Plage is highly recommended. It is very relaxing to sit there and enjoy your meal overlooking the sea. It is on the beach with sand so you dont have to wear your slippers or come in formal clothes; very non-pretentious. I did not use the Spa or the pool although I visited them and looked very inviting.", "title": "Transperent water worlds Beautiful beaches", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "SwetaJain", "date": "August 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 77674155}], "location": {"city": "Bel Ombre", "continent": "Africa"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 16, "very good": 36, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 242}, "aka": "Sofitel So Mauritius Bel Ombre Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.285714285714, "description": "Sofitel So Mauritius Bel Ombre is located on the southern tip of the island in the most naturally beautiful place.
