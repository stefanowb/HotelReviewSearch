The hotel is very traditional, perfectly located and with all the comfort the modern traveller needs. Unfortunately the hotel also has WiFi (Wireless Internet) installed, which is a pain for electro-sensitive people like me. Luckily enough the WiFi is only installed in the reception area, and if you choose a room on an upper floor, it is possible, you still can sleep at nights (although I know the radiation actually covers the whole house).", "title": "Superb Hotel, centrally located, electro-sensitives can 'survive'", "user": "Martin K", "date": "June 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131537774}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "So if you happen to choose the Platz and are electro-sensitive, ask for an upper floor room.", "title": "Excellent location & good service", "user": "yanasim", "date": "June 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131434881}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Staff was very attentive and responsive to my personal situation.", "title": "The Perfect Platzl", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "hipandhopping", "date": "June 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131350476}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at hotel Platzl for 2 nights during our recent visit to Munich and were very pleased with our accommodation choice.

This is it. Our room was smallish but perfect for relaxing and recharging. Although it was air-conditioned, the windows in the room opened on to an inner courtyard. We experienced fresh air and quiet. The room was clean and well-appointed. The bathroom was modern with a great shower /deep tub combo. The breakfast that was included in the price of the room was a sumptuous brunch-like affair. If you left hungry, it was your own fault. And if you travel as we do, it kept you going until dinner.
