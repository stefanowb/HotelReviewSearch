To be honest, we waited too long to book the B&B where I had previously stayed. The Dewey House was the only opening on the island for our first night, and I was extremely excited as I'd heard wonders. It did not disappoint. I can honestly say that it's the best place either of us has stayed in the entire country. The Dewey House has a traditional elegance that somehow seamlessly blends into coastal chic. We stayed on the second floor, by the stairs, with an enclosed balcony facing the street. It was flawlessly quiet, and the bathroom was beautiful and spotlessly clean. I would have much rather spent half the time in Key West that we did so that we could've afforded an entire stay at this property. Seriously, it's that good. The concierge called us a cab to the Blue Angels Air Show. We ate the best breakfast of our trip (espresso, English muffins, fruit, cheese, and yogurt) out on the beautiful beach-front patio. The location is on the absolute end of Duval Street. At first, we saw that as a negative, but if we did the trip over again, I promise you we would've spent entire days reading on the beach, lounging on our balcony, and enjoying food and drink at the Southernmost Beach Cafe next door. . . with brief trips out to the marina and dinner. It's a splendid property that offers the luxury that's too often missing from a Key West vacation. Skip the hotel chains and other B&Bs. They can't compare. This was my husband's first trip to KW, and I had wanted to just book where I'd stayed before. I hugely regret that decision! I sincerely hope you choose to stay at the Dewey House for your entire trip!", "title": "Amazing March 2013 stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TennesseeWifey2010", "date": "June 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 162917970}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed two nights in the Ocean front suite, room 404, which was on the ground floor.

This was our third trip to Key West but our first time staying at La Mer and Dewey House. We will never stay anywhere else. This place is a gem! This hotel is on the Gulf side of the island a block or so away from Duvall street ( the main street of Key West). You are walking distance to everything. When we first arrived at the hotel, we were met by Randell a wonderful gentleman who took us around the hotel grounds and gave us helpful information about activities going on at the hotel during our stay like Scuba class,wine and beer class, yoga etc. Boomer runs a lot of these activities and he is a great guy who will make sure you are never bored while staying at La Mer. Our room was wonderful with a spectacular view of the beach! We had a balcony that faced the beach. we would sit out there in the evening having a glass of wine enjoying the wonderful weather and watching the sun set. We could not of asked for anything better! This hotel has three pools one had live music every day with many activities throughout the day. The other pool was the tranquility pool for those who just enjoyed the quite and wanted to relax and read. The 3rd pool was the Pineapple pool. Every morning breakfast was served while you sat at cafe tables that overlooked the beautiful beach with crystal clear blue water. If that wasn't enough to wet your appetite,they spoiled you with delicious food; fresh waffles, quiche, every kind of fruit, Muffin and breads, yogurt, coffee, and cappuccino. Relaxation with a top notch view! This is a wonderful hotel to stay at in Key West and in our opinion the very best place to stay!

The innkeepers made us feel like we were at a friend's house. The location can't be beat. All beaches had free cold water available and each day we were given two bottles of water.

Sam was the epitome of guest relations. She showed us our room, she gave us ideas of things to do, offered and gave us a champagne cocktail on our arrival. During our 4 days, Sam was by far the most pleasant and outstanding staff I have ever encountered. The rest of the staff were fantastic also but she just made you feel welcomed and appreciated. Southernmost, take note, Sam is one of your most valuable assets. Our room was incredible, housekeeping was above and beyond what is considered normal.
