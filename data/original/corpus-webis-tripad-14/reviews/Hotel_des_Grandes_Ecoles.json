They confused our reservations, thinking that we were the same person, an honest mistake. Thankfully we both had email confirmations of our reservations and within a couple hours (and a yummy breakfast that they gave us), they came up with another room (as the hotel was full). This room, we believe, is not normally a room they rent out. It was in the back lower portion of the hotel and was basically a small apartment, with a kitchen and living room.

The walls were covered with cherub wallpaper. Each side of the bed has a nightstand with lights and a telephone. There was also a table with 2 chairs by the window, which had a great view of the buildings in the area. The closet was big enough for my large suitcase and all my clothes with room to spare. The bathroom was a really nice size with a big tub and shower. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom, but as I soon found out is not very strong and I have long thick hair, so it took about an hour to completely dry my hair. There was no clock in the room, so I recommend bringing a small travel clock. The front desk can arrange for a wake up call \u2013 which I recommend because it plays cute music including Happy Birthday :) There is a small elevator, which just fit myself and one suitcase \u2013 I am not a large person!

It's true that the rooms are small. It's true that the in-room amenities (shampoo, lotion, etc.) are minimal. It's true that the breakfast is a French breakfast (bread, coffee, juice), not an American one, and it's expensive for what you get. But.... how many Paris hotels can you stay in where you can leave your window open at night and wake up to birds chirping in the morning? How many hotels have a beautiful, secluded-from-the-street garden and patio where you can retreat when you've had one too many metro ride, been to one too many museums and been jostled on one too many streets? The location is great. You are a 10-minute walk from the heart of the Latin Quarter and the metro is 50 meters away from the front door.
