The mainline JR line ticket machines are not easily understood and we required local help. Dont drive as most signs are not helpful and traffic is awful. Hotel rooms were clean and with a good view of the government building (free viewing platforms at the top floor), Breakfast was buffet with good choice and I recommend sign up for their EIC membership online for discount rooms and priority check in and use of the business room in the south tower (as a good place to plan your visit with free coffee and soft drinks). This hotel is closer to the station where there are stacks of shops than the Hilton. Check out the food halls in the shops - absolutely amazing.
