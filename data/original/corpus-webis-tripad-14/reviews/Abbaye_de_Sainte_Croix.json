It is a gorgeous building with fabulous views. The rooms are not overly spacious but perfectly adequate and ours had a lovely roof terrace which more than made up for it. The food is exquisite and quite an event in itself but they will also cater for simpler tastes ie for children. The staff were lovely and if you are looking for a classy experience of being 'french' this is the place to be.", "title": "Beautiful!", "user": "sjwoolnough", "date": "October 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 21125415, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Room size"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007", "text": "Do you really want to relax and get away?", "title": "a piece of heaven", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "balz", "date": "October 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10455777}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Little Gem with great food", "text": "Do you really want to dine divenly?", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 28, 2006", "id": 4394557}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2003", "text": "Do you want to be pammpered?", "title": "Simply Brilliant", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "JessicaBN", "date": "April 17, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3370160}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We loved the Abbaye de Sainte Croix", "text": "Look no further, this is the place.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "smurer", "date": "June 20, 2004", "id": 2207882}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2001", "text": "This hotel has magnificent views and an excellent restaurant It is let down badly by the small, ill-furnished and very expensive rooms", "title": "Expensive hotel with a good restaurant", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "ExEmGe", "date": "August 12, 2003", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 1223266}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Provence", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 8, "very good": 27, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 42}, "aka": "Abbaye De Sainte Croix Hotel Salon-De-Provence", "slim_ranking": 0.176470588235, "description": "Perched on the rocky outcrops of Salon-de-Provence, a tiny Provence town, which is ideally located to explore everything this delightful area has to offer, there is a tranquil spot where time would appear to have stood still. This 12th century abbey in the hearth of twenty hectares of Proven\u00e7al gardens and garrigue offers spectacular views of the Alpilles Valley and the countryside surrounding Salon-de-Provence. The rooms still bear traces of the Cistercian monks who once occupied the abbey and boast a d\u00e9cor that blends charm and authenticity and provides a calm and restful atmosphere. You will be delighted with the hotel's attentive service and the culinary delights served in both restaurants which offer delicious dishes based on seasonal local ingredients."}
