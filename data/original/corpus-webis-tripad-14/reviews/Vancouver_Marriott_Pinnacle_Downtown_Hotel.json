Not only is the hotel beautiful, it is centrally located downtown. I was most impressed by how the entire staff treated me as soon as I walked in the door. Everyone from the two concierge to the reception (Ting) were exceptional and always very pleasant and helpful. Also, as a priceline customer I appreciated that this was not mentioned at check-in and my request for a room ending in the numbers \"19\" was easily accomodated. (At other princeline hotels I found that this is not usually true). I recommend requesting a \"19\" room, you will get floor to ceiling windows overlooking the marina and downtown area. We didn't have a car and were able to get around town easily. Outside the back of the hotel (off of Pender Street) bus 19 picks up right outside and drops you off in Stanley Park. The bus driver announces which stop to get off to rent bicycles for the park. Across the street from the bus stop is an inexpensive breakfast diner called Moonpennies, that had delicious scones for about $2.25 CAN. You can also easily walk to Robson Street, which is about a 10 minute or so walk. I personally would have skipped Robson Street as it seemed just like any upscale shopping area in the US, nothing special. We walked to Yaletown on Saturday night and found some cool bars with live jazz music and cocktails at a restaurant called Capone's. Another plus about the hotel is that it is only about a 5-10 minute walk from Canada Place, convenient if you are arriving by cruise ship.

My wife and I are Marriott Rewards members and often stay at Marriotts for free. I must say that our stay in Vancouver was more fun than the cruise. Due to a massive cold front packing 50knt winds our ship, the SPIRIT was forced to forgo Prince Wm. Sound and Glacier Bay and the continued miserable weather canceled out our helicopter excursion in Juno. As a matter of fact it rained almost the entire cruise. Don't get me wrong though, Alaska is breathtakingly beautiful. We are going to have to go back! But we needed to make up for lost sightseeing in Vancouver. The Pinnacle is a lovely hotel in a great location. Just a short walk to Canada Place, the sea plane terminal, shopping on Robson St., dining, etc etc. Just a wonderful location. We paid for a 5 day stay using Marriott points and when checking in we were treated just great. The desk attendant booked us into a 29th floor corner room with a spectacular view of the harbor. The concierge staff went out of their way to help us book our tours to Victoria, Butchart Gardens, the Capilano suspension bridge and Grouse Mountain. On our last night which was our wedding anniversary we had a delicious dinner at Morton's steak house that rounded out a great time in Vancouver. Great city and a fine hotel.
