We joked about how we could live there long term. It had a spacious suite and luxurious bed with the softest pillows I have ever experienced in a hotel (and I've been all over the world!) The comforter was heaven and not the gross bedspreads that never get washed. The color pallet was calming and I was impressed with the updated countertops and lighting system. Even though we were only there for one night, we were determined to take advantage of all the amenities the hotel offered. A widescreen flat tv, fridge, coffee maker, microwave, hairdryer, office space, tub! This place is perfect for lone travelers as well as a romantic getaway. Can I take the Ayres everywhere we go!?

I cannot tell you it was the worst hotel in Chino Hills but I can tell you that I would not stay here again. Definitely do NOT stay here for the breakfast. The bagels/bread was stale. They have cook to order eggs which my husband said were fine, but the potatoes served with the eggs were bland and cold. The orange juice was not available.

The bed was extremely comfortable. We asked for extra towels in our reservation, which we were given at the front desk as well as in the room when we arrived. We heard no noise from the nearby freeway, although we were on the opposite side. I did not use the fitness center but it appeared to be well-equipped with lots of free weights and several pieces of cardio equipment. I only have two minor issues that I post here as constructive feedback for the hotel. One is the availability of the complimentary breakfast. We stayed from the Thursday night before Christmas Sunday through the following Tuesday morning and never took advantage of it because as we understood it breakfast was from 6AM to 9AM. We are not morning people, particularly while on vacation. It would have been nice to have it open until 10AM, even if only on the weekends (unless it was and we just misunderstood?) The Corner Bakery that's in the same parking lot as the hotel, however, has GREAT food. Also, a lot of hotels leave bottled water in the rooms, which I don't mind paying for. This would be a nice touch as, otherwise, I can't think of anything else that would have improved our stay at this very nice hotel.", "title": "Excellent Hotel", "user": "Maryann T", "date": "December 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121905719}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel is extremely clean including bed linens, carpets and bathrooms. The brand/model of mattresses that they use is so comfortable we would like to buy one. This may not be important to many people but I find the lobby to be very warm and inviting. We also enjoy the quality of the complementary breakfast although there is no waffle maker which one of the other local hotels provides. There are lots of good restaurants and shopping close by. Also, if you are a Christian looking for a church in this area, my daughter and her family attend Calvary Chapel Chino Hills which is close by. You will truly be inspired by Pastor Jack. I'm sure the hotel can provide you with address.

I have to admit, when I searched for lodging in the area and all that I found were two hotels, both rated 2 or 3 stars, I didn't expect much! But the Ayres was perfectly clean, the rooms nice and big, and we got a great night's sleep. The hot breakfast the next morning was actually unexpected. I had only indicated one guest in the room as I was searching for hotels and didn't change that when I made the reservation although I did have my teenage daughter with me. The manager was perfectly nice about giving me an extra breakfast pass and it was a great way to start the morning. For the price, our stay at the Ayres was a GREAT value.
