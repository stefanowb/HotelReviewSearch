The hotel is across the road from the Sorbonne (which was handy as I was working there). 5 mins walk towards the Seine past some fantastic restaurants and bars you come to Notre Dame. Another 10-15min walk along the river is the Louvre. So all in all a fantastic location. The hotel reception was undergoing some refurbishment while I was there but the staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast is a traditional continental affair but good quality with bread, pastries & croissants on your table, with cereals, cheeses, cold meats, yoghurts etc available from the counter. There is pretty stable WiFi available(1euro/hour) which had reasonable signal in my room which was on the 1st floor, although some guests on higher floors had to use the lobby to get any reception. My twin bedded room was of a reasonable size with a desk and tv, there was a small 1/2 size bath with a shower in the ensuite. The room looked very recently refurbished and was of good quality.

This was a last minute trip, my mother was visiting from the States and wanted to go back to Paris. This was our first stay at this very charming, Parisien hotel. All the staff members were lovely, very friendly and helpful. They made a reservation for us at a local restaurant, and we had a wonderful dinner. I want to thank them very much for trying so hard, because the calling card we gave for the restaurant had an old phone number on it! We stayed in a triple with a balcony overlooking Rue de Vaugirard, just off Blvd. Saint Michel, a very convenient location. The bathroom was small (c'est normal), but it was very modern and clean. No problem with the elevator, most elevators in Europe are small. The bar was closed for renovation when we were there, but it isn't a problem because there's a very nice terrace across Blvd. St. Michel that's open late. I think it's called Tabac. If you have a car, parking is within a few blocks. Metros are very close and convenient. I would definitely give the Trianon between a 3 and 4 star because of the hotel's personnel. They were all very helpful, and it's very important to have a friendly, helpful front staff.
