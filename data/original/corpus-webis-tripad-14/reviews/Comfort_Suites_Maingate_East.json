I called the place first to see when it was last updated and was told most rooms had been recently refurbished. I was told to make a request online for a refurbished room. So I did. I also requested an early check in. The day prior to arrival I called to confirm all of this. I was told the early arrival would not be granted until the next day (our arrival date). I called that morning and was spoken to very rudely by the woman. She said she would not know if I could check in early until 1:00pm! That was the time we needed to be in the room to change our clothes before attending the wedding at 2:30! We arrived at 1:15pm and there was no one to be found at the front desk. The lobby smelled like fried foods (gross). I was not impressed. Finally a man came and starting spewing excuses as to why we could not check in early. He said the hotel had been full the night before. I calmly asked again, was there not a single room ready? He finally relented and gave us a room, but it was very dated, not updated, and the flooring and bedding was old and gross. The bed was awful and I could not sleep. I really do not know if they truly have any updated rooms as all the rooms on our floor looked to be the same.
