However, we were a bit concerned about how dated it was and the fact that they didn't clean our room or change towels until I chased them after four days. This year, they were far more hands on and whilst it wasn't a thorough clean every day, they cleaned the room 6 times and changed the towels three times within our 14 day stay. Emptying the bins each time and leaving plenty of toilet roll. The pool bar was in full swing this year and they have added new tables and chairs to the pool and bar area. As always the girls on reception were great and we enjoyed it even more this year. The sofa bed was fine for our twelve year old, but if there is a group of you, you might want to try and get a bigger room with more beds for comfort. All in all a great budget stay.

We were lucky staying in a 2 bedroomed apartment (Room 717) which was on the top floor facing the beach and it had a front and side facing corner balcony affording great views of the resort. The apartment was spotless and very spacious. A large lounge/diner, separate well equipped kitchen, and a small corridor off the lounge leading to a single bedroom, a double bedroom and a large 4 piece suite bathroom. Only downside was that there was no hairdryer, but we managed to buy a cheap travel hairdryer from a shop nearby for 8 euros. The air con and TV were free of charge, bonus.
