For American visitors (which we were), we found that even an attempt at the language - simply saying good morning, good day, good evening, thank you in Italian - made for even warmer relations. This was true not only of the hotel staff but in general throughout our travel in northern Italy. You may even receive compliments, as we did, on your pronunciation. Another plus was the free shuttle to/from the Malpensa Airport. This service was available throughout our stay. We made several trips into Milan using the shuttle to drop us off at the airport then calling them to pick us up when we returned to the airport. Be sure to reserve the shuttle the day before you leave for the airport. We also thought the free, full breakfast was filling - a good way to start a long day of sightseeing. We would rate the breakfast B-. On the other hand, we found the hotel's restaurant expensive. Unfortunately, given the location, choices are rather limited. One night we dined at the nearby Microtel and found the food (if not the prices) better in quality.", "title": "Good value- friendly staff, quality room, free airport (Malpensa) shuttle", "user": "wgsMissouri", "date": "November 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 49187555}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The best thing about the hotel was the efficiency of the airport bus connections; we were collected when we asked and returned to the airport in the morning at exactly the time we asked.

The front desk people were not very pleasant, but I don't believe they were Italian either. We had dinner at the restaurant and the previous reviewer was correct concerning the food and staff in the restaurant. We ordered 2 plates of different pasta and the pasta certainly wasn't made fresh and I would think it had to be made at least 1-2 hours before. It was not good at all, but at 8:30 we were hungry. Management's response to another traveler talking about the buffet is another problem. The food had to be sitting out since the restaurant opened for dinner-a health inspector would not have been happy seeing all that food without refrigeration for such a long period of time sitting out. There were only two other tables in the restuarant occupied and one of the staff sandwiched us in between the other two tables, I guess he didn't want to strain himself walking. As far as management's response to the gas station-I turned left out of the hotel, then left again onto the highway and then followed the signs to terminal one. I had previously read these posts and really appreciated the comments of management and believed that there indeed was a gas station as was mentioned. He is dead wrong and the reviewer is correct. I actually had to get back on the highway going back to the hotel and gas up at the station on the other side of the highway. If there is a gas station going the way I did and how I was told to go by the shuttle driver of the hotel and there is a gas station before terminal 1, management please respond, as I can't wait to hear where you believe there is one going the way the hotel driver said to go. The room was small, but clean and the beds hard, as would be in the Novotel. In closing, next time we will stay at the Novotel as even though a French chain, this Best Western is in no way an \"Italian\" hotel based on the staff and food!", "title": "The best way to get to Malpensa early morning", "user": "barbaraGeneva", "date": "June 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33124532}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008", "text": "We were just looking for an inexpensive place to stay near the airport before flying home the next day, so we weren't expecting much.

The only gas station we could find was a self-service station without an attendant. Because everything was in Italian, we had difficulty to determing how to get gas from the machine and we lost 20 euros, but fortunately got a credit receipt. Frustrated, we turned our car in, paid the high gas price and returned home. Once home we thought perhaps the Best Western could turn in our credit to the gas station when an atendant was there and use the gas in their hotel courtesy van. It was worth a try. We wrote them a letter saying what had happened and included the credit receipt, our hotel receipt to verify our stay, and a self-addressed envelope. About two weeks later we received 20 euros in the mail, saying they were able to redeem the credit. We were shocked and we wrote them a thank you e-mail.
