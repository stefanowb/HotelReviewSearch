Our room was bigger than the ground floor or our little house, so I nearly got lost on several occasions! And I know it was cleaned on a daily basis, because I tested the theory!! In fact, the staff are cleaning 24/7, all over the hotel. I was fearful of sitting in one place for too long, in case they washed,mopped etc me!! The main restaurant always offered something for even the most fussy eater(Paul), and as for for dirty tables etc, either choose your time to eat away from the masses, or do a Sharon. That is, pick a spare table, slap your handbag on it, and stand there looking pathetic! The waiting staff sort it really quickly! We did manage to get into the bbq restaurant one one occasion,but they seem to be a little over subscribed by some clients. However, the main restaurant did a bbq on several occasions.We did not bother with the others, Mr fussy again. The pool area is fabulous! And the staff here are so professional! How Rammy, the main barman kept his cool with some clients is beyond me!!( personally, had someone talked to me the way I witnessed a Russian talk AT Rammy,I would have ripped his head off, and done something disgusting down his neck!!). The atrium bar is the focal point of the hotel for many.,and is subsequently busy at times. However, the staff here are again ultimately professional. The 24 hour service is very welcome after a hard days sight seeing in Cairo!! Thanks also has to go to duty manager Ahmed,Not only for conspiring with Paul, to make our special day memorable,but making sure our whole stay was perfect! Finally, to those who have written negative reviews,. Are you sure you stayed here?? Not sorry for refusing to join the \"sit on sunbed and see what I can complain about next?\" club!!! In fact, within 24 hours of our return home, Paul booked for next year!!!", "title": "We loved it!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Harrysmama", "date": "October 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 81796980}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "Some people on here really do need to get a life.

There's always fresh pasta and chips on the terrace if you don't fancy anything from the main restaurant but we always found something to eat.

Waiters will get you drinks if you ask and if you then tip them. The food is 'international' so will not suit all tastes all the time but what we tried was cooked very well. Breakfast was best for me as there were pancakes and waffles every morning. We tried the Italian one night which was good but we found the waiter service a bit uncomfortable, plus you have to book and there is a line every morning for this from about 8:50am.

Plus, drinks will usually come in quite small glasses or cups so if you want a larger drink think about bringing your own glass (as one guy we saw had, and was therefore the only guy with a pint!); c) the beds in our room (inland view standard) were two queen-size beds which we just pushed together. The staff then cleaning your room will make them up as one big bed when they're together; d) people will come by several times a day offering you excursions or treatments in the spa.
