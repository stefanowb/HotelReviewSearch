I must admit that right from the start the impression I got was of bad organisation. They did not reply to e-mails and I had to ring the hotel several times to get the confirmation through, even after they had taken my credit card number. On arrival, the reception staff seemed pleasant enough and checked us in quickly. When we got to the room we were horrified! It was a small, grim room (214) with a tiny window that you could not even see through without standing on tiptoe. It was frosted glass and looked out onto some inner yard. We went straight back down and thank goodness we had the e-mail confirming we had booked a sea view room. We could have lived without a sea view, but a balcony was essential! They quickly moved us to room 311 which looked onto the side street and had a partial sea view.", "title": "Beware of some rooms!", "user": "hesketh27", "date": "September 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 20149932, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Some poor rooms, shabby bathroom"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "It was obvious that the hotel was not full so why had we been placed at first in what looked like a cell??????

On the plus side, the staff continued to be helpful and friendly and the location is great, but overall the hotel is more two star than three. The bathroom was particularly small and shabby.

The reception staff booked us into ROOM 106....It is the WORST room I have been offered in my travels throughout the world.....the beds are twin and pushed together in what is no more than a large cupboard...there are two frosted over windows with a sole view of the air conditioning vent. I refused to accept it and wouldn't budge till they changed us to another...they were not happy. Did they really expect us to stay in there for a week? It seems pot luck to get a sea view room and one wasn't offered despite the request 3 months previous and a phone call two days before. The staff aren't particularly friendly and this is no more than a two star hotel at the very most.
