This could have been a recipe for disaster, but our choice of accommodation really made a big difference to our week. The building itself is ancient and very characteristic, My view in the morning was of the pretty garden, with the persimmon tree at the window and the sound of bells from nearby San Zeno church - very romantic! The rooms are of a very high specification. I've stayed in hotels for a lot more money which have a lot less thought gone into them. Although the building is old, the rooms are immaculately presented, with lovely wooden floors and beams, decorated in creams and very tastefully done. The bathrooms were also very high spec, with excellent showers, tiling and lighting. The kids were delighted by the wifi (no problems accessing the internet) and the English TV channels on the TV in the sitting room which came with our rooms. This was our new babies first trip away, and miraculously he loved his travel cot in our room, and didn't sleep in our bed once (at home he hated his crib!) It is an easy walk into town along the river past the Castel Vecchio, and the church of San Zeno is amazing, and just over the road. The parking in on street, but wasn't a problem. Francoise the owner did everything she could to make our stay a happy one, including even holding the baby while we ate breakfast! The breakfast is continental style cereal, croissants, coffee and fruit juice etc, Some travellers may expect cooked breakfast, but we tend to eat so well in Italy that its a relief not to have a big cooked breakfast. Are there cheaper B&B's in Verona? Yes. Are there nicer ones?

Soooooo much better than any impersonal hotel. The Original structure was built in 1070. It now has stunning grounds, each room is prettier than the next and everything is perfectly appointed.
