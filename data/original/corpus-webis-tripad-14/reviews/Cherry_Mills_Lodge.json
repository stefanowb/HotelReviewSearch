We were given a choice of several hot breakfasts. I had eggs, sausages, and bread. The eggs were very large, and the bread was a miniature loaf which was delicious. We were given orange juice with the meal, as well as a dish of strawberry jam. The strawberry jam was spectacular: it seemed to be pure strawberries! It was sweet and very tasty.

I did an Internet search of the area for a Bed and Breakfast large enough to accommodate my entire family. I found Cherry Mills. After a few emails with the owners I decided to rent the entire Bed and Breakfast. When I arrived my Daughter and her Husband had already claimed the bedroom that they wanted and were sitting on the 2nd floor front porch enjoying the cool breeze and the sound of the nearby Creek. When we arrived we were greeted by the owners, and a very friendly Dog. We were told that we had the entire 2nd floor and the use of the large living room and breakfast area downstairs. My Wife and I stayed in Guest Room A - a very nice room with a view of the creek and a private bathroom. The rest of my family arrived and had to choose what room they wanted. Hard Choice! We hiked during the day and played cards and board games in the Breakfast area at night. Even Breakfast was a hard choice, starting with a plate of fruit, Scones, Juice & Coffee, then having to choose from 7 items on the menu, all cooked to perfection by the owners and served by their wonderful family. Overall this is a great place to take off your shoes, kick back and enjoy the peace and quiet.

We went for a relaxing time, and that is exactly what we received. It is an old hotel, 1865, so don't expect a 5 star hotel with TV, radio etc. You won't get it. What you will receive is a very old hotel, that is a grand place to relax, read, play cards or just talk. We had a really nice time. It is only 18 miles from the beautiful Ricketts Glen S.P. which is unbelievable wit all of it's gorgeous waterfalls.Cherry Mills was the perfect place to come back to and relax at, after a steep and exhausting hike up the waterfalls trail.The host were quite gracious to us, telling us about Woolrich, Pa and places to dine at. To take the chill out, since our weather wasn't the best, Michael made 'wood' fires in the fireplace, as we played cards or read in the main room. The breakfast was fabulous. Brenda created a feast for us, which included, homemade breads, jams, canned and fresh fruit, homemade dried beef/gravy over biscuits... YUM etc. We stayed in the east wing, family suite and can say that the beds were extremely comfortable and the shower was quite nice even after being the 4th person to use it that morning. Also, we felt comfortable/secure in not feeling the need to lock the doors. Not to many (Hotels/Inns) give you that type of security in them.
