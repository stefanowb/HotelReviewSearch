It is rare to find a hotel that captures a sense of history with modern comfort but this is such a hotel. I arrived late at night and there had been a mess with booking my room, though in no way was this the fault of the hotel but rather the internet service I used to book it, and after a 12 hour journey from the States that could have spelled disaster. But no, the staff could not have been more polite or more helpful and all was more than resolved. The food I enjoyed was first rate, I particularly recall a split pea soup that transported me back to my grandmothers in England, and the bar is cozy and friendly.
