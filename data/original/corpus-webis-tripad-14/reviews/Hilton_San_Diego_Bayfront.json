This was after they completed the check in process - we had to remind them of our package the benefits. We encountered the same problem on checkout - I had to remind the staff of our package - they just gave us the standard check out which didn't account for our resort credit and parking. Perhaps a minor detail, but why does the customer have to make sure they get the right rate and benefits when they have already been booked/confirmed? Lastly, the wait staff in the Odysea on our first visit were a bit slow and didn't even mention the specials including the Happy Hour (HH) specials (which we had no idea about). On our second & third visit the service was much improved but again, no mention of the HH specials (which include both early evening and late evening).

The hotel was clean, bright, the staff was amazing. Everyone, from the concierge to the folks who cleaned the room were cheerful, energetic, and seemed to be having a good time working together. I have attended many conferences and this was nearly seamless. (Small mix up at lunch, but not a big deal.) I would come back. Location was terrific and the room was not cheap, but I felt I got the value for the money. I wish I had more time here to enjoy the harbor walk located just outside the hotel.", "user": "LlamaMom", "date": "June 19, 2011", "id": 114279957}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Hilton trying to get every dollar possible.", "text": "My family and I stayed at Hilton SD Bayfront June 2011. The room was large the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms a good size. However, parking is $36 a night. And they charge $7 an hour for WIFI.
