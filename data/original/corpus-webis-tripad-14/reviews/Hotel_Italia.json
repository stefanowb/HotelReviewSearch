We booked a triple room because we travelled with our 10 year old daughter. First of all, the hotel does not look at all as on its website. The hotel was renovated but it looks like the pictures were taken just after the renovation. The hotel looks gloomy and tired. Our room, a \"superior\" triple room, which according to the receptionist are all on the front of the hotel on the busy Via Cavour (+ in front a busy intersection) are to be avoided, if possible. We asked to see another room and the receptionist proposed us another standard (not renovated) room in the back of the building on the ground floor at the same rate. This room was quieter (the bathroom was not renovated otherwise I did not see any difference with a superior room) but situated above the cellar with the boiler producing hot water. There were also single and double rooms next to our room which had the same problem because one could hear the boiler working in the hallway that led to our room. We choose this room - not because we liked it - but because the other room was far too noisy because of the traffic. The boiler under our room worked all night, which means that we did not get much sleep. The parking (free of charge) is very small but there is parking space on the street behind the hotel. The distance from the hotel to the gate of the old town is about 8 minutes and from there on you have to walk at least 20 minutes to get to the Piazza del Campo, which does not correspond to the advertisment of the hotel, which mentions 10 minutes to the \"old town\". Going back to the hotel after a busy day visiting Siena to rest is not a good bet because at night you have to go out again and walk to the city (30 minutes), except if you choose to have dinner in the only decent place around which is a fish restaurant, on the other side of the street just before the city gate. Finally, the hotel is situated just outisde the city walls in a very ugly and inpersonal neighborhood, where one does not really wants to stay when one aniticpates to visit a town for its unique atmosphere.

The last night was spent in the main hotel and the room was smaller, but comfortable enough. The only issue I have here was with the bathroom, which was more like a wet room. Not a problem in itself, but the drain didn\u2019t work well and so the whole of the bathroom floor filled up with water and remained there for a while until it drained away leaving a soapy residue all over the floor. So if you do want to stay here it may be wise to ask for a room in the annex building where the shower was a cubicle.", "title": "A couple of issues but overall OK", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TravelPad", "date": "October 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 20642261, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Blocked plughole in bathroom, expensive internet"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Breakfast was ok, with a choice of sweet breads, rolls, cheese and ham as well as a choice of cereals, tinned fruit and yoghurts.", "title": "Charming but a little smelly", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TIffany946", "date": "May 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 15747948, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 How close we could walk to Sienna's town area", "disliked": "\u2014 The smell"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with family", "text": "There is a good pizza place a five minute walk away, on the same side of the road just next to an old stone archway.", "title": "Great for the price", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Marais1969", "date": "December 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 12011035, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Well maintained property", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007", "text": "All in all a reasonable place to stay which is within easy reach of the centre and a 15 minute walk from the station (uphill on the way to the hotel), although I wouldn\u2019t agree with other reviewers who say that it is a boutique hotel.", "title": "Run don't walk away", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "PEGLAR20", "date": "December 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 11193460, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything else was just terrible.
