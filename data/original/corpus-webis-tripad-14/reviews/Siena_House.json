They are situated perfectly in the Tuscan countryside and there are day trips a plenty in all directions and whether you choose to dine in and sample their amazing cooking or venture out to one of the many excellent recommendations, you will be sure to have a great time - Malvin was armed with suggestions of places to see and things to do each morning as he served the delicious breakfasts. The d\u00e9cor is stylish and fun and so refreshingly \u2018un-chintzy\u2019 which is a rare find for Tuscany and the walls are decorated with many of Amanda\u2019s great paintings \u2013 all of which are for sale and we happily snapped up an original Amanda Helen Atkins to remind us of our lovely trip and that fabulous room\u2026.nothing better than sitting in the bath, glass of wine in hand looking out of the window at rolling Tuscan countryside.", "title": "Just Perfect", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "continenthopperUk", "date": "August 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 75406980}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010", "text": "We will most definitely be back and by the looks of things will have to book up way in advance, but rest assured that Siena House is an absolute delight and you get a lot more than you are expecting once you are there as some things you just can\u2019t put into words on a website.", "title": "Fantastic hosts and absolutely lovely place - highly recommended", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Snoop21", "date": "August 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 75383575}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Malvin, Amanda, Scarlett and Dino were such gracious and generous hosts.
