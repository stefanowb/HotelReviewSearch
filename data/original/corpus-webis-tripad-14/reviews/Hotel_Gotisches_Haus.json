Staff were friendly and helpful. Note that hotel kitchen is closed for whole of 2008 for refurbishment (we were advised when booking), although it does serve breakfast. However, this was not a problem as there are many restaurants in the area, and the hotel receptionist gave us a very good dinner recommendation closeby. Rothenburg as a town is delightful - an old walled town which is wonderful to stroll around. Quaint narrow little streets. There was a festival on the weekend we visited, which added to the buzz.
