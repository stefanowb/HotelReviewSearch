It is a large hotel with extensive ground, huge pool area, big lobby, bar, poolside bar, huge breakfast floor etc. the rooms we were in (we had 2) were good size and recently updated with modern furniture, comfortable beds and were very clean. Breakfast was elaborate on a separate floor. Wi fi was also included but was only available in the lobby, which for us was not convenient. This hotel is frequented by European tourist mostly from nearby countries and from the Greek mainland so not much in the way of English translations. The front desk staff was trying hard and were friendly. The pool area and grounds were huge and beautiful with night activity around and in the bars. We had one of our toilets that did not work at night and apparently there was no maintenance man on duty (a bit odd because it is such a large hotel, I think over 200 rooms) but the clerk gave keys to another close by room to use until morning. When he later was doing his night audit, he forgot which room he gave and called to verify at 3:30 am(?). The manager when contacted apologized and made an adjustment.
