It is a non-smoking, non-pet hotel, which is fine. You sign and initial that you do not smoke/have pets, or you are charged an exorbitant fee. You would expect it to be fresh and clean smelling.....right? The problem is that the enitre property reeks of smoke and strange odors. It is dated, but clean. The smell is what really gets you. Obviously not an original Carlson property, but one that has been bought and refurbished. The rooms were small....we did not need a suite, so requested a king room. It was tight, to say the least. Great desk/chair, but no overstuffed chair for sitting/reading/relaxing. The bathroom is tiny, but clean. The towels were extremely thin and worn....definitely not a plus. Room had a microwave and fridge, but both had to be plugged in. Very strange. Great flat screen TV, and the staff seems to be family, and very friendly. The spa looked OK and usually had people in it, but the pool looked green. Gross! It was ok for the 2 nights we were here and gone all day, but definitely not a place you would want to hang out and relax. We stayed here due to the great price and proximity to St. Louis activities, but will not be back.", "title": "Not a fave!", "user": "bessiedear", "date": "June 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 67653101}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Where do I begin? Over the course of two nights, we had a total of three rooms. The first room had no tissue, no soap for the shower, the carpet had not been vacuumed, and it was very clear that housekeeping had made the bed without changing the sheets (there was hair in the bed). YUCK! The towel rack over the toilet was pulling out of the drywall. We complained at the front desk, and she cheerfully gave us another room. The air conditioner in this room was out of order. The third room had a broken towel rod over the sink. The overworked desk clerk was trying to run the front desk, bake the complimentary cookies, and do the laundry. She wasn't even supposed to be any of these -- she was supposed to be the night auditor. The breakfast area was a mess, as well. The tables were not being kept clean, the food was not being replenished, the orange juice was watered down, and no one was emptying the garbage container, so paper plates and cups and scraps of food were spilling onto the floor. The daytime desk clerk was trying to run the kitchen as well as the front desk. And this is purely personal: kids from the pool area were in the eating area with bare feet. Isn't that against the health code? When we requested that all charges be removed from our bill, the manager asked if we would like a free night.

My first impression was that the lobby area was not as clean/tidy as I might expect - nothing specific but just seemed a bit dingy. The room, however, was fine and the beds were good. There was a nice flat panel TV and the internet worked well. There did seem to be a problem with the bath/shower control - it appeared something was missing - and it was very hard to turn it totally off. Maybe because this was a room with 2 queen beds instead of a king there was no comfortable chair - just a straight-back chair.
