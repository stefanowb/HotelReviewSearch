It was just as I was led to expect. The location was great for my purposes. I could easily walk to the pickup point for tours ( near the Palacio Real) and had a good variety of restaurants to choose from within a five minute walk. Although I didn't use it, there is a Metro stop nearby as well. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet; and the breakfast buffet was excellent. The renovations are still going on so I had to use the lobby of the Tryp Menfis, attached to the Washington. The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Carol Sue C", "date": "September 22, 2005", "id": 3931088}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "have just got back from a Fantastic short break to Madrid and 4 nights in Tryp Washington Hotel.", "title": "Couldn't have been better!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "JodieBath", "date": "March 22, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3293477}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Disappointing", "text": "Excellent hotel, spotlessly clean, rooms fantastic with lovely bathroom and comfortable living space.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 7, 2005", "id": 3168075}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Iwas there last year & will definitely go back.", "text": "Fanastic room with a balony overlooking the amazing Gran Via.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 12, 2005", "id": 3002672}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good price and location", "text": "Would definately reccommend.

Demanding travelers who require sumptuous elegance both inside and out and who rely on obsequious hotel staff fretting over their every need will not enjoy this hotel. Clearly, scaffolding surrounds the fascade of both it and its sister hotel, the Tryp Menfis, and access to the Washington remains through the Menfis. Those details aside, the Washington boasts that feature which is most important to American travelers in Europe--a moderately sized, comfortably modern room. Ours boasted a double bed, new hard wood flooring, plenty of closet and storage space, updated electricity (with three additional outlets for heating pads, curling irons, etc.), AIR CONDITIONING THAT WORKED, a mini bar, a comfortable marble bath with high water pressure showerhead and abundant hot water, and reliable maid service. Two metro lines are withing minutes of the property, which is located at the western end of the Gran V\u00eda near Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, La Palacio Real, and the Opera district --where are located a range of lovely outdoor restaurants overlooking the palace. The hotel offers a breakfast service for 9E; however we preferred to purchase couissants from a local market and coffee from the (SURPRISE) Starbucks across the street, which saved both money and precious time. Another plus is that, though by no means out of the way, the hotel is significantly distanced from the throngs of tourists and Madrillenos that gather at venues such as Sol and Plaza de Cibeles and Plaza Mayor and Telef\u00f3nica Gran V\u00eda. Yet, those attractions are a comfortable stroll or convenient metro ride away. Also convenient is the presence, next door, of a local travel agency that offers inexpensive and informative day trips to locations beyond Madrid such as Toledo, Avila, Segovia, and El Escorial--which I heartily recommend to complete your central Spain experience. I heartily recommend the Tryp Washington and would not hesitate to stay there again upon future visits to this vibrant European capitol.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 21, 2006", "id": 5369551}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "This is a very good place to stay, and reasonably priced (on Expedia). We booked the \"Gran Via view room\" but when we checked in, our view was to the unpleasant and noisy rear of the hotel. We got the room changed without difficulty. The sound-proofing of the windows on the Gran Via side is excellent (not so on the rear). The room was comfortable and the bathroom was better than we expected. The breakfast, which was included, was AWESOME, making the overall stay an excellent value! The location was great, and about 50 yards to the subway entrance, which is a great way to get around Madrid. We could walk to many of the sites we wanted to see. The fact that the Tryp Washington lobby was closed for renovation was no problem at all. You simply enter through the Tryp Menfis lobby, take the elevator to your floor, and walk through a doorway in the hallway to get to your room. The desk staff was friendly enough, but didn't exactly go out of their way to be welcoming or helpful. One note of warning (and not the fault of the hotel): it is impossible to get a taxi from this hotel to the train station. When the cabs pull over and hear that you're not going to the airport, they just drive off. If you have luggage, the subway is difficult to negotiate because there are lots of stairs.", "title": "Very nice hotel.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "RandBrad", "date": "June 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5298354}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Terrible", "text": "This hotel was bad from the minute we arrived there, the door was close, because the hotel was in construction, we have to go inside from the Memphis hotel, the people in the front desk don't even said hello, not help us in anything. after we booking we went to the room, we have to go to the other side of the Memphis hotel and the walls where all derty, the room are small and the noise was terrible we can't sleep for two night and we stay there for 3 night, our room was in the back of the hotel ugly and derty view.
