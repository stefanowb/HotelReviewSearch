Resort is super kid friendly, lots of other families. Pool is nice not too many chairs and pool service is not always available. Rent a boat accross the street at Sea Forthe next to the Hyatt Hotel across the street, they had a much larger boat inventory. We fit 9 people on a pontoon boat, very fun and only $85/hr.
