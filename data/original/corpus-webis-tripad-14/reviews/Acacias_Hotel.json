We stayed here for two nights and the room we were allocated was very clean but absolutely tiny, too small for 2 adult travellers. The bathroom had no bath only a shower and was large enough for only one person at a time. There was no fridge and the balcony, which overlooked a building site, was only large enough to accomodate one of us (standing) at a time. A search for the pool proved fruitless (A 4 star hotel with no pool?) and the north facing sun lounge was some decking, two tables and four chairs and in permanent shade. We were half board and dinner was a buffet. The salad was not bad but the hot food was the usual hotel fare and was so tepid it was inedible. The breakfast was the same, again fruit cereal etc was fine but the eggs, bacon etc were too cold to eat. The location was ok, only a 5 minute walk to the beach, the hotel itself was very clean but I am afraid these are the only good points. Two days were as much as we could stand and whilst we can laugh about our experience now, I would advise anyone to give this hotel an extremely wide berth.", "title": "4 Star?, You are having a laugh.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Gedski", "date": "July 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 8121155, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 The room"}}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Catalonia", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 21, "very good": 36, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 31}, "aka": "Acacias Hotel Lloret De Mar", "slim_ranking": 0.292307692308}
