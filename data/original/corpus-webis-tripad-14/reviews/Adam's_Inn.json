The location was decent although I would not walk in the back alley by myself at night. We needed a room that could handle three people and were given a room on the third floor.

This was on top of the fact it was a very hot time in Washington running in the high 90's when we arrived and the Inn was not air conditioned in the hallways or any other part of the house other than our room.
