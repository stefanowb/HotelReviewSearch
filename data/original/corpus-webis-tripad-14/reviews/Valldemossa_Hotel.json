However, we felt it was let down by the quality & variety of food in the restaurant. We were there for 11 days & there was not enough choice if we had chosen to eat there every night. Two places to eat in Valldemossa village are \"Costa Nord\" for lunch (& dinner when they are open) & a MUST is dinner at \"Ses Espigues\", just for the experience. This place has so much clutter it's amazing & service is very friendly & foods OK too.", "title": "Great location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Scallywag", "date": "May 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5044082}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "stayed for 3 nights with my daughters after a villa holiday in jul 05. perfect location - 5 mins walk from valldemossa centre.", "title": "stunning location", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "wispabar", "date": "March 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4569223}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Magical", "text": "fantastic welcome - complimentary glass of champagne on the terrace (awesome views!) before showing us to our room. bedroom was gorgeous - so comfortable, spacious & stylish. marble 5* bathroom - top!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "roscopcoltraine", "date": "December 30, 2005", "id": 4311549}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "we had our own walled patio outside with wooden loungers, marble topped table & chairs and even an olive tree for shade.", "title": "Food has deteriorated", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Paul S", "date": "October 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4055913}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 7, "very good": 15, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 55}, "aka": "Valldemossa Hotel Majorca", "slim_ranking": 0.75}
