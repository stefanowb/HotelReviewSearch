We were very plesantly surprised to find that the bell attendant (Cort) recognized us from our visit last July. Cort, the concierge and the valet staff were incredibly helpful in giving us directions-by car and on foot-to various places around Portland. We indulged in their Sunday brunch and were definitely not disappointed. The price is very reasonable-about what we would have paid for one of us at Salty's restaurant in Seattle for their Sunday brunch. The London Grill's brunch at the Benson featured a huge array of foods; seafood, chicken, vegetable dishes, salads, made to order omlets, a carved meat station, and a gorgeous desert section. The London Grill's dining room is very elegant and because it's on the lower level of the hotel, it has a sweeping staircase that makes you feel like you are making a grand entrance. I was happy to discover that there are restrooms on the restaurant level, since last time I didn't know this and walked back into the main lobby. There is also an elevator on the restaurant floor for those who don't want to use the stairs. The Sunday brunch is well worth the indulgence and it made for a wonderful way to end our stay. We love the fact that the Benson is a Coast Hotel, since we have a Coast Rewards card. I highly recomend getting one, even if you only stay at this hotel once. The benefits are great. We had express check in and even though I got a great room rate online ($119), the hotel must have given us a larger room. It was much more spacious than the room we had last year. Will continue to frequent this hotel. It has a great location. Yes, the parking is expensive, but when you are treated like this, who cares? A few negatives... Housekeeping neglected to refill our toilet paper in the bathroom. Fortunately I found the extra roll in the closet and just changed it myself. Given that we have yet to have bad service here, I think it was just an oversight. Another negative would be the noise from outside the hotel. It continued until well past 2am. Unfortunately, the hotel really can't do much about noise coming from a few streets over through the window.", "title": "We kicked off our PacNW trip in Portland...", "user": "beanstravels", "date": "July 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 72211524}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We kicked off our PacNW trip in Portland and stayed at the Benson for 3 nights.
