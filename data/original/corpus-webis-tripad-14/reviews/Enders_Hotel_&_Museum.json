We had a long table in the back room and were able to see the geyser as we were eating. Service was cheerful and efficient, and everyone was happy with their meals. Later, we visited the museum and were also given good service in the gift shop. Great to see a nice restoration of a historic building.", "user": "BarbaraElizabeth", "date": "August 15, 2013", "id": 172418003}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "My wife and I had happened on the Enders Hotel and Museum, out of luck on a previous trip.

The rooms were very clean and the shampoo, etc. were above average for hotels. The rooms were small and cramped due to too much furniture. Although the added pieces, which appeared to be antiques, added to the \"old timey\" theme they were impracticle and the extra space would have been more appreciated. It is next to a railroad crossing and a train sounds about every two hours throughout the night.My husband and our two children had to rent two rooms since they do not have rooms with two beds. My daughter and I shared one and my husband and son shared another. My husband went to sleep so my son stayed in my room until a movie we were watching was over at midnight. When he went to return to his room we could not get the key to work. I sent him to the front desk to ask for help. He returned with another key which worked. He then told me that no one was at the front desk. She was gone for the night. But all the room keys are right there at the front desk with big room numbers on them. Pretty scary to think that in the middle of the night any other guest, or someone from the restraunt could obtain your room key easily and give you a surprise visit in the middle of the night. During the day the desk help waitresses in the adjoining restraunt. I was waiting a long time for a receipt while she waitressed (not her fault that they are understaffed) so I went around the desk and copied it myself. Anyone had plenty of time to take as many room keys as I would have liked and returned that night. Still note that the rooms were clean, a big plus, but not getting murdered in your sleep, well, that kindof trumps the good housekeeping.We won't stay here again.", "title": "Horribly Rude & I will NEVER stay here", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Ameilia Q", "date": "August 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 136261870}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Soda Springs"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 0, "very good": 8, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "Enders Hotel And Museum", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333}
