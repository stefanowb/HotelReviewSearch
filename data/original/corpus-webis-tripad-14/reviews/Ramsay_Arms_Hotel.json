The staff was very friendly, and their selection of food items (fairly traditional scottish menu items, e.g. angus beef, local fish, lamb, game, shellfish) was very satisfactory indeed. Food was tasty, well-prepared and the portions were large, which suited myself, being a hungry traveller. The selection of beer & wine seemed quite decent as well. The hotel and restaurant had a good, warm feel to it. I am certain anyone travelling in Scotland and looking for the \"authentic\" experience will enjoy dining or staying at this establishment.", "title": "Charming place, good food", "user": "mijansso", "date": "October 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 119937968}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "This is the 2nd time I have stayed at The Ramsay Arms Hotel and again we had a brilliant time.
