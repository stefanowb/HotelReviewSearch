We were there for several nights. We were in the cottage which was not in the main house. The view of Mount Rainer and the water was wonderful, even with the utility wires in the way. The food was great. You prepare your own breakfast so you don't have to get up and dressed at a set time. There was fresh fruit and fresh pastries every morning, along with eggs, cheese, yogurt and juice. Lovely, big chairs to sit in and two great outdoor sitting areas. There was a washer/dryer. The house was on a dead end street so it was very quiet. We were very comfortable and will stay here again when we are back in the Seattle area.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "May100", "date": "August 31, 2007", "id": 8590077}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "After 10 days traveling through Canada and the US we arrived at this gem overlooking Puget Sound for a six night stay.

Rainier on the other. On top of the fact that you couldn't ask for better surroundings, the service and amenities were truly exceptional. The cottage was beautiful, with wall-to-wall windows to take in the views through and plenty of cozy spots to relax and unwind in.
