We got a very good deal on 1800hotels.ie for 380 euro for 3 nights including breakfast. Our room on the 3rd floor was very clean and roomy and the reception and dining room staff were very helpful and friendly.The location of the hotel is excellent,and is only 200metres from the main train station. The breakfast was superb with a huge choice of food and of very high quality. This hotel is of a high standard but it should be advertised as 4 star. Paul Mooney.
