The rooms were small, but they were comfortable and nicely furnished. The public rooms were ornate with lots of gold trim here and there and elaborately tiled floors. The most beautiful place in the hotel was their small pool in the front next to which they served their included buffet breakfast, again with pines overhead and views of the sea beyond. Relaxing and lovely. To get to our room we had to walk up a flight of stairs and cross an open tiled balcony\u2014a sort of outdoor public terrace. There was a table with cracked vase sitting forlornly in the area which suggested they could use some sprucing up but overall the place was well attended and a real bargain for what it provided.

The welcoming professional staff upon seeing his grey face and my stressed out look, sent a tray of camomile tea and dry toast to the room to settle his stomach and my nerves. And what a room, and the view and atmosphere. The romantic holiday was back on. We ended up extending our stay. Our visit to Axel Munthe's Villa San Michele was a highlight and I am busy reading his biography and missing Capri immensely since we returned last week. The hotel was the best we stayed in 4 weeks in Italy . The breakfast is worth a mention. Quality food and ingredients and wonderful service.

The location is unbeatable in our opinion - on Via Tragara - the most beautiful walking street on the island just a few minutes past the action of the main Piazzetta. A few minutes past the gorgeous shops and the crowds trickle away and - especially at night - you are left with twinkling lights, honeysuckle scented air, and beautiful hotels and homes.
