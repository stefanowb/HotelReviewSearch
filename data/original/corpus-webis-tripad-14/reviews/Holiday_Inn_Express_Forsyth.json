The interior layout is a little confusing at first, too, because of side entrances that come into the same hallway.

Out of the few basic choices I feel that the Holiday Inn Express is a fair one. Work booked the stay for me. Check in was easy and smooth. They have a guest breakfast each morning which compared to others I have had it was fairly good. The nice lady taking care of the guests in the morning is very hard working. A tip: It is one of the few hotels still offering smoking rooms. If you don\u2019t smoke avoid the fourth floor. I am a smoker so it was nice for me but the hallway smell makes you feel like you are in an ashtray. No big deal to the smokers who enjoy the convenience of not running outside all night. If you\u2019re not a smoker\u2026floor 1 and 2 will do you. The hotel is right off of I-75 so it\u2019s convenient for a quick stop overnight. The Georgia Police Training Center is close so many of the guests are police and sheriff deputies attending training. They were all very nice and quiet. It\u2019s a safe place to stop. Don\u2019t expect the four-star feel of traditional Holiday Inn\u2019s in trendy spots. This is not a trendy town but the hotel will serve its purpose. You have an Ingles and CVS right across the street and are two minutes from the local fast food row.
