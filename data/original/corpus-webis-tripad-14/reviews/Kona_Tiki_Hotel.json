The noise from the surf - if you have read the other reviews here, you know the noise from the surf is loud. When we initially read them, we couldn't help but be amused. We figured...how loud could it be? If anything, it was one of the things we were most looking forward to. Well, we learned. First, I will emphasize that we did get used to it. However, we think its only fair to try to give upcoming guests a realistic view of what to expect. This is not the soothing sound of waves gently breaking against the sand. Its more like the full surging power of the ocean crashing furiously against the rocks and wall...which in turn was amplified inside of the room. We were torn as to whether it was closer to the sound of a freight train outside our window all night or 747s taking off continuously. The doors/window do not block much (if any) of the noise - plus, with no a/c, shutting the windows also blocks out the breeze. The upside though - after the 2nd night, we had gotten used to it and had no problems sleeping the rest of the stay. Another plus to it is that it drowns out the road noise which would have been terrible if it weren't for the waves.

Originally we were at the Manago Hotel in Captain Cook, but found that to be to far from what we wanted to be doing in this area (see review of the Manago for comparison). When we decided to check out of the Manago, I had the Kona Tiki in my mind as a back up hotel. We drove to the hotel first thing in the AM, to see if we could get a room. We were told that they had an available room as someone did not show up, but they had someone on a waiting list before us. If that person did not take it, they would call us. Less than 15 minutes after we left, we got a call that we could have the room if we would be willing to change rooms during our stay. We agreed to it and told them we would be there in a couple of minutes. As we pulled into the parking lot, we saw another car leaving. The person who was on the waiting list and first said no, changed there mind and would take the room with the change.

The bathrooms in both rooms we stayed in were small, in fact we joked that you had to back in. The parking lot was not big enough for 15 cars. In order to overcome this, the last two cars in parked right in the center of the lot and put their keys in a lock box. If someone wanted to leave before those cars had been moved, the owner takes the keys from the box and moves the cars so you can get yours out. They even block traffic with the last car, so you could get out easier.

The ocean is close as you are going to find at any facility as are many ocean activities. From our lanai we could see both whales and surfers. In fact, it was the closest we came to someone surfing as he would surf right past our balcony. We got a lot of great pictures. The rooms were large, clean and had comfortable beds. We stayed in rooms at the opposite ends of the building (106 and 201). We did not notice road noise in 106, but did in 201, though the ocean helped to drown it out. Each room has a refrigerator and not just a pint sized one. The refrigerators were fairly decent in size, when compared with the ones in a normal hotel. If you are not in a kitchenette room, you could still cook as the hotel provided two small gas grills and two small charcoal grills. Since there are only 15 rooms, you get to meet and talk to other guests. Many of them when we were there had been coming for years and knew each other. That did not preclude them from inviting us to join them either for breakfast or an evening of watching the sunset and just visiting. We even got to light the torches they have on the property and to blow the conch shell prior to lighting each one (my wife could blow it, I couldn\u2019t!). Speaking of breakfast, there was an ample breakfast of fruit, muffins and hot cinnamon buns (kept in a warming tray), in addition they had juice and Kona coffee also available.
