It is a standard Mercure, our twin room was fairly small but clean, quite modern, beds were comfortable. Location was excellent. Bathroom clean and quite spacious. Only gripe was the AC - i had the temperature turned down as low as possible but it didnt seem to do anything - so had to open the window to cool down, which then meant we heard every police car/ambulance that went buy during the night. I would definitely stay here again as it is great value at \u00a360 but make sure the room temperature control works first.", "title": "Great value, excellent location.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bellmeister", "date": "April 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14932102, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Room too hot."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "For a little over \u00a350 per night for a single room, this hotel is good value though not particularly memorable as such. The \u00a350 gets you a single room with a single bed in a very small room with a modern en-suite facility, though no bath (a bath wont fit in such a small room). The rooms, though pretty non-descript, were comfortable and quiet, though the air-con didnt seem to really do anything but make noise, so I switched it off. The staffare professional and courteus, but that's it really. Not a specialhotel, but comfortable, located in between the Kongisalle and the train station. Good base from which to explore nearby Cologne and Bonn. Breakfast is \u00a312 per day extra, which is ridiculously expensive, considering the restaurant and bar are tiny. As such didnt opt for brekky so cannot vouch for the quality of the food. Note, also there's no room service or much food about the place. In summary, a well located and comfortable, good value but average hotel.", "title": "Comfortable hotel, friendly service, good location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BarcaBoys", "date": "March 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 14655378, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Small boring rooms - also 2.5 Euros for a small bag of crips?!?"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel is situated about 300 metres from the Hauptbahnhof and about 10-15 minutes walk from the Koningsalle and Altstadt, altough Dusseldorf in itself is very walkable.", "title": "Great hotel by the Hauptbanhof", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "outrun78", "date": "January 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12634190}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Hotel has been recently modernised and rooms are of an ok sized.
