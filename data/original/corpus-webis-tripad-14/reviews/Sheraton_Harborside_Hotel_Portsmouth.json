We have three children, 7, 5, and 2. We decided to stay at the Sheraton, b/c it is close to Kittery and it is close to the water...not like we were swimming, but we are New England ocean people, even in the winter. Anyway, the rates we received were a great value for the hotel. We paid about a $100 a night, and we've stayed in other hotels for more money that weren't nearly as nice as this place.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JSRI", "date": "February 19, 2007", "id": 6811505}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007", "text": "Pros?

I had never been to Portsmouth, and upon arrival, I thought the view and location were perfect for the nautical theme of the occasion. The hotel is in a perfect location to downtown Portsmouth. The lobby, restaurant, and banquet rooms are spacious and inviting. Views of the water can be seen from the hotel and are beautiful. The hotel is an odd shape, so it was a little challenging to find the rooms. Also, the suites have a private entrance to the hallway, which is a nice touch if you are paying the money, but when you are in a wedding party, it is a major pain. People had to go to the front desk to be admitted to the private elevator, and the same staff, though they saw me 15 times in one day, continued to ask for my ID for \"security\" reasons. The rooms are very small, and somewhat outdated unless you are staying on the 4th floor. I could have sworn that my room was a smoking room, but the hotel is a non-smoking hotel. Perhaps it was recently converted. Also, beware if you have a waterfront view. The sunrise, though incredible, will awaken you at 5am. Also, some of the wedding party had a parking lot light shining through the room the entire night. Just figure out how to close the curtains if you can, and you'll be fine. I am being very picky in this review, but I feel that people have a right to know the details of what they are getting into. For the occasion, the hotel was ideal in terms of location, wedding, cost, and convenience to the activities downtown. Just know that this hotel is obviously a little older, and might need some updates here and there. Also, if you are interested in working out, there is a gym downstairs with one treadmill, bike, and efx each, and a weight system. Finally, there is no convenient store within walking distance but a small one located at the front desk in the lobby, and vending machines downstairs. I definitely recommend this hotel if you want to stay in downtown Portsmouth. As well, it made for a beautiful wedding reception location.", "title": "Sheraton Portsmouth - Great Location", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "AngelMel", "date": "July 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8241644, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 smell in the room"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2003, traveled as a couple", "text": "I'm planning another trip through the area so I checked out this place on Tripadvisor.
