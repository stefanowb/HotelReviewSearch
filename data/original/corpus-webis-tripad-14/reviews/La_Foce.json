The whole experience was amazing. Our three room apartment - with 1.5 bathes - was perfect for the two of us. Our delicious welcoming dinner was prepared for us in out apartment because there was no one else to share it.- we dine well in Italy and this was the best food we had the entire three week trip - including a week spend on a six star luxury cruise to Croatia and Greece. The grounds and gardens are absolutely beautiful - being groomed in spring for their summer splendor. La Foce is the perfect place from which to base Tuscan travels.

La Foce was fantastic for a rustic Tuscan vacation with our 3 small children. Staff were so kind and helpful and the grounds are beautiful. I couldn't stop staring at our marvelous view. Take the time to drive around and explore all the lovely small villages. The unexpected small things are what you will most remember-- for us, it was the sheep crossing on our way to Pienza and the large package of vanilla wafers the kids purchased for just 50 Euros in Radicofani. The labyrinth in Chiusi was super cool for the kids (and spooky for me), but be sure to check the tour times as they are infrequent. Wish we could've seen the tombs and catacombs, but we didn't time it right. Be sure to visit Osteria Aquavechia in Montepulciano for a unique dining experience and La Porta- Daria is as wonderful as all the bloggers say.
