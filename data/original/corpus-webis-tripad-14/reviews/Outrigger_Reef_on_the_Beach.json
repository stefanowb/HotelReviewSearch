After all, how much time does anyone actually stay in their room? Once you're by the beach or the pool the noise is minimal (mostly drowned out by kids enjoying the pool or patrons cheering their team on at the pool side sports bar!), The staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful (especially the housekeeping staff) and the room was spotlessly clean on arrival and kept that way during my two week stay. This hotel is by far the cheapest on the beach and yes, that's probably reflected in the out dated decor etc. but I'd rather put up with some 80's wallpaper than pay another $200 per night. My room on this stay was booked through hotelnow[--] and cost $175 per night. It was on the 9th floor (room 959) and overlooked the pool and had a partial view of the ocean. There were two Queen size beds plus a double sofa bed - all for me!!! The food, as per the last time I stayed, was excellent and the bar and waiting staff are very attentitivie.

There was a reasonably sized pool and 4 places to eat. we had breakfast (buffet style but you can pick your meat and request how you want it cooked) in the restaurant right by the beach and had the delight of watching a beautiful morning wedding ceremony take place on the Waikiki beach. as you would imagine there was a great variety for breakfast with so much fresh fruit its unbelieveable. also cereals, cooked meat, yoghurts, breads etc..the beach was right on the hotel's doorstep and went on for miles. lots of nice clean sand and also a playground on grass for the children. to the right of the hotel you get a fabulous view of Diamond Head Crater. we had dinner in the restaurant overlooking the beach. the food was out of this world. the waiter was so friendly and gave us tips on what to do/see and also where else to eat on the island. im vegetarian and found i had a good choice off the menu. each morning we would come down to breakfast to see different activities taking place - basket weaving, lei making, hula dancing etc.. the children loved it.", "title": "Ocean Tower Open-All New!!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "mondo36", "date": "May 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7714859, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 All the rooms are updated and just opened as of May 12, 2007", "disliked": "\u2014 construction is still ongoing on other parts of the hotel"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "we had hired a car from the airport but did find th edirections a little confusing getting to the hotel(dont drive in Honolulu at rush hour - mad!) and even more bizarre trying to get out of the city.

The pool looked great (we didn't use it). The Shore Bird restaurant was excellent and being right on the beach was wonderful.
