This is a very over rated hostel, while the room was clean it was overlooking the street (we were on the 5th floor) and the street and bar noise was so excessive and that combined with the heat as there is not air conditioning or fans meant that we didn't sleep for 2 nights. We were very disappointed as at 80 euros a night for the room were were expecting much more. The breakfast was poor and they wouldn't allow us to access the bottled water fountain during the day. We left and payed an additional 5 euros for a room in the Ibis much closer to town.", "title": "Give this place a miss", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "T-A-UK", "date": "July 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 8256999}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006", "text": "Stayed here for two nights with my sister in December 2006.", "title": "Private twin room - very nice", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "connaught", "date": "March 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7185071, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 good price", "disliked": "\u2014 high internet cost"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We decided to stay in a youth hostel as the price was a lot lower than twin rooms in hotels in Munich.", "title": "great for the price....", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ccc02e", "date": "January 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6558285, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 not an all female dorm"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006", "text": "Good things:", "title": "Eh.
