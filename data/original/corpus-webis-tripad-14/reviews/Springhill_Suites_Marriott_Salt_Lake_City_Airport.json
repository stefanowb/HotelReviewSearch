The room was great and our boys thought it was one of the coolest rooms they ever stayed in. The room had a great design and decorating to it. It was very clean and spacious. It had a sitting area with a large desk which would be great for the business person. There was a glass partition that seperated that area from the beds. The beds had duvet covers, which I tend to hope are cleaner than the normal bedspread. The room had two bathrooms that had pocket doors - one had a sink and shower/tub and the other had the toilet and another sink. Both pocket doors had a frosted glass inlay to provide light. The room also came with a frig and a microwave. The breakfast was very good - both good hot and cold choices. There was plenty of room in the breakfast area and nothing was lacking. We did not use the pool. Considering location near the airport, it was also a very quiet hotel.", "title": "Nice suprise", "user": "ChrisClarkston", "date": "October 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 141797759}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at this hotel in August and September 2012.

I like the roominess, but my biggest complaint was that the thermostat was in the sitting area and the AC/heater blew across the bed and had little impact on the thermostat. The room was warm when I first entered, but if you turned down the thermostat, you would freeze in bed from the icy wind blowing across you.

We stayed (at a different hotel) in Salt Lake City the first night of our vacation and have to say that this one was far better than the first for about $20 less. The hotel feels updated and modern. The pictures on their website are fairly true to life. Our king suite was clean and spacious. We had to leave too early in the morning to be able to sample their hot buffet breakfast, but we were grateful that they had the cold food out earlier than the hot, and we were able to grab a bite to eat before heading back to the airport. We were also able to print our boarding passes for free on their lobby computer. Room noise was average, except for a tractor trailer with a very loud engine that was parked in the parking lot not far from our window for some unknown reason in the middle of the night.
