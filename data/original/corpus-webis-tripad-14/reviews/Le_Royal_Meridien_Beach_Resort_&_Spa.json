The hotel was recommend to me by my parents as they have stayed on several occasions and loved it and was also very impressed by the reviews on trip advisor. The hotel gardens and beach are fantastic. We lay at the beach everyday on the luxurious sunbeds away from the busy main pool. I have stayed at larger resorts in dubai like jumeriah beach hotel and preferred the hotel grounds of le royal meridian as more accessible for walking in the heat and doesn't feel like your room is a long way away. The room was large and exceptionally clean and had everything we would need, the house keeper was especially good at giving us plenty of water everyday therefore never had to buy any during our stay. We had 2 queen beds even tho we'd requested a king but this was not an issue. The room however was dated amd could do with some modernisation. The bathroom was very small and in a 5 star hotel I expect a separate bath and shower. Although dated nothing looks tired or worn. The hotel is on a fantastic location at the very start of the jumeriah beach walk therefore never felt trapped into getting a taxi every night to go for dinner. Unlike other Dubai hotels I've stayed in, the staff although incredibly friendly never got to know us or remembered our faces.
