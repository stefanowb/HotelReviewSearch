Our room was fairly small but recently refurbished , clean and well equipped in standard business hotel style. With temperatures of 40 degrees outside we were very grateful for the effective air conditioning. Breakfast was very good, although the range of hot food was limited as is common in Romania. There were only a small number of non-smoking tables and these were in range of the smoke haze, but again this is a common problem. Staff on reception were very helpful whenever we needed them and spoke excellent english. We did not dine in the hotel as their offering was limited, but thre are plenty of options nearby and we particularly liked the lakeside restaurant in Cismigiu Gardens. Overall, good value for a good quality city centre hotel.", "title": "A good quality hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Steve-G23", "date": "August 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8438159, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 High level of comfort in a convenient location", "disliked": "\u2014 Smokers in the breakfast restaurant"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel far exceeded my expectations. The room was nicely furnished with all that one needs. The bathrooms were obviously recently redone. There is great waterpressure from the showers and plenty of hot water. The breakfast, which is included, is a buffet style breakfast with breads, meats, cheeses, cereals, jams, etc. The bar/lounge area is nice, but pricier compared to most regular restaurants in the area for drinks. It also closes at 11pm, which is earlier than one would think.
