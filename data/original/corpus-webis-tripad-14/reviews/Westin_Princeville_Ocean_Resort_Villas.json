The front staff found a perfect location for us. Building 4 facing the ocean and the golf course. It was definitely worth to pay the upgrade fee. They also so moved us from a studio to a one bedroom suit. Once you stay here you can go to Saint Regis which is two miles away. There is a shuttle that goes there on the hour or you can go with your car and valet service is complementary. Saint Regis is the top brand for the starwood hotels. The beach area is very relaxing and I took my snorkeling equipment on the second day. There is a nice reef with lots of fish. You can eat and drink there and charge it to your room. It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it. There is a bar in the lobby which has a terrace area over looking the ocean and the Hanalei bay. If you go here you have to stay and watch the sunset. The view is unbelievable. This was a great trip for our marriage bounding and I think the Westin is great choice. I have three kids which i was happy to leave behind.

The room was more than large enough for us, and although the kitchen would not support cooking a full meal, we made salads, full breakfasts, and indulged in ahi tuna poke from the local Foodland for dinner.

Although they only did maid service once during our stay, they provided plenty of clean towels and we didn't mind straightening our sheets ourselves each morning. They did remove our trash each morning when we left it outside our door. The grounds on this resort are amazingly beautiful and well maintained, and it truly felt like walking through botonical gardens. Although we were asked to participate in a timeshare presentation, there was no pressure whatsoever when we politely declined. Plus, they gave us some really good sightseeing and restaurants tips! We ate at the market for breakfast once, and it was really nice. Fresh food, reasonable prices - not sure what some of the complaints are about? We also enjoyed the affiliation with the St. Regis. We walked the 4 miles roundtrip to the resort in the mornings, and returned there using valet parking later in the day to enjoy the beach area. Really nice arrangement. We also played golf at the Makai Golf Resort twice, which was really, really nice. Would recommend this resort to my friends. However, will mention that the weather was significantly cooler than Maui, which we went to after leaving Kaua'i. Although I could wear shorts, I did have to wear a light jacket and long sleeve shirt to be comfortable. This is probably typically for February, but I was a little surprised.

The suite itself is packed with everything one would need for a week's stay -- complete kitchen (dishwasher, coffee maker, toaster oven, electric stove/over, large fridge, dishes, cutlery, pots/pans, etc.). The living room sofa turned into a sofa-bed, and, frankly, it was not very comfortable. The separate bedroom (with separate TV) was very nice with kingsize bed, though we felt the king size pillows were wayyyyyyyyyy too soft. The bathroom was large and there was a extra large jacuzzi that we never used. They provided adequate numbers of towels and there was a hair dryer if needed. And also a washer/dryer in a separate closet! we had a ground floor room in building 3. I usually prefer a higher floor because privacy can be an issue but this time I just accepted it and it turned out to be no issue. Our patio opened across from one of the \"plunge\" pools (large enough to get wet and move around a bit, too small to do laps) and a heated whirlpool. These areas are meant to be quiet zones and those guests with younger children stayed near the larger swimming pools, so you could actually stretch out by the plunge pool with a book and relax. Now, as others have noted, there is no upgrade for Starwood members. Also, while every other starwood hotel I've stayed at offers an extended checkout of 4pm, the Westin insisted on 11am -- one hour later than the regular 10a checkout. This was quite inconvenient as our flight was at 5:30p. But if there was really one nit to pick it is the housekeeping schedule. We usually left by mid-morning and until I complained, housekeeping did not come until very late in the afternoon -- 3:30-4p. This meant that after a morning/afternoon sojourn, we returned seveal times to rooms that had not been straightened.

The beds/bath were clean and the room nice and quite. The full kitchen was stocked nicely to meet your basic cooking/brewing needs. The main pool, an infinity pool, was very nice and my kids enjoyed the kiddie pool. (Note: We stayed at the Westin Resort Villas in Maui, and found the pool here smaller). We ate most mornings at the on-site restaurant- nice buffet for $20A/$10Kid. There was no extra charge for the WiFi but they did impose a $13/night parking fee. Service was friendly. We had one issue with our stay and that was when we noticed that the prev occupants spilled something on the carpet that became sticky-like once it dried(juice possibly).

Took a canyon hike in Keokee- absolutely beautiful though the extra trek to the fall was underwhelming.
