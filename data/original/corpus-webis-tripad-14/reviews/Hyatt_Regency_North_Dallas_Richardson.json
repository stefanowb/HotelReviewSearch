I was a little apprehensive to stay at the hotel due to previous reviews, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms have been upgraded and include very comfortable beds/bedding. My room had two queen beds and was rather small, but comfort was not an issue as a single traveler. I had no problem with the air or the hot water as mentioned by earlier guests. In fact, the hot water was immediate when switched on which was quite nice. The room that I was in was on the 6th floor and overlooked I-75.
