We are in our 40's This is our second trip to Turkey. The Marmara sits on a 3000 year old archaelogical site. It towers over the whole city with a Million Dollar view. Get a ocean view room and pay the extra. The staff is off the scale and professionaly trained. We met staff from other hotels that told us it was their dream to work at the Marmara. We had room # 1720. It was incredible. Breakfast is european and complete. Food at lunch and dinnrer are way over priced, eat in town for a 6 dollar cab ride or a 10 minute walk.", "title": "The Best Location in Bodrum, dont be fooled by others", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "TimHagel", "date": "September 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10002504, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 staff", "disliked": "\u2014 food prices"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "I am an active runner, I visted all the other 5 star Bodrum hotels, they cant touch the Marmara.

The views were absolutely STUNNING from both the pool and my room. It was probably the best pool hotel I have ever been to, not too crowded, just a perfect mix of interesting people, Cafe del Mar playing in the background, tasty pool food and great drinks. The interior design was beautiful, it has a good feel through out with a cleaver mix of old with new. If you want a couple days to kick back and do nothing but relax by the pool, I could not think of a better place, the second best pool hotel would have to be at the Faena Hotel and Universe in Buenos Aries, but the view from the Pool at the Marmara is priceless and makes it the winner.", "title": "Excellent Hotel, Staff not Trained", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "SurfaceTravel", "date": "September 12, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8701376, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 Service"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Very Disappointing", "text": "At night there were a couple fun places such as a bar called Cuba, and a couple other places at the port, also the Yacht Club had a wonderful live band.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Heley1", "date": "September 4, 2007", "id": 8617894}], "location": {"country": "Turkey", "region": "Turkish Aegean Coast", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 15, "average": 23, "very good": 88, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 297}, "aka": "The Marmara Bodrum Hotel Bodrum", "slim_ranking": 0.0265486725664, "description": "The medieval castle, built by The Knights of St John, guards Bodrum's dazzling blue bay at the confluence of the Aegean and Mediterranean seas. The city has a lively atmosphere that draws the socialites and, being the cultural centre of Turkish art, the connoisseurs, too. The Marmara Bodrum, stands high above the town from whose restaurant, Tuti, you can enjoy the panorama whilst savouring Mediterranean cuisine. The hotel's glamour blends with its natural surroundings whilst providing all the modern comforts and amenities of a world-class hotel. Each of its air-conditioned luxury bedrooms and suites are splendidly appointed. The fully equipped fitness centre includes a Jacuzzi, sauna and an authentic Turkish Bath.
