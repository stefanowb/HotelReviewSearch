The rooms still retain some of the original charm but have been updated with new baths and gas fireplaces. The great secret of this inn is the location. It is located in the heart of downtown sandwiched between main street and the ocean. The location is historically known as \"the field\" where three large victorian homes were built set way back from the ocean. All three homes exist today and are inns. You can not hear or see downtown from the inn you can catch a glimpse of the ocean from some of the rooms in the inn. The beauty is that you can park at the inn and walk to anything downtown or walk thru \"the field\" and take the mile long ocean walk that winds down the ocean front. I go to Bar Harbor to hike in Acadia National Park and at the end of the day I am tired. It is great to come back to the inn and go to the pantry where there are always hot coffee or tea and a cookie and then sit by the fire. The present owners have been there seven years and did extensive renovations to bring the inn back to it's beautiful self. Breakfast is always delicious and filling. I have been going to Bar Harbor every year for twenty years (I also live in Maine) and I would highly recommend this inn. Every morning at breakfast I listened to the innkeepers help vacationers decide what to do and where to go to have a great time in Bar Harbor and they gave great advice.

This is a completely restored \"summer cottage\" (meaning huge summer home) of a wealthy original owner. The architectural details and quality of the original construction are wonderful and the restoration very competently done. Our room was extremely large, had a gas fireplace, comfortable king bed, lights wherever you needed them, multiple seating areas with lights and tables, large bathroom with plenty of space to spread your personal items out, flat screen TV. The breakfasts were inventive with interesting choices between a sweet or savory main course (which is good since Tom and I have diametrically opposite tastes in breakfast food - I don't like sweet breads and pastries and he doesn't like heavy meat/egg ladened breakfasts). There is a guest pantry with complementary drinks including wine, ice, dishes, utensils, glasses and refrigerator so you don't have to bother any one to get these items. There is always a nice snack available (brownies or cookies). The public areas are large, including several fireplaces), with comfortable seating, ample reading material, places to play cards, etc. There are loaner umbrellas for inclement weather. This was one of the most expensive B&Bs we stayed at on this three week trip but it was worth it! It is located in the middle of Acadia National park so a great place to base yourself. Too bad the weather was rainy and cloudy while we were there. The only other place meriting a Tom \"perfection\" rating was the Goldener Hirsch in Salzburg Austria so pretty high bar.

The common pantry was generously stocked with coffee, soft drinks, homemade cookies/pastries and fruit throughout the day. Our room, #3, was roomy and bright with a generous sitting area that included an upholstered chair and love seat facing the fireplace - a wonderful setting to read or relax after a hard day of sightseeing. Jeff and Terri, the owners, were very attentive as were the other staff. Though we are not breakfast people, the morning breakfast fare was exceptional and served in a lovely seated dining area.
