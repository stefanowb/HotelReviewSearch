We decided to book the best reviewed hotel there--the Portofino Bay Hotel--which looked gorgeous! When we arrived it WAS beautiful and the service seemed great. The hotel was only 30% filled, so it was easy to get good service. The room was large and we did get the King Bed we asked for. We went off to City Walk for dinner and a night out which was close by. We returned to the room at 11:30 pm and I turned the sheets down (turn down service apparantly did not happen in our room!). Immediately I noticed large spots of blood all over the white sheets up near the pillow area. This was most definitely the most repulsive thing I've ever seen. We called the front desk, were put on hold for 15 min (keep in mind the hotel is NOT busy). Finally we were told that someone from housekeeping would be up to change the sheets. I said that it was disgusting to have to sleep in the bed that had dirty, bloody sheets and could we move? They said they had no rooms ready for us but they'd cover the bed well!!!! YUCK. ONE HOUR later the housekeeping team came up and started to remove the sheets. The head housekeeper made a repulsed face when he saw the blood and said \"sorry for that!\". Then they found out that they brought queen sheets so had to leave and get King sheets. Meanwhile, we're tired, want to sleep (so much for romance!) and it's now 1am!! Finally by 1:30 we get new sheets. IT's not a good sleep at all........", "helpfulness": 30, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 10, 2006", "id": 4335793}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Would definitely return to Portofino", "text": "The next morning I went to the desk where they had a coupon for us for two mornings of free breakfasts for our bloody sheet incident(buffet only).

I needed to buy emergency aspirin and one of the hotel stores was open at 7am but a word of advice - bring plenty from home!

I had requested a Bay View room, near main lobby, foam pillows (allergies to down feathers)and as a LoewsFirst member, the local paper and fruit and water at check in. We got a Bay View room way over on the west wing. It was hard to see the plaza from the room, but we were near the water taxi. I had called twice to confirm my requests prior to vacation, and they said they had them. They also said they could see them on my reservation when I went down to the front desk to ask about why the requested items were not there. They said they were trying to get the pillows, (we got them later that night before we went to bed), and they were working on the other things. As for the room, I asked about the one near the lobby as requested, one reservationist said they didn't have any, the other said they did, but we ended up staying where we were. That night -the people next to us came in and sounded like they were in our room with us. They were very loud, maybe because it was an adjoining room. It was odd, because you couldn't hear much of anything going on outside where the boat came in and out, but the guests next store were horribly loud. After all the other things, my husband went down to the front desk to complain about our neighbors. They said they would \"talk to them\" and ask them to keep it down and if that didn't work, we could move down the hall. The party quieted down a little while later, so we were satified. Again- everyone was very polite. Friday morning, went to get my local paper in the hallway- The New York Times was there. When I called down to the front desk, the lady said, \"we don't get the local paper on weekdays\". Monday morning- the local Orlando paper appeared. Ask, and you shall receive. Again- very polite and empathetic. We had 2 souvenir wine glasses from the Harbor Nights Festivities as well as one of the rooms wine glasses disappear after the maid had cleaned the room. We contacted housekeeping as the maid said she didn't understand English, and they did find two souvenir glasses and brought them to our room a few hours later. Very polite, and very nice. Maids should pay more attention to detail- no soap to shower with and the mirror had dried water spots on a lot of it, coffee in room one day was only decaf. The hotel also does put a $300 hold on your card above and beyond the room rates when you check in for \"incidentals and room charges\" which can crimp your spending if you use a bank card. Pools were cold and had a lot of leaves in them although-it had been windy there. Coffee shop closes in the afternoon until 4PM. We wanted to get coffee a few times during the day there and sit out and look at the bay, but couldn't. Lots of walking to get to your room especially in the West Wing. You have to go from the lobby-down the elevator- outside across the plaza-into the building- up the elevator to find your room.

It was excellent, but I think they only did it as a special event. Internet access -nice feature for a fee- to print our boardings passes and check-in online so we didn't have to at the airport. Villa pool, nice secret place to relax. I think it was my favorite. Place was relatively clean all the time. (I did see one leftover wine glass sit on the table near the elevator for a day or so). At night, the workers go around like little elves to make the place look new again for morning visitors. They also are constantly picking things up and cleaning during the day. Coffee shop has alot of great items and you can grab something quick in the morning if you are in a hurry to get to the parks. Water taxi is a real plus. Using your room key to get into the rides without waiting-priceless. Motion sensors in the room let housekeeping know when you are away so they can clean it without disturbing you. Pretty cool, huh?

On our honeymoon we were at the Portofino for 3 days in mid September and had a fantastic time. We arrived late at 10pm on the first night and check in clerk Laura\u2013 immediately set the tone for our stay \u2013 engaging, friendly, polite and professional and as honeymooner\u2019s a complimentary bottle of wine was sent to the room (and it was a good one). I don\u2019t know where they get their staff or how they train them but they are amongst the brightest and helpful I have come across and it is what makes the difference between a really good hotel and a great one. This is a great one. At 10.30pm we still managed to get a Pizza in Sal\u2019s and returned to our room. The room was large with a massive king-size bed \u2013 the type you need a step ladder to get into. The bathroom was large with twin sinks however the robes were a bit light. The guest wings on the first floor were undergoing complete refurbishment during our stay \u2013 so maybe some of the earlier reviews had a point. Our room had already been refurbished (3rd floor) so everything was new \u2013 the corridors still smelt of new carpets. The corridors are long but you have to understand it is based on a real town and consists of two long guest wings with the restaurants, bars etc in the middle. We ate at Bice\u2019s one night and it has the wow factor \u2013 beautifully designed and furnished \u2013 we decided to sit on the balcony over looking the square \u2013 which was very romantic as night fell in and the lights come on all over the square. The bill while pricey ($230 for 4 course meal with wine and aperitifs \u2013 beware the Ice Martini\u2019s are $25 \u2013 not including tip) but the food and service were excellent and it is 5 star all the way. Mama Della\u2019s however was a bit of a disappointment for us as a couple, the food was just ok and the waitress that fake sweet \u2013 sorry. Breakfast and Lunch in Trattoria were great \u2013 dine al fresco if you like. The water taxis to the theme parks are a real perk and such an elegant way to travel. In all we had a fabulous time \u2013 enjoyed all the hotel has to offer \u2013 and would fully recommend anyone to stay here \u2013 it\u2018s good value for money. Best Thing: the space.
