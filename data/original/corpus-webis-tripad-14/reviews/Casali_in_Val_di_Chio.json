The swimming area was wonderful for the kids and the yard had plenty of space to relax and enough room to play soccer with the kids. The private location of the home is breathtaking with amazing views of the Tuscan country side. We enjoyed spending time exploring the surrounding towns and loved to come \"home\" at the end of the day to enjoy a glass of wine outside. Roberta and Lidia were very helpful in answering any questions that we had. We enjoyed our tour of the vineyards and the wine tasting. They also arrange a private cooking class at Villa San Martino for my 8 year old daughter and I which we will remember fondly forever.
