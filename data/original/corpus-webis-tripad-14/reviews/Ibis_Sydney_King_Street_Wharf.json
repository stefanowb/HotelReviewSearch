I have stayed at a number of Ibis hotels in Europe of similar standard for $100 per night. I still can't work out why this one cost $325 per night - or why I was stupid enough to book it at that price. I could have got the Westin for not that much more, and there is no comparison.

The windows are double glazed so it is luck of the draw. The hotel is cheap, but none of us would stay here again.
