Indeed, the service was outstanding, and the facility was clean. The problem, which was not too bad since we only stayed 2 nights, was that the room was very noisy. The walls seemed paper thin, and it seemed that all the noise from the plumbing in the motel was funneled into our room. Also, our air conditioner worked fine, but we have never heard such a loud air conditioner as it cycled on and off.
