Any time we wanted anything it was at our front door or on our plates immediately. As the staff got to know us after a few days they brought our favourite items without us even asking. The owner, Sepp Kr\u00f6ll is present every day and always looking after you in natural and welcoming way. In the early evening you will often be greeted by Sepp's wife Martina with a sweet \"hallo\" as she takes care of the garden. Sometimes her cute young children also help, which adds to the comfort of staying at a family run boutique hotel.
