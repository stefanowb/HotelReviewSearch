We have been hoping to go to Big Bend for some time and finally got there. It is one of the least visited National Parks and is well worth the long trip to get there. Give yourselves plenty of time \u2013 the roads are twisty and the pace is slow (and we didn\u2019t take the time change into consideration). The room was nice with a lovely balcony with a gorgeous view of the Mountains. Deer came right up to the hotel and we saw lots of animals throughout the park. We did one meal out of the convenience store which was well stocked and not too pricey and we had an excellent burger at the hotel restaurant.", "title": "Lovely, remote, awesome and well worth the trip", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "desertrat2", "date": "June 10, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5329450}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at chisos Lodge for 5 nights [4-8 march 2007] and enjoyed every minute.
