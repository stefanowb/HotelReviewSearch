The staff were all very pleasant & helpful. A very big plus was the use of the spa area across the road which included a gym, swimming pool, spa pool, sauna & steam room. It was a lovely end to a cold day walking on the fells. Bolton Abbey is very close by with it's acres of countryside & river that can be explored.
