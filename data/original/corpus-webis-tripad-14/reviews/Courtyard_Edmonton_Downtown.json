It is located right on the River with fantastic views. We were given a top floor corner room so were able to look out over the river and also toward the University of Alberta area. The room was very large and nicely decorated. It had a small refigerator inside a cabinet and a marble floor and counter in the bathroom. Breakfast was available either as a buffet or made to order. It was not included with our room although I believe sometimes you can get a rate that does include it. There were also several other restaurants within walking distance as well as shopping. Next door was the convention center. Across the river was the Muttart Conservatory with 4 pyramid glass buildings that are edged in blue lights at night. The only negatives were that you either used the valet parking or the pay parking next to the entrance, and the counter space in the bathroom consisted of a narrow strip running above the sink along behind the toilet. There was a small round table next to the bed that I took into the bathroom and used to put my toiletries on. There was plenty of room for it. The staff were very friendly and one took us out onto the outside eating area and pointed out places of interest and things to do. I would not hesitate to stay here again.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sky22", "date": "October 29, 2005", "id": 4071736}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "What a Hotel!!", "title": "Wow!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Barkleythedog", "date": "August 22, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3795564}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great view of the river valley", "text": "I am used to simple motels like Super 8, and Days Inn and was wowed by this place.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 26, 2005", "id": 3611560}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005", "text": "To start the room looked like a palace with windows that had a great view of the river.
