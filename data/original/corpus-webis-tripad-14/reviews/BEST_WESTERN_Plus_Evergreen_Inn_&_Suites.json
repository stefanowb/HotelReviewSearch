The elevator was not working the whole time we were there. The staff that had to bring us up to our floor was always nice. One day we went there and like they started cleaning our room then stopped. We had to ask for more towels and toilet paper. The next day we left kind of late and again didn't get our room cleaned while we were out that day. So had to ask for more towels. Then I called the front desk to ask what time do we have to be out by to get our room cleaned? They said well they are cleaning rooms all day. I ask well what time do they leave? They said they leave at 1:30.(I wanted to say till 1:30 is not all day!) So the next day we made sure we left earlier. Would be nice if they can let the hotel guest know what time we need to leave to get our room cleaned the following day. I was worried about how New Years Eve would be staying there. Wondering if it would be loud but it was nice and quiet which was nice. Wish they had the breakfast downstairs quit at a later time. The area where you can use the computer needs improving.

I contacted the Best Western in Federal Way and the only response was \"we don't have your card on file, so it can't be us\" and they gave me the extension for their accountant, who did not return my call. About a week after my stay, I stopped receiving the \"Pending\" charges; however, I received one very large charge for more than $600.

I told the person at the desk who answered that the accountant did not return my call and asked for a manager or supervisor. He did not know who his supervisor/manager was. I asked him who I could call above him to get this resolved; he told me to call the 1-800 number for best western and that is the corporate office. I then contacted corporate Best Western and was told that I would receive a refund within 7 days, but have yet to receive one. This whole issue has been ongoing for three weeks now.
