We love it, we stay at one of the cottages on the sea that is about $300 per night, all of the cottages on the sea are similar but not excactly alike, we always stay at the same one because it's like our little vacation home. Don't really want to give the exact name because might be harder to reserve next time, but they are all really cool. We are in our late 40s. We love sleeping with the windows and doors open and the sound of the sea crashing on the rocks. Hadn't had any trouble with bugs our previous trips but this time we had a couple rainy days and had some bug and mosquito bites. Would take along some \"off\" and something to put on bites to keep them from itching in case you need it. The people here are fabulous, so very nice. Got to meet Sally and Jason, the owners, this time and they were so nice. Yvonne, the manager, always goes out of her way to give us the best treatment possible, she's great. Dougie @ the bar is the best bartender in the world, we love him. Jake's wouldn't be Jake's without him. Andy took us horseback riding and snorkeling, it was a blast, about an hours drive. Best \"Jerk\" is walking distance outside the gates, only on Friday and Sat. it's called \"Delven's\". Get you some. Andy also does bike and kayak tours, he's a great guy. If you want to go on a boat to Black River or \"the pelican bar\" ask for Joseph, another good guy who'll take care of you. Our driver to and from the airport was the nicest guy you'll ever meet, his name was Keven, he even took us to meet his beautiful family and had his mom share some recipe and instructions on cooking \"Jerk\" style. The drivers we've had in the past on the almost 3 hr drive from \"Mo Bay\" have not been as nice as Keven, ask for him to pick you up at Mo Bay. Went to \"Shirley's Steam Bath and Massage\", it was great, only wished we'd have done it the 2nd day we got there instead of waiting until the 5th and last day. The trip to Shirley's is a great experience that takes you to another world. Loved it. This trip we stayed 5 nights and our bill for food and drinks for my wife and myself was $1000, so that gives you an idea of cost. Loved the food at Jake's, very good. Pizzas at \"jack sprats\" are great too. We always took Dougie a couple slices, he enjoys Jack Sprat's pizza too. Bevin took good care of us at the restaurant, very nice guy, good waiter.

So festive and elegant. Our bags were whisked off and we were escorted with umbrellas to our new home. Arriving after dark is always a mystery, I could hear the rain falling and the sea splashing against the rocky coast and was so excited to see the bungalow which I had only dreamed about. We walked in to a pink and purple fairytale room, the bed fit for a Caribbean princess, with a unique purple stone and colored bottles placed as accents on the head board. The dark wooden shutters on French doors and windows were closed to keep the rain out. We sat in our room and wondered where are we? We could here the roar of the sea hitting the rocks just beyond the French doors, we opened the doors!! It was a bit scary, the unknown, the vast sea right at our door step, just less than 10 feet from the foot of the bed. It was dark and all we could see was the white water splashing against the rocks and up on our patio. It was amazing!! We were a bit hungry and head out to Jake Sprats for a wonderful dinner of fresh lobster and a red stripe beer. What a perfect start!! The next morning we awoke to the sounds of birds outside and the romantic rhythm of the Caribbean sea as it splashed against the shore. This was the moment we were waiting for! The sun was rising and we flung open the dark wooden doors to see a sight you only see on Corona commercials, two lounge chairs sitting there awaiting, the vast sea in front of us, just feet from the end of our bed. It was like we died and went to Jamaican heaven!!! Then there was the outdoor shower. The most unique experience ever!! The shower was just off the room, designed with Sally's artistic touches of conch shells and colored bottles, It was open to the sky above and just high enough on the Caribbean side to hide your private parts from passing kayakers and fishermen. I had to try it first, it was like going skinny dipping, I felt a bit silly at first but as the water streamed down my face and the warm Caribbean breeze brushed my body, I felt at peace with all of Jamaica mon!! The roof top sundeck was hot and steamy and we would sit up there in the evening to watch the beautiful sunsets. We felt so welcomed and comfortable there. It was more than I could have imagined.

Most of the roads sustained damage during Hurricane Ivan and have not been fixed, so there are many, many potholes and not a whole lot of room to avoid them; very narrow roads, and people walking all over; makes one a bit nervous when a tractor-trailer is coming your way on the other side of the road and the roads are very narrow.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 14, 2006", "id": 5466620}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "When we arrived at Jakes and checked in, we were immediately impressed by the wonderful staff.

I am so very glad that we did this; when we arrived at the cottage through a meandering, beautiful walkway and entered our cottage, the french-style doors were thrown wide open onto a small tiled terrace with Adirondack chairs, and then a nice-sized wooden deck with loungers, and right off of the deck was the Caribbean Sea. Just a spectacular view! It was very windy the entire stay, thus, the ocean was more silver grey than Blue, but the waves crashing up and spraying on the rocks was just great to watch; almost hypnotizing if you sat there long enough.
