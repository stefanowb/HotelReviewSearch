Warm, friendly staff that always looked for ways to be extra helpful. The rooms are cosy and well maintained, if a little old-school. The buffet breakfast and dinner seem to cater a little more to the tastes of western guests, but they were quick to substitute spiced up versions of dishes for us. Elements of their food/beverage service could be improved a bit (hash browns that looked nothing like what they were supposed to, the unavailability of any coffee other than instant, and an underwhelming dessert section at their dinner buffets). I'd have also liked more local (read Bundelkhandi) food on the menu. Another minor irritant was that the carpets in the corridors smelled slightly musty (it's not noticeable unless you're sitting outside for a while), but I'm willing to concede that this may have been due to the just concluded monsoon season. We also used the spa for massages during our stay, and found the experience very pleasant (even if the offerings were a little basic). We didn't use the sports facilities or the pool, but they seemed well maintained and clean. The hotel is well located, just a short walk from the Western Group of temples, and in a quiet and clean part of town. Top marks to the staff for their pro-activeness and helpfulness. If they refurbished this place a bit, it would be taken to a whole different level.", "title": "Memorable hotel stay", "user": "jp_jacob", "date": "September 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176549173}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled solo", "text": "This hotel didn't live up to the Taj's usual standards, it's very tired and the food isn't great and the bathrooms need some work.", "title": "Tired Taj", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SueGS", "date": "September 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 176477447}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "On the positive side the service is great they couldn't do enough for me, I had a rush job of laundry and they did a wonderful job and very reasonably.", "title": "Wonderful Taj experience at unbelievable prices", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ScorpioOnWheels", "date": "August 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173889606}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "The room was clean and a generous size, it's just that I have come to expect more from this hotel chain.", "title": "Not worthy of Taj brand", "user": "Amit A", "date": "August 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 172775270}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "We traveled as a couple in sept 2012 and stayed here over a weekend.

At the end of the meal the head chef came to our table to apologise personally. He even gave us his card saying we could call him whenever to ask him for any recipe and he will happily help.
