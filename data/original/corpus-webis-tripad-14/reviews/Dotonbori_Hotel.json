If you came from Tokyo by shinkansen like us, take Midosuji line from Shin Osaka (M 13) to Namba (M 20) and find exit 25. After exit make U turn to find Mc Donald walk straight until you find Yoshinoya at the corner, turn left and walk straight, find the hotel on the left side opposite of Lawson. If you carry some big suitcases, on the way to exit 25, around 20 meters before exit 25, on the right hand side (exit 15 if I am not mistaken) take the elevator there and you will be on the street level in Namba Hips Mall.
