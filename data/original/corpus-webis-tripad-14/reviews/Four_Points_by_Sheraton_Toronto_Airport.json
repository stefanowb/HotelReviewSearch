We thought of all the options we had and figured the park-stay-fly deal was pretty good as they have a 24 hour shuttle service...apparently. The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, but as we only needed the room for a few hours of sleep it wasnt that big of a deal. We decided to go for a swim in the pool only to find it ice cold. The jets were all turned off and it wasnt swimmable even though the staff said it was good to go. When it finally came time to leave, the shuttle bus took forever to arrive and when it did come there was only enough room for 8 people so a few others had to wait for another half hour.

We called as soon as we were through customs and were told the shuttle would be there in 5 minutes. Our coats were in my car and most of the people outside waiting for the shuttles were wearing t-shirts or sweaters as they just returned from hot weather. We then saw shuttles for every other hotel you could imagine come by except ours (and a large group of people waiting for the 4 Points as well). Then we saw those same shuttles come back for a second and then third trip. After calling again half an hour later we were told that the bus had already been by and picked up some people. Obviously from the large angry group gathered outside this hadnt happened. 45 minutes pass and another call was made. This time it would be 15-20 minutes wait. We waited for another 10-15 minutes with no luck and decided that an hour wait wasnt worth it so we took a cab for $16. The hotel wouldnt reimburse us and further inquiring let us know that the shuttle bus had actually been broken down for the last hour or 2 and wouldnt be good to go for another 20-30 minutes! Even though we were told it was on its way AND had picked up passengers when it wasnt even possible to do so! Now Im angry and just want to go home. I go out to the parking lot and my car has 4 foot snow drifts on each side. I ask the front desk person if someone will dig me out but he says the maintenance person left at 5:30 pm and that all he could do was lend me a shovel. I was very angry but what choice did I have? Clearly he didnt want to dirty his suit. So I shovel my car out and have to push it out as it was stuck. This took a good half hour and most of the other cars in the parking lot were in the exact same position. Imagine a senior couple having to go out and shovel themselves out and then push their car out to boot! I asked why the snow had not been removed while the maintenance person WAS there and I was told they had a bad couple of days. I am including a couple of pictures to show you what it was like, one of my car and one of a couple in their 60's.", "title": "Well...

After returning for our vacation, we called promtly after getting of the plane for the shuttle to come pick us up (which we were instructed to do) and we were told they would be there right away. A group of 12 of us (including a small toddler) ended up standing in the freezing cold for over an horu waiting for the shuttle. I phoned 3 times to inquire and twice the lady at the hotel hung up on me. When we finally arrived back at the hotel to pick up our vehicle, I asked the man behind the desk about the issue, and he told me that we must have missed the bus because it came 3 times.
