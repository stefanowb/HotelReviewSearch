Later in the morning after checkout, I wrote customer service, explaining my situation and how unsatisfying it truly was. A week later, management at the hotel reaches out to me, asking to enroll me in \"Priority Club.\" Maybe this would be of value to me if I traveled more often, but I don't. When I do travel, its for work and everything is expensed, so it really has little value to me. When I went to redeem the points they added to my membership, I discovered that 5,000 points will earn me a DVD copy of the CaddyShack - a $5 value. Really?!

In the meantime, someone came to the desk and said a man entered her room with \"his\" key, thinking it was the room he'd been assigned...weird. The front desk has no idea which rooms are available, they literally left the desk twice to physically check the rooms to see if they were vacant, cleaned, etc. When we finally did get our room key, that room wasn't cleaned, mind you it was after 7pm at this point. We were assigned another room, but that key didn't work! So after multiple trips to the front desk, we finally made it to a clean room. Now, clean is putting it lightly.

Donald......what can I say, the nicest gentleman, the shuttle drivers were great too. I can't say enough about how enjoyable they made our vacation stay. It's alittle out of the way from DC, but it was definetly worth it. A friend stayed at a hotle in the city, and had to pay a daily parking fee. Plenty of places to eat, Chevy's has great mexican food, and it's very close.", "title": "We really enjoyed our stay, we'll be back !!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Chris V", "date": "August 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117191657}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011", "text": "Close to metro stations close to fedex field.

We checked in around 1pm but they didn't have any rooms ready so we had to wait about 20 mins. It is what it is. When we did get our room, it was worth the wait. Very spacious and modern design. Clean and comfortable. The fridge and microwave were very handy for us to store some food and water. The bathroom was, shall we say, quaint. Not tiny by any means, but a little small. The shower curtains were short and did fully cover the entire tub so the floor got all wet when we showered. It was very weird that they didn't have longer curtains.", "title": "Great hotel with awesome staff", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "derbdo", "date": "August 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116165377}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011", "text": "The hotel is located in a pretty nice area.
