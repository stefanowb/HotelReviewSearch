It is a very attractive hotel, built into boulders on the plain. It has a wonderful pool made to look like a rock pool with a waterfall. The views from the deck above the pool are stunning, with vistas around two sides of the lodge and over a waterhole, so you can watch hippos, herds of antelope, elephants, zebras, warthogs, monkeys and baboons all from the deck. The bar/lounge area is decorated with rock art murals and the walls are actually rocks. The food was good, but the service a bit over attentive. Musicians played traditional African music in the restaurant when we were there. At breakfast, we had a wonderful view from the restaurant of hot air balloons over the Serengeti at dawn. Little rock hyrax swarm all over the gardens and rock features.", "title": "Attractive hotel in a fabulous location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Joanne T", "date": "August 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 136952259}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Stunning location", "text": "Built into a large kopje rock this has stunning 360 degree panoramic views. An excellent base for game drives - we stayed two nights and did a morning and evening drive during which we saw an amazing range of animals. The buffet was delicious with a lot of choice. Disappointed there was no souvenir shop, as had been advertised and it was irritating that the drinks had to be paid for in cash - would have been much easier to put on credit card. We took US dollars but ended a bit worried about how much we had because every time we had drinks with meals we needed some. This was the case in all lodges we went to though. Hot water was rather limited and shower pressure was rather feeble - but then again you are in the middle of the Serengeti!

Plus, there's not too many choices in the Serengeti. This lodge was in a great location, the grounds are attractive. So, what was wrong? Well, first of all, the grounds are infested with hyraxes. They were up on the roof scratching, on the walkways pooping. After awhile, they weren't cute. The swimming pool had a weird green tinge and I wouldn't let my children swim in it. There was little to no warm water. I think the worst part is that they advertise that they have an Internet cafe, fitness room, spa, boutique. There are \"rooms\" for all of those, but they're EMPTY except for the fitness center which is stocked with treadmills which weren't even plugged in. The buffet was typical of large lodges; bland with recycled food choices.

There is a weight room with exercise equipment that has looked like it is ready to open for the last year, but for some reason they have not yet opened it. One key thing is that you HAVE to know where the migration is located for the time that you want to book. This makes a big diference in the price as well as how far in advance you have to make your reservations. I highly recommend Fortes Car Hire out of Mwanza for any Safari needs.

We came into the lodge grounds around 8 or 9pm when it was dark but all the lights high atop the grounds where the lodge is situated were splendid and inviting-- an oasis of sorts! Check-in was easy (12 of us plus 2 guides). Rooms had a very African feel. Hot showers except for certain times in the day/night (we were informed of this upon check-in). Very clean. Squeaky floors, but that's quite a minor complaint. Food was absolutely fantastic with a huge selection (buffet style). A tremendous bar/sitting area on the higher level with fantastic views. The lookout deck provides an amazing morning and evening view over the Serengeti. Didn't have time to use the pool (also wasn't overly warm weather during my stay), but it looked spectacular (although a bit small). Small animals roaming around the premises (hyrax and many monkeys) and also larger animals (giraffes, hippos) around the grounds-- feet away from your bedroom window!!
