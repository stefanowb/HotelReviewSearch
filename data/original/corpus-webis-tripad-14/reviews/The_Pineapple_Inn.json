A beautiful retreat on Corcega Beach, Nelson (the owner) keeps the rooms and pool area immaculate, and is overflowing with hospitality. He met me with maps and guides and recommendations and bent over backwards to meet my every need. When the time came to check out, I felt more like I was leaving a friend's house.
