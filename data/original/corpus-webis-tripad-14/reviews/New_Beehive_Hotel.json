This is often the destination for people who can't get a table at the nearby 'cliff restaurant'. We don't expect outstanding food but the burgers we had (we ordered 8 burgers in terrible) were awful. The burger meat was as cheap as it gets. This place could be fantastic. Such a nice local area and the pub and the interior and exterior is fabulous, but the food is very very poor. The table service wasn't great but we didn't mind as only went for pub grub, but I would be embarrassed if I had taken my friends into the inside restaurant.", "title": "Awful burgers.......", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "qprjames", "date": "August 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 137184550}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited August 2012", "text": "I didn;t even realise that the Beehive had \"re-opened\" in a new location (the old Orton Rigg old peoples home). Hence I was quite excited by the prospect of going somewhere new to me. The interior decoration was nicely done but there was a terrible looking stain on the carpet. I'm not sure what it was but the vibe of the place wasn't quite right. Not sure whether it was because it felt like a place that used to be an old people's home, the music which didn't sound right because of the choice and acoustics, or the older rather pedestrian landlady type person serving behind the bar. The menu offering is limited and very uninspiring (as if taken from a pub twenty years ago). There is a complete absence of any kind of local produce being put on offer. You rarely see that these days in any successful pub offering food.", "title": "It's a pub....and that's about it.", "user": "jrchannon", "date": "August 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 136985887}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited August 2012", "text": "The pretty Eastern European waiting staff were very helpful and the food came out pretty quick. My burger was actually much tastier then appearances suggested. The beer garden was a nice place to be but had some rather old school sit and ride amusements and an old shooting arcade game which seemed a little out of place as against the rather chic interior. It's a place that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. I know many pubs work an angle to differentiate their offering from other pubs in the area. The New Beehive does not do this. The fatal blow is having \"The Cliff\" pub right next door. The Cliff has a far better menu, is busier and hence has more of a \"buzz\" about it and seems to get things better in their execution of the offering from comfy and smart interior, to table lay out and the finer details. The New Beehive still uses the little annoying condiments sachets which appear to dispense about a thimble full of product (meaning you have to open 3/4 of them to get a reasonable amount (why do they make them so small? It's infuriating).", "title": "sunday carver", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "stephenJohnston42", "date": "August 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 136505495}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited August 2012", "text": "We had to ask our server to bring us salt and pepper.
