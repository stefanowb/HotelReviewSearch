It is most suited to families with children, not for a romantic getaway. There was not enough staff over the new year period to run a bar service to the pool, neither was there a snack / light meals menu. The only restaurant there was totally booked out and quite expensive, perhaps inaccessible to the family clientele. We found dirty nappies outside our door, drunk non-guests loitering near our room, and we had to battle with a very faulty doorknob to enter our room. Overall, we thought we would have been better off trying the Grand Hotel for an equivalent price.", "title": "motel with add ons, not a resort", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "xelar8", "date": "January 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12342938, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 comfortable room", "disliked": "\u2014 motel facilities for resort prices"}}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific", "city": "Mildura"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 8, "very good": 17, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 8}, "slim_ranking": 0.291666666667, "description": "The Quality Resort Inlander Mildura is located just a half day away from Adelaide and Melbourne yet still within driving distance from Sydney.
