Checkin was quick, courteous and informative. Our room was large with a lovely comfortable bed. There were floor to ceiling windows with stunning eastern views out over Oysterhaven Bay. We stayed for three nights in April 2013 and were lucky enough to have good clear weather which I took advantage of to watch magnificent and spectacular sunrises, out over the bay and the surrounding hills. We used the hotel as a base to explore Kinsale and the surrounding countryside. We also spent some time relaxing in the hotel and we used the nice pool and hydrotherapy facilities every day. Breakfast is excellent with good quality food in an eat all you can buffet style - perfect to start the day. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant one evening and we were very pleased with the quality. I wouldn't recommend a visit to the bar in the hotel. It's very dark, dull and basic with no windows, no music, no decor to speak of and no atmosphere. In fact it looks just like an afterthought stuck into an empty space. A mini bus shuttle service operates every evening from 5.30p.m. from the hotel into Kinsale and back again every half hour up to half past midnight (\u20ac3 per person per trip). This is a very welcome service. We were able to eat and drink in Kinsale town with the comfort of not having to worry about driving back out to the hotel afterwards. The bed was made and the room was cleaned each day but having said that, we were left short of shampoo/shower wash and toilet paper and just about reached the end of our stay using a box of tissues. We stayed on a value package in this hotel and while we were pleased with what we got for the money we paid, I probably wouldn't go back to this hotel because it's just that little bit too far away from Kinsale town.", "title": "A fantastic weekend at the Carlton Hotel Kinsale", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "nyladelbib", "date": "April 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157386710}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013", "text": "I stayed here with my husband for one night.
