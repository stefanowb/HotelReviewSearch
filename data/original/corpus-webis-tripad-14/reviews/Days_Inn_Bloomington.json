I was unpleasantly surprised by just how poor condition this property was in. There was a softball sized hole in the rug at the door. The bathroom sink had 1/2 inch gap between the sink/counter and moldy caulk everywhere. It was freezing in the room when I arrived, and probably that was to keep down the mildewy smell that became apparent after turning the heat on. My flight wasn't until 9 a.m., but I was out by 5 a.m. They need to repair and clean this hotel.", "title": "Very Poor Condition", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Katherine M", "date": "April 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 128552346}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "stayed over night, got a ride to airport.

Chilis is next door and they take airline vouchers (Delta gave us $6 for a meal!). Delta should be ashamed for putting their passengers in this motel.
