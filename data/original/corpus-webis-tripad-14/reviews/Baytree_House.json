The location of this B and B is ideal. It's in a lovely quiet street and is a short stroll from the centre of town, great if you want to go for a meal and have a bottle of wine. There is also off street parking. The house itself is lovely with lots of original features in the sitting room and hall. However, it's when you get into your rooms that you realise that it isn't all that great. As someone who suffers from a dust allergy, our room wasn't ideal. There was dust visible on a lot the surfaces. There was also visible water damage on the ceiling of the room. The room was tired, with wallpaper starting to peel from the wall. The light shade was interesting, as they used a lamp shade upside down as a shade hanging from the ceiling. There was also 5 ladybirds who were sharing the room with us. Don't know if they came in while the window was open or if they were already there. We opened the room as it was a bit stuffy. Overall, we slept well. Breakfast was nice, but bacon and muffins were a little overcooked and portions are small, especially the salmon and scrambled egg. Home made bread seems to be what they're plugging, and it's nice, but from a breadmaker. Not that there's anything wrong with a breadmaker! Owners are friendly. But a comment about being too busy on to Sunday as they were full was a bit strange, considering the economic climate, they should be grateful they have business. Overall, this is an okay place to stay. But at \u00a395 a room living night, they could do much better. For an extra \u00a325 you could stay in luxury at the nearby Rudding Park Hotel. So i wouldn't be back to this establishment and wouldn't recommend it to a friend as I believe you could get better elsewhere for the price they charge.", "title": "A little tired and dusty.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "andare", "date": "March 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 154560824}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "A lovely B and B, just 5 to 10mins stroll into the town.
