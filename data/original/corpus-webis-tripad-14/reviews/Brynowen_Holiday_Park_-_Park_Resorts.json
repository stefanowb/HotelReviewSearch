{"user_rating": 3.0, "review_count": 452, "name": "Brynowen Holiday Park - Park Resorts", "reviews": [{"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I returned yesterday from a three night stay at Brynowen Park Resort and am very disappointed with my stay. My brother lives in Aberystwyth and so myself, my Mother, her partner and his teenage son stayed here on a Sun holiday booking in order to visit my brother. Incidentally, we stayed at this park in April last year, also on a Sun holiday, and we were absolutely astonished when we arrived and got the key to our van, to discover that we were in exactly the same van as our last visit! The van itself is extremely old and basic, with uncomfortable beds and not many utensils. However, after our last stay, we didn't feel it necessary to complain as we only stayed for two out of our three nights due to other committments. However, on this visit, the state of the van had only deteriorated further with stains on the carpet not having been cleaned, I found a childrens colouring in sheet and a broken bracelet under a cushion, the seat cushions kept sliding off the bases when attempting to sit on them, the springs in the mattresses were actually on the verge of piercing through the fabric, the bathroom door handle kept falling off and the toilet roll holder in the bathroom was broken and hadn't been replaced. Ok, so it was a \u00a39.50 per person Sun holiday, however, people forget that this is only the initial cost. You also have to pay extra for entertainment passes, linen and also service charges, meaning that the total cost of the holiday JUST for the accomodation was over a hundred pounds. It is not unreasonable for me to suggest that this van is disgusting and is ready for destruction. The site itself is not too bad... Certainly a short walk up to the top levels of the site show where obvious care is taken to the grounds and walkways etc - I believe most of the vans up this end are privately owned. However, there are lots of scrap items lurking about such as bed frames and rubbish which wouldn't take much effort to hide just to tidy things up. There is a man who drives around the site all day on some kind of buggy with a trailer on the back in which I believe he transports dirty and fresh linen to vans - This man drives so very fast and doesn't appear to look where he's going. It is pointless having signs alerting visitors and other people to drive slowly if the site's own staff cannot even adhere to this - he is actually a danger to the many young children who freely run around the site. I have to admit, the entertainment in the evenings is good - even if it's not to your taste, at least there is something on which is inoffensive and is both appealing and suitable for children and adults alike, however, the prices of drinks are a complete rip off. On our previous visit, the price of a bottle of house wine was around the \u00a39 mark - this time, upon asking for a bottle of house wine, we were given a bottle priced \u00a315, which we later, upon asking again for the same bottle, were asked if we were sure we wanted that and not the house wine, discovered that we'd been charged for a more expensive bottle of wine than we'd asked for. The average cost of a drink is approximately \u00a33.50 a pint, with soft drinks being over \u00a32. I was charged \u00a32.60 for a can of energy drink which I was told was sold at 60 pence in the smaller 'Patio Bar' which is open in the day on site. It is also worth mentioning that there seem to be far too many 'security' members of staff, largely, people in their late twenties, early thirties, who have delusions of authority. It seems that these people are actually glass collectors, but they wear t-shirts saying security on their backs. They carry walkie-talkies and are incapable of smiling. They are constantly walking around and watching your every move and I must say, I found this extremely uncomfortable and wholly unecessary. My advice here really would be, do not bother with the entertainment unless you are happy to pay absolutely extortionate prices for drinks, or drink in the van first then just go for one drink as I could literally have gone abroad for a week all inclusive with the money that this holiday cost. As I said, the entertainment is good - I can't really complain there, and the actual location of the site is brilliant if you want to be a bit further out than Aberystwyth, however, we will not be returning as we were just so disappointed.", "title": "Not worth it, even on a Sun holiday", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "rlvickers", "date": "May 10, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 107667119}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled with family", "text": "With a good deduction from Tesco vouchers, our holiday proved to be cheap and cheerful.

Next morning the office staff went out of their way to change our caravan; they chose a beautiful van that was being vacated, sent in cleaners to get it ready for us immediately and even offered to move all of our luggage etc for us if we had shopping to do! We were made to feel that nothing was too much trouble and that attitude was found in every single staff member we dealt with from the life-guards at the pool to the shop staff! The weather in Britain wasn't good this June but we had the best of holidays in a superb caravan with views out over the sea and the mountains to die for!! Everywhere we went staff smiled and greeted us, the site was quiet and spotlessly clean and we lacked for nothing that goes towards creating a wonderful holiday.
