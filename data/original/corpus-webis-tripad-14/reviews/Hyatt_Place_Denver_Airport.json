The rooms were very welcoming, large, exceptionally clean (I always check for bed-bugs) and has so many amenties that we were shocked. The teenagers are typically not very impressed since they have been to many hotels but they were even commenting on how nice the rooms were; plasma tv, sectional with pull-out sofa, lots of extra linens and pillow-cases, mini-fridge etc. Location was great as well, close enough and easy to get to airport, looks like a newer area of Denver in a business park type area but also had decent family restaurants nearby, Outback, Applebees, Einstein Bagels, Starbucks etc. Would stay here again and would recommend to friends.

You can also order food, wine and beer in the hotel using a touchscreen system in the lobby, and there's a liquor store across the street with a decent selection of wine and beer. The complementary breakfast (which starts at 6am) is your standard cereal-fruit-bagel deal but you can order something more substantial if you want to, using the touchscreen system.
