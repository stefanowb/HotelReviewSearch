If all you need is a place to stay that's clean, it's fine. If you are a tourist who does not speak Mandarin, you aren't going to get much help here. The room is tiny. We opted for a family room thinking that two beds would be useful. The second bed is really for a child although it's standard length. The mattress was actually softer than their original bedding so we kept it. Even though we were on a non-smoking floor, the smell of smoke wafted in. What prompted us to move though was the construction noise outside and the dust generated. Breakfast was cheap (about $4 USD) but didn't look edible. There are restaurants in the same block. Before we discovered that, we walked the other way to a main street and found more local restaurants. It seemed like primarily a residential area.

Best if you do all your research on which place you want to visit so you know all your options. Theres wifi in the common area but no signal in our room. There's a \"restaurant\" (for lack of a better term) on the other side of the hotel you just have to cross the road and the food there is great.

After checking in and settling in then we discovered it is a gem. It is an absolutely no frill but very clean hotel. Considering that there is so much to see in Xian and you spend little time in your room, this is perfect. The reception staff is a crew of new generation and very helpful young Chinese. As commented by by previous hotel guests, the staff was great in guiding us to everywhere on public transport. It was near impossible to try to catch a cab in Xian so we used the bus with the staff's help. There is a bus stop and a police post (2 policemen sitting inside a wooden hut) right outside the hotel. Therefore it is very convenient and safe. It is also a few minutes walk to the South Gate of the City Wall, an attraction in Xian. Beware of the Szechuan restaurant near the hotel; the restaurant is a nice looking place with rolls of chinese lanterns in the next block on the right side if you are leaving the hotel. They got us to order a fresh fish which they scooped out of their tank and then served us a frozen fish. The waitress quickly retrieved the fish when we showed her the frozen part of the fish sitting on our plate of supposedly fresh fish. The hotel is away from the vicinity of the Bell/Drum Towers and Muslim Street. It is a bus ride away of about 7 stops. There is nothing much there; both the towers are under renovation so can't see much and the Muslim Street has little to offer. The street parallel to the Muslim Street is lined with vendors selling fakes and a tourist rip-off.", "title": "A Gem", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Nancy255103", "date": "January 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 149477993}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Price is fair,and rooms are very clean, so staff was helpful, give information about number of bus around Xian. bed is comfort, but the pillow was so flat not good ....anyway ,we like this location nearly railway station.", "title": "Ibis Hotel Xian", "user": "maytee1976", "date": "December 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 147482628}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "At around $22 AUD a night we weren't expecting too much, but what we got was pretty great.
