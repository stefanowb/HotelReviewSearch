Such a beautiful victorian style hotel and great value for good sized rooms especially for NY standards! Loved the fact that outside there was a whole laneway full of pubs and restaurants outside the hotel. The hotel is located right down in the Financial District and about a 10 min walk to Battery Park. So easy to get around by subway and taxis are everywhere! Extremely safe area to walk around late at night. Breakfast was ok just wished there was more variety of healthy options, more fresh fruit or yogurt instead of sugar glazed pastries and bagels. Also found some of the reception staff a bit sour but didnt let it ruin our stay. All housekeeping staff were extremely nice! I think the majority of guests are usually people on business obviously being in the financial district.
