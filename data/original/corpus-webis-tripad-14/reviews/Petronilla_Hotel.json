We only stayed here for 1 night - which makes me want to go back for longer to enjoy the experience all over again. The staff are so lovely and helpful - if you want to know where to go for a delicious dinner just ask at reception. We had spent 4 nights in Milan but the best meal we had by far was the meal in Bergamo, the fact that it was also the cheapest was an added bonus. This is a beautiful city - I would definitely recommend that you walk up the steep hill to the old city and enjoy the atmosphere and views. There are lovely restaurants and bars in the square for you to relax and indulge yourself with some wine or beer! Back to the hotel - the rooms are lovely, all mod cons at your fingertips. It is a very quiet hotel, we had a night cap in the garden which was lovely. Breakfast was delicious with a great selection of fresh fruits, yoghurts, cold meats, cheeses, smoked salmon, freshly ground coffee - what more could you possibly want?

We booked a twin room, we got one on the 3rd floor with a view of the buildings opposite. The hotel is situated a little out of the way for most of the good restaurants ( although v close to Al Vecchio Tagliare which is excellent) and close to the shopping streets in the Citta Bassa. The room was very clean and well appointed with a lovely bathroom with rain water shower. Breakfast was very good with fresh fruit, lots of good juice and coffee and the usual prosciutto and cheese, fresh bread and an assortment of cakes. The staff were very helpful and friendly. So why a little disappointed? Well I thought the room was overpriced at \u20ac210 per night, I prefer to stay near the Citta Alta when in Bergamo, the hot tub and sauna were not in service ( I didn't ask why but I expect it was because the hotel was not busy) and we have stayed in about 14 hotels / apartments in Bergamo and the Petronilla would not be in my top 3. For the record we love love love La Valletta and the Gombit is perfectly located and a nice place to stay for the Citta Alta and San Vigilio. The San Marco is conveniently located for both the Citta Alta and Bassa and is great value off season at our rate of \u20ac120 per night for a superior 7th floor room with balcony and wonderful view of the Citta Alta.", "title": "Nice hotel but a little overrated?", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Mariao6", "date": "November 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 145880852}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Uta , the manager, was wonderful from beginning to end.
