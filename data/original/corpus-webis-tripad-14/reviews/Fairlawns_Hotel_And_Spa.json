First impressions DO count, and ours were good after being greeted by a very pleasant young lady at Reception who was very efficient and helpful. The function ran like clockwork, the food was hot and delicious, and our every need was attended to. I managed to throw a glass of champagne over myself (startled by one of the screaming balloons homed in on me) and was immediately attended to by a waiter with a clean napkin or two (thank you). We found the room clean and comfortable with everything we needed for a nights stay. Can't comment on the breakfast as we didn't make it!

We liked the restaurant and service in particular and found that there was a genuine desire to offer a good service all round. Whilst the service wasn\u2019t perfect for one reason or other, the staff were always trying to provide a high level of service.
