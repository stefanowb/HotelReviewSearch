The staff were extremely friendly and helped whenever asked. They gave us directions to the bar, mercado, and the bus stop. One night they even called a restaurant for me because I didn't know how to ask certain questions in Spanish! They have a happy hour by the pool Monday - Friday, which helped because It rained everyday from 2-5pm lol. The breakfast was included in the stay and was outstanding. Beans and rice, plantains, eggs, meat, cheese, pastries and bread, tons of fruit, juice etc. If you are looking for a nice hotel near downtown San Jose, this is it. Absolutely beautiful.
