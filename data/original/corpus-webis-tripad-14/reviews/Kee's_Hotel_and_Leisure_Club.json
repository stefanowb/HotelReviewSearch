I always get the superior rooms when I stay here. When we arrived are check in process was pleasant as always and staff were friendly. We arrived in our room and noticed how cold it was put thought perhaps the heating was not coming on until later so we did not mind too much as we were intending to go down to the leisure centre and beauty salon . After a fun time at the leisure centre and beauty salon where all staff are lovely and helpful and professional we went back to our room where it was still very cold. This was November so we were really feeling the cold at this stage. We had dinner booked in the restaurant as usual so went down there and were surprised how cold it was there too. Our meals took a long while to come out and when dinner was served the meat was turkey and ham had to be sent back as the meat was cold . Then when we scooped up the mashed potato we noticed other bits of carrot stuck underneath the mash. I am not sure why that was there as there was no carrot being served with the veg. Our main course came back out ten minutes later but at this point the vegetables were cold. When I asked for them to be heated I was not met by helpful staff!!!!!. I got a snappy yes with no apology. By the end of the meal we were just happy to finish up and get to our room where we learned the heating was still not on. At this point we did contact reception where 15 minutes later they sent up someone who stayed 40 minutes trying to fix it as we sat there as he worked on the radiators in the rooms . He could not fix this so went away again and 10 minutes later came back with two electric heaters that we were told we could use, when asked what about during the night we were told we could leave them on all night to keep warm. We were not intending to do that as we felt it may be a bit unsafe to leave two electric heaters burning but providing we could get the room warm by then we figured it would be OK and we would just turn them off. After saying goodnight the man left and I went to have a bath. After running the bath I went to put my leg in the bath only to find under the bubbles dirt and dead flies floating in the bath. Horrified, I got dressed and rang reception. Another man came up and viewed it for himself . There are signs in this bathroom that the water may contain things as it comes from a natural source but in all the times i have stayed in this room in the past this had never happened before and I was shocked how much dirt and dead flies came out. As I mentioned before I have stayed here many times and this was my worst experience. I do not know if the time of year had any relevance to what happened or if it was just bad luck. Unfortunately It ruined our trip and we left at half 1 in the morning, to drive the hour journey back home.We had been staying here for a special occasion and it was ruined . Although our experience was bad this time we did have many wonderful times here. It has been a lovely hotel for us in the past it may just have been an unlucky stay for us this time.", "title": "Disappointing stay", "user": "IrelandPebbles", "date": "September 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 140988528}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We got married abroad and had our wedding reception in kees hotel on our return.
