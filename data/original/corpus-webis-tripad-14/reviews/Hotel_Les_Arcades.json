The rooms are a good size and setup adequately for a comfortable stay in Geneva. The breakfast was very good and the staff sensational. The wifi worked satisfactorily but you needed an adapter for Switzerland that is different from France and Germany for your electrical gear. The staff had one which you put down a deposit on and could use while there. What was a bonus was the free travel pass provided by the Hotel Association and Tourism Board for people staying in accommodation in Geneva. You could ride all public city transport (trams, trains, buses, boats) for free for the duration of your stay. The hotel is in a zone where I as a solo traveller felt safe, there were all kinds of shopping nearby. A fridge in the room meant you could keep foodstuffs for other meals if you wanted too. The staff will do washing for you. It is a little noisy as you are above a very busy road.
