We had extensively researched spas in Oahu and I had even visited the area last December - we were very excited about staying there and having a spa weekend at their beautiful facility. Unpleasant surprise upon checkin when the front desk advised that the spa was closed for renovations. There was a temporary setup in the Penthouse suite, but it was barely adequate for minimal services (massages) and there were no amenities. We had corresponded several times with the spa and no mention was ever made of the closure, nor was it disclosed on the hotel's website. I had used Marriott points plus $150/night to upgrade to a deluxe ocean front room (which was lovely by the way) - add to this the $36/night parking, $15/day internet and ridiculous prices at restaurants and pool bars - my lovely \"just about free\" spa weekend was almost completely ruined. I will say the room was beyond beautiful and it was so relaxing to sit on deck and watch the ocean - very private. The grounds and walks were beautiful too. But the food/drinks - blech, and too expensive. Pool also pretty small - multiple pools at the neighboring resorts (including Marriott's own beach club) looked much more inviting. Also you can tell that the lagoon area nearest this property will soon be a nightmare when the Disney resort opens fully - too many kids for my adult taste. Although the only hot tub had specific signage forbidding children under 10 to use it, the hottub was treated like a kiddie pool - MANY toddlers with floating toys in there every day. We finally had the pool attendant kick out the toddlers one afternoon and we suffered the wrath of parents' dirty looks the remainder of the day. (Why would parents even think it was safe to let a 18-month old use a hottub??) Italian restaurant on site had snooty wait staff, ridiculous prices and mediocre food.

Rent a cabana on the beach for half a day ($35) to really spoil yourself. Spend some time in one of the hammocks if you want to get a taste of heaven!

Overall the resort is beautiful with the saltwater lagoons adding a nice touch and the restaurant staff and bellman was very helpful with directions and restaurant suggestions. Restaurants in the hotel were expensive but we expected that so we decided to just do breakfast and lunch in the resort and visited nice restaurants outside the resort for dinner. 2 places I will recommend( and I will write reviews later) is Roy's Ko Olina which is at the Ko Olina beach club and there is a hotel shuttle that wil take you there. Also visit the Hula Grill at the Outrigger at the beach in Waikiki for dinner. Back to this resort review, the only negative is that there is no natural beach with waves that you can access. My son loves the ocean and it's waves and even though the lagoon was right outside the resort and great for kids, there are no waves like a real ocean and we missed that. The pool was good not great, we have been to other Marriott sorts which have bigger pools with waterfalls and slides but this one was just a basic round pool so I was disappointed with the pool area. The Ko Olina area is definitely more private than the crowded Waikiki area so if you are looking for a peaceful,relaxing vacation in Oahu then Ko Olina is a great choice. we did drive to the North Shore and that felt like the real Hawaii with the natural beaches and big waves and we stopped ate some local fruit stands and bough fresh cut up fruit and had fresh cooked shrimp from Fumi's shrimp truck which was awesome. Thanks to Sean from Marriott Vacation Club for telling us to do the North Shore drive and he was kind enough to tell us which beaches to stop at, which shrimp truck to eat from and the local fruit stands etc. Overall our trip to Jw Marriott Ko Olina was wonderful but please consider the lack of a natural beach if that is your priority.", "title": "Lovely resort but needs some TLC", "user": "FoodiesAnonymous", "date": "April 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 127835386}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012", "text": "Went here last week to surprise our friend who was celebrating his 50th birthday- that said, we would have been happy anywhere, so that rather colors my review.", "title": "Beautiful Location on Oahu", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Stephen88", "date": "April 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 127831992}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Nice location away from Waikiki, but now rather crowded into a lagoon with a massive Disney complex.

I have been to both the reasonably priced Marriott Courtyard and the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Both are close to the main attractions and the busy tourist spot of Oahu. After several days, my final stay in Oahu was located 30 minutes away from Waikiki. It's approximately a $90 taxi ride to Ko'Olina where JW Marriott IHILANI is located. I've been excited in staying at this resort as I've seen great photos from the web. After the tiresome Friday night at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, we moved to the Ihilani after the rush hour traffic cleared on H1. As soon as we took the exit off the freeway, I noticed a big difference in the area. Definately a nice location with great new homes and resorts around the area. Near by is the Luau called \"Paradise Cove\" within walking distance from the Ihilani and the Disney Resort. As I drove up the driveway at night, the biggest difference is that this is definately more secluded, most peaceful, and less crowded compared to all the hotels in Waikiki. Along the driveway you will see the lit torches lined up to welcome you upon arrival. The vallet staff immediately helped out with the luggage. The ambiance is peace and quiet and very romantic. If I get married, I would definately consider returning to this place. As soon as I opened the door, the nice room with white shutters and elegant fan rotating above is a feeling of luxury and paradise. As I walked one of the two balconies I hear the waves crashing to the rocks. I hear birds singing. I left the double doors open with only the screen door closed. The shutters slides to the side and slept so peacefully with the sound of the birds and the waves. The following day was filled with lots of walking around the beach and taking a dip in the lagoon. The restaurant is great. But keep in mind, this is not a cheap or bargain hotel. The food is not cheap as well. This is probably the main reason why only a handful of people are seen around the hotel and as compared to the Waikiki chain of hotels, this is like night and day. Total complete opposite. Worth the money? I believe so.
