Staff are friendly. Access to the kitchen saves money but plan to cook (or reheat) before or after the crowd. The library of travel books available is very helpful. Free laundry is fabulous. We stayed in the family room on the ground floor (no stairs!) and had a lovely modern and large bathroom - there was even a hairdryer! On the downside, having a window right on the street was very noisy - not traffic but loud people even into the night. The location can't be beat. The street is quiet but one block in any direction and you are in the middle of shops and restaurants. Funky decor but great for the price.", "user": "katie19891", "date": "June 11, 2008", "id": 16845218}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great value for flexible travelers", "text": "Actually, I didn't stayed there, 'cause i left everything for the last minute and couldn't find double rooms avaliable.

But a special mention for the staff and service. Yes, they zealously guard the hotel's peace and quiet (no rowdy guest behaviour is uncommented on), but they are realistic, informed, possess a working sense of humour (unlike some of the reviewers I've read here). The manager is credible, trustworthy and clear. His offsider, Michelle, is a personality in her own right. I'd characterise her as New York Jewish in her expression and sense of humour, and she and I got on just fine. I realise she can startle some, but hey! what do you want? Subservience?
