Most of the crime is related to homelessness, poverty and alcohol and drug use and not aimed at tourists or residents. Seattle has always had a plethora of Native America, African-American and other street people. The economy isn't helping. So, with that out of the way, let me state that this is a lovely, well-maintained property. The building's history is fascinating, as are some of the decor items used throughout that were part of the original property. Front desk, valet and room service staff were, for the most part, professional, warm and responsive. Rooms are varied in layout, but well appointed and extremely comfortable. Nice big bathrooms make up for somewhat smaller rooms, but it makes for a very nice stay. The main part of downtown is a pleasant 10 minute walk away, along with Pikes Place and other tourist areas.

We stayed pre (one night) and post (2 nights) cruise. Lobby with bar is lovely and quiet place to relax. The room we were given for the pre-cuise night was on the 6th floor and very, very, very small. You really can't turn around in this room. However, we were okay with it because we were only staying one night. The room is beautiful with all new bedding (wonderfully comfortable), two tall windows (no view), dark chocolate crown moldings and a dresser with built-in refrigerator and coffee/tea bar. The desk is fitted with business traveler needs (pens, paper, highlighter, stapler). The bathroom is quite nice with hairdryer, make up mirror and small bottles of shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash and body lotion. We had breakfast in Juno which was very good, but expensive ($43 for two). The waitress seemed like she just woke up and never really seemed like she wanted to be there. We took a three hour bus tour around Seattle that I highly recommend provided by Tours Northwest. The hotel also has a car service on hand that we used for travel back and forth from the airport and Pier 91. Cale Car Service is very reasonably priced, and offers personal service. After a week cruise, we arrived back at the Arctic Club and this time we had a room on the 9th floor. Atleast twice as large as the first room with a seating lounge area. The room was outfitted the same as smaller room. I would not want to stay at this hotel if the smaller room was the only one available. Front desk and Conceirge (Stephen) were very helpful during our stays. Hotel is within walking distance to downtown and waterfront (Ask front desk for a great map). We enjoyed the walks and felt very safe on any street. Several coffee shops, restaurants and sandwich shops on every corner.

It is always where I search for when we start researching destination. After this experience NEVER AGAIN. Upon check in we were informed that our reservation was cancelled due to not showing up on time. I had called a day in advance to inform them that we would be arriving the next morning but had booked an extra day so that our room would be ready upon arrival. We were placed in a temporary room until our room was ready. For inconveniencing us they gave a certificate for a dinner for 2 at Juno. The restaurant below. It was AWFUL. Food was bad and found a hair in the bread. Not just dropped in but actually baked in the bread. Ok so we had perfect weather and \"Seattle was great. We thought everything was good..until I got home. I prepaid for a discounted room rate prior to leaving for Seatlle. Well I guess with the mess up in cancelling our reservation they also charged us again for our stay. I called to have Hilton reverse the charges and they had informed me that they already did and that the location was responsible for the error. The hotel had charged the card that I had used to book the reservation and credited the card that I had used upon check in for incidentals. Upon receipt of my credit card bill I see that they had a field day with my credit card. Charging over $2500 ...I called them once again. They stated even though they had erroneously charged my credit card numerous amounts of time they ultimately gave me the correct credit.
