The hot water was VERY limited so if you are with a party of more than one, you better take a 30 second shower. The face/hand/body towels were non-existent and when we asked for more, the \"staff\" replied by saying they were all out and did nothing to try to find more. Isn't it great to come from the beach and have to shower with your hands... NOT!! The customer service was extremely poor. The only PRO was the space but I'd rather pay more for a true hotel experience. I will NEVER stay here again and hope this finds others before hard earned money is wasted.", "title": "worst hotel ever", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jamika", "date": "October 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 10118306, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Spacious", "disliked": "\u2014 No hot water; No towels; Not great room service; Poor Staff"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008", "text": "These are individually owned condos and there must be great disparity between the units, judging by previous reviews and a friend's strong recommendation to stay in a one bedroom suite with a terrace, which I tried to book but was denied on arrival because Casa Grande messed up my reservation.

The coffee table rocked like a hammock and seemed like it was ready to fall over at any minute. The silverware was simply on a paper towel in the drawer.
