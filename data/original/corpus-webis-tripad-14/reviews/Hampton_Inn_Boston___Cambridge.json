Of course, as luck would have it, heavy rain started coming down just as we got off I-95 and headed into Cambridge's unfamiliar streets to try and find the Hampton Inn. After a few wrong turns we finally got there, a bit soaked, but no worse for wear. I must've been quite a sight walking into the lobby with my big bulky motorcycle suit dripping water all over the floor, because as soon as the guy working at the front desk saw me, he smiled and we both had a bit of a chuckle. We were a bit early (maybe two hours before check-in), but he shuffled a few rooms and got us something right away so that we could change into something dry! They even saved us a spot in the underground parking right next to the elevator so that we could unload the bike without having to walk too far. The room was very nice, with a bed so comfortable that I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. As with other Hampton Inns, the breakfast buffet is one of the best there is. Another plus is that it's only a few steps from the T station, which is a cheap way to get into the city and ramble around.", "title": "Great, Helpful Staff", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LuckyLL", "date": "April 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7363455, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Excellent service, great location.", "disliked": "\u2014 View from back rooms is just ho-hum..."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the Hampton Inn for two nights in early April.

We didn't really know the area so we wanted to be close to the T system, which turned out to be extremely accessible right across the street. The woman was very helpful with our tickets gave us the exact amount it would take us to go to each of our destinations. The front desk was very polite and we experienced a very fast check in. We had a room with 2 queen beds, not much of a view but the beds were very comfortable. Reminded me of home. We could hear the tv in the next room but only for a little bit before they turned it down. The next morning we had a complimentary breakfast which had hot/cold food. The best part of all is the free parking at the hotel that can run you as much as 40 dollars a day at other places.
