The steak was so-so, the rest of the experience was bad due to an annoying, touchy-feely waiter. Yuk. As far as the casino, I was shocked to be confronted by a racist dealer at the Let It Ride table, who actually freely used the \"N\" word while dealing. I turned him in, I hope he was fired. I thought the Sheraton was dingy, dirty and low-class in everyway. On the other hand, we stayed at the Horseshoe next door and LOVED it.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 27, 2003", "id": 1149823}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We Had a Great Time..Thanks!!", "text": "Your casino slots are really loose, and your breakfast was divine, Thanks Anthony from AL", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 20, 2003", "id": 921675}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "thanks", "text": "My wife and I stayed at your hotel last month and we had a great time.
