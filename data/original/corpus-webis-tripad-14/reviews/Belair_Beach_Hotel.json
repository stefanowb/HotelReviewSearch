I have been to St. Marteen many times because I have family there. Stayed at Belair.. I think it is a or should I say could be a great resort. Love the beach and the pool. I went Jet skiing and I thought that was a great experience, the guys that ran this program were great and one had a beautiful little baby.. I think the supermarket is a little expensive at the hotel, naturally you can find better prices if you go into town.. Very quiet. There is some problems at this resort...The elevators were having problems the entire 8 day stay. I was glad we were on the first floor(walking out to the beach) but we went to utilize the laundry room which is on the 4th floor, and had to climb the stairs back and forth. There was two black outs with no explanation. I would also like to add that the rooms are definately outdated and could use some Interior Decorating badly also the air conditioning was poor you don't get much cool air better to be outside by the water. They also need to upgrade the lounge chairs for the beach, and have some type of beach activities or music playing ,at least some of the time.. overall the staff is friendly", "title": "Needs Updating....", "user": "TayTay56", "date": "February 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 13951758, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The staff", "disliked": "\u2014 The outdated decor"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Having just returned from a week at Belair, I must say kudos to Belair. Yes the second bedroom is small and the kitchen has 2 burners, a microwave, toaster oven and full refrig. But I did not go there to cook big meals. It worked fine for breakfast, and light lunches. The staff is what makes Belair a pleasure. Jody of Jody's Store was a delight. Once she asked your name, she called it anytime she saw you. (She is also an artist) Her shop was a real convenience. On arrival we were able to purchase enough essentials until we went to a larger super market. (The coconut sorbet is to die for) The Gingerbread House Cafe also was very convenient being on site. We ate 3 dinners there and one breakfast. They had live entertainment all 3 nights. Monday night was a pool side wine and cheese and then BBQ. Coming from BBQ country, I can say they did a bang up job. We did not rent a car. We found taxi's and local buses met our needs. Being right next door to Divi also gave us other lunch opportunities. Belair is not a \"swanky\" resort but is just \"family\". We were made welcome by all. We also were impressed with the \"assigned\" beach chairs. The attendant asked your room number then found convenient chairs and labeled them for the duration of your visit. Also provided and umbrella and towels, all at no charge. I understand that at many places you have to hurry down to nab a chair early in the day and pay a fee.. This eliminated that problem. We also had mid-week maid service and clean towels at no additional charge. We would definitely return to Belair. It just depends on your taste. It is not a big party resort, but is great for couples and families.

We took the kids out of school on an off week from vacation. They had a blast even though there were no other kids around. We never got out of the clear blue water. The hotel is in the perfection location. Away from the hustle & bustle of town and on a beautiful, private beach. The view from every room is magnificent. We only left the property at night to eat in Maho. (\"Pizza Pasta\" restaurant is a must!!) The little mart on the property had alot of snacks, but a great supermarket is very close by. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. We felt safe. Our room was outdated and had a mildewy odor, however, the other rooms we went into did not. We stayed in it because we were on the 1st flr and literally 3 steps from the sand. I think they are changing the decor. The hotel itself was very clean. A negative remark would include: Possibly having waitress service on the beach for tropical drinks and adding some music for the vacation/tropical feel. It was a little too quiet at times.

The Belair was definately the best of all three. We could not have asked for anything more. The customer service was excellent. The security around the resort gave a very safe and secure feeling. All the staff and I do mean all the staff were fun, friendly and very welcoming. The best thing about this resort is the setting...every room faces the ocean and has huge sliding doors that open right up so it feels like there is nothing between you and the beautiful veiw. The rooms are clean and even if they need a bit of an update in the second bathrooms it was just right for us. We had our 6 year old granddaugther with us and the pool, while not large was just enough for her when she needed a change from the ocean. The waves may have been a bit large at first but we soon realized that it just depends on the weather and every day we were able to swim safely right infront of our room. The staff on the beach would have our towels, umbrella and chairs ready for us everyday. The Gingerbread cafe had resonabley priced and tasty meals when we did not want to leave the resort or cook for ourselves. The laundry room was clean and easy to use, never had to wait for the machines. The resort is nicely situated between Philipburg and Simpsons Bay so it was very easy to get anywhere on the island.
