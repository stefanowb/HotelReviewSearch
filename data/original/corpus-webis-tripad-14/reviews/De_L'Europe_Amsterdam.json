My luggage was stored for me while i went to walk around. I returned around 2pm, and the room still was not ready which was disappointing. Finally, i was shown my room after a brief tour only to find it very small. It has a nice view of the canals from one small window. The staff did follow my request for a quiet room, away from elevators. This is probably the smallest room i have ever slept in and i find it hard to accept in such a high level hotel. The bathroom is very luxurius and large with heated floor but no double sinks. There is a Nespresso coffee machine which is great and the iPad is great too. The Concierge by the name of Eel, correct my spelling, is superb, warm, helpful and wonderful. He guided me on some wonderful walks, recommended places to eat, lent me books of Amsterdam etc. Other staff is great but not as helpful as that man. Now, problems..... On my first day in the hotel, i found 4 flies in my room. They were going crazy above my head. How could housekeeping allow this to happen? Called front desk and was told to wait or someone. After several min, i called back bc noone showed up. This is when the wondeful Concierge showed up and managed to get rid of 2 flies. He arranged for an insect zapper or me so i could kill the remainng flies. The room is clean but not as it should be. Wood floor areas are dusty and dust balls stuck to my suitcase. Tables are dusty also. Housekeeping is inconsistent. On my first day, i had no bath mat, dont dusturb sign, hand cream and body scrub. On second day, i got some of the bath amenities but not all and the room was cleaned very late at 2pm. On the 3rd day, i got all the amenities and finally the dont disturb sign. In this level hotel, housekeeping should be superb.

The bedroom was quiet and dark so no problem sleeping during the day. Room service was very accommodating bringing up anything we needed.

The location was perfect walking distance from shopping and the square. Everyone was very helpful and so nice. I did not get to try out the spa, but it looked really nice.

The interior designer deserves huge props to pull off such a task in such a tasteful manner. The concierge booked us dinner at two restaurants of which I will never forget. De Vief Viejen (well, something like that, English: the five flies) was the first and it was drop dead yummy. It's Dutch food made at it's best. The best experience and food I have ever eaten came from Le Rive at the intercontinental. Nothing on any continent has touched it, and I was a vegetarian at the time and the chef created an entire pre fixe menu of 5 courses which was actually like 20, and course on top of course topped the next. When you stay at hotel de l'europe, which you should, get them to book you a dinner at Le rive with drinks afterwards at the secret unmarked bar that was like hogwarts gone achy.
