Our rate included a nice breakfast, with fresh baked croissants. The hotel had soap, shower cap, shampoo, and our room had a view of St. Finbarr's Cathedral. In fact, it turned out that we were a very short walk from there. We got up very early the next morning and had time for a walk before breakfast. We were within walking distance of the downtown area, though lots of places were closed, as the day we were there was a bank holiday. We met my nephew and his family at Caf\u00e9 de la Paix, which the hotel had suggested for lunch. It was quite pleasant, as we were seated in the sunny room, with a view of the river. We had a relaxed lunch there. Everyone seemed happy with their food, and the service was unhurried. We walked to town and spent a couple of hours in a cozy pub, The Old Oak on Oliver Plunkett Street. We enjoyed dinner at Rossini's Italian restaurant. However, I'm afraid I didn't do it justice -- I left half of it on my plate, as the servings were huge!", "title": "Good value hotel", "user": "sandypaws3", "date": "April 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14749969, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Very clean and comfortable with a view of St. Finnbarr's.", "disliked": "\u2014 No problems with it at all"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "great value", "text": "Was in Cork for a family get together had never stayed at the Lancaster Lodge before but I have to say this is such a little gem.

I especially did not like the bathroom which had a tiny stand-up shower that you could barely move in and no counter space to put your stuff on. We were in a room in the back of the hotel and there was a huge construction project going on right behind the hotel. We were woken up both mornings by the construction noise which started around 7 am. Breakfast was very good with many choices for a hot breakfast that you could order from the menu in addition to a cold buffet. I do have to say that the staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful and gave us wonderful suggestions for dinner.
