Very clean and comfortable. Bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom even included makeup removal cloths, which I had forgotten mine. Breakfast was good, waffles, english muffins, toast, bagels, sausage patties, eggs, boiled eggs, assorted cereals, etc. This hotel seems to be pretty new and it is very clean. No complains, we would stay here again.
