Also during my stay I called to concierge several times, but was transferred to the front desk due to the concierge being \"unavailable\", and again the front desk was less than pleased to take my call, and needless to say were unhelpful. In addition during my stay the television system was out for 5 hours from 8am to 1pm, no apologies or offer of compensation.
