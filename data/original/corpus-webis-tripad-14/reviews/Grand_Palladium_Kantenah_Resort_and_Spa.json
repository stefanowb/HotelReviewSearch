They said the construction was noticable, but not overly annoying. We booked a Mayan Suite with a King bed, but we ended up with two double beds for some reason. It wasn't a big deal though.

I think the first day of vacation is so overwhelming because there is so much to do. We decided to book our 3 ala cart dinners right away.

I think we would probably try another resort first and maybe even another vacation destination. Except for a few things, I agree with everything positive you have read about the resort. It is huge and beautiful. The staff was excellent. Drinks were very good. The pools and beach were great.

We got a Mayan Suite on the Colonial side, two double beds, and the first floor. I know they can't always accommodate all requests but at least part of the request would have been nice. We were not whisked away on a golf cart. We were escorted to our room with a bellboy and our bags. He said it would be better for us to do this so we could get to know our way around the grounds.

However, you do not want to get the one we did. It was in building 31. There was a busy walkway about 10 feet in front of our balcony. You could also see the new construction plain as day right in front of our balcony about 150 yards away. There was no privacy of any kind. When we walked in and were checking out the room, we looked out the window past the balcony and there was a security guard standing on the walkway outside staring inside our room at us. Very strange set up. The Mayan shower outside on the balcony was private from by passers, however, the people on the second floor can look over their balcony into your shower!!! If you think you can take an au natural shower without someone seeing your \"privates\", think again. It is NOT A PRIVATE SHOWER. At check in we were told we could change rooms later in the week to meet our accommodation requests. We told them that our given room would be fine, but after seeing the things mentioned above, we called them back and asked to be moved. Our third day there we were moved to building 31. Still on the Colonial side and two double beds but on the second floor. We enjoyed this much more. These outdoor showers are not as nice as the first floor pictures which you see on the website. They aren't as big and do not have the plants growing around them but at least they were private. The construction noise was not bad at all and we could actually see it going on above the trees about 300 yards away. The inside of the rooms however were noisy. There were always these weird sounds coming from the walls/other rooms. I don't know what it was. It sounded like loud \"clanks\" and another noise that was like heavy furniture being dragged across the floor. A sort of screeching sound. It kept me awake a lot.", "helpfulness": 21, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 23, 2005", "id": 3494763}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "The Food- This is the one thing I disagree most about over the majority of reviews I have read. The ala-cartes were pretty good. We had a Japanese show table and the steak house. Service and presentation were nice. The buffets were not very good at all. Breakfast was OK. Dinner seemed like the same old things every night even though there were different themes. Just chicken and beef in the same sauces simmering in chaffing dishes. The wait for the grill at dinner and omelet station for breakfast was long at times. Service here was hit or miss and we did tip for everything. We made a reservation for the beach BBQ but it was cancelled (because there was a brief shower an hour before it was supposed to start) so we had to eat at the buffet from Wednesday evening when we arrived until our first ala-carte Saturday night. For lunch, there was no indoor AC dining option. There was the buffet by the pool and the beach bar. Personally, I have to eat indoors when it is that hot. I have no appetite after being in the hot sun all day unless I can cool off. It also presented the last and final problem. Flies. There were more flies at this resort than anywhere I have ever been and I am from the Southeast where they are bad. The food at the pool buffet was covered in them. I don't see how anyone can swat flies away from a stack of burgers, then pick one up and plop it on their plate to eat. I normally only got the ice cream from the machine so I could be sure it hadn't been \"Flied\" on. Another option was the beach bar. They also have a small buffet that is outdoors, but the food is at least covered on the chaffing dishes. You can get burgers, hot dogs, nachos, and quesadillas. Also you can get made to order tacos which were very good. Still, you are eating in 90+ degree heat constantly swatting flies from your food and drink.
