That stated, it was well located--half a block from the Reading Terminal Market, which was fantastic for breakfast and lunch, and a few short steps from the other Marriott, which was actually attached to the convention center. The 'other Marriott' would have been a much better choice for several reasons; the service was great (I left my coat at the bar one night and returned the next, and it was returned to me via concierge), the bar was lovely (fountain-side bar with great martinis) and there was a respectable restaurant. The whole thing kind of reminded us of Las Vegas--but again, I'm talking about the OTHER Marriott. The Marriott we stayed in--the Marriott in question in this review--consisted of a teeny, tiny valet parking area (valet parking is key, because of the location directly across from city hall, on a crazy-busy street), a very clearly 'used to be a government building' lobby, and the odd layout of the rooms. And all of that would have been ok if it was not for the shoddy state of the room itself. We were on the 15th floor, and our TINY window did afford a great view of city hall--you could look down upon it--but that's where 'nice' ended. The wallpaper was pocked with spackle, the mirrors rimmed with flaking painted frames, and the layout of the bathroom was beyond inconvenient, especially for two people trying to get ready for a convention at the same time; it was difficult to fit in there by yourself, never mind trying to dry your hair whist your partner brushes his teeth. That was simply not an option. Additionally, there were disturbing gray stains on the bathroom floor, and I don't know that the shower was cleaned before we checked in. If we return here, we will stay at the Marriott next door, to which I would have given a glowing review, having never stepped into an actual guest room.

I really liked this hotel. It was in a great location. The pool/hot tub was great. I used priceline and got the room for $80+ tax, and the hotel ended up being a steal for that price. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other people, and I would probably pay more than what I paid to stay there.", "title": "Lovely hotel", "user": "dapo2004", "date": "November 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 49459574}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is housed in a preserved historic building located right in the heart of Philly's downtown area, close to the subway station.
