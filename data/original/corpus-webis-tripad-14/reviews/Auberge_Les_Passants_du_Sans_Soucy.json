It may have been the charismatic Pierre Trudeau, or perhaps it was the success of the Montreal Canadiens, led by Guy Lafluer and his flowing blonde mane. Something inside me had been inspired a long time ago. Growing up in western Canada, we didn't have access to many things french, nor were we taught to have such foreign asperations. To this day, I cannot say where I developed this craving. I can tell you, however, where my appetite for all that is french has been satisfied. Les Passants du Sans Soucy embraces all that is truely french. Some feel as though they step back in time when they enter Old Montreal, this feeling was taken to another level the first time I stepped into this delightful B&B on the oldest street in the Old Port District. Once inside, the building's mystique had me captured, its history as a warehouse receiving goods from the mighty St. Lawrence took me back to a time when Canada was but an ideal in the minds of men to come. Although now very much in tune with the times, as far as technological advances are concerned, through its elaborate upgrades it has maintained the classic french feel. Each room is unique, with its own sense of style and form, attention to detail is paramount throughout. The same can be said of the staff at LPdSS. Each one with his own perception of the city itself, I feel this gave me an upclose and intimate tour of this truely international gem. I was guided to a number of outstanding restaurants by both Michael and Martin. Each one gauging my mood and intent for their percise suggestions. I do have to say, it is not hard to find a great place close by to spend some time. Whether you're hungry, wanting to indulge in the history that surrounds you, or simply looking for a place to happen, it can be found by wandering the streets adjacent to the hotel. Breakfast is certainly a highlight of one's stay, having a chance to meet others from the corners of the globe. This is a terrific opportunity to find out what the others have been doing during their stay. As many events are seasonal, you may not be aware of all that is happening at once. Upon discovering something of interest, be sure to ask for the pertinent information at the front desk. During my stay, Michael prepared an omlette for me that was again, built to suit my craving at the time. The next morning I tried the french toast, it too had the flavor of a time gone by, metaphorically speaking of course. A classic recipe handed down through the ages I'm sure. Martin made any and all arrangements with ease, making my stay one of the most relaxing and enjoyable getaways to date. I would certainly suggest this destination to anyone planning a trip to the area. For those who haven't been to Montreal, I recommend you consider to travel through time, to a place steeped in french charm and history. It answered many questions formed in the time of my childhood, and leaves me with a special understanding, and a definate appreciation for this wonderful, and truely ecclectic culture.

Our room looked just as it did on-line; warm wood, rustic and cozy with a nice, big bathroom. All very clean. What surprised us was how wonderfully quiet the room was at night. The Air conditioning was appreciated. We slept well. The communal breakfast was tasty and generous. We had warm croissants, made-to-order omelets and French toast.
