This hotel is a bit dated and needs to be remodeled. That being said, it was clean, convenient to the airport and the staff was friendly. The worst part of the experience was these huge lights in the parking lot that shine into the hotel windows of the rooms facing the side lot. Even with the curtains fully closed the lights shined in around the side and if felt like you were sleeping during daylight. I can't understand why they wouldn't reposition these.

It seems they are trying to remodel, but it is surely not fast enough. And there is nothing they do NOT charge for. What hotel/motel does not have free internet now? You pay 13$ per day for it here...and 9$ to park every day...oh, and for years now, when you check out, the little machine on the parking lot to raise the release bar and let you out when it scans your ticket rarely works, which makes you go back inside yet again(I waited in line while everyone had to do this, including us). The elevators are so slow, it's frightening. The staff is very nice, and very friendly. The restaurant is horribly overpriced. You almost need a line of credit from a bank to take your family there for a meal, and that's not a joke, it's just fact. We go there out of habit and out of sentiment, but in the future we plan on going somewhere else...it's just gone down and down, and until they improve some things, we will not return.
