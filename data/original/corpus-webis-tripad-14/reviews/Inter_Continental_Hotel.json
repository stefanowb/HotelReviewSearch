The Intercontinental is a threadbare, gloomy accommodation. The passageways are dark, the rugs are worn out, the bedrooms are Spartan. (The photo on the hotel's web site of a typical standard bedroom is sheer fantasy.) And I do not recommend the nightly dinners outside, adjacent to the pool. You can't see a thing (e.g. your food), and many of my colleagues complain of sickness after eating anything at the Intercontinental. My rule was to eat at the small cafe near the front desk - I think it's called \"Talk of the Town,\" a name that is almost touchingly whimsical. (I'd re-write the description, though: \"Suggested attire - body armor.\") The cafe is pleasant place, and the food is pretty good. I'd ask anyone reading this to tip the waiter, a genuinely nice guy who no doubt needs the money. When I gave him a dollar one evening after having a tuna fish sandwich, his face was rapturous.", "title": "Depressing hotel experience, but good from a security perspective", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "isoruku", "date": "February 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 97038773}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled on business", "text": "In contrast was the guy at the gift shop, who sold me two \"sapphires\" that turned out to be worthless - something I learned when I got back home.
