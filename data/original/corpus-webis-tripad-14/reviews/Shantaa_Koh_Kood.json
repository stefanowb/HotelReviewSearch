We stayed here for 5 nights (until Christmas day) this Dec. The location is amazing - all the villas face west towards the beach and setting sun with plenty of space between the villas. We had the cheapest villa (with 2 beds in it, not the one with the bath tub) and it was spotless, spacious, comfortable bed, outdoor bathroom with good shower (and also novelty shower in the garden section with coconut shell showerhead!) The food at the restaurant was delicious and varied and they also serve it at the beach bar. There aren't other restaurants close by so unless you hire a car you will get all your food from Shantaa - but we loved it so it wasn't a problem, and it was pretty reasonable. The beach by the resort is relatively small but big enough for everyone there. You can snorkel around the rocks and see parrot fish and multicoloured clams etc. There was never a problem getting sunbeds, and you can go and lie on the beach beyond the pier which is pretty much a perfect beach with very few people on it, if any. At the hotel beach there is a table with towels, bottles of water, snorkels/masks and large woven plastic beach mats. The bar Shantaa Bar-bara is also there where they can serve drinks and bring food down from the restaurant. It is a very quiet resort - including the staff (some of whom almost mumble - but were very charming) so if you want to get away from it all, Shantaa would be a great choice. We would go back there tomorrow.", "title": "Idyllic getaway", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "acbw_8", "date": "January 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 52466060}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Shantaa is a charming and very well-maintained resort.

The \"Sweets\" are set up on a hill overlooking the water, so the beach was not right outside our front door. Originally I thought this was something we'd miss- but instead we got a gorgeous all around view of the grounds and the water and were able to enjoy the privacy of being away from the few people who might be enjoying the beach. The less than one minute walk to the beach was perfect for us. The beach bar is nice to order snacks or drinks from while you relax by the ocean.
