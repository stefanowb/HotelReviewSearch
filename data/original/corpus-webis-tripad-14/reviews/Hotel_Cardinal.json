We had a room on the ground floor which was spacious and like, the public areas, elegantly decorated with some original paintings. True, we heard people coming in during the evening, but apart from that the room was very quiet. The breakfast was nicely presented and was what we would expect from a 2* hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. When we arrived we found a leak from the washbasin and spoke to the guy on reception who investigated it immediately.
