Our towels were folded in the shape of a dog, which we found rather cute. If we had a complaint, it would be that our room was right behind the lobster retaurant, which meant we had the greasy smell from the kitchen exhaust, so I would suggest asking for a room away from the kitchen. We didn't have chance to check out the pool, but children were swimming happily and we met a woman who had been here for a week, and she had no complaints, but overall, I would rate this hotel as a good place for a stopover or as a reasonably priced (for the area) place to stay with children, but not one where I would base an entire vacation.", "title": "Good stopover", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Martlet83", "date": "July 29, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3720636}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Would stay again!", "text": "Really enjoyed our stay.

I said pardon....She said your baby.. I was shocked and asked her maybe its my top that makes me look that way. Her reply was \" No the way you were standing and your side view makes you look pregnant!! and she made a ball motion on her stomache. Well If it wasnt for the fact my kids were hungry and tired I would have left as I thought I would bring this matter to the manager in the morning, and to make the situation worse Rachell went to other tables and laughed and said woops I thought that lady was pregnant.When she came back to take our order I said after that comment I dont think I should eat and bring me a drink she said I dont blame you I would feel like that too and I'll make the drink myself and I will make it strong. I did after all order food but had to leave it with my self esteem behind.That evening I went to the front desk and said what had took place and the gentelman their said to leave my name and number as the manager from the Lobster Trap would call me. In the morning the manager called and said she was sorry and would send me something in the mail.Well after all that I thought the manager of the hotel should know and called him and his reply was What do you want? and went on to tell me about Rachels bad childhood and that she couldnt afford to have a vacation. That was an unacceptable responce from what I thought was the manager but Jeff corrected me and said he was the owner!! His main concern was that as he put it was opening up his wallet' When all I wanted was my night back with my family as we worked hard to have that vacation. We missed the complimentary breakfast and I couldnt swallow dinner and as for sleep well who could sleep with being told and laughed at about their weight. What Jeff thought was an attempt to go into his check book was only some compinsation for me as a human being to have a decent night out with my family again. He even told me on the phone to forget it as he thinks thats all Iam after and said in so many words if i write this review he would put in comments of his own and told me to get a lawyer as he has a whole team of lawyers.
