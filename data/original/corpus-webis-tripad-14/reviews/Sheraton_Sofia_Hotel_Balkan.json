The hotel not as great as it looks or sounds in the other review. I had a standard room on the 5th floor. I felt like I was staying in an old Holiday Inn. The room was dated and the bed was lumpy and very close to the floor. I asked to see several other rooms and they were all the same on the 5th floor. The bathrooms have been renovated and are very nice, but I wasn\u2019t sleeping in the bathroom. My friends had a free room on the executive floor that was beautiful. The executive floor feels like a different hotel, but is substantially more expensive. The service in the hotel is fine, a bit blunt at times. The restaurants in the hotel are overpriced, there are better options outside of the hotel. The evening we arrived we ate in the hotel, the restaurant was empty and there was no music, only dead silence. There are probably better options for your money in the city. This did not feel like a 5 star hotel to me.", "title": "Didn't feel like a 5 star", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "tgh60660", "date": "March 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3271837}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best Place in Sofia", "text": "I stayed here for a week last December while on business and I can only say great things about the Sheraton Balkan.
