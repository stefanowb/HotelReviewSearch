The air con in the rooms is the best I have ever come across, and the showers are amazing, the shower head is the size of a dinner plate!! I went all inclusive and would definitely stay there again.

Our flight times weren't great so we arrived very early morning and left very early morning too. The first day we were there, we were very impressed with the hotel. The weather was disappointing as it rained all day but the room had a tv with some english channels so we spent a lot of the day in the room. The room was very big and modern. Curtains shut out lots of light if you like a bit of a lay in. I have to admit, the air con was a bit temperamental. Sometimes the room felt very cold at night and then very hot in the morning. The bathroom was modern and clean. Including a hairdryer although it wasn't very powerful if you have lots of hair! The entertainment was quite good in the evening as it suits all ages. The Tom Jones tribute act was incredible and if you have kids, they have a mini disco from half 8 til half 9. The food variation was fantastic. Plenty to choose from and the Italian night by the pool bar was perfect. The staff in the restaurant were always prompt at cleaning up and making sure people are seated quickly. The beach is just a 2 minute walk down the road. We went just as school started so the beach wasn't too busy. We didn't buy sunbeds or an umbrella as it would work out too expensive as we went to the beach almost every day. We just layed our towles down on the floor. The hotel was very clean and the staff spoke very good english! The reception staff were very helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. I had a brilliant time and I will return to this hotel again!", "title": "Excellent Hotel and Great Location!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Eli D", "date": "September 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 177621617}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013", "text": "We have just returned from an 11 night holiday in the Palmeras Playa & what can we say but fantastic. On arrival our room wasn't unfortunately ready as the previous occupants hadn't checked out when they should have however Clare on reception soon sorted this out. The rooms are large & the bathroom is too with a brilliant shower with plenty of hot water. Our room overlooked the stage & got the early morning sun but was ideal for watching the evening entertainment which was usually a tribute act but normally finished around 10.30pm. We were only round the corner from S'illot which was a nice little resort with bars & restaurants. If you like to dance then visit the Brittania Pub or the Kings Head which both open until around 3am. The Music Bar is also worth a visit. When we are on holiday we normally dine out for an evening but the choice of food on offer at the hotel meant we didn't need to. There was everything you could possibly want - chicken,pork,beef,lamb,quail,liver,fish,prawns,mussels,squid,octopusplenty of vegetables & each night you could have a freshly made stirfry if you wished. What can we say about the desserts? You're certainly not spoilt for choice here either. There is a wide variety of cakes & ice cream available every day. There is food to suit everyone from children to adults & if you require any special diet the staff help you with this to suit your needs. As in other reviews the pool is not as big as pictures may show & it's freezing until you get used to it. You can step in easily at the shallow end but need to watch as the pool suddenly slopes & you may find yourself in trouble if you are not a confident swimmer. The pool area is lovely & clean & yes the beds are close together but you can move them about a little. The best area we found at the pool were the beds over by the pool bar - yes it did take a little longer for the sun to come round but we did as everyone else did & put our towels down before breakfast. There were people reserving beds from 7am onwards but there was no need as there were plenty. If you didn't want the pool then the lovely beach was only down the road. It cost us 15 Euros for 2 beds & a brolly for a day. You are better to buy a lilo & the hotel have brollies they can lend you otherwise just put your towels on the sand. You can walk into Cala Millor just along the coast or take the land train for 4 Euros return. We would recommend the hotel to anyone & hope to return to it in the near future as the staff cannot do enough for you.

Well where do i start, there really is something for everyone here, there is so much choice from salads and pastas, pizzas, chips etc, roast meats, veg etc, to the cooking station where you can have fresh meats, steaks etc cooked in front of you or delicious stir frys they do there too! Cooked by a nice friendly chinese chef! My fave meal of the day was always breakfast and i was made up as there was always plenty of brown sauce to go with the full english!!! The deserts tasted as good as they looked... Amazing! The pool area and pool bar are also very good and plenty big enough i think for the size of hotel, at the pool bar they also put on plenty choice of food throughout the day ( you will never go hungry staying here ) and you can help yourself to ice creams, coffee, cake etc. There was plenty going on throughout the day... Kids clubs, water basketball, bingo and there was entertainment on every night starting about 9.30pm after the kids mini disco, The Beatles, Rud Stewart , some were really good and the others (the mime show) well we done some laughing at these! There was always somewhere to sit and a great choice of drinks too which i have to say the bar staff are very generous with their measures! We also got out and about quite a bit we got the little \"noddy\" train into cala millor quite a few times where there are a lot more shops and bars etc, this stops right at the front of the hotel, we also done the trip to Marineland, i really enjoyed the shows there they were fantastic! We also went on the glass bottom Katamaran 3 hr trip ( white cat ) which i would recommend they take you on a lovely tour around the Island, visiting the Pirate cave, Purto Cristo and many other places, good value for money! All in all we had a fantastic holiday at the Palmeras Playa and have got some lovely memories to treasure! If you are thinking of booking then go for it! You will not be disapointed!!!!
