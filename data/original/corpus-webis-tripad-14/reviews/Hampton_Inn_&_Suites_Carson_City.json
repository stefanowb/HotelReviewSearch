Luckily the Carson City Hampton fitted the bill perfectly, as the hotel itself was beautifully appointed with lovely large rooms and nice comfy beds !!! as we are Hilton HHonors Gold Card members we even got an upgrade, but we noticed all the rooms in this hotel were excellent anyway !!! The free business centre Internet connection was very uselful to check personal e-mail etc, and make reservations at other group hotels as the holiday progresses. The staff were very nice and recommended nice places to eat in Carson City. The breakfast was of the usual high standard with hot food and cereals etc,. We would definitely stay there again next time we are in the area. Pam and Dave Phoenix, Knutsford.

It is very new and nicely decorated in a great contemporary style. The bed was very comfortable. It was very clean and well kept. It had a little microwave and fridge and a great little desk area. Although there is no bottled water offered in the room, you can buy it in the small little market area next to the front desk, as well as other little snacks and sundries. The breakfast was crowded but well stocked and had a good selection. My only complaint was that I stayed on the first floor and like clockwork each morning at 8:00 am it sounded like a heard of elephants above me as (presumably) the room above mine was being cleaned. I heard this even over the sound of the a/c and a white noise machine I use when I travel. I would recommend staying on the top floor if you can, to avoid the noise.
