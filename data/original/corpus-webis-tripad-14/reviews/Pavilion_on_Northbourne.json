Upon our arrival back at the hotel we were given a room on the ground floor adjacent to the restaurant which at first caused some consternation as we thought there could be some noise at night, but our fears were unfounded. We ate in the restaurant that night and I would say that the other patrons were also guests of the hotel so the restaurant emptied fairly early. The food in the restaurant was good but we had to ask for vegetables which came at an extra cost. The bartender also makes very good G&Ts.
