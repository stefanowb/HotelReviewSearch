Staff lovely and really helpful (Rosa checked us in & out and nothing too much to ask), hubby also enjoyed football banter with the porter (sorry I cannot recall name).

As we arrived, being our first trip to Washington we noticed traffic was awful, of course you can't blame the hotel for that, but it made finding the place a little stressful. When we got to the Donovan House the valet was no place to be found, which was good with me because I planned to self park anyway, I drive a Roush Mustang which is seriously my baby and I wouldn't leave it in the hands of valet, once we parked valet was bringing someone else's car in and driving completely wreckless nearly hit my girlfriend and I as we walked up the parking garage due to the elevators being out of order. I would not reccomend allowing valet to park your car! Once we checked in we were very pleased with our room, it was very clean and comfortable. The morning after we ordered in room dining which took quite a while to arrive, it was 70 bucks for her and I to get French Toast and an Omlette which I thought was steep, especially considering my omelette had two black hairs in it, note that neither of us have black hair so I know it was from the cook. Otherwise everything went pretty well, the front desk was friendly and helpful. Although I wouldn't recommend this hotel, I would say it wasn't completely awful.
