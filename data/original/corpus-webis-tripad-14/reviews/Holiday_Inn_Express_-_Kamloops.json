The rooms were average, but clean with comfortable king sized bed. The breakfast buffet would have been better except we came down at the same time an entire little girl baseball team did. The food was all quickly scooped up and we had to cram into a corner and wait for food. This in no way was any fault of the hotel... how could you time that? The attendants tried their best and I did love the little pancake maching that made as many fresh hot pancakes and you wanted.

It wasn't until five days later enroute home that we thought we'd stop by the hotel and let them know of our situation and see if we could get credited for the no-show. The front desk person was very sympathetic but I got a lecture from the sales manager for not calling as soon as I could (with a sick son, it was the last thing on our minds) and said it would be up to the GM who wasn't in. And wouldn't you know it, this is when the van's \"Check Engine\" light came on, which caused another delay, but that's another story! Once we got home, I contacted the GM who said she would check into this and let me know. We got a call back to tell us we would be credited with the no-show!!!

The tone of voice that was used by this H.I.E. staffer was unacceptable. A simple \"would you please wrap it up for the evening\" would have done the trick. Sadly the evening staff chose to go the route of negativity which left a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of paying patrons.
