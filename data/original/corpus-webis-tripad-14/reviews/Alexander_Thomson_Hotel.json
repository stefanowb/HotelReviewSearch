The room also provided tea and coffee making facilities and bottles of mineral water free of charge. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis. The breakfast was great and provided plenty of choice.

We jumped in a cab from the Station and the driver was less than positive about what we would find when we arrived. However, it was not as bad as he made it out to be. The hotel is actually a 2minute walk from Central Station and there is a Wetherspoons on the same side of the street, which we ate at and was very good. The hotel itself is dated but our room was very clean and tidy and had tea, coffee, biscuits and bottled water. The towels and bed linen were spotless and the bathroom was also clean and tidy. There was a flat screen tv on the wall if you wanted to use it. The staff at the hotel were ok, not the best in customer service but certainly not the worst. When we checked in the girl on the desk was pleasant but not really bothered with conversation. We slept ok and the room was cosy without being too hot, noise was not too bad as we were on the 5th floor. We did not hear any noise from other rooms or guests. Breakfast was ok, a full Scottish plus toast - didn't like the look of the croissants though as they appeared to be very stale on sight :( Breakfast was a buffet style which suited us. On the whole this hotel suited us for the 1 night and we only paid \u00a320 each for the twin room, so you cannot expect 5 star luxury.
