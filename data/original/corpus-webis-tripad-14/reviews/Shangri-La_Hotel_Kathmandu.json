Spacious common areas and a nice garden restaurant for meals. The rooms overlooking the garden are nice, big and quite adequaltely furnished. Good air-con that was easy to control. It was very quiet here even though it was a busy hotel. Service in the bar was quick and happy hour with beers half-price (2 for 350 rupees) made them better value. It's not a cheap place to eat/ drink - very muchpriced at western levels; c. \u00a330 for a one course dinner (burgers + chips) with wine for two. Service in the restaurant was slow and food was OK but not fantastic - a bit like pub grub. You can stay and eat much more chaeply in Kathmandu and I'm not sure that you would be any worse off. I think I'd return tot he Kathmandu guest house in Thamel instead - it has a better location and the prices are much more sensible for Nepal. If you're just looking for a nice place to stay over night and you're prepared to pay the price then this is fine, but if you want to use it as a base, even for a day or two, look elsewhere.
