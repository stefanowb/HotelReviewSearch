The whole experience was disappointing to say the least. We arrived at the Sofitel at 11.30am and were eventually, after finding our luggage, settled in our room at 4.10pm. The room with balcony and pool view that had been booked was not available (hotel was full) and we were given a small, dark and depressing room with no outlook. This was refused and eventually another was found and we were charged 30E per night extra. The concierge and reception staff were less than helpful. This attitude continued throughout our stay. The hotel was not in a convenient location and we were advised not to walk too far and to take taxis (inexpensive - but don't tell them that you are English because they double the fare). Breakfast was adequate; poolside snacks expensive - \u00a310 for a meat baguette, \u00a33.50 bottle of water/beer. Entertainment was non-existent. The hotel was overrun by 'corporate hospitality' involving large groups of suited persons talking loudly into mobile phones. The room was not serviced until late afternoon which could be inconvenient. There was no tourist information available and we were faced with a look of distain when requested some.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "leonardoWales", "date": "March 1, 2007", "id": 6894034}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Would we recommend this hotel?
