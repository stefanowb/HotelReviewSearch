After 22 hours travelling from the UK we arrived at the hotel around 9am to find a mix-up with our booking. We had booked a Valley Wing Room on the hotel's website & when we arrived they said we had booked into the Garden Wing and the Valley Wing was full. After tears from me and several cups of tea later, the manager of the Valley Wing arrived and apologised and said they had found us a room in the Valley Wing. We were so happy as we had wanted the free champagne option as a perfect start to our honeymoon. The manager took us to our room and they had arranged a cake, champagne and a beautiful heart of petals on the bed. Over the 3 days, Sandro (the GM) and all his staff couldn't do enough for us. Sandro also gave us a $25 voucher on the last morning to use in one of the restaurants. I would rate this hotel 6 stars and although we had a bad experience at check in, they couldn't do enough to rectify it. I would highly recommend the Valley Wing as the champagne and canapes are great. The breakfast in the Summit room is lovely and they cooked my husband his own personal breakfast (and remembered that he hates tomatoes on the 2nd morning). We ate in the Line restaurant several nights and the buffet is amazing.
