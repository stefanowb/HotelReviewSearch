The rooms are very spacious and are just in the pictures. Everything is clean and new. The location is good while not on the beach it is only a short walk. The breakfast is very very basic and the quality is just okay, but you have a full kitchen so it really doesn't matter that much. Safeway is only a couple of blocks away and with a full kitchen you can bring in supplies. The pool was not very busy even though the hotel had lots of families staying. My one minor complaint would be the sound proofing. As you walk down the hallway you can hear everything that is going on in the other rooms. We could hear a bit when we were in the room but not so much that I would say it was a problem.", "title": "Lives up to the reviews", "user": "ryjenw", "date": "July 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35743448}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "This was our second visit to Rivertide Suites and we would certainly stay there again.
