We booked a regular swim up room then upgraded to a swim up Casita in section 29 which was worth the $80/night. They were having a 50% off promotions on upgrades. We felt the casitas section didn't feel quite as \"elite\" this time as it did 4 years ago, perhaps because they are having to discount rooms to get people to come there and also to upgrade and the guests are not quite as elite. We love the swim up concept and are willing to overlook the very open concept bathroom (one of us would leave the room because it is weird to hear someone else's bathroom activity), the very bland food, the inability to just walk in to a restaurant and grab a plate at any time and take it where you like (we loved the RIU for this), the pool that had lots of people's oils and lotions floating in them as well as bugs and debris from the trees and plants, and a very not private experience if your neighboring room which shares your swim up shelf is occupied. For the last point, we will probably book the infinity swim up next time which has a low divider with plants between you and your neighbor. It is more expensive than a regular Casita swim up, but the sections are newer and don't seem to have as much rust or staining in the grout in the pool. If you do opt for the infinity, be aware if you love sitting at the swim up bar that section 32 gets no sun at the swim up bar after about 11 in the morning because the palapa roof over it is very big and sits far into the pool area.", "title": "Good enough for the money", "user": "Minnes0tans", "date": "September 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117769231}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "People seem to love congregating by the swim up and talking to each other for hours.
