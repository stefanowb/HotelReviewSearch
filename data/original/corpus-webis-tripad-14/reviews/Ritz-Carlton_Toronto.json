The lobby of the hotel was brilliant, marble, wood and comfortable loungers placed conveniently; the TOCA bar was on the immediate left with TOCA the restaurant above it. The DEQ Lounge was at the back of the lobby. Upon checking in, the front desk greeted my friend by name, and actually accompanied us to the room to show us the unique amenities found there. As the hotel knew he was celebrating a birthday they left a surprise chocolate log/cake in the room, which we devoured immediately. We booked a corner suite, to get into it one must use the key to get through an entrance door into a little corridor where only the doors to two separate suites are found (a nice touch for privacy). The bedroom was huge, with a large comfy king size bed and a wall of windows with a beautiful half-view of the lake and city. A large LCD TV was placed on top of a dresser with a great set of Bose speakers on the bedside table, perfect for hooking up an Ipod or laptop and pumping some music. The closet was the largest I\u2019ve seen in a hotel and contained a large safe and tons of space to hang your clothing. The washroom was located off the main hallway connecting the bedroom and living area (the hallway was filled with windows showing the spectacular view). The bathroom was huge, with heated flooring and a large double countertop, the mirror contained one of those small built-in TV\u2019s. The toilet was in a separate locked room (perfect for when you have a large group staying in the room) and the bathroom also included a nice, large soaker tub as well as a glass-enclosed shower. The living room was located just off the entrance and was surprisingly roomy; it had a giant LCD TV on the wall built into the wood paneling and a fairly comfortable pull-out couch.
