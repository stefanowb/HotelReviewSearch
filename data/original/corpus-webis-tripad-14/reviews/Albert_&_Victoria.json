Actually it's better to say: He has a sense for the details. Quality is superior, everything is nice and clean... but then you find two flowers on a table for two ... That is to say: not only flowers on the table, because having flowers on the table is nice, no, you find two flowers on a table for two, and one flower on a table for one... You find towels, of course you do, in the bathroom, and then these are embroidered and carry the A&V. So do the gowns (yes, the gowns). The jam served at breakfast is not just jam it is bonne maman, etc etc. Everything seems to not just fullfill a function but please your eye as well and carress your senses.
