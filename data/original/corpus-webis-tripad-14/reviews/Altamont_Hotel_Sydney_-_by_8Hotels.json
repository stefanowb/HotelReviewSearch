Alan(the owner) and Sam were more than gracious with all their suggestions around town. I had a ton of questions and they were very patient with me to answer all of them. I was traveling alone so I felt like Alan took me under his wing and took extra good care of me like a dad. I loved Alan's dogs, Slick and Bear. They are very sweet dogs. The room was large and so was the bathroom. I found the room to be clean and comfortable. The bed was bigger than my bed at home. I am used to small hotel rooms in my price range so this hotel was a nice change. However, I would suggest requesting a room not on the alley side. There tended to be a lot of people walking by all night long and you can hear the street noise. During my stay in Australia, I left Sydney for a few days and came back the night before I left for home. I liked this hotel so much I cancelled my original hotel for the last night and stayed here again. Plus I felt safe there in the neighborhood.

My husband would like to add that the room rates also had much to do with it as they are virtually unbeatable. We checked in late and were checked in by the concierge at the sister hotel down the street. We stayed during winter and despite the concrete floors and walls of the lobby and the unusual holes the the unique front doors we didn't find it cold at all. The room was small, and on the cozy side of small, tastefully decorated, and thankfully lacked the awful \"sterile\" feel we had experienced in previous hotels. We had a first floor room with a garden terrace - we highly recommend it. The bathroom was edgy and completely black (more on that later), not to mention spotlessly clean. I thought it might be noisy with the concrete floors and peole coming in late, but we didn't hear a thing. The internet fees were the best we encountered in Australia AND the only wireless we found in the room! They charged one flat fee for the stay for internet. There's also a laundromat 50 ft away, which is convenient and reasonable. And of course the service was above and beyond. I truly think that I could have been staying in a dive hotel in an awful area and the staff would have still made it a great stay. Alan recommended that we try Fish Face, a restaurant a couple of blocks from the hotel. It was absolutely brilliant with a wide selection of fish (obviously) and light side dishes. It's worth the wait. Things that people may be concerned about, but are in no way a complaint and didn't bother me at all:1) if you have a lot of luggage you will still have to be able to pick it up and carry it up short flights of stairs, even on the first floor - although I wouldn't doubt that if the staff is in they would help you out. 2) I don't wear makeup, but the bathroom is painted black (including the ceiling) and I would imagine that it'd be mighty hard to apply makeup in there unless you had a light up mirror. 3) The shower tended to make the whole bathroom floor wet, but that's probably due to the fact that I wasn't being particularly careful about where I was getting the water.
