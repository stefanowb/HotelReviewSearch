When I booked online directly with the hotel, they responded immediately and offered a rate including breakfast and tax to make it easy for us. The communication in English was perfect! I wanted tickets to the Last Supper tour and Dariana stayed on top of the online site and alerted me, and arranged for the purchase! This was 5 star service and I hadn't even arrived yet! When we arrived, everyone of the staff greeted us kindly, professionally and welcoming! We were a bit earlier than normal check-in, but the room was ready in about 30 minutes after we arrived. We had a delicious, nicely served lunch as we waited. The room was very comfortable, tall ceilings, very comfortable bedding and a beautiful bathroom. The water pressure is great, the bathtub is comfortable and they read our requests of extra pillows and a clock and they were already in the room! It was quiet with our big windows looking into a courtyard but still bright. Most of all, the Air-conditioning worked great and was extremely quiet....this is an important thing for an American! I will stay here every time I come to Milan, hands down!

The hotel is beautiful and we loved everything about it. The location is perfect, just outside the main tourist area, but only a short 10 min walk to most things. The staff were friendly and helpful with dinner reservations and recommendations. The room, although small for a suite, was very well appointed. The room and bath were updated and high quality with all the amenities I look for while at a hotel-, robes, slippers, towel warmer, water bottles, and weather report to name a few. We liked all the different lighting options in the room, so you could set the mood exactly how you wanted. It was so nice to come to Europe and enjoy a comfortable bed and pillow! We normally stay at nice 4 star hotels, but it is so difficult to find ones with comfortable beds in Europe. I actually got some sleep in this hotel. Lastly, we enjoyed a few drinks in the hotel bar. The drinks were good, but the snacks provided with drinks were even better.

The hotel is brand new - at reception we learned it opened in 2012, and you can see everything is working and in mint condition. Some of the most romantic places you can imagine, you feel like Alice in the Wonderland with shapes of owls all around the room, cute rabbit shapes applied to different things and even colorful chairs with heart-shaped backs and curved legs. Location looks fine - 10 mins by car to Milano centrale, 20 mins by foot to Duomo and 20 mins by foot to some of the main shopping streets (like Della Spiga). Personnel is extremely friendly, so feel free to bug them with any questions you happen to have. Breakfast selection is quite sufficient, highly recommend to try prosciutto and cheese selection. Restaurant is good as far as food is concerned but with lots of imagination from the cook and rather pricey, in my view, - but make sure you try the foie escalope antipasti, it is exceptional.

The staff there (except for the Japanese gentleman making eggs, who was very nice) were extremely rude.
