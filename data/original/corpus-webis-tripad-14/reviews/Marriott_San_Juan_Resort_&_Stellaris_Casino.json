It pains me to even tell you why I'm writing a review because I don't want this one thing to deter you from staying and I should not. We checked in at about 3pm on August 15 after traveling from New York since 4:30AM. We were hungry and wanted to enjoy a nice Caribbean lunch in the hotel restaurant \"LA VISTA\". We were seated outside on the terrace as requested and ordered two delicious mojitos right away. Followed by this we got Ceviche as an appetizer and proceeded to order our main courses from a slim menu. I got the Cuban sandwich and my fianc\u00e9e ordered a grilled Caribbean mango chicken sandwich. $70 later plus tip, I have to tell you how disappointing this food was. I really had higher expectations of a Marriott resort restaurant. The bread was not fresh and the sandwiches looked and tasted like they came out of a school cafeteria! We got engaged on the Beach outside the hotel the next day and went to dinner down the street at an Argentinean restaurant. I'm sure we would have, as we planned, eaten in the Marriott Tuscany restaurant for dinner that night. But we didn\u2019t. Nor did we order breakfast to the room the next morning to eat on the balcony while watching waves crash as we planned due to our lunch experience on day one.", "title": "Heaven on Earth", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "NVOUS845", "date": "August 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19175869, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The beach!", "disliked": "\u2014 The food!"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel, staff, casino, bar, club scene, pools, and especially the beaches were all stellar!

My high expectations were not met for the following reasons. The day I was to fly out, I spoke with Anthony in at your service (hotel operator) to inquire if the wireless in guest room internet charge was included in the $29 a day resort fee that is charged on top of the room rate and tax. Anthony told me this internet charge was included. I arrived at the hotel around 2AM, and there was a band playing music in a dance club type atmosphere in the middle of what is supposed to be the hotel lobby, which was made up of a bunch of tables and chairs with a bar in the middle. I couldn't hear a thing because of the volume of the music, and there were no front desk employees at the front desk. After a few minutes, I tracked a hotel employee down, and was eventually checked into my room. Upon arriving at my guest room for the first time, I was greeted by a small amount of trash right in front of my guest room door in the hallway. After entering the guest room, I was happy to see that the room was clean and in good shape. The room I stayed in was recently renovated and had a very nice formal caribbean decor. The balcony was large for a standard guest room, and was extremely private, which blocked off a portion of our ocean front view, but the privacy was nice. After getting settled, I went to go on the internet, and the computer showed that I would be charged an additional $14.95 a day for internet access, so I called at your service again, and was told that I would not be charged the additional fee, because it was included in my resort fee. The next day we were out of the room the whole day until 6 or 7PM, and when we arrived at the room it was still dirty, because housekeeping had not come by to clean the room yet. I called at your service, and was told that housekeeping could only bring me towels at this time of the evening, and instead of arguing with this person, I asked to speak to a manager. I was put in contact with Miguel, who is a housekeeping manager. Miguel initially did not know why my room was not cleaned, but eventually told me that the maid got sick and went home early. Shortly after that conversation, my room was cleaned. On my way to the casino that night, I stopped by the front desk to speak to a manager to try to get some assurance that I would not have many more problems, because we were ready to switch to another hotel at that point. I spoke to a woman, who claimed to be a manager, and when I told her about the problems we had on our first day and that we were thinking about changing hotels instead of apologizing or addressing the problems, she offered to book us in another hotel. After I told her that I would think about whether we would stay or not, she gave me a \"I'm sorry\". I then proceeded to the casino in the hotel, and was previously told by a person at the front desk that no shorts or short sleeves were allowed to be worn in the casino at night, so I was in jeans and a button down shirt. After about an hour, I could not tolerate how hot I was in the casino, because the air conditioning is kept very low, so I left the casino and never returned during the entire trip. I believe it was the second night of our trip, and we went to La Vista, which I was told was the casual dinner restaurant of the hotel, and the food was very slow to come out even though there were only a hand full of people in the entire restaurant. I asked the waitress for the check, and she must have forgot, because we had to eventually get up and wait for her by the server's area to pay the check and leave. On our second to last night, we did not receive maid service again, but this time it was just turndown service we did not receive, so our bed was made and the room was clean, but we had no clean towels or shampoo that night and the next morning. Sure enough on our last day, we look at the bill and there were multiple internet charges on top of the resort fees. This time my girlfriend went down to the front desk to get the internet charges taken off the bill. Upon her return to the room, she told me she successfully had them take off the internet charges and that we were being treated to a complimentary breakfast by Marco, who was briefed on the details of our stay. I had a chance to meet and speak to Marco before we checked out, and he was very apologetic and was a pleasure to speak with. I have to say that when the maids cleaned our room they did an excellent job and were very nice when we encountered them. During our stay we spent a good amount of time eating and having drinks at the Marriott Renaissance, which is only a couple of blocks away. The Renaissance was booked up the night that the front desk manager offered to transfer me to another hotel, so we ended up staying at the Marriott. Anyway, we very much enjoyed our time at the Renaissance. The Renaissance is a much more chic and beautiful hotel. It has an art deco decor with lots of water features, colored lighting, and comfy white beds and couches all over the lobby and pool area. The Renaissance restaurants are excellent as well, and are not your typical Marriott restaurants. The service we experienced at the Renaissance when dining there was excellent. Although, we had a good time in Puerto Rico overall despite some problems, we would probably not go back to Puerto Rico again; However, if we did go back we would definitely try the Renaissance and stay away from the Marriott.", "title": "Great hotel in Old San Juan", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "rhoneycu", "date": "August 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 18861471, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great location, wonderful staff."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My family of 4 had a fantastic stay at the Marriott in San Juan.

We never felt uneasy when walking in the neighborhood, even late in the evening. There is a very prominent police prescence in Old San Juan, and the neighborhood around the hotel. The hotel is a short cab ride to the historic area of Old San Juan. The concierge is a great resource when planning your site-seeing around San Juan or beyond.

We were on the 19th floor with a half-ocean, half-city view. The room was always clean, but was small, with a comfortable bed and furnishings. Yes, the lobby rocks on weekend nights, and we stopped briefly to watch the dancing, though no one can talk above the music. However, we could not hear the lobby or casino sounds on our floor or in our room. Food in the Vista restaurant was very good; we did not try Anthony's. The lobby coffee shop makes excellent sandwiches and has great pasteries--at a fair price. There are many excellent restaurants within a block or two, a Walgreen's yards away for necessities, and a bus stop outside the hotel for the 15-minute (25 cents) ride to the old city. Every staff person we encountered was gracious, many asking whether there was anything we needed. The pool area was busy, but we always found lounge chairs somewhere. The large fountain pool, one of two pools, helps mask the people sounds, making poolside snoozes easy. Forget the hotel promo that you can swim laps in the pool; you can't. We stayed during very windy weather, so beach swimming was impossible. My only complaint is the amount of litter on the beach during the day; I blame careless guests. The beach is cleaned nightly. As other reviewers note, the Condado area has several derelict hotels, the lasting result of a devastating hurricane a few years ago. But elegant shops and a wide variety of restaurants on tree-lined Condado streets make up for a few blighted and under-construction areas.

Booded 2 oceanfront corner pool/ocean rooms @ 280 per night + 10% resort fee. Internet was down most of the time and wireless-only service is non-reliable and fails constantly. All guests in the hotel who had computers were complaining. Hotel staff clueless as to what to do. They would transfer me to a toll-free 800 number that went to India only to be put on hold for 20 mins before I was told an storm in Atlanta had caused \"global\" outages for the \"StayOnline\" (ironic name, right?) service. My comapny headquaters are in Atlanta and when I called the office, we were up and no major thuderstorms in the area. The hotel was just using this as an excuse. No major hotel, and especially one that caters to convention/business travelors should have such poor technical services in a newly renovated room. Drinks in the executive lounge are $8.50+ for serve-yourself bar. Security at the hotel is terrible. Anyone from the street can access the elevators and there were two security situations that had to be addressed on my floor during my 5-night stay. Sign-in within the executive club is also very unsecure and receptionists regularly would repeat guests name and room number when they walked in.....not a good idea in today's environment! In addiition, sign-in book is left laying out for all guest coming in to see. Hotel operators are responsible for handling calls to all areas of the hotel (ex. no \"front desk\" button on the ohones) and they often will disconnect or put you on hold forever before coming back to explain that no one is available. This Marriott has a great location but service it terrible. Rooms are nice now, but AC is either too cold/too hot 24 hrs a day. This hotel has had a facelift but nothing major. Business people will be majorly disappointed and families will be turned off by the price. All will be disappointed at the level of general service and staff competence. SJU needs a true 5-star property with consistent, reliable services. I have stayed at this Marriott many times over the years and sadly nothing has changed other than a badly needed room renovation. Guests paying these prices expect to receive more. Having to beg someone to setup an umbrella on the beach was also frustrating. Unfortnately, this is about the norm in SJU.

Ther is construction all over San Juan but if you think about it there is alot of construction in Times Square too, so I didnt let it bother me. The water slide was extremely fun and I was one of the few adults who kept trying it! For those complaining of the cold pool there is a perfectly good hot tub spa area almost like a jacuzzi and is very relaxing. I used it myself when the sun went down. The beach was very enjoyable and the hotel provides you with the towels and beach chairs. I got a very good tan. The waves were pretty strong for children but they were good for me it was very fun! As for the learning part of my vacation... We went to the tour desk of the hotel and bought two tours. One to El Yunque rainforest and one to go snorkeling in Ikakos island. The rainforest tour guide \"YOGI\" was extremely informative (ask 4 him he looks a little nuts but is very smart and sweet!) I learned about the endangered puerto rican parrot (there were lots of fake nests all over the forest to try to help them reproduce no luck yet:( Also I learned about all kinds of plants and the different uses that the Taino indians gave to them. The ride up to the rainforest was nice too. You get to see all the locals going about there business and up the mountains you get to see bulls, horses, cows and plenty of roosters. Snorkeling was a blast! I saw a beautiful white fish on the shore (I was to chicken to go deep) My husband did though and he was very impressed with the variety of fish he saw. The best part of that was the whales that we saw on our way over there it was astonishing(also very rare to see). El Morro in Old San Juan was very enjoyable to me I learned alot about the history of my country. It's like a museum. The area surroundng the hotel is very busy but I like that. I went to some expensive restuarants like Ajili Mojili (a short walk east of the hotel) the food was o.k. Then I went to a very cheap restuarant called the Godfather and the food was excellent! The hotel was great so whether youre gonna be in the hotel all day or on and about all day I think the Marriott is a very good and safe choice. Even if the hotel is not of your liking I'm sure you'll find something interesting to do in Puerto Rico. Like the night club Babylon which is very popular if thats your thing. For the younger crowd there is Club Luxor. Also, for shopaholics like me there is Plaza Las Americas which was heaven. It's one of the largest malls in all the carribean. It was fantastic. I didnt give the hotel a perfect rating because I'm sure that it's not the best but it's pretty close. Whatever you do dont let anything get you down be open and enjoy.

So we did. 45min. passed NO Service, I asked the manager why we couldn't get some drinks. You'll love this. The manager told me that we were play the wrong slot to get service, Then he walked away. I went to the front desk to put a complaint in with the manager of the hotel, but he never showed. I told the girl at the front desk I will be writting Tripadvisor with a poor score for this hotel. So 3 of us left the hotel to go back to ours (THE WINDCHIMES GREAT!!!!) The 2 that were left behind were still playing in the casino$$$ and when they went back to there room they were met by security and they were told because I!!!! was reporting them to Tripadvisor they would have to leave. They then called the bride and groom woke them up to see if they could stay with them I guess everything work it's self out by 3:00am. But I cant tell you how unprofessional, the Marriott's staff was and is. Then Puerto Ricans DEPEND!!!on the $$$$$ from the people who come to there Island, and I can tell 38 people bring in a whole lot of money for them. So I guess the I can tell you I WILL NEVER! EVER! stay at a Marriott !! Even though I did not stay here, I should have been treated as a in house guest would have, with respect and kindness and no less.

If you are into buffets this is the way to go. The kids loved it but a waste of money. I dont care for buffets and I thought the menu was very boring...all I wanted was a toss salad and couldnt get one! The pool area was very nice, however, get your chairs early because they go fast and by 11am there is none to be found. The pool swim-up bar was closed, no activites for the kids, they had a volley ball net, but no balls and by the middle of the week the net was gone. The 90 ft slide was the best feature, you have to try it, I even did, it was great! However, they open up a 11am close by 4, while alot of the families are just getting back from day trips by that time, a real bummer for my kids. The beach area was very clean and nice, the water is a little rough(undertoe) but that depends if the wind is blowing or not. The lounge area at nite was very quite, on the weekends the locals come and dance, the place was mobbed. The casino was good, didnt hit on the slots but played 21/2 hours at roulette table with $25, I should have walked away when I was well ahead! Overall, it was just OK, I would not stay there again. Restaurants...Miros...2blocks down(walking distance) was excellent, service was great.The Cherry Blossom next door is your typical bonzai restaurant, good for the kids. We went to the Caribe Hilton to Mortons, great steak, but expensive. This hotel looked great, we took a walk around, tons of stuff for the kids. We rented a car and went to Liguillo beach by Farajedo, about an hr. drive from San Juan, absolutely beautiful, plan on doing a day there. Seven Seas beach was nothing to brag about. We did East Coast Cattermaran/snorkel great time, the crew was great, they made 2 stops to snorkel, one shallow water which was great for my 7 year old, they have aslide off the back of the boat. They gave us a great lunch and all we could drink. The 2nd stop was in deeper waters, the water current was too stong for me and my 7 yr old. All in all, great experience. We did the new/old San Juan bus tour/ one of the forts, nice trip, the kids were bored until we got to the fort, only 45 minutes to shop, was not enough time. I would suggest to do a 1/2 day in old San Juan or more. Dont go on Sunday evening, the shops close by 5 or 6. All in all the trip was great, next time I would definately not stay in San Juan.

You have two balconies, once which is ocean front and the other is either ocean or pool view.

We stayed at this Marriott on the recommendation of friends. The hotel is centrally located about 5 miles west of the airport and about 3 miles east of Old San Juan (don't miss Old San Juan, it is amazing, especially the fortifications). The Marriott is on a nice beach in an area densely built up with medium/high rise hotels and condos/apartments. The exterior of the hotel is well maintained but may appear dated to some discriminating travelers. It does blend into the surrounding buildings however as many of the buildings nearby are of the same vintage and most newer buildings are only slightly more modern in design. The interior has been recently redone to the tune of multiple millions of dollars and is quite nice. The entire lobby is a very large bar with a stage at one end where live music is performed most evenings. Check in is to the left and the casino is to the right. Check in lines can be long, but move quickly and check in staff is excellent. I asked for an upgrade, mentioning our 30th anniversary, but none were available. However, when we got to our room we found a nice note from the check in staff congratulating us on our anniversary on a tray with fruit, cheese and a bottle of wine that was of above average quality. Pretty classy for a Marriott. Our room was \"ocean view\" (see photo) and looked off to the west. Ocean front rooms face north. The room was decently sized, had a comfortable chair with a good reading light (you don't get those often enough) and was well maintained and very clean (and my wife is very, uh, picky, shall we say, when it comes to clean). The room service food (mostly from their \"La Vista\" restaurant) was well above average. We did not eat in their \"high end\" restaurant. The pools and beach were very nice. The casino was small, but adequate. My only complaint was that they only had one craps table and that didn't open until 8pm. My wife felt that was a plus, not a minus, however! A couple of quick notes: contrary to other comments here, my GPS worked fine and my Verizon cell phone worked fine too. You can call back to the USA as easily as calling your next door neighbor when you're at home. Roads are excellent, but very crowded around San Juan. Roads up in the hills and mountains are VERY serpentine. The Arecibo Observatory is closed on mondays and tuesdays (we found out the hard way). USA dollars are used and electricity is USA standard. Most people there speak some English, but knowing some Spanish is helpful. The road signs are in Spanish. Safety is no more an issue than it is in the USA. A little common sense there, as here, is always a good idea. One last note... my wife wanted the next book in a series she was reading so we went to a nearby bookstore. The books were in Spanish. Duh. They told us to go to the Borders book store in the mall for English books, so away we went. We found the mall without difficulty just off the highway a couple of miles south and were surprised to find that the mall was bigger and nicer than the malls at home!

Puerto Ricans are a very friendly people in general and this shows, always asking if everything was ok and always greeting you with a friendly smile. I had a corner room (#1609) overlooking the ocean and pool/Old San Juan. The corner rooms have a wrap around terrace in which easily you could entertain over 10 people. they have chairs and a table so you can watch the spectacular sunsets from your terrace while enjoying a drink or simply relaxing. The business lounge at the 21st floor is very nice also, they have appetizers from 5-730pm (Sunday-Thursday) which can easily serve as a meal. In the morning they also have breakfast which I found more than adequate. There's an automatic coffee machine also which makes excellent espresso. The beach: perfect also. Included in the price is a \"resort fee\" which allows you to use the hotel beach chairs and umbrellas. So you only have to tell the attendant at the beach where you want your chair and umbrella and thats it, no $$ involved. Most of the time I was there the beach was half empty but on weekends you find more locals that stay at the hotel and can be more crowded but never too crowded.", "title": "Super customer service", "user": "kristin9519", "date": "July 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17647464, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Hotel and staff", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing it was perfect"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We just returned from a long weekend in San Juan.
