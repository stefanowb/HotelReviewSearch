Stayed in a suite, had two floors (first time i've had such a big room...). Has some promise, but two quirks: the room had no desk, so was bit useless for working. And there was a toilet downstairs but it didn't have a wash basin, so had to go to the upstairs toilet to wash hands. I would hope these quirks can be sorted by the management., as otherwise was a nice hotel.", "user": "cdd86", "date": "October 12, 2011", "id": 119218602}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "3 star hotel with rooms from a 4 star hotel", "text": "Very good and brand new Novotel hotel.

The only negatives are plastic glasses and paper cups, so after one cup of coffee the paper cup was useless. This seemed an unnecessary economy. Forget the bathrobe and provide mug and glass.
