I would class the Pinar as a very basic 2 star hotel if not a 1 star - we have stayed in many 2 star hotels in Turkey and Greece and this was by far the most basic. The rooms were small and dark (definitely in need of redecoration) and the blanket in the room looked like it was full of dust mites - I couldn't touch it - yuk! The room was relatively clean. The cleaner was lovely though and she made the beds every day. I just didn't like walking around in bare feet as you picked up other people's hair (new mop needed I think). The pool is very small but clean. The people on reception (in particular the young girl who was always smiling) were really lovely and helpful.", "title": "fun fun fun and more fun", "user": "spunji43", "date": "October 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 20802161, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the friendlinesss of staff an guests", "disliked": "\u2014 everything was excellent"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Bed & Breakfast is a con - it's crap and there's not very much of it and the tea, well it was stewed rubbish!

The food is awsome and the best restaurant for us was the Mexican - El Diva (I think that's the name - next to McDonalds).
