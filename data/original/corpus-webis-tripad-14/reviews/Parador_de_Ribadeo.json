It was nice enough but something of a letdown after the wonderful Villa Rosario in Ribadesella. It\u2019s starting to fray a bit about the edges and could use some freshening up, especially in the rooms where floors could use resurfacing. The amount of space OTOH is amazing. For 154 euros including tax and breakfast on a \u201cGolden Days\u201d special promotion based on our age\u2014how discriminatory but I\u2019ll take it, we had not only a bedroom but also a very large living room, a walk-in closet room, a sun porch with windows onto the estuary and two full bathrooms. Food in the dining room was ok but nothing to write about. Breakfast there was plentiful but not as good as Vincci Puerto Chico in Santander where the tortilla was head and shoulders better.", "title": "Parador exemplary of town of Ribadeo, needs more TLC", "user": "FloridaTravelmum", "date": "September 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 20033169, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Tremendous amount of space in the room(s)", "disliked": "\u2014 Need for some updating of rooms, more TLC"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed at this Parador for one night. We had stayed in Santiago for three nights in a superb 5 star hotel and were very disappointed with this Parador. The staff were extremely unfriendly when we arrived. We were given a room without a view and it was very small. The bathroom was small and pretty sparse. Ribadeo itself was very disappointing apart from a couple of interesting old buildings in the square. We did have an amazing meal at a restaurant near the front (Restaurante Marinero), it specialises in fish and was very reasonable and the food was superb. The restaurant opens at 8.30 and it is obviously very popular as it was very busy. The only plus point about the Parador was the breakfast which was excellent and there were a lot of choices - hot and cold.
