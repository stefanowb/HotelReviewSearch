While the western theme is spot on and helps the magic of the theme parks live on, the rooms are really basic. Nothing wrong with that after all, as it is clearly marketed as a value Disney hotel vs the more luxurious ones. What's wrong is that the rooms do not get cleaned or maintained. Finding plastic wraps and dust on the carpet and in the bathroom did not give us a good first impression, and it's clear that the carpets do not get vacuum cleaned very often. In fact the carpet dates back to 1992 and has never been replaced after that. I used to live near the carpet factory which produced the carpets for all the Disney hotels, including the Cheyenne wit those bull's horns pattern, and this carpet is still there, only much, much darker and worn out. Breakfast was ok, a bit chaotic but it was expected. Reception was fine, the shuttle buses to the parks very frequent. It would be so much better if only they took good care of the rooms.. We've also stayed at Marriotts Village and Elysee Val D Europe which were of course more expensive, but also much more value for money.

The rooms were ok could do with a lick of paint but clean and the beds were comfortable which is what you need after a day at the parks. We had 1 double bed and a set of bunk beds all were made everyday and towels changed daily. We had a kettle in the room but no tea & coffee making facilities, no cups. We stayed on the half board package and I'm so glad we did as it is very expensive to eat in the resorts & hotels. It would have cost around \u20ac75 for the 3 of us to eat a standard burger & chip meal with an ice cream and soft drink nothing fancy in the evening. This was at one of the cheaper places to eat. There is a McDonalds in downtown Disney but it gets packed and the prices again are slightly inflated to those back home. We went to the cowboy cookout which we could use with our half board package. You get to meet mickey . Goofy, Pluto and Minnie & woody you was not rushed and could spend as long as you needed and the food was lovely well worth it. Again this would have cost for 3 around \u20ac75 for lunch. Some of the rides were shut due to being refurbished but staying in a resort hotel does mean going into the park 2 hours early so you could get on a selection of rides before the park opens. Not all the rides are open at this time. Going this time if year and being a school holiday I thought it would be really busy but it wasn't. The tower of terror ride had a maximum wait if 10 minutes althought some of the kids rides were around 40 mins.

Positives - much more character than Santa Fe where we stayed last time. Rooms were clean and comfy, kids loved the bunks. Very quiet all night. The only negative was the rush for breakfast but it was the same at the Santa Fe and no doubt all the other Disney Hotels. At breakfast for 8am, we managed to get a table after a few minutes hovering around but had to clear the table ourselves - good idea to take a small Dettol spray and some wipes. There's only 2 toasters which is ridiculous! I took me 15-20 minutes just to get some toast for the kids. If your kids only like certain cereals take some with you. Mine didn't like the frosties, choco flakes, special K, or lage rice crispie type things. For adults there is a selection of different croissants which are really tasty. Take food bags with you. Get into the parks as early as possible - we were late on our last day at around 10:15am and queued for 1hour to get past the security bag check point!
