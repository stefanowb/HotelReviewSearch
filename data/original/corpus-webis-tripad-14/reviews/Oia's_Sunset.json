Each room has its own lounge chair and umbrella which was so nice. Panos was very helpful and kind- he welcomed us with a bottle of wine (for our honeymoon), and he was more than happy to give recommendations and ideas of things to do. He was incredibly responsive during the booking and always got back to me the same day. The only downside were the following: 1) our room was right next to one of the main walkways and it was very loud, especially when the cruise tour groups poured in and out; 2) there really isn't a view of the water or much of the sunset- mostly of other beautiful white buildings. This is fine, but if you are hoping to lounge around and enjoy views of the water, this is not the place. Overall, it was a good place to stay.
