Let me begin with the pros. The hotel is clean and Ikea-modern, the rooms are large and the beds were great. It is closely situated to the Gare de Valence-Ville, and there are lots of great bakeries around. Things I didn't like so much: This hotel is pretty expensive for what you get at 120 euros a night for two people. I have stayed at much nicer hotels state-side, like the Westin, and paid less. I had to pay for Wi-Fi. Now I'm sure you'll think I'm ridiculous in complaining about paying a very nominal fee for internet, but in my month of traveling around Europe, this was one of the most expensive hotels I stayed at and the only one without free Wi-Fi. Checkout was a disaster. After waiting ten minutes for the staff to correct the previous gentleman's bill, the front staff then handed me my bill which had a bar charge--I didn't have anything from the bar, nor did I give authority to anyone to use my room number. The staff member declared that I had to have done this and after five minutes of rudely arguing with me, finally removed the charge from my bill. I paid in cash, not the norm, I am sure, but the staff member stated there was no kind of a receipt she could give me showing I had paid my bill. I asked if she could sign my bill and write paid on it for my records, she rolled her eyes and told me that they didn't do that but would do so if it would appease me.
