We stayed in the Comfort Suites in Copperas Cove for 1 week. It was absolutely the best service we have ever received while taking long trips. We are from Somersworth, NH, so we traveled quite a ways. We arrived late but the hotel staff was very polite and helped us. Every time we left for the day, one particular front desk manager named Jared, greeted us when we left and when we returned asking about our day. The breakfast was great. Something different every morning. My daughters love the Texas-shaped waffle maker. The housekeeping staff was great. Very kind. Kept our room cleaned, gave us plenty of towels. What else can I say? Not enough. We plan on visiting the Copperas Cove area every year from now on because of our new granddaughter, so we will be definitely staying at this hotel again for sure!! Please pass this review on to the staff at the Copperas Cove TX Comfort Suites.

This hotel is definitely the best hotel in Carlisle in terms of the quality of the rooms and the location. We stayed in one of the hotel suites and this more than met the needs of two adults and one infant. The hotel was located in the heart of downtown Carlisle and this meant we were within walking distance of a large number of restaurants. We were also roughly 1 mile from a large shopping center. There were only two drawbacks to our hotel room and those are that the suite only had an air conditioner in the bedroom. This meant that the door separating the bedroom from the living room (room with the sofa sleeper) had to remain open at all times or else the living room would become unbearably warm. The other drawback was that we had a problem with our whirlpool tub and no one on the hotel staff seemed to know how to fix the problem.

It was a typical stay for a budget friendly hotel. The inn was located close to 190 and the local Wal-Mart but set back far enough from the road and stores for a quiet setting for sleeping and relaxing. There was plenty of parking and check in/out was easy. Our room was right off the main lobby. It was sometimes noisy late at night or early in the morning when people came in/out. (I\u2019m a light sleeper) The manager refused to move us unless we paid more for a room with a Jacuzzi tub. This was the only negative during our stay. We had a king room with a small sitting area and microwave/fridge combo. It was good sized for a hotel room with high ceilings. The room itself was clean and was in excellent condition being a newer hotel in the area. The bed was comfortable and the linens were fresh and good pillows. However, the edges of the carpet and some the fixtures appeared to be dusty/dirty. The maid service was adequate with linen exchange and emptying trash. I don't think they wiped down the bathroom. The free breakfast in the morning was average. The hot options were terrible: goopy waffles, pre-made egg pucks and \u201csausage\u201d links. The fruit didn\u2019t look too fresh. Ick. But there was plenty of cereal, yogurt, pastries/bagels and decent hot coffee for a light breakfast. I\u2019d recommend Little Tex restaurant for a solid breakfast and lunch options. Yum! The pool and hottub were small but appeared to be well maintained. We enjoyed a nice soak in the hot tub in the morning.
