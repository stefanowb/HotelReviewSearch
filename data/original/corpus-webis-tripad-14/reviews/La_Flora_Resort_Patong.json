{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 395, "name": "La Flora Resort Patong", "reviews": [{"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "This hotel is a HUGE rip off. They market themselves as a oasis of calm and relaxation just moments away from the crazy city life of patong-- correction-- THEY ARE SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF IT! Literally, the hotel is sandwiched between a McDonalds and a Starbucks with massage parlors and kiosks practically hanging out on the front steps. There is no gate..no security...no nothing. ZERO sense of privacy from the chaos of Patong. The rooms were halfway decent but not worth the cost of the hotel, especially when the US dollar goes as far as it does in Thailand. The noise was unbearable--firecrackers going off every hour on the hour in the middle of the night, paper thin walls where you could hear everyone's everything...and not to mention, the Thai national anthem blaring loudly in our ears at 8AM on the dot (this was broadcast from the hotel!) The \"private beach\" they preach about does not exist. They do not provide beach chairs or anything to do with the beach besides access to it--yes the hotel is on the beach but two steps off the property and we were greeted by a mob scene. We had to rent chairs for 200 baht and the beach was filthy. Gone were the pristine blue waters we had dreamt about--instead we witnessed a murky green grossness. It was awful. The food? TERRIBLE. I've never been so disgusted by a breakfast buffet at what was supposed to be a 5 star resort. Everything looked like it had been sitting outside for hours... there was barely any fresh fruit and the continental fare they prepared was abhorrent--also, barely anyone spoke english so it was impossible to get anything done correctly. Aside from all of these grievances there were two other issues I thought I would share with the Trip Advisor community-- after we complained to the management about the noise as well as a host of other things that had gone wrong with our room and our planned stay, we were upgraded to a suite in the hotel with a private pool. This would have made up for everything had the following not happened. My friend, whom I was traveling and staying with, almost cut his foot on a large shard of broken glass that was left carelessly in the bottom of our private pool. Apparently, a previous guest had broken the window and when the hotel repaired it, they clearly had forgotten to clean up the remains. IT WAS ABSURD. One of us could have easily cut open our foot on it and sued the hotel. Luckily we found it in time but that kind of negligence is frightening at an SLH 5 star hotel and when we brought it up to management, they did nothing. Lastly, it was our final day at the hotel and we had invited three of our friends to come by and have drinks by the pool. Please note that at the time we had invited our friends over the pool was practically empty. It was us and one man who was chain smoking cigarettes. Our friends arrived and the manager walks up to us and tells us that we are NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE FRIENDS AT THE POOL. They should leave immediately as the pool is only available for hotel guests. THERE WAS NO ONE AT THE POOL. Well that was the straw that broke the camels back. It was so embarrassing, so unnecessary and so ridiculous. We were shocked. I felt like had been a part of thailand scam where I thought I was getting one thing and instead got something very very different. If you want a gorgeous, relaxing experience with a private beach and real 5-star amenities that's near Patong but not IN IT, try Le Meridien. DO NOT BE FOOLED!", "title": "DON'T BE FOOLED!!

It\u2019s literally on the main drag. No big lobby. Literally an entrance in between Starbucks and McDonalds ! We were greeted by security staff ( again worrying ) and the guys at the reception came out to meet us. My first gut feel was\u2026\u2019\u2019this is not good\u2019\u2019 \u2026but trust me\u2026this was the one and only time I felt this in the week we were there. All the staff are execptional ! Kind, polite , attentive , well-mannered and couldn\u2019t have gone out of their way more. Even in the face of some rather rude Russian ( shock horror ) and Middle Eastern guests\u2026it never fazed them. Check in was smooth and quick. The room was huge. Very modern, clean and with ALL amenities. From beach towels to scented candles. No immediate complaints and non from then on re room . As far as location is concerned LF is one of the few hotels that is based on the beach. Most hotels you have to cross the road! Lovely clean pools\u2026.great poolside service\u2026 comfy sunbeds\u2026clean well groomed gardens\u2026and again plenty of security to stop and wanderers from the beach ! The beach was great but I had to remind myself it was at the end the brink of the rainy season. So hard to gaugehow busy it is in the height. We were told from the locals that at the height you cant move\u2026both on the beach and streets. So be aware. Breakfast was good and plentiful. We never ate there in the evenings so can\u2019t comment. The roof top sunset bar is brilliant. I heard the spa was good but then again we never went. Staff are at hand to recommend trips , restaurants and attractions. However it was available cheaper outside the hotel. Considering the location I never experienced any noise from the street. As you walk outside the main entrance you literally ARE right in the middle of EVERYTHING ! so no problems re that. All excursions pick you up at the hotel. Some great restaurants about if you want to eat away from the Riff Raff. If you have booked Patong as a location you should know what to expect ! It\u2019s party town and ANYTHING goes. You can escape this at La Flora ! Would I go back to Patong ?....I dunno \u2026 Would I go back to La Flora ? \u2026 Yes.!! But you cant do one without the other !
