Everyone you meet is smiling and having fun. I never say any Grumpy Gus' on our trip. Got this on priceline and that was my first surprise. 2nd came when we realized it was a golf resort which was perfect since this was for my husband's birthday. Check-in was a no wait experience at 4pm. That is the first in a long time. Check-in was a breeze and we were given a lovely room on the 10th floor overlooking the 8th green and the nature trail. The rooms were very nice. Children could be heard in the hallways sometimes but the rooms were quiet inside. The golf resort staff, restaurant and bar staff and all the hotel staff we encountered made us feel welcomed and at home. The stay wasn't perfect. We didn't know, until my husband went to check in for his game, that the valet had failed to send his clubs to the golf storage room and they sat in bag storage instead. The person at the golf club went to find them when they couldnd't be located. My husband's club are as important as his wife, so this was a big deal but was handled very well by the golf staff. Checking into our room, it appeared very clean; however, I went to wash my hands and the sink in the bathroom was stopped-up very badly. Housekeeping should have caught that. Also, there were no glasses in the bathroom, they failed to refill the kleenex dispenser and they failed to give us coffee for our 2nd morning. These things were remedied by maintenance and guest services so well that we didn't even think of them as a problem but a minor incovenience. Maintenance came to repair the sink and, on the 2nd day, to replace a bulb in the bathroom and both times they were quick and polite. This is a resort so we payed for parking and internet but we have come to expect that at resorts. Why? Who knows? I liked the idea of a quiet pool for adults. We ate outside by the pool one day and at A Land Remembered for lunch twice. All the food was so great that we didn't feel like we needed to go elsewhere to eat. A Publix is across the street for drinks and snacks. This turned out to be one of the most relaxing weekends we have experienced in a long time.

We stayed local (using Priceline for an unbeatable deal) and knew what to expect. We had stayed before and had our complaints of a resort that so many people say that they \"love.\" We were, and still are, not amazed by the service that is offered to The Rosen's guests. With so many choices for 'beautiful' accommodations, it's difficult to understand why this hotel would stand-out. Nice facilities, decent restaurants, many amenities...but it's in the details when you advertise as \"luxury.\" You could put a rock in a very pretty box and guess what you'd have? I rock in a pretty box. That's pretty much the experience at The Rose Shingle Creek. I paid attention. The only exceptional service was the gate guard asking if this was our first time, where we said \"no,\" and he said \"well, welcome home!\" These touches are what makes the difference to discerning travelers. Having said that, there are deals to be had on this resort. Never pay the published price. If you do, I would suspect you'd feel cheated. The pools are nice, but basically unattended. Good luck at finding someone to bring you a cocktail or snack. The front desk staff is pedestrian, at best. The actual structure is quite beautiful inside. Again, sad that it's decor is geared to an elderly clientele (this would be my guess). I would recommend that you do not purchase the wireless internet. It is accessible from your guest room, but don't expect functionality in the lobby or pool areas. During our stay, the credit card readers at the in-sight restaurants/shops were no functioning. Big, long, lines...no added help to aid (or apologies) to help with the extra time handwriting receipts for room charges/credit purchases. We do enjoy the \"value\" of their spa...quiet, seemingly unused, and adequately appointed, I'm not sure you could find a better bargain for the facilities (no extraordinary service, however). It appears that with the \"markdowns\" that are available from mass market websites, that this resort has attracted some particularly unappealing guests. Hallways were loud...could hear laughing/partying from our neighbors and throughout the corridors. Please note that the price we paid was comparable to a 3-star hotel, so there is some guilt in complaining. I cannot imagine, however, paying their websites rates and receiving such sub-standard service. NOT an exceptional resort.", "title": "We thought we'd give it another try.

Like most have commented, this place is huge. It is a convention hotel, period. Yes, there is a great golf course and other \u201cresort\u201d amenities, but first and foremost it is a convention hotel. If you are looking for a hotel for a Disney or other theme park vacation, I would not recommend Shingle Creek; there are other properties with similar amenities much closer to the parks. Now, if you want to get away for the weekend, play some golf and just relax without leaving the hotel, then Shingle Creek is a great choice. The hotel is always very presentable and the staff is great, mostly college students from UCF, but they are very attentive. The golf course, which I have played several times, is always in tournament shape and offers a nice challenge. The pools, lounge areas, and outside bar are always clean and well staffed. Food at all the restaurants is good, including the steakhouse at the golf club. As others have mentioned, there are extra charges for several things including the fitness center (have never used), in-room internet (lobby is free), and parking is usually around $20/day for valet. They do not charge a \u201cresort\u201d fee like some other area hotels, so the extra charges are not that bad, just be prepared.

It was as if you weren't really dinning just some schmuck bellied up to the bar. In my opinion there should not be seating there. It is way too busy Had people buzzing by but no one noticed i was not getting waited on, including a couple of guys sporting high dollar suits which i would assume were manegers. Ordered a $100 bottle of wine. And waited. Finished three full glasses of sparkling water and waited. Finally got frustrated and went to the bar.

I repeated everything that was on their web site and asked her to confirm that this was the same package. She confirmed that it was, so I booked it for 2/17/12. I told some friends about it and they called RSCR to also make reservations. RSCR told them that the package didn't exist at that price, so they pulled up my reservations. RSCR told them that my package didn't include golf. I called RSCR, spoke to manager Jeff and explained the situation. He went back and listened to the phone tapes, confirmed that his rep. had offered the golf /room package of 1 night stay and 1 round of golf for 2 inclusive at $149.00, plus tax, but he would not honor my reservation. My cost would be $309.00 , with golf included. His resolution to the problem was to \"let me\" cancel my reservations. For the record, their policy is 5 day advance cancellation at n/c.
