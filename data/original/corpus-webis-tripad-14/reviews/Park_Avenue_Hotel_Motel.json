On a Saturday evening there is live music. We had the lamb, which was cooked perfectly and the Barramundi with squid ink which was also awesome. The kids had burgers (which were home made patties) and the fish and chips, which was really good. The kids meals came with an ice cream included. The service was without exception very friendly and professional. We will be back. Great to see a hotel in Rocky realigning themselves to a more quality orientated market.", "title": "Interesting menu and good kids meals", "user": "robmigrates", "date": "December 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 186971043}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited August 2013", "text": "This place may look professional but so so far from it seriously for the price if the food you would expect table service but nope... Have to go order yourself and after a 45 min wait the food was very small and not very enjoyable trying to much to make it look fancy rather then taste nice. Would definitely choose other restaurants over this place", "title": "Pathetic", "user": "StacieLG", "date": "October 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 182775250}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited October 2013", "text": "The PA is very flash inside now and the service is very prompt and friendly.

The menu is above pub meals expectations, extensive and well presented. I recommend the PA to anybody who wants a quiet relaxed dining experience.
