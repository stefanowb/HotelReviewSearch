I was trying to book directly with the hotel but I experienced several problems with the hotel\u2019s central reservation department. They were telling me that the room type was sold out even though there was availability on their web booking site. They could not provide adequate explanation what would have happened if I had booked from their web site directly, without calling them for a verbal verification. Following my call they said that will update their web page\u2026 and indeed that happened the next day. Well, it seems that big tour operators pre-book and pre-pay rooms at bulk discounted prices and it is up to them to market them or bear the risk of not being sold. Therefore, thanks to TUI/airtours I managed to get a 40 sq.m. family room with separate bedrooms and sea view. I am sharing this info to fellow travelers as a piece of advice to achieve last minute booking in this highly popular resort.", "title": "needs more attention to details", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Thefall", "date": "June 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162943899}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013", "text": "Indeed I was offered a room as described upon my arrival to the resort. Many thanks to Dominique in front desk for his smiley and genuinely caring attitude. The palm tree in our garden in front of the room was \u201cblocking\u201d partially our view \u2026 not much of a hassle \u2026 so I brought that into their attention at our third day there. They promptly offered us a new room with elevated unobstructed sea-view, again with a private garden and outdoor furniture, same space and even better connecting rooms arrangement. The whole facilities complex was impeccable with several pools, sun-decks, beach volley court, sea-bikes, kindergarten with daily activities to keep the kids busy in the afternoon hours that they have had enough of swimming and play in the outstanding sandy beach. Breakfast variety, quality and quantities were simply the best I have ever tried. The same goes to the dinner events that were different every-night including thematic specialties (e.g. outdoor BBQ, Italian cuisine etc). So many highlights \u2026 but I will pick-one: the sea-food risotto. Simply a heavenly taste.", "title": "You get what you pay - the family choice", "user": "kleanthi_tr", "date": "May 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 159823709}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "One night, we experienced a thunder-storm that transformed the whole place. The sound of the waves breaking at shore and the lightning strikes (check my picture \u2013 no photoshop), offered us one more thing to remember from this outstanding vacation in all aspects. The resort is very close to ancient Olympia archaeology site and museum. Since the London Olympics were on TV at the same period, it gave me the chance to explain to the kids the moral and the spirit of the games, during the visit to the Olympics birthplace stadium and museum. You can also visit Arkoudi village for fish-taverns offering whatever the fisherman managed to get in his nets in the morning.
