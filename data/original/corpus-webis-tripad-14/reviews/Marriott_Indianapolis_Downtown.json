The Wi-Fi in the room did not work. It was either out altogether, or when it was on it was so slow as to be worthless. I had to go to the lobby to send emails. And as I was there for business meetings, that was a significant inconvenience. I reported the problem to the front desk without result. No improvement in service. No follow-up with me. Aside from that, it was a nice hotel in a good location with friendly staff and nice amenities. It has a lot going for it, but I would not stay there again unless I could be convinced that they have come to understand the need to provide reliable WiFi/Internet service for business travelers.", "title": "Good in Every Way But One", "user": "rwoody", "date": "August 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174219664}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled on business", "text": "From the minute I stepped out of the taxi the service was excellent!", "title": "Friendly and clean!!", "user": "GirlyGirlTravels", "date": "August 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 174214278}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "The ladies at the front desk were really nice and helpful when checking in.", "title": "Great stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "hoosierboy72", "date": "August 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 174125956}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent!", "text": "No free wi-fi in the rooms only in the lobby. $15 for 24 hour use of wi-fi...ouch!", "user": "jamiern", "date": "August 25, 2013", "id": 174040905}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "The room is beautiful, clean and I got a great view!", "title": "Great location to all the action!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cnk30", "date": "August 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 173949392}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here for 6 nights with a number of my colleagues for a conference. Good central location and just across the street from the convention centre. I had a nice, clean and big room. Some of my colleagues were as satisfied as me, but there were quite a number that I know that have rather high standards and wanted something more luxurious. This place would be a step above Holiday Inn but not up to luxury standards apparently. So taste is all relative. But the staff was welcoming, the hotel meeting rooms were nice and the food was generally good. Only warning would be that if you are a light eater at breakfast, you might want to skip the main restaurant.
