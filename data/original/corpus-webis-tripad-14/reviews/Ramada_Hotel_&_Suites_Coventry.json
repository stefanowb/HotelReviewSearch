The modern hotel next to the derelict looking carpark was depressing. Upon arrival the receptionist was very helpful and polite and upgraded me to a studio suite. It honestly went downhill from there. The room was modern and functional except for the television. The government have been advertising the switchover from analogue to digital for years but apparently they weren't aware of it at the hotel. This meant that everybody was lucky if they got one or two very snowy channels at most. The excuse of the gentleman (perhaps the manager) behind the reception was that he had only been in the UK a few months so didn't know about the switchover. Even if the TV had worked, it was situated between the seating area and the bedroom area. You couldn't rotate it so it was impossible to view from the bed - in fact it almost faced the wall inbetween the two areas of the room.
