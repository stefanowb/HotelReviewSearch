The rooms were smaller and darker than we'd imagined, but not bad. Parking was a problem - they have a garage but you have to walk a bit. You might want to call ahead to make sure parking is available, as we had to deal with construction and finding OUR OWN PARKING for half of our stay. There is a cute/quaint outdoor shopping complex within walking distance - starbucks, pizza, subway, cute shops and a couple restaurants. We also walked to an Aveda Salon where we had a great time getting facials and manicures/pedicures. The girls there were very nice and personable. If you are coming to Phoenix for a professional sporting event, you can walk from the Hyatt. However, there's not much else around the hotel. We were disappointed to not be able to walk to restaurants or bars, or really even drive a short distance to any. If you are looking for more attractions - shopping, dining, nightlife, I'd recommend staying further out a bit. The weather was perfect the entire week. Scottsdale is a short drive away, and has several different style shopping/artsy areas with plenty of restaurants and entertainment. Sedona is a two hour drive but absolutely worth the trip! Another unique trait of downtown Phoenix was the helpful people who's job is to actually walk around the city looking to help people find their way! That was a welcome treat! Overall, our trip was very nice, and for the price (about $650 for air/hotel/rental car for a week pp), I would stay at the Hyatt again, and just have to drive a bit to find things to do.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ranns826", "date": "February 23, 2008", "id": 13797097}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed here for two nights for a conference.
