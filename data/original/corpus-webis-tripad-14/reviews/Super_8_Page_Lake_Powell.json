My stays have ranged from one night to 7 nights. Parking is good (we bring a boat to use at Lake Powell), the area is nice, property is nice, staff is friendly, it is convenient to shopping, they give you a coupon for free ice at the gas station, it has a very pleasant lobby and breakfast area.....I really don't know what is not to like about this well-run and good value hotel.
