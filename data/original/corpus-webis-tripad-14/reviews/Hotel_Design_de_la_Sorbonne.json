What stood out to us was the way the staff were so friendly and helpful - they couldn't have done more if they tried. We don't speak very good French but they were happy to speak to us in English and as soon as we'd ask for directions somewhere, they took out a map and marked where we were in comparison to our destination and told us the best route. We also forgot to take a travel adapter but the hotel had one and lent it to us for our whole stay! There are also umbrellas to borrow free of charge - these came in very handy as it poured down when we were there. This hotel is in walking distance to Notre Dame Cathedral and we also managed to walk from the hotel to the Louvre Museum, Champs-Elysee and Eiffel Tower! Public transport wasn't really needed in our case so this hotel was perfectly located. If you're travelling from Orly Airport, catch the Orlyval (signposted Airport Shuttle at the airport!) to Antony Station. Then catch RER B to Luxembourg Station. From there it's just a 5-min walk to the hotel. It's 10.50 euros per adult one way.

The rooms were small but perfectly formed, quirky decorated with everything you might need. We were on the 5th floor which was a bit of a hike (although there was the smallest lift ever) but worth it as we had a fab view over towards the Pantheon and all down the street. I would recommend a fab chocolate/ Icecream place called Amorino which we had the best hot chocolate EVER which was on rue soufflet just around the corner from the hotel. I would definitely recommend visiting the Pantheon as it was such a beautiful old building I loved more than the Notre Dame yet wasn't even on our map as a place to visit. We ate at the Au Bougnat restaurant on rue Chanoinesse near the Notre Dame as strongly recommended on trip advisor but we thought it was below average for the money we paid which was around \u20ac90 for 2 people having 2 courses and 2 half bottles of wine. I used to work in a Michelin starred restaurant in England and we could have eaten three courses and the same amount of wine for cheaper and it would have been a million times better.... i'd say well over priced for what it is, and it didn't really taste like french cuisine to me. We ate lunch in a cafe the next day and it was much more enjoyable for a much much much lower cost. on our walk back to the hotel after dinner we stopped off at a cocktail bar called Curio Parlor on the rue des Bernardins which was very quirky and was a sneaky little find hidden from everywhere. the cocktails weren't cheap and extremely strong but fab especially when we asked for something not on the menu they were happy to cater to us, helpful staff and a great atmosphere.", "title": "Good but could be better...", "user": "hinona", "date": "October 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119987073}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Paris"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 26, "average": 85, "very good": 373, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 320}, "aka": "Design De La Sorbonne Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.136642498606, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "A bigger brighter lobby, all-new designer rooms, new sound system, new breakfast area, new photo exhibition on every floor, unlimited free internet access, a freshly-cleaned fa??ade... you'll be amazed and delighted by the new Hotel Sorbonne!
