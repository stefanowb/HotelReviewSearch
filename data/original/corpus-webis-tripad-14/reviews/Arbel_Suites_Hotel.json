At night everything was very quiet, although the walls of the rooms are quite thin. The room we stayed in was quite large and we enjoyed our stay. The kitchen was great, but there is only one electronic cooker. The hotel has free bicycles which you can use, so a ride to the beach or Dizengoff center takes only 5 minutes. Old Jaffa is around 5 km away, but still a nice ride along the beach. The location is great in comparison to the sea. Wifi is free and available in the room.
