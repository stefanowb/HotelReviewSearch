We had a great experience. We stayed in a two bedroom/two bath condo. with washer and dryer, fireplace, granite countertops (in kitchen and both baths) and underground parking. The pool and attached hot tub were well situated in the center of the two condominium buildings and were spotless. The shuttle service to the base of the gondola was very efficient, we never had more than a five minute wait (a nice touch was the trolley outside the office offering coffee and hot chocolate). Drivers were courteous and helpful with skis, etc. The only downside was the dimly lit and hot bedrooms (we had the heat off and windows open at all times). The condo. was nicely furnished, and overall we had a delightful stay.", "title": "Great condo. experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "KCKansasCity", "date": "March 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7219989}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "Our first time to ski at Steamboat Springs and we lucked out with this fabulous condo!!! Very new and very nice. Beautifully appointed, nice comfy furnishings, granite everything. Kitchen fully stocked in the way of dishes, pans etc. Washer and dryer in the unit. Thick robes in the master bedroom which had a pillowtop king size bed. We had a 2 bed, 2 bath unit. It was not huge but had high ceilings that made it feel more spacious. It was plenty big enough for 4 of us for 5 days. We had a balcony that looked out over the ski slopes and a gas log fireplace. There is a heated underground parking garage that you access with your room key. Each unit has its own storage locker (with key) in the parking garage for skis and snowboards so you don't have to lug them up or store them in the condo. Nice pool and hot tub. Creek runs through the property. Getting to the ski area couldn't be any easier. Just a few steps to the reception area where the free shuttles that run every 10 or 15 minutes pick you up and drop you off right at the base of the mountain! The polite and helpful drivers will even put your skis in the ski holders and hand them back to you when you get off the bus! We never waited more than 5 minutes for a ride. They also have free buses into the downtown area. They are not as frequent but they give you the bus schedule. This is a great place and well worth the money!", "title": "This is a winner!!!!!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "lifeisgr8", "date": "April 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4972566}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Steamboat Springs"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 6, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 20}, "aka": "Canyon Creek Condominiums Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.19512195122, "description": "Canyon Creek offers comfortable two to four bedroom condominiums.
