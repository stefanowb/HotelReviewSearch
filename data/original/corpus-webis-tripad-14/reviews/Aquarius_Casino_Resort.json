Overall, the hotel is old and is by no means a 5star resort but it was definately a good time. We took our 4 year old and she loved the pool and gameroom. The hotel is located centerally and is a close walk to outlet mall and theatre along with easy access to the riverwalk. Everyone was very nice and it was clean, what else can you ask for for $18.

Anyone that comes to Laughlin usually is a person interested in gambling. Yes, there is the occasional break to eat and sleep, but for the most part it is a destination for getting down and dirty to gamble. There are no fancy spas, big headliner shows, glitzy nightclubs or world-renowned chef owned restaurants. If you're looking to bring the kiddos in hopes for something \"disney-esque\", turn-around, drive home and unload the mini-van. The pools are NOT a place to see and be seen, but rather exactly what they were built for 20 years ago, and that is to cool off for a few minutes between rounds at the poker table. Along that note, there are no strip clubs or streetwalkers. The only walkers you'll see are those the elderly folks getting off the tour bus are pushing into the casino.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sliggy1", "date": "September 10, 2009", "id": 40630877}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Bottomline, don't expect to find similiarities between Laughlin and Vegas other than gambling.

It was our fifth stay there. When we first started coming to Laughlin in 2005 it was still the Flamingo and we were always pleased with the room and surroundings. Dated, but rooms were mostly clean and comfortable. Now with the newly remodled rooms we love it. Good location and we've never had a bad view. We like the breakfast buffet with made to order omelets and plenty of other choices. The Aquarius Cafe can sometimes have spotty service but the food is usually decent. There's also Outback Steakhouse and some fast food places. After reading reviews of other hotels in the area, it's obvious a good elevator system is important. There's hardly ever a wait at the Aquarius, even on weekends. When checking in, ask for a room close (but not too close) to the elevators. Check-in has only been slow one time, although I must confess we've always arrived on weekday afternoons. Stay in the adult tower (California) if you aren't traveling with children. The pool area is plain, but we don't use it except to sit in the sun occasionally. There's also three tennis courts. We started coming to Laughlin to get out of Illinois winter weather and we've really enjoyed ourselves every time. Good motel rates and laid back atmosphere.

But in actuality, that's what I liked most about it. The rooms in this hotel and clean and new - no plasma tvs, travertine floors or giant sitting areas, but perfectly nice for the price. The beds and bedding are comfy and the casino is spacious and nice (for Laughlin) unlike many of the nearby casinos with their low popcorn ceiling claustrophobia-causing gaming areas. The Aquarius has a good variety of machines and has pai gow poker unlike some of the others that don't. It's not too hard to accumulate comps and the drink service was pretty good as well. The food in the hotel is reasonably priced and this hotel is near enough to other casinos that you can walk anywhere (except Harrah's) if it's not too hot, or take the water taxi (you're right on the river) if you want to venture out for other food options or clubs. The pool area is a little weak but I don't really think the pool is a big draw in Laughlin so it does the job. There is an outlet mall and a movie theater right across the street so if you want to shop or see a movie during your trip, this is the closest place to stay. I am totally coming back to Laughlin again and though I will probably try out Harrah's next time because of their comps, I would stay here again to be in the mix of things.", "title": "awesome girls' weekend hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "monkeyherder", "date": "August 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 36755037}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed 11 nights in June, our 6th time to Laughlin.
