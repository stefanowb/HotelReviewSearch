However, because of its small size, some amenities are lacking. For example hotel pool is very small. There is the owner's pool next door but it's not the same as having a proper pool in your own building. Stretch of the beach is so so, and hotel is not actually on the beach but a few meters away. No proper parking is also a pain. However, service is good and smiley, breakfast is decent for a place this size. Not recommended for families/kids. Alright for couples looking to unwind. Weak point is the bar on the rooftop is quite popular at night, so bar customers walking up and down the stairs can be noisy for actual guests. Still a nice little hotel in a decent part of town but there are many stylish options with more amenities/facilities in hua hin in this price range which may be better contenders.", "title": "Cute hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "islandhopper67", "date": "July 5, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 69746275}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010", "text": "Dune is a great little hotel.

A few steps from the beach. Rooms are creatively named ONE TWO THREE FOUR & FIVE. We booked the Dune Suite which was ONE - round the corner from the reception and side street which made it awesomely easy to go out and return, check-in and check-out. Small garden opens into a lovely 5mx2m pool, a comfortable day bed, glass door opens to a comfortable king size bed, flat screen TV, Denon amplifier & i-Pod dock. The bathroom is heavenly contemporary with a large stand alone bathtub. Very tastefully done. The twin headed Grohe shower in the separate standing shower should be fixed as there was a spraying leak when you turn the shower on. The service was hospitable & prompt. The spa ladies who came to our room daily were wonderful & friendly. The food is EXCELLENT!!! I love snowfish... and the parsley crusted snowfish was heavenly. The wasabe mayonaise sauce for the deep fried calamari was fantastic, so was the roti with masamman curry. The complimentary mini bar was generous, and the cashews and M&Ms were replenished daily. The speakers are all hooked up to the entertainment unit - so you get music individually controlled in the bedroom, bathroom and swimming pool.
