After 1 week the snack bar opened I would recommend the snack bar opposed to the beach bar, the burger and pizzas are great. The hotel is by far the best one one the beach but I feel the beach for the hotel guests is not paradise as many reviews state. I think if you have travelled to other destinations like Mexico or the Maldives the beaches are nicer. We are beach lovers but out of 14 days we only spent 1/2 day on the beach. The beach is quite narrow but gets wider and more roomy the opposite end, which is where their sister hotel is situated. The reviews never mention the smell either from the lagoon which is next to the beach, you do notice this and it is not a pleasant smell.
