First, the location is superb -- being approximately only a block and a half from Pzza San Marco... Second, the rooms were a good size -- with a large comfortable bed, a large bathroom with a tub, and a safe... third, the morning breakfast was incomparable -- even by American standards -- with eggs and crepes made to order, bacon, cold ham/cheese, croissants, biscuits, jams, yogurt, biscotti, cappucino, juices, etc... and lastly, and most importantly, were the people -- the young people who own / manage the place... they were AMAZING! Two brothers, a fiance and a close friend... they understand service... they understand people... they understand what it is like to travel... whether it was ordering our train tickets to Florence (and paying for them and picking them up and having them waiting for us upon departure), or posting / mailing our postcards, or personally escorting us to the Rialto vaporetto stop on departure (and wheeling one of our bags there for us), they could not do enough to make our stay superior.

It was the second part of our honeymoon and we wanted it to be as special as possible and we were not disappointed!! Venice is so beautiful and despite critics \"Aqua Alta\" is magnificent to see, a true experience. As has been said before, Barbara, Matteo, Francesco and Bruno were all absolutely superb and catered for our every need throughout the duration of our stay. Matteo's breakfasts (Omelettes, Crepes, etc) were fantastic and lasted us through our long and tiresome walks - much needed!! The Locanda Orseolo is decorated beautifully and we had one of the superior rooms overlooking the canal. Although busy at times the rooms facing the canal have great views and it is lovely to wake up each morning, open your windows and hear the sound of Venice. Matteo and Francesco recommended some great restaurants, although very pricey they are well worth the visit if you like good food and good wine (hard to find in Venice!!)- we visited Al Paradiso, Fiaschetteria Toscana and Al Fontego which were all fabulous places to eat. We will definitely return to Venice in the future and will without doubt return to the Locanda Orseolo. Recommended to All!!

The warm greeting we received from Francesco, Matteo,Bruno and Barbara when arriving made us feel very welcome after a long day traveling.Without asking,our bags were taken upstairs by Bruno( no lift). The room was beautiful, overlooking the Orseolo canal. It was very romantic watching the gondolas pass , accordian music playing. We would recommend for late risers to opt for the rooms facing the gardens as it does get a bit noisy early from all the local deliveries being made. Breakfast was as good as all the reviews stated ( chocolate crepes are a must!!!) and the omlettes were excellent. Francesco and Matteo recommended and made reservations for us at 2 great restaurants the locals go to(did not want tourist traps), both were amazing and reasonable. The personal service was so refreshing and always genuine. I was even able to use their computer to e-mail my son when to meet us upon our arrival in Florence. As Barbara said to us over our terrific breakfast, \" We really love what we do\". It really does show.

It was just great, and I agree, please hotel owners, take a tip from these owners! They are all the best. Upon leaving I told Barbara, 'thank you for making our experience in Venice truly memorable', and I meant it. They made all the difference. Lovely, lovely people! We were on our way to Siena without reservations, and Barbara suggested a hotel that she stays in, it was also fabulous! It can be done, but it is not done very often, perfection!

This hotel is such a fantastic breath of fresh air in a world that claims to be service oriented, pay attention; this is how it should be done. All the praise you read here on trip advisor for Barbara, Mateo, Bruno & Francesco is more than deserved. Our experience started with a welcome from the staff on duty, Barbara, Bruno and Francesco. Each one stepped forward and greeted us in a manner that assured us they were waiting on our arrival and letting us know they were happy to meet us and ready to take care of us. There was no elevator in this small hotel, however without the need to ask for help our bags were carried immediately to our room. The room itself was beautifully decorated and very spacious with a great view over the Orseolo canal basin. The breakfast was first class, with scrumptious omelets and crepes prepared to order by Mateo accompanied by a first class selection of breads, croissants, fruit, cold cuts and homemade preserves. Breakfast can be enjoyed watching the local gondolas drift gracefully past the open windows. I agree with another reviewer that the restaurant recommendations were first class. The location is excellent just steps from St Marks square yet in a quiet courtyard away from the crowds and noise. I cannot say enough good things about our experience in this fantastic hotel. I really hope I will get a chance to stay here again and catch up with the staff, who now feel like our friends in Venice.
