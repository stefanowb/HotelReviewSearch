Every staff member I dealt with was very nice and helpful. I read here that it was hard to find, so I got directions when I made the reservation which was most helpful--better than google maps. The room was SO comfortable. It seemed new or newly renovated--but it was even nicely decorated. Such a nice price. Breakfast had waffles--Texas shaped--as a Texan, I thought it was cute. Close to the Buddy Holly museum and wineries. I wish every budget hotel I stayed in was like this. As dedicated budget travelers, this experience was a nice little relaxing surprise.", "user": "MaggieP6789", "date": "August 29, 2010", "id": 77425855}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for my husband's graduation from Texas Tech.

Our room was located inside the hotel right beside a wonderful waterfall fountain. The room was very clean. The beds were both comfprtable.
