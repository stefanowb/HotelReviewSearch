The hotel is actually only about a 15min walk from Gare de Nord station, it was daunting stepping out of the station into the unknown as the area is just like Oxford Street and I did go wrong a few times but my best advice is dont be afraid TO ASK people - I asked plenty and received a friendly reception! Hotel Magenta is in the heart of the bustling area but once inside, you could not hear a thing outside. Modern, spotless, friendly, safe (which was really important for me travelling alone - 24 hour reception staff and surveillance) central location - everything you could possibly ask for from a hotel. If you have found a deal that includes this hotel and Eurostar then go for it! To stay at the hotel independantly you will pay an awful lot more and I was shocked at the rates for one night so I was over the moon that not only was it perfect but I got a bargain too!! 100% recommend this hotel.
