What brought me to the place was the location and also the style of the room, the Robinson Crusoe look. Well I got a different room a much bigger one but not want I had initially in mind. Another thing was the price, I was told that there is an extra 6% charge if I use my credit card. This was not indicated properly on the site, only if I pay cash will I not have this issue.
