We received a very warm greeting from friendly staff and a nice cup of tea. Our room was huge and charming with a lovely modern bathroom, very comfortable bed and great views of the pretty garden. We went to the Indian restaurant for lunch and it was so nice we went back for dinner!! The bar was really nice and we played snooker in a quaint room next to the bar. Breakfast was delicious - very good choice of fruit, waffles etc...

I bet the next theme would be Sichuan cuisine from China--super hot!! Our choices were really very limited. Generally, lack of waiters. Our room was of acceptable standard but with a no. of cons: 1. noise insulation was nil. I heard distinctly TV dialogues from adjacent room and what my neighbor ordered for room service (ie tuna sandwich and tea). I knew when the occupant above me took a shower... Thought there was a downpour out there... 2. My TV had an irritating high-pitch echo while on, so I had to turn it off after a minute. 3. Kettle socket went dead. Luckily, I brought my own travel kettle. 4. Shower cubicle was tiny and claustrophobic.
