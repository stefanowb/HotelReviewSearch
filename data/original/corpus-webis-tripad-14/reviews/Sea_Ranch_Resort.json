We booked our vacation through OBX Golf and were rewarded with accommodation in a two bedroom condo at the Sea Ranch resort. Each couple had their own two bedroom unit which meant we had tons of space, although we could have co-existed if necessary in one unit. The apartments have recently been upgraded with new carpeting and comfortable living area furniture. The kitchen was well equipped with new appliances and plenty of dishes, glassware and cutlery. The master bedroom had a great king size bed with a full ensuite. Two flat screen TV's with extensive satellite coverage as well as a DVD player. Our units were on the fourth floor and had fully glassed-in balconies with screened windows. We opened the sliding doors from both the master bedroom and living area upon arrival and they stayed open for the rest of the week. We ate, read, slept and awoke to the sound of the surf crashing on the beach. Oh did I mention that the Sea Ranch is right on he beach? We spent many fabulous hours walking for miles long the beach, playing in the surf and watching seagulls, gannets and dolphins. Not too bad! The staff of the Sea Ranch are friendly and helpful and each guest is provided with a complementary membership to the YMCA in nearby Nags Head. Plenty of shopping nearby including two huge supermarkets, a Food Lion and a Harris Teeter. I realize that other reviewers have been less than kind but they were either in an older unit or are extremely difficult to please.

What we got was a suite that was better than we expected. The suite had a master bedroom, a second room with two twin beds, a living/dining room with a kitchen, and the best part, a enclosed three-season room overlooking the beach. Everything was in neat and orderly. Since it was a suite, we didn't have to fight for time in a bathroom since there were two. With the screen windows opened, the sounds from the beach were relaxing, especially at bed time. The one minor problem was the shower in our bedroom was only warm, when the other sinks and shower had good hot water. Also, if you know you know you will be staying in a suite, you may want to do some grocery shopping ahead of time. To us, it wasn't inconvenient to run up to the grocery store.

Kinda wish we would have spent a little more to stay somewhere a bit nicer. The place was deserted, only saw one other guest the 4 days we were there (albeit it was the off season). The rooms are musty and dingy. They're clean, but the comforters look like they're 30 years old and need to be replaced. Sheets were nice, but mattress was hard as a rock. They boast about having a heated pool, even have it on their advertising sign by the road... It was NOT heated. It was a touch above freezing and we could only stand to stay in it for a few minutes because we were shivering from the cold. Also there's no elevator, only stairs. So if that's a need for you or your family, don't stay here. It looks like there are renovations being started on the place, but it looks like they're mostly being done on the attached building which is all timeshare properties. When we called to make a reservation, they said no ocean front rooms were available. We asked that if when we got there if any were available could we pay the difference and upgrade, to which they said yes. When we got there and asked about this, they said they never have ocean front rooms available except for the large suites which are over $130/night. Trust and believe, I would never spend that much money to stay here. The $55/night we paid was pushing it. They give you breakfast vouchers for a free breakfast at a restaurant called the Jolly Roger which is about a block down the street. Loved it! Great breakfast and friendly service. That was the best part about the hotel. The staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly and hospitable though. However, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, nor would I stay there again myself.", "title": "Just a place to stay... Nothing special.

The shower worked great, good channels on the tv. And we were able to get a room on the bottom floor next to the parking lot. Which worked out great for us, so we could unload our stuff and tote it right to our room. The beach area seemed nice even though we didn't use it. And it wasn't that far away from everything.

The bride and groom reserved a block of rooms at the Sea Ranch, for guests, which is located on the beach. The front desk staff was friendly. When we checked in we learned that our rooms could be had for a cheaper rate than when we booked. We were given the lower rate for everyone in our party without argument. The room was spacious. It looked as though it had received some updating. It was very nice, but not fancy. It had a fridge, tv and \"wet bar\" area with writing desk and table. No safe. Housekeeping was fast and efficient. The oceanfront rooms have a glass enclosed balcony with slider windows, good for enjoying the view in nasty/cold weather. Be careful that you do not lock yourself out of the room when on the balcony since the only way to get help is to call from your cell or open the window and shout down to the beach. The Sea Ranch restaurant is The Pearl. It seemed popular with the \"Saturday Night Crowd\" and it was here that the wedding reception was held. The restaurant is surprisingly nice with a large meeting/banquet room across the hall from it. There is also outside \"deck\" dining. (We observed a \"bachlorette party\" being held there one afternoon, which appeared to be nicely done, i.e. chairs covered in white linen, etc.) The Pearl did an excellent job on food and beverage service and prep for the wedding reception. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. The Sea Ranch has a large indoor pool, kept very neat with lounge chairs. The bathrooms off the pool left something to be desired and need some work. At least one Trip Advisor reviewer mentioned \"bugs\" at the Sea Ranch. There were none in our room. I did spot one on a wall away from our room but otherwise saw no serious evidence of insect infestation. We thought this an excellent venue for a wedding. Another nearby restaurant is The Jolly Roger which has a great breakfast deal tied to the Sea Ranch. You receive a coupon from the Sea Ranch front desk for breakfast each morning and the food was more than ample and delicious. At night we stopped in there for a \"nightcap\" and walked home. Also nearby is the Outer Banks Brewing Station, but it is a short ride by car. The OBBS is a fun place to go with excellent food (not just burgers and fries, my dish was almost gourmet quality) and craft brewed beer. Shopping centers are located within walking distance of the Sea Ranch.

The first night the neighbors were a little loud, but quieted down by the time we were ready to go to bed and we were able to sleep with our balcony door open to hear the surf. Check in was easy and the staff was courteous. Each morning we picked up a voucher that allowed us to get breakfast at Jolly Rogers. The choices were eggs and bacon or sausage, pancakes or waffles, or oatmeal. That experience is also easy. You just give them the voucher and you don't have to worry about checking out, which was busy in the off season so I imagine is very busy in season.
