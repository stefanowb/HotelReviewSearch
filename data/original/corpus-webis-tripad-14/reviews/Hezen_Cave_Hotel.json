The view of the small town, as viewed from the hotel's patio, is stunning. An excellent restaurant, perfect for dinner, is a ten to fifteen minute walk away. Breakfast was included in our stay. A buffet contains cereals, fruits, yogurt, pastry and an egg menu offers more varieties of egg dishes than I ever thought possible. In addition, there is a washer and dryer on site which can be used by guests free of charge. Be aware, however, that there can be lots of stairs to maneuver, depending on the location of your cave room. The location is somewhat isolated for the typical tourist sites. This can be easily overcome by renting a car or arranging a tour with a reputable company that picks you up in the morning and brings you back at the end of the day.
