On checking-in we were asked to pay for the room in advance (although we had not yet been shown the room), and so paid the invoice in full. When we finally entered the room we were gutted! The room was way too small for a double bed, there were no wardrobes and so we had to live out of our suitcases, no storage space for suitcases and so had to jump over them, the drains in the bathroom smelt really bad, as well as the bathroom door not being able to open fully without hitting the bed! On top of this, the room was not clean. When we looked behind the curtains, there were cobwebs on the windows, dead insects behind the bed, and the decoration was shabby. When we tried to get a full refund, we were told that we were only entitled to 50% of the money back, and should they be able to re-rent the room, we would get another 20% back - neddless to say we didnt get the further 20% refunded. However, we did decide to leave and checked in to the Holiday Inn in the Rocks, Syd - AMAZING view for the NYE fireworks and a tad expensive, but worth it if your only going to visit Sydney the once.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "maxndave", "date": "January 7, 2005", "id": 2987282}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "OK", "text": "We stayed here for 2 nights in August 04. We requested the Retreat about 6 months before we left and were given confirmation. The Retreat is 3 interconnecting rooms as we are a large family, I also emailed some time before we left to check these rooms were the ones booked, however on arrival we were given different room as the Retreat had been given to one of the owners friends. This did cause some inconvenience as we had to climb over a sofa bed in the night to get to the bathroom as the rooms we were given weren't set up for the extra bed. The desk staff were apologetic and tried their best to help us in the circumstances. The breakfast was excellent. The rooms we had weren't as clean as I would expect, but price was reasonable. Overall not bad but do check that the room you are booking is the one you get as I did get a feeling that this wasn't the first time that pre-booked rooms had been given to someone else.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "EJP_5", "date": "September 24, 2004", "id": 2598498}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Happy stay at the Hughenden", "text": "A very comfortable hotel with many interesting antiques,however if you have a lot of luggage do ask for a larger room.The hotel is in a very pleasant area and conveniently situated for public transport.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 25, 2004", "id": 2221673}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2003, traveled solo", "text": "The Hughenden Boutique Hotel is not only a 'home away from home' but, for me, it was a 'home between homes'!", "title": "Home away from home", "user": "Angel_Paddington", "date": "June 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17247136, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Can't think of anything negative!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here while I was moving from one address to another.....and I keep coming back for dinner, as a local!", "title": "I adore this place", "user": "dcmwoman", "date": "June 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 16781783, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 old world charm and the staff"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "fantastic, love this hotel", "text": "Stepping into the Hughenden is like stepping back into an era of elegance and true Aussie hospitality, hard to find in today's hustle and bustle.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lskallywag", "date": "April 15, 2008", "id": 15066957}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Acquaint yourself, as I have, with the hotel's friendly staff, homely furnishings, the building's historical significance, artefacts and memorabilia, and walls boasting the creative works of local artists and authors.", "title": "Charmed by The Hughenden", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CourtneyHongKong", "date": "March 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14511825, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 it was oozing character"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Delicious aromas waft from Quaiffe's Restaurant, and the melodic tunes from Sir Victor's baby grand piano accompany you through the Victorian lounge and up the stairs to cosy bedrooms that invite you to a good night's sleep,,,,,with the promise of a hearty breakfast in the morning.", "title": "No better place to stay at Christmas.

The staff at the desk was perfectly nice, but the place was really run-down for the prices we were paying.

There is no excuse for stained pillows everywhere, stained chairs, stained rugs, lack of vacuuming, 3 posters only on what is supposed to be a 4 poster bed... And the cleaning staff definitely did the bare miniumum. We had to ask for new towels, even when we made it clear we needed new ones, and had to clean up the room ourselves every day (similar to a previous reviewer's beer can situation).
