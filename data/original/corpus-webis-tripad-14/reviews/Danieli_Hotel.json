After 23hrs entrance is through the back door from a dark alley, but our group felt secure. Overall a good value, very good for our purposes, we would stay here again under similar circumstances.

Staff lost our reservation, twice, then charged us for a room we didn\u2019t stay in. Basically, we were charged for two hotel rooms even though we only stayed in one. This seems incomprehensible to us, although maybe due to the staff not using computers for reservations. After an hour and a half battle with the manager, we were still forced to pay for half the room. During this time, the manager was horribly rude and inconsiderate and gave us the worst display of public relations skills we have ever witnessed, yelling at us and refusing to admit the staff had made any errors. In addition to this, the cleaning staff kicked us out of our room at 9:30 on the last morning so they could make up our room, even though checkout wasn\u2019t until noon. Rooms are in bad condition and outside streets are noisy. We stayed in another hotel in Avignon one night and it was superior in every way. This is an extremely poor hotel and we recommend against anyone staying there after the atrocious experience we had.", "title": "Worst Experience!
