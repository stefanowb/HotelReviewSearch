Beautiful lobby and side areas with interesting movie props and set pieces. Fantastic pool surrounded by well stocked bar, adjacent sitting areas and a large, shaded harem tent, all nicely lit in the evening and a perfect setting for cocktails. Dinner in the main dining room was a buffet, more Western than Moroccan, but good with enough variety to choose. That was okay, considering my friend and I visited in July which is low season. Rooms are in buildings behind the main building, and at the other end are pleasant sitting areas and even a modest gym. The hotel is just a ten minute walk to the plaza at the center of town for some local Moroccan ambience. The staff is attentive and professional, and on that subject, I wish to extend many thanks to concierge Azdin, who immediately accommodated us to change from a large, beautiful room (probably pricey in high season) without balcony, to a smaller one with a balcony, which we requested. (We prefer to smoke outside and not in the room). Also, the next day after visiting Ait Benaddou in the morning (we were staying for two nights), I felt ill and he was immediately at my rescue with immodium and the head maid (she's terrific too) with a plate of bananas. A few hours later, I was back at the pool feeling better. With a huge smile, good sense of humor and great personality, Azdin is the guy to go to for all your needs. If a riad or Moroccan style hotel is what you seek, do it in another city. If you've been on the road with more road to do, but need to catch your breath before moving on to Marrakech, Fez or the desert, stay here.", "title": "Ouarzazate's Finest", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "franknewyork48", "date": "July 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134956840}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "From arrival through to departure the service was excellent.
