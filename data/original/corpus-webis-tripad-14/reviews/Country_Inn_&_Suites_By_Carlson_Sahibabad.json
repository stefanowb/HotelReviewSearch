Spacious, with a good d\u00e9cor and well maintained bathroom.\u2026The only shortcoming I found about this hotel during both the visits is the tardy service. The check-in and checkout takes a long time. The restaurant staff is confused if there are more guests during the breakfast time. They are also not proficient in English.. The restaurant is purely vegetarian, but it is not mentioned anywhere on their website. I would still recommend this hotel if you are OK with veg food as the other similar grade hotels around this place are very highly priced.", "title": "Good rooms\u2026not so good service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "c_b_goel", "date": "November 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120780327}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We had a very nice wedding party organized at Country Inn & Suites, ghaziabad.
