Very helpful owners make you feel most welcome. Despite being the only guests the night we stayed they opened the kitchen and the full menu was available. Food was excellent, as was the bottle of local Almeria wine recommended by the waiter. Again for breakfast the full buffet was laid out solely for us!

We have stayed overnight on three occasions in the past year. Today we tried lunch which was excellent. The rooms are beautifully furnished, impeccably clean, spacious and are fitted with all mod cons that actually work! Stefan, the chef and manager produces some of the most creative and tastiest dishes to be found in this region. Lucainana de las Torres is an elevated village and the Venta offers spectacular mountain views yet it is easily accessible being about 35 minutes from junction 514 of the E15 in the Almeria direction.
