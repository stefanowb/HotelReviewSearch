They were probably the most helpful staff I've encountered anywhere I've stayed. The manager Katjia (sp?), Jerome, and Gudjia were phenomenal, recommending hikes for our family, guiding us to dinner, and even ensuring our daughter had a birthday celebration in an local restaurant. The were always friendly and smiling and seemed tl be thrilled with their work. I would love to return to Chamonix and when doing so would definitely try to stay here again. One tip: The Brevant rooms can get a bit loud on nights with celebrations as the late-night revelers return home into the wee hours of the morning. If you're an average sleeper, you may consider the MontBlanc side if you think you may need to keep your window open. Other than that, absolutely no complaints but many many compliments to a staff that really helped make our trip!", "title": "Quite simply the best hotel I have stayed in, very friendly and ideal location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JFWall", "date": "April 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 28002612}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Rhone-Alpes", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 33, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 120}, "aka": "Grand Hotel Chamonix", "slim_ranking": 0.025974025974}
