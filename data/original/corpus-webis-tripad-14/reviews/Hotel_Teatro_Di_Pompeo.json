Our room was in the annex, which is across the cobblestone square, which was good and bad. Good in that the room was of decent size, on the third floor of the building, no lift. Very clean. Any complaints I had were taken care of immediately. Bad in that there is no wifi, and we spent every evening in the lobby of the main hotel catching up with friends, family, etc....and after a week, the three flights of narrow stairs started to take a toll on this tired traveler!!!

We then had another key for the door that accesses the 4 rooms that the hotel owns. Well this is where the real awkward part begins. If you have climbed the inside of a duomo of a church you will get the picture right away. The door opens to a narrow marble staircase so if you have large luggage it will not be fun.
