This Formule 1 is right next to the A9 and is right on the outskirts of the town. 2 bus routes go directly the town centre every 15 minutes or so and this takes about 20 minutes. Be aware, howewever, of breakfast timings!! Published (as with any other Formule 1) as served until 9.30am they finish between 9 and 9.15 here!! There's some good caf\u00e9s in the town centre for breakfast though!", "title": "Functional", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "TimPithers", "date": "March 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4595283}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Languedoc-Roussillon", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 7, "very good": 7, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 5}, "slim_ranking": 0.690476190476}
