It is conveniently located in central Cuernavaca practically across from the Robert Brady museum, which is definitely worth a 1-hour visit to see how this wealthy expatriate art collector lived and decorated his home in a former convent. The hotel is gorgeous with outdoor dining, reasonably priced delicious breakfasts (I recommend Desayuna Poblano) and a wonderful restaurant whose cuisine beats Las Manianitas hands down in my opinion (the experience at Las Manianitas is still worth it though). Our room #14 was fantastic with french doors opening onto a patio overlooking the pool. The patio has a couch and chairs in front of a working fireplace. This was wonderful on one cool evening. Also the bathroom has a sauna, which our boys loved to use and jump in the pool. They had a room back behind the outdoor bar area which was great for them - king sized bed and a futon in a small side room. The experience was unsurpassed.

It's in an excellent location to walk to many of the noted sites in the city. Please note, however, that it's located downtown. If you are looking for absolute quiet with all the 5-star amenities, with no city noise, this isn't the hotel for you. The common areas and grounds are absolutely lovely and peaceful. The furnishings are antique and very interesting. I highly praise their staff. Many speak English and all are very accommodating. If you are interested in hiring a private driver for day trips please inquire at the desk. Tepoztlan and Xochicalco (ruins) are easy day trips and highly recommended. We ate breakfasts at the hotel and the food was fabulous and well priced. For a special dinner I recommend the restaurant Gaia.

Unlike the personnel at the larger luxury hotels, the staff at the Casa Colonial is barely noticible. However, when the need arises, someone is always there to graciously help out. Staying at the Casa is rather like being a guest in a private home. It is so centrally located, that a tourist can walk through all of Cuernavaca's major tourist sites in a couple of hours. One note of caution...this is not a five star luxury hotel. It is old and it's in the old part of town. If you are looking for 5 stars, try Las Mananitas and pay the price.
