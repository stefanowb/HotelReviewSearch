The service at the hotel was spot on, with a very satisfying continental breakfast with coffee service and plenty of choices, served in a lovely dining room. The discrete location was so cool, entering through a private entrance which opens into the courtyard of the suites and private residences.

Unfortunately the management of Camperio seem to hope that their guests won't know the difference between 'fan' and 'cool' functions of an A/C unit. Our 'romantic' getaway was unpleasant because the nicely decorated room was stiflingly hot, and opening the window for 5 minutes resulted in us having to hunt down 16 (count 'em!) mosquitoes that were breeding in their window boxes. The hot room ensured that we sweated more than slept there. The Camperio staff had been very nice until we mentioned the issue with the A/C (or lack thereof). Our hopes for finding a solution were first met with denial that there was a problem, then different stories of why it didn't work, and finally complete dismissal. \"Why are you bothering me?\" and \"You shouldn't be bothered by the mosquitoes\" were actual responses we received. They did offer us a useless insect repellant plug-in (and called it a mosquito-machine). Some solution. For almost 200E p/n one expects better service.
