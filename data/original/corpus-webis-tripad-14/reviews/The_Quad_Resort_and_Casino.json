I felt for the people who were staying at the front of the hotel, especially the ones on lower floors, because there was a lot of noise on the strip. The room looked like a 1970's Holiday Inn room. There were 2 double beds, a good tv with local channels and a few cable channels (ESPN etc), a table with chairs. The a/c worked fine. There was no safe-a big negative that should be updated. The bathroom was standard with tub/shower combo and a clean sink area. There were basic amenities such as shampoo and soap. The ice bucket was there also, and free ice was available near the elevators, about 100 feet away. Sometimes there were drunk people in the hallway, but that could occur anywhere. The elevators were slow as everybody states, but I never had to wait more than 2 minutes. There was usually entertainment from the drunk guests but nothing violent or offensive. The location was fantastic and was convenient to everything. I had breakfast in the restaurant on the 2nd floor. It was not the best but was comped based on my Total Rewards-a definite must for anyone staying at a Harrah's property. I had stayed at the Paris last December and had been receiving offers ever since so I decided to return, but the only available place with a comp room was the Imperial Palace so that's where I stayed-so great for the price (free). I also had received a coupon for 2 free buffets at the Rio so I took the free shuttle bus there for a fantastic buffet with something for everybody. The free shuttles leave from the Paris or Harrahs next door. They also give you a coupon book at check in so I got my free Flamingos and Harrahs tee shirts after about 20 minutes on the slots. There was also a discount coupon for the prime rib/Chinese place at Bill's, but I didn't realize I had one until I ate there the first night an did not have a chance to return. The casino wasn't as smoky as I was expecting, and I had fun playing the slots and drinking free beers. I lost a few hundred but had a great time.
