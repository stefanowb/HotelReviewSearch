Security is excellent with parking @ $5 per night. The street is not an option. We stayed for 10 days. Unfortunately there is a lot of work going on in nearby area (installing the GC light rail tracks) which needs a little planning to get around but that will recede.

The Internet passwords should be offered or automatically given at check in. This was not done in Zetland either so it must be a training or company policy issue, but having to go back down to reception 5 min after checking in is annoying. The flooring material in the non carpeted areas of the rooms are prone to getting dirty, so they need to be cleaned more thoroughly between rentals. After the first day i realized i should probably wear shoes in the apartment. Also, the king bed in 509 had something sticking up in the middle that made it slightly uncomfortable. And if you do not have a car, you might want to pay extra and book the Broadbeach location because there is nothing around here except for the mall.
