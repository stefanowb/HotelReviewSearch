Absolutely fabulous time in every respect. The management staff, Margaret and Jean Marie, were extremely attentive to our needs helping to arrange tours, make reservations, reserve tee times, purchase tickets to attractions, and give advice on what to do. Have never been taken care of as well anywhere in the world. The hotel offered tea in the afternoon, cocktails in the evening, and the full breakfast in the morning was delicious. Especially thanks to Shadrack and Pierce who made us feel welcome and provided fabulous service. Everyone was so friendly and eager to help. The location of the hotel is perfect, the views of Cape Town from the rooms excellent, and there was ready access to city center and the Waterfront. The beds were very comfortable, the hotel quiet, and the showers were like standing in a warm rain shower. Very safe and secure neighborhood although we never felt threatened anywhere in Cape Town - the comments about crime and safety noted throughout the internet are greatly exaggerated. You just have to be aware and smart about your destinations.
