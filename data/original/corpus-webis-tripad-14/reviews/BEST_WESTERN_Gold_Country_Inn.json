However it always smelled musty though it was clean and reasonably attractive. They serve a decent but simple expanded continental breakfast and have hot fresh baked cookies in the lobby each afternoon. A nice touch. It is right off the freeway convenient to Grass Valley and Nevada City. Our negative experience involved the housekeeper. We returned to our room after the complementary breakfast and found the housekeeper making up the bed. We said we would be out in just a few minutes. She continued to finish the bed and went to clean the sink area. My husband said he wanted to brush his teeth and she just stepped aside to let him in to do that. The toilet area is separate from the sink area and he then said he needed to use the rest room. She just continued to clean the sink area while visiting with me. He went in and closed the door though she was just on the other side. She was very friendly, but very inappropriate. It is hard to imagine they don't make it clear that if the people using the room are in it they deserve privacy. If not it is just common sense. We should have asked her to leave but we were leaving in a moment and let it go. She seemed to be a nice person. Otherwise, for the price this is a better than average motel with some nice amenities and nice grounds when the pool and spa are fixed. I think it is a better than average motel for the area but needs to pay attention to staff training.", "title": "Don't stay here", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Momimom", "date": "June 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 112867085}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Worst hotel room I have ever been in.

I saw a lot of dogs staying at this hotel with their owners. The location is good and within walking distance to other restaurants and convenience stores. The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable enough for one night. Stayed upstairs and had to go up and down the stairs, no elevators. Didn't try the free breakfast, but there is a nice breakfast place across the street which I'd highly recommend if you decide to stay. The hotel to me was over-priced for what you get. Beware I left a few items in the room because was in a big hurry to check-out, called a day later to see if housekeeping could put my things aside or send them to me. Unfortunately, I had to call 3 times and left messages, on the 4th try someone actually stayed on the line with me and helped me, but only to tell me that housekeeping didn't see my $80 blouse and phone charger.
