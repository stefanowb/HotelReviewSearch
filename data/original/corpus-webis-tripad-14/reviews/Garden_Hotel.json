This is a really nice little hotel although i did find the head waiter a little scary although he was freindly. We were in a room right at the front of the hotel and i got the balcony i wanted but at a price because for me the noise of the traffic was just to much. But if traffic noise dosen't bother you then this is a perfect little hotel to stay at as it is very near the centre.

A very simple small double au-suite room with TV, one draw, bar fridge and a wardrobe, just about enough for the 6 days we were there for but could have done with more draw space. The waiters were very nice and helpful but I can't say that for the managers - we wanted to use the reception phone to quickly call the rep to arrange a meeting time and they told us that we had to use the phone in the room. We asked about places to go, even though they weren't busy they seemed uninterested in helping us out. No room service to speak of. They had a large roof terrace (we were expecting a lovely decorated Italian terrace) which consisted of plastic chairs and some tables, but it had a good view of the mountains in the distance. We had one night of loud Italians until 2am but one call to the night manager and we didn't have any further problems. He was great and could speak English plus gave a us maps and told us about some of the near by towns to visit and how to get there. We went half board - Breakfast was very good, cereals, Melba toast, jams, and croissants, coffee and hot chocolate . Had dinner twice as there was little choice on set menu, so we chose to eat out were the food was soooo much better! Shame. If you wanted somewhere cheap or as a base I would recommend The Garden but if you wanted to be waited on hand and foot spend the extra \u00a3200 odd and go to the Grand.", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 1, 2005", "id": 4078767}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 27, "very good": 45, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 10}, "aka": "Garden Hotel Province Of Catania, Sicily, Italy", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
