The pool area was very nice and the beds were very comfortable. Front desk staff were professional yet friendly. In addition to their coffee there was also peaches and fresh summer tea available.

A large sign at the front desk said to pardon their dust, renovation in progress. This sign was not there when we checked in, but was present the next morning. Our room was very clean, beds comfortable, and the price was great. However, by the middle of the night, the dust really began to bother us. Had to get up early and leave in order to breath normally. The hot tub was out of order, not a good thing. The employees were professional and friendly.

It was fairly quiet, with some slamming doors late at night. The room was comfortable and clean, the staff friendly. It was well located for my purposes, right off the freeway and close to my workplace. There were not any good restaurants nearby but it was a quick trip down the freeway to the next exit for that (well, as good as restaurants get in Clarksville, AR). My only complaints were: I killed a giant bug in my bathroom the first night that was absolutely disgusting; there was no fitness center BUT the hotel has an agreement with the Holiday Inn Express next door to let their customers use their fitness room; and they had only an indoor pool while the Holiday Inn next door had an outdoor pool, and I was there in hot, sunny weather. I wouldn't have discovered the outdoor pool next door if I had not used the fitness center there (2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, maybe a bike?). When I had come over from Hampton that morning to work out, Holiday Inn workers gave me a key card to use to get into the fitness center. So I kept it and went back that afternoon after work to use the pool. I was the only one there and no one said a word to me (no one even saw me as far as I know). But I felt a little guilty, and next time I'd do it legally, just stay at the Holiday Inn, IF I thought it was going to be swimming weather. If I didn't care about an outdoor pool or it wasn't going to be swimming weather, I'd definitely stay at the Hampton again. It seemed friendlier.
