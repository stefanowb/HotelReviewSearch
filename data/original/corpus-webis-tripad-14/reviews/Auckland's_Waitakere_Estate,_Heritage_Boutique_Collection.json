The grounds are beautiful and the suite had an incrediable view. We were the only patrons at dinner our first night, but they served us impeccably and the food was delicious. Breakfast was excellent, as well. Although the rate was the highest we paid in New Zealand, they charged for Internet access. Other places included it for free. Still, it was a wonderful place to end our vacation.", "title": "Beautiful estate", "user": "JEC2", "date": "December 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 186793306}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We could not fault this estate.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the lovely lady at the desk who went through all the things we could do on our stay including showing us a map of all the walks, etc. We bought the rainforest retreat package so included dinner and breakfast that were both lovely and we thought we were pretty lucky to get the seats with the best view in the restaurant for both meals! The only complaints would be although we bought the package that included the bottle of bubbles on arrival we didn't receive it until we asked for it which I felt a bit uneasy about but then we had it over dinner which ended up being more convenient. The other thing was our room was next the laundry so we heard the washing machine once, but lucky it was just once! Overall I would recommend this place to anyone its a bit old but quite well kept and the views are AMAZING.", "title": "Loved my Romantic Weekend Away", "user": "JessiMitchel", "date": "October 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 179651336}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Degustation 6 course meal was really yummy although pork belly and duck little salty.", "title": "Wonderful anniversary away", "user": "D P", "date": "October 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 179543601}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room was quiet and warm with wonderful views over Auckland.", "title": "Great Service", "user": "Renaru", "date": "September 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 178772117}], "location": {"country": "New Zealand", "region": "North Island", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 13, "very good": 15, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 29}, "aka": "Auckland`s Waitakere Estate Hotel Waiatarua", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "Aucklands Waitakere Estate is set in a stunning rainforest setting only 30 kilometres from Auckland City and the Airport.
