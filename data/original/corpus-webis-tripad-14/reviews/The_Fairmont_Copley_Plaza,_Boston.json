So I kept checking in (they did offer to call my cell phone but I didn't think it would be that long) and finally at 3:00 I was told a room was ready; however when I got up to the room housekeeping was still in there so I had to go back to the lobby and wait another 15 minutes.

The lobby is not set up right to me; the only place for people to sit is on the opposite side of checkin near a reception room and if there is an event going on (as there was on the day I stayed) you have to hear the noise from the room. Finally, a treat for me is to order room service breakfast; don't bother. Two eggs, toast, ham, coffee and juice (no mention of potatoes on the menu I had) for $21 plus room service fee, gratuity, taxes, etc. which by my calculations would bring the total close to $30!
