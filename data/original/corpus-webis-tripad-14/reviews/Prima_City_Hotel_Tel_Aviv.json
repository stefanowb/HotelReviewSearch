In November 2012 when we stayed at this hotel fifth time we were satisfy oneself that every year it becomes much and much better. We like big shiny rooms, teapot with all ingredients you need, big bath. Every day they put new soap in bath, clean towels. Very clean rooms.

What I enjoy about this place: the rooms are bright, the staff is very nice, helpful and always the same- (the same I met two years ago)- So you feel like part of a family. Breakfast is terrific: several types of fish, cheeses, cereal, many, many fresh fruits, several delicious breads to choose from, excellent coffees and teas.
