I wish they would have had this hotel for my parents to stay in when I went to CU. My family and I had connecting rooms and the beds were great! Stand up shower was incredible. Valet service great! My only reason to not give it a 5 star was twice our service in the bar was below par.

Service as always was top notch. Love the in and out valet of the car. Ordered room service twice, it was good and quick. Overall great customer service for our stay!!
