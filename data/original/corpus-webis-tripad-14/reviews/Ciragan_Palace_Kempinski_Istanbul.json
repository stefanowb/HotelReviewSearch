Traffic is a problem in IStanbul so really where ever you stay you will be waiting in traffic jams. It was a great place to come back to night after night. As for the property, the pictures do not do it justice and the staff is what you expect from a hotel of this caliber, extremely attentive and will accommodate any request! I will not stay anywhere else upon my return to Istanbul. The pool was fantastic and again the pool staff was there for any request but never in your face.

The gym is large, the spa fantastic and the food, both quality and selection, superb. The breakfast buffet is the largest and most diverse I have ever seen and is worth splurging out.

We were upgraded to a huge, full Bosphorus view room that we could have lived in for a while! My favorite amenity was the pile of pillows on the bed, each one a little different, with an explanation of each one. I could have watched the traffic on the Bosphorus for hours , but there was so much more to do! It's an exciting place to stay, yet elegant and peaceful. One observation--security is way up there since between the first and second visits, they have added an X-ray machine and security check at the entrance. Our room included breakfast and calling it breakfast is an incredible understatement! We took dozens of pictures, because the selection and presentation was overwhelming! We also were entitled to a magnificent traditional tea, which became our lunch since we weren't really hungry at lunchtime after indulging at breakfast. The first time we sat outdoors and watched the Bosphorus; the second time, we sat inside and listened to lovely piano music.

Fabulous bathroom with lovely robes, slippers and toiletries. Breakfast is delicious- probably about 200 things to choose from, but I never did discover what 'Foul Madam' was. There is a juice batr with 10 different juices to choose from. Ate at BBQ restaurant one night - outside by the Bosphorous - which was great.

It is lovely to sit at the restaurant and have a drink and watch the ship traffic. Note that food and drink at the Ciragan is very expensive (probably because there are no other options in walking distance). If I chose to stay on the Bosphorus in the future, however, I would probably stay at the Four Seasons instead as it is a smaller hotel and I think that the service would be better.
