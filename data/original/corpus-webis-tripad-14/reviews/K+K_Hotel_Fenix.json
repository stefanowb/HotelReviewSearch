Good size rooms, maybe the only \"negative remark\" was the rack in the room, you had lot of space to hang up clothes but no flat surfaces to dispose the other clothes. Breakfast choice was more than good and, bit of luxury, served until 12:00 on the weekends, which is very convenient when you went out late the night before...Free wifi all over the place. Very good location, close to Wenceslas Square, just don't pay attention to the cabarets around the hotel. To make it short : I can only recommend this place, for young or less young people.

Note, however, that rooms facing away from the street will not have much of a view and you will just be looking out onto another building. As the other reviews have pointed out, there are two cabaret clubs next to and across the hotel, so there is a dodgy feel to the street as you walk down to the hotel from Wenceslas Square at night, but we were not bothered by the clubs' touts and guests. The location of the hotel is otherwise great, as it's just a short walk to Wenceslas Square and on to the Old Town Square. One-way 90-minute tickets for public transport can be purchased from the hotel reception, but other tickets have to be purchased from \"tabacs\" or metro stations (you will need coins for the ticket machines at metro stations).
