Having intially booked another hotel much further out but managed to get it changed in time before we arrived, we were delighted with the location of Hotel Inglaterra. For tourists who want to be centrally located, this hotel is ideal. It's only a few minutes from the top of the Ramblas at Catalunya Square which is one of the main tourist thoroughfares with a myriad of street performers and stalls selling anything from trinkets to small animals and birds. We arrived at the hotel extra early and were informed that we were being upgraded to a deluxe room. To be honest, I think the only difference between that and a superior room was access to a private outside patio-type area. The room was lovely, nice big bathroom and all the usual amenities. Good choice of breakfasts in the morning. Room was made up every day when we were out. When back late, we didn't haave to ring a bell to get, there's someone on the front desk 24/7. When leaving on the Monday morning, we were able to store our luggage until that evening as we had a late flight back to Dublin.", "title": "Great location, very helpful staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "rinceri", "date": "September 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 39841084}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Overall, the location was great - we could come back to the hotel if necessary to drop off stuff etc. Also, very close to the tour buses and metro station at Catalunya Square.", "title": "Good value * Good location * Good holiday *", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AandB2009", "date": "August 31, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 39383852}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "24-28th August 2009.-The Hotel is well situated in being just far enough away from the hustle & bustle of the \u201cLas Ramblas\u201d, yet close enough to walk to.", "title": "great hotel", "user": "petronas255", "date": "August 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 39076280}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel staff were pleasant and spoke good English.

In fact, if you actually wanted a view, you literally had to stand on a chair to see over the \"fence\" that surrounded the terrace. The beds are HORRIBLY uncomfortable.
