My boyfriend and I travled there last year in August and loved it so we brough some friends back with us this year. The resort was the same for the most part but we did see a bit of a decline in some of the services. I think a lot of ahte problems were due to having more rooms this year though. The more rooms you have on a resort the more chances for a combo of problems. Our phone didnt work their remotes didnt. The water shut off one night. For some of the people we traveled with this was a lot worse then it was for me. I could care less if my remote doesnt work or my sink doesnt run at 12:00 am Im there for the beach, sun, and food which were all as amazing as we remembered. Your trip will depend on your atittude and your personality. If your an uptight person your going to find a lot of things wrong anywhere you go, if your easy going your vacation will be great here. The a la carte restuarants are still amazing especially the Japanese you get a show with your meal as its being made from the friendly staff. Mexican, italian, brazillian all good.. we didnt do the Spanish but I heard it was good as well. Buffets still full of great food. I never got sick off of anything some of the other complained of little things here and there like stomach aches or the [--], just be carefull what you eat and/or use common sense. Dont go to the buffet near the end of lunch and eat some salami and cheese thats been out in the heat for 3 hours and you'll be fine. The animation team is still as energenic and amazing as ever.. We were happy to see Pinky, Richard and Rocco again who are stars of the resort you will see these guys all over the place during the day and night. We found last year there were a lot more Europeans then anything, this year there were tones of English speaking people and although it still is a highly non-english speaking crowd its still not to hard to find new people to talk to if your interested in that. We love to make new friends so we were always looking for english speaking people to hang out with and by the end of our trip we had met people from Canada, England, France and Belguim.. We are all keeping in touch through email and msn. They have off the resort club nights that from what we heard were ok, we never bothered to go because you have to pay to get into and for drinks. We figured why bother when its all free here. One thing not to miss is the beach party night. This was the livest night of our trip.

We were not able to get reservations for the restaurants until the 2nd day since the reservations desk closes at 3PM, well after we finally were checked into our room. Luckily my mom's friend wakes up very early so we had reservations for every other day. We loved the Japanese restaurant, and most other restaurants were pretty good as well. The mexican restaurant was the worst. I was already starting to feel sick at that point, and then after a few bites of the mexican I had to go back to the room and lay down. The food at the buffet was usually pretty good. The drinks were awful. There is hardly any alcohol to choose from, unlike other all-inclusive resorts we have stayed at. Even non-alcoholic drinks are hard to come by, unless all you drink is soda. There is no orange juice (just some orange drink, like Hi-C) or any juices at all for that matter. The margaritas at this place are the worst too. The worst food was at the beach, which is the Brazilian restaurant turned into a buffet for lunch. There is a guy cooking hamburgers, but no cheese, and hot dogs that dont taste like hot dogs at all. There is pizza available by the pool available 24 hours, but that was usally pretty bad too....if you could even get some. This one spanish couple went up in front of us the one night, and litterally finished off the 4 pizzas that were sitting up there. They completely filled their plate with every piece of pizza that they could fit, not leaving any for anyone else. We finally just left after waiting 10 minutes for more pizza to come out.", "title": "Not a 4 Star Resort!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "boamot", "date": "August 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 19153450, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The beach was beautiful", "disliked": "\u2014 Pretty much the entire experience."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "The staff was very rude, at least to us who didn't speak spanish very well.

The water pressure was terrible and you almost had to chase the water drops around the shower, I am not exaggerating the stream that came out of the shower head was smaller than what you would get out of a sink. I tried showering at differnet times in the day hoping less people using the showers would give me better water with no luck.
