The entrance to the Reem gave an early indication of what lay ahead - is it the narrowest hotel entrance in the world? Inside, it got worse. Up we went to the top floor in a lift the size of a suitcase, and along a creepy narrow corridor that screamed \"fire risk\". I couldn't quite believe it when I opened the door to the room: it was quite impossibly small - so small that I measured it - 14 square metres! The bathrfoom (if you cld call it that) was three times the size of a 747 toilet space! It was as hot as hell up on that top floor, and the sense of claustrophobia was latent. We suffered the first night, and demanded a lower, more spacious room thereafter. It wasn't full, so we got a room with three single beds, and a decent-sized bathroom on the ground floor. It was pretty shabby and gloomy, but at least we didn't have that crammed in feeling. It's all very well to say \"that's London\" - but I don't think that's good enough. This room cost us 60 pound a night for a week, and someone is creaming it at the expense of visitors. A three-star hotel?

The Reem Hotel is set in the heart of bustling Bayswater London, yet quietly tucked away in the relative tranquility of Prince's Square; this Hotel truly offers the best of both worlds.

The City and commercial areas are a short tube journey away."}
