Its private beach also excellent and have a stall (hotel stall) selling light snacks and fresh juice. We do not having a package with free buffet breakfast, but taking up a set meal every morning before go diving, it was excellent.

Without a doubt it is the nicest resort on the island, and the beaches and outlook from the resort are lovely. We are not overly picky travellers and generally stay in mid-range hotels (we have travelled through other countries in Asia) so I feel we are justified in making some criticisms of the resort. The room was large, however, very dark as it had hardly any windows - made it a bit depressing. Despite the large room, the bathroom was tiny and had no curtain for the shower, meaning that everything got wet. I know this is often common in Asian hotels, however, I would have expected a bit better for the price as many cheaper hotels and resorts we stayed in did not have this setup. The bathroom also had a funny (unpleasant) smell and we also found out that the shower in fact was salt water! Our room was also right near the generator, not so bad during the day but quite noisy at night. The staff were nice and very well meaning but did not seem very organised. It was difficult to order food from the menu as often no one could be found to order from. Food took a long time to come, but luckily was very nice when it did arrive. The buffet for breakfast was excellent. One major issue with cleanliness - I have to admit I was disgusted when one night I noticed three cats on a table eating from the dinner buffet which guests were supposed to be eating! Ugh. I'm sure the cats were happy but I don't find that very hygenic. I also saw a few cockroaches on food. If I were to come back to the Perhentian Islands, I think I would stay at one of the resorts on Perhentian Besar and give Kecil a miss.
