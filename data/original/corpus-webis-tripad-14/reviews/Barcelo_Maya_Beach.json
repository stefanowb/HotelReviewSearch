The buffets down by the ocean for lunch were ok but not good. I'm not real picky but I like my burger to at least be cooked... the check in was fine other than the fact that we arrived early and a lot of others did also but no rooms were given until 3p so that made for a line and a wait for a room assignment. No biggie but would have been nice to check in a little early... the entertainment at nights was ok but not great. didnt try the disco, we are not the dancing type.

I would like to say I wasn't really sure what to expect on going to this resort...I definatley loved this resort, and don't really have many negative things to say about it. I have been to other resorts like the Iberostars in Riviera Maya and Cozumel. Barcelo is very similar to Iberostar in many ways. I did prefer the pool and beach areas much better here than at any of the Iberostars. The pools are much larger and seem to be a little more fun. The beaches are a lot larger here and are less rough, as it is in a lagoon. The beach go-ers were also better looking here too. There was more a lot of fish/wildlife/snorkleing available right off the pier that was on the resort. You can get fish food and feed them. The rooms were nice, but the a/c power will turn off once you leave your room, which can make the room get warm rather quickly. The food was about par for being at an all inclusive, but the restaraunts were pretty good. I didn't like the fact that in order to purchase anything from the gift shops, that you had to charge the room as apposed to paying with cash. The resort was huge, and you have to do a lot of walking. i really only went to one of the shows for the night entertainment and think the Iberostars do a little bit better of a job at that. The club was a little bit better than the Iberostars. The rooms would sometimes have little bugs either on the bed or on the floor. The mini fridge wasn't all that cold either. I think that the atomosphere/beach/pool totally made the trip though. The staff was very nice, and I would recommend this place to couples, groups, or families.
