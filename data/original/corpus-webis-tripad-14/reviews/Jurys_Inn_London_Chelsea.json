The hotel is clean with an inviting lobby that has a breakfast restaurant and a bar. Our room wasn't large, but it was quite adequate with a queen size bed, desk/chair, additional chair, TV. Very nice size bathroom with shower/tub combo. The staff tried really hard to be helpful and some were excellent but some lacked either language skills or basic knowledge of the city. It is a 2-minute walk to the overground train, and about 10-15 minutes to the tube, so a little far from main attractions, but it was quiet and relaxing (except for one morning breakfast when we were overrun by a choir staying at the hotel!). The food was acceptable; our room included full breakfast, which was the usual: eggs, ham, tomatoes, beans, plus toast, rolls, fruit, cereal. Same every day. Expensive wireless and only available in lobby. Bring an extension cord. The plugs are not well located. You have to put your room key into a little box inside the room to make the lights work (most travelers probably know this, but I didn't!). Slight concern about security as hotel almost put someone else in our room at 2:30 in the a.m. and freely gave us additional room keys without requesting ID. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.", "title": "Good value, nice service, off the beaten path", "user": "Nebraskatraveler", "date": "October 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 85178234}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Had been worried by other comments re location.
