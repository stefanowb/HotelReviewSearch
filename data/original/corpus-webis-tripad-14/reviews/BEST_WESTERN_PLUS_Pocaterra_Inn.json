Our plan was to stay in Banff because that is where we were going to be spending most of our time anyway. After reading some reviews we chose to stay in Canmore instead. Very nice hotel. We had a room with a gas fireplace and jacuzzi tub and a king size bed, we really enjoy it all. Nice big room. Clean. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Very good continental breakfast as well. Never tried the pool but it looked okay. It is only 12 minutes to banff which isn't far at all if you don't want all the tourist and a little quieter place to stay.

It's a notch up from the normal BW's, with a rustic theme, lodge-style; ice tea and cookies in the lobby were a nice touch (it was a warm summer weekend). Never made it to the pool but it looked like kids were having a blast on the waterslide. Staff was courteous and informative. Check in was a snap: I walked up, told them I had reservations, and in less than 1 minute we had room keys and were on our way. Comfortable bed, nice room with view. Mountains surround Canmore, so every room must have mountain views. Breakfast was basic muffins, bagels, croissants, fruit, cereal.
