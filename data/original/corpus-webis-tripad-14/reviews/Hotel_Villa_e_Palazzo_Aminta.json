Sure, the furnishings are a bit over the top for UK taste and it is not very convenient if you want to stroll into Stresa but the hotel was lovingly restored to its original glory by the new owners (the Zanettas) in 2000 after a lot of research and it has been beautifully done at enormous cost. The public rooms are tasteful, if a bit ornate, and the rooms are very comfortable. On the small side, and again a bit ornate, but fitted out with state of the art electronics like flat screen TVs and the marble bathrooms with gold fittings function perfectly. The staff are as charming and helpful as any of the other 5-star hotels we stay in regularly and the food was excellent. The menu was varied, with good sized (not enormous) portions and the wine list also varied and affordable. Daniela, Clara and Alice are all very helpful and obliging at the front desk and the dining room staff, ably led by Vincenzo, are excellent. Elisa runs the bar with great charm and efficiency. The rooms on the side of the hotel over the front entrance get some muted train noise but they are double glazed and using the a/c cuts it out. As far as the trip to Stresa is concerned the hotel lays on a courtesy car to take guests in and bring them back six times a day, which is more than adequate for most needs.

We had just done a lot of sightseeing in London and Paris so the laid back town of Stresa was just what we needed! We booked with American Express which included a deluxe breakfast with champagne, cheeses, and hot egg dishes. We spent a lot of time hanging out by the pool (which as other reviews mention, is freezing!). We also took a drive into Switzerland (about one hour).
