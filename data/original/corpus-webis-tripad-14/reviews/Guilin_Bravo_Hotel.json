Many staff spoke very good English and always willing to help us with any of our requests.

We could not wait to check out of this hotel, our entire stay was horrible....the worst out of all our hotels in China. On our first night our room was very hot even though we had the a/c on the coldest settings. We called the front desk to have them come up and look at it.....they took the temp reading in the room and it was a muggy 78 degrees. They didn't really seem to care too much that we were uncomfortable, so we asked if we could have a fan and they asked why. Finally they gave us a fan which gave us some relief, but we tossed and turned all night because the beds were so uncomfortable. One night we ordered a burger from the restaurant and when it came, the bun was old and hard. The hotel charged 7% to cash travelers checks.....no other hotel in China charged us....travelers checks are the same as cash. Finally our last day came and we had to wait in the lobby for a while because we were not catching a train until 6pm that night. The lobby must have been about 80 degrees.....every person in there was hot and very uncomfortable....and the staff didn't seem to care at all. They closed the pool earlier that day due to rain, but would not re-open it even after the rain stopped and the sun came out. Finally after a few hours and complaining they opened the pool. Once we checked out, we called the manager to complain and he did not seem to care at all. One night we went over to the Sheraton to have dinner and we saw how nice it was and we regretted staying at the Bravo. The reviews for the Sheraton say it is still under construction, but when we went it was only on the outside and hardly noticeable.
