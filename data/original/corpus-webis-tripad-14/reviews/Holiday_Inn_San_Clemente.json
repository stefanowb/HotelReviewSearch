The service was wonderful, the hotel room was clean, and we had a great view of the ocean for a great price. Each room has its own balcony patio w/ chairs...so you can sit outside and enjoy the sea air. We really appreciated the consideration and care of the staff. On our second night, the room above us was occupied by some unruly, noisy guests: one call to the front desk took care of it! We traveled with a medium/large dog and found that the Holiday Inn San Clemente was extremely pet friendly, as is San Clemente in general. This hotel is in walking distance of shopping, restaurants, and the beach, making it the perfect \"base camp\" for a wonderful beach vacation.", "title": "Nice place to stay", "user": "Trip.Tracker", "date": "October 12, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4018059}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "No thank you.", "text": "I've always had good luck with Holiday Inn and expected the same with this location. Unfortunately, it turned out not to be. First of all, the underground parking is very tight in both space and numbers. One time, we got back to the motel a little late and could not find a place to park. We ended up parking a block away on the street. Even when we did find a parking spot in the garage, we had a hard time maneuvering our slightly larger SUV around the walls and columns to park. If you are driving a tall vehicle such as a camper van, or if you have a roof top cargo box you vehicle may not clear the ceiling. Garage is deep and with walls and columns through out, I felt a little uneasy walking to my car at night. There are only two elevators positioned in the middle of the building with no access to stairs (except for emergencies) so you have no choice but to wait for an elevator even if you are only going down one floor. Across the street is a popular restaurant and on weekend nights the patrons (and their cars) gets noisy. We had to listen to a lot of screaming, yelling and car stereo that goes \"boom-boom\" all night long. The room itself was just \"OK\". I've seen better rooms at Motel 6.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 6, 2005", "id": 3644218}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Needs Some Work", "text": "Stayed here with my wife in early 2002.
