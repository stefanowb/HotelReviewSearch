Dining area quite nice. Pool area a bit skummy. We had to leave our poolside chairs because of the swarms of flies that made teh place feel a bit third world. Nice big pool though which keeps teh flies at bay for as long as you can stand your fingers and toes shriveling.", "user": "SimonWise", "date": "January 16, 2007", "id": 6603774}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Brilliant", "text": "Service - Poor. Prior to our visit I asked hotel reception to get us a room next to the restaurant so our baby monitor would work, which was confirmed before we booked.

No tonic at the bar - \"We've run out\" and no coffee \"It's broken\" - how does a hotel run out of tonic water & coffee?? and managed to get a restaurant table by the window so we could, with the aid of an ash tray, the blinds and occaisional acrobatics just get a signal on the monitor. The waitresses were friendly but continually forgot we were there. No coffee/dessert/nightcap as we were simply forgotten about - I think our waitress had clocked off just after the main course was delivered. Food average...they did something wierd with a Kangaroo steak - a month later I still can't decide if I liked it or hated it.", "user": "CassGeorge", "date": "April 5, 2006", "id": 4933544}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great location", "text": "After battling the checkout scrum the following morning, the bill was way more than the place was worth, even with decent service.
