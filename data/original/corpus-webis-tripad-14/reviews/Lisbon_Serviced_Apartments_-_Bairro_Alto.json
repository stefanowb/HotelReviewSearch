We were in the Penthouse Apartment (Loft), and I have to say it was wonderful for our group! From the initial booking from Australia, right through to receiving our bond back, I knew we were dealing with an incredibly professional organisation. All the way from the owner Luis, right through to her cleaning staff, I was so impressed with PAaricia eye for detail. The decor was top notch, the linens of the highest quality, and the kitchen was amazing! Not that we used it at all, as you have the most amazing array of restaurants all within a very small radius! You could live here for years, and not visit the same restaurant twice! There was a choice of 2 subway lines within a couple of blocks, and we made full use of this as well! And the shopping at Chiado which would be about a 5 minute walk, well........!!!! I would not hesitate for a second to come back here if ever I was fortunate to be able to visit Lisbon again!", "title": "Absolutely Ideal!", "user": "raks1979", "date": "July 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115021172}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Apartment great, but the night time noise was terrible, could not sleep between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m..

The street was strewn with plastic beer/mojito cups. I knew we had landed in the party district. Our concerns were quickly alleviated. Street cleaning crews took care of the rubbish and when we entered the apartment it was a pleasant surprise. The decor was sleek and clean. It was also well insulated from street noise. The combo makes this place a great stay. You will be in the heart of the fun but steps away where you can turn it off in the comfort of your own apartment. There was an issue with the coffeemaker that may have been our fault (it leaked everywhere but we had not used one like this before so it could have been user error).
