The staff was wonderful. Upon our arrival we were given a nice map of Siena and shown the easiest way to walk into the center of Siena. Throughout our stay they answered several questions we had and were very friendly and helpful. Our room was fairly large and decorated nicely. It was also very, very clean. I was amazed at how well the room was cleaned and straightened up each day. The breakfast in the morning was not extensive but still good.

It was not just a shower - it was also a bidet! It was very small and I know a few people that probably wouldn't fit in it. The doors didn't close well and water collected on the floor each time it was on. I dreaded having to use it every morning. The outlet for high powered devices in the room wouldn't work so I couldn't plug in my blow dryer and had to use the one in the bathroom instead. The bathroom's blow dryer didn't work well, so I found having to use it very annoying. The room also had thin walls - we could hear people in neighboring rooms quite often.

Very cozy and warm feel to the hotel. Rooms have been recently updated and are modern looking. Excellent continental breakfast and friendly staff. Distance from city centre is the only drawback. It's a 20-25 minute walk to the city centre. The first 5 minutres of the walk are not enjoyable as you are on a secondary route. Location come is handy is you have a car with you as parking is free. The bus stop is a 3 minute walk and will take you to the city centre for 1 Euro. Would highly recommend this hotel.
