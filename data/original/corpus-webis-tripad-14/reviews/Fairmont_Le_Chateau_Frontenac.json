It is the center of the Quebec universe, with a row of restaurants outside the entrance and more restaurants and shops right below. We opted for a lower floor with a larger room and garden view rather than paying $330 + tax more for the six nights for a river view and less space. We loved our room, 3240, as it was spacious, had an excellent layout and a super big bathroom with electrical plugs and counter space for our travel espresso machine which we don't leave home without. We had five large windows, so we received a lot of natural light during the day. The weather outside was much warmer than we had anticipated, but the air conditioning has virtually no limits. If you like arctic indoor temps., which we do, the temperature control is excellent. The hotel reminded me a bit of the Broadmoor hotel in Colorado Springs, which is amongst my favorites in the world. I loved the charm, the dog, Santol, and the service was generally excellent, but unobstrusive. We had cocktails at the bar a couple of evenings and really enjoyed the experience. They make outstanding martinis, cosmos, Margs.; probably everything and the salty sweet mix of nuts and chips that they serve with drinks is great. It was odd to be in such a large hotel and not have a room safe and the hotel doesn't appear to have any security, has many doors, stairways, corridors and lots of public/non-guests that flow through, yet it still feels safe. We did have issues with the housekeeping on two days. After the first night, we spent most of the morning/day out and our room remained unmade when we returned. We called for service and it was made up quickly. The second day began the same, except we didn't get service ever. We spoke to a floor supervisor, who only spoke French, which my husband speaks poorly, and a woman who was making up rooms, and were assured that it would be done within a half-hour, went out and returned and hour later to the room unmade. We called housekeeping and they said that someone would come immediately and no one did. Eventually, I tracked down a guy doing turn down service and asked for towels and toiletries. He was kind enough to bring a cart by and allow me to empty the trash and recyclables. The person who said that she would do our room came by later and apologized for not cleaning it; said that the day was complicated and that our room was not on anyone's service list. Ridiculous really, but things happen, even in fine hotels. We stay in ten to twelve hotels per year and no stay is perfect. In the end, in spite of the housekeeping mishap, I would still rate the hotel as excellent and would highly recommend it to others.
