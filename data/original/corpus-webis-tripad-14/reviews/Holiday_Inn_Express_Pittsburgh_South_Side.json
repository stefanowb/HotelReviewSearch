We had a great view of the river and city. We had a suite with two queen beds and a pullout sofa bed. This worked well since I was traveling with three adults and two children. It is located fairly close to Station Square but not within walking distance. Keep in mind that in addition to your room rates, you will be charged $9.00 per night for parking. The rooms include a microwave, refridgerator and free high speed internet.

My previous impressions of Holiday Inn Express hotels was definitely shattered. We were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the hotel room; the hotel decor; the hotel's wireless internet; the variety of food offered during the free breakfast; and the friendliness of the hotel staff. We have stayed at a lot of hotels around the country, and we can definitely say that this was one of the best in terms of bang for the buck and location. Talk about location - we were within walking distance and short drives (less than 1 mile) of major Pittsburgh attractions. An example of the quality of the hotel staff is that one evening there was a party held in one of the hotel banquet rooms. The number of guests at the party made the Holiday Inn Express parking lot full so that it was impossible to find a parking spot. When this matter was brought to the attention of the hotel staff, they immediately sent someone outside to help hotel guests find alternative close, free, safe and adequate parking. This is just one example of the great quality of service and professionalism of the hotel staff. We will definitely stay at the Holiday Inn Express Pittsburgh Southside if we ever find ourselves in the Pittsburgh area again.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "fishfry", "date": "July 26, 2006", "id": 5515151}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "This hotel was a great little gem! We traveled w/ two little children, and we were pleased there were several other families there too--not just business travelers. The hotel's location made me hesitate a bit since it is off the beaten path and it didn't appear there were prime tourist sites nearby, but in reality I would highly recommend its location. It is a short drive to Station Square & the Inclnes, a walk to Carson street's many shops and restaurants/bars, and a very reasonable drive to the many things we did in Pittsburgh. The hotel also has nice views of the city and is in a quiet area.", "title": "Very pleasant surprise", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "relambjr", "date": "April 22, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4995374}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006, traveled on business", "text": "The parking is a nice sized, secure lot and worth the $9.", "title": "One of the nicer HI Expresses I've stayed at", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "rabidstoat", "date": "March 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4627906}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006", "text": "The hotel's amenities are nice, and I will echo another writer's comments about the room appearing huge with the arch way adding to the effect and apparent size of the room.
