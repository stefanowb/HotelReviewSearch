I really enjoyed staying here - the building is incredibly solid with foot-thick walls and hence beautifully quiet, authentic and charming. Be aware however that the stairway and upper level corridors are only about a metre wide, and like many old buildings the timbers have settled in such a way that the floor, while strong, is no longer even. I didn't care to take our larger suitcase up the stairs and instead repacked into our smaller case which was more manageable.

On asking at the front desk I was told that it wouldn't hurt me but that it was 'ground water' - i.e. bore water or artesian water straight from the ground with no filtering. I found it extraordinary that there was no notice about this either on the hotel website or in the bathroom itself. Reception advised that the water wouldn't hurt me - it was free of e-coli - but that as it had very high levels of lime in it most people preferred bottled water - which was available from the hotel at $3 for each 600 ml bottle! This story was confirmed at the Stump Inn where we went to eat, and who again sold bottled water at $3 a pop. If this situation is standard throughout the town, which I understand it is, then I think Port Fairy - and certainly this hotel - are being a bit naughty in keeping this information under their hat. Other places in the area might have rainwater, but barring that there is no town water supply and if you are going there you'd be advised to buy several large bottles or a 5-gallon keg from a supermarket before heading in.", "title": "Lovely people, generous, clean room.
