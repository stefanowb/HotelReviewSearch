Interestingly enough our friends that arrived a few hours later were given a windowless room and when I called the front desk to inquire about how they were able to get the windowless room I was told, very courtly, they had specifically reserved that room almost a month ago and that in the future I might consider doing te same if I wanted a specific type of room.
