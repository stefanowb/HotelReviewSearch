The hotel is very quiet because it does not sit on a busy street. That being said, it is still well located near the main Piazza. The only negative aspect was that the walls were surprisingly thin so we could hear people walking around upstairs and downstairs which was a little annoying. The absence of any carpets in the building makes it worse but this is typical of many mid-range Italian hotels. Breakfast was pretty meager and offered yogurt, packaged brioche, juices, toast, hot tea and coffee....it could be improved. We paid 90 euros for a Friday night stay in late October which struck me as being a little pricey as we stayed during what I thought was the off season, but it was still a decent value.", "title": "Affordable and Cozy", "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "October 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 21335384}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in the Hotel Capitelli in lovely Triest and had a great stay. The hotel is small but the rooms were clean and had a romantic charm with wooden floors and trim -- just the bathrooms had tiles. Getting there by foot at first with luggage might makes the location a bit out-of-the-way but once there this seemed to be a strong advantage in favor of the location. It is located in Triest's historic center. The Roman Arch-- Arco d'Ricardo-- which once served as the main gateway to the city --is just around the corner seemed to prove the historic significance of the neighborhood. The hotel is located on a small side street which made it charming. The service was quite friendly and breakfast was served in a small dining area just across the main entrance. The price, which was \u20ac90 (Euro) or about $132 a night for a double room included breakfast, and seemed to compare favorably with other rates we checked out for the city in November--which I is not high season.", "title": "Romantic stay in Triest", "user": "Twostones", "date": "December 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 11191975, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nice quaint hotel with good facilities and friendly service", "disliked": "\u2014 Noise from the surroundings"}}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Friuli Venezia Giulia", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 1, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 11, "very good": 9, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 14}, "aka": "Capitelli Hotel Trieste", "slim_ranking": 0.352941176471, "description": "Located in the pedestrian area of historic city of Trieste,Hotel Capitelli is 100 meters from the seafront promenadea few steps from the port.It offers spacious accommodation with elegant furnishing.Rooms at the Hotel Capitelli are set in buildings of the 18th century.All feature a TV and a private bathroom with hairdryer and toiletries.They come with wood or tiled floors.Hotel Capitelli is 5 minutes walk from Piazza Unit\u00e0 d\u2019Italia squareand San Giusto Cathedral.The neighborhood is full of shops, restaurants and cafes.All the accommodations are furnishedwith private bathroom.
