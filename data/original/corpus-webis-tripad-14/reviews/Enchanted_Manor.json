What struck me first of all was how professional and friendly the owners are - Ric & Maggie. You want to wind up inviting the owners out for a drink at the quaint Buddle Inn just down the road - i wish we had. Secondly, what takes your breath away is the Manor's interior decor. If you're into art, as i am, the Manor is a gallery of some of the best and imaginitive pieces of artwork i've ever seen. The artist is a genius - SEE FOR YOURSELF! The rooms are luxurious (ours had a lovely seaview) with en-suite bathrooms and huge plasma TV and their excellently prepared breakfasts suit all tastes. Would we ever go back again? YOU BET!!
