While we've been to Williamsburg multiple times, we'd never stayed at the Lodge before. Based on this stay, we may upgrade to the Lodge again from our usual place (Williamsburg Woodlands). We stayed in a suite in the main building. All we had to do was take the stairs (or elevator) from the lobby to be at our room (# 4111). There were two rooms: one with sleeper sofa, desk, sink, fridge, coffee maker, tv, and a couple of chairs; and the bedroom which had a large walk-in closet, tv in armoir, a chair, and a queen bed. The room looked newly refurbished and was probably the cleanest hotel room I've ever stayed int. The bathroom in particular was spotless. Once I spilled lotion on the floor and wiped it up with a washcloth. The washcloth didn't pick up so much as a speck from the floor. The room has wood flooring instead of carpet, which I found that I liked. It, too, was very clean, and I enjoyed walking around barefoot and feeling a clean floor. (I'm paranoid about hotel carpet and never walk barefoot on it.) The bed wasn't the most comfy one in the world. The bed is quite high, which wasn't a problem for us since we're tall, but I wondered if a short person or an elderly person would have trouble climbing up into it or getting out of it. (If we sat on the edge of the bed, our feet hung a few inches off the floor.) The mattress was a bit too firm for us, and the woven coverlet was too heavy to sleep comfortably under, but there were extra pillows and blankets in the closet, so that wasn't a big problem. The bathroom had a wonderful shower and a large double vanity as well as fluffy bathrobes for us to use. We ate in the Lodge restaurant for breakfast every morning. The buffet was included in our package, but otherwise was about $15 a person. The service was excellent and the buffet was great with lots of choices including fruit, yogurt, breakfast meats, and custom omelettes. We had the seafood buffet for dinner one night, and it was also quite good. Nightly turndown service with the little chocolate on the pillow was nice, and the housekeeping service was always great.Overall I'd say the Lodge is much nicer than the Woodlands in that the location is better, the restaurant is nice (there's also a bar that serves food), and the service is better to make the higher price worth it for most people.
