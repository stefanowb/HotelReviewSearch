Everything was great, the room was clean, the price very good, the staff was very helpful and kind, we were away for a few days returning in the weekend and they even allowed us to keep our big suticases in the storage room of the hotel so we could be away for a few days just carrying our backpack before returning to the hotel the night before we flew back to Italy from Denver.

The hotel is very clean, the room nicely decorated and the staff fantastic. I am staying here while I'm waiting for workers to finish renovating a house I'm going to be renting. Since I'm here for more than just a few days, one of the staff - Lina - brought me a combo microwave/fridge so I won't have to eat out every meal. It was greatly appreciated. There's a free breakfast which is okay - waffles, toast, bagels, muffins, juice, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, coffee and fruit. The free wireless works very well everywhere in the hotel. There's a computer with a printer in the lobby which I've used a few times when I've needed to print something out. The place has a nice size swimming pool and hot tub. And, very important to me, this place is very dog friendly. Dogs are allowed anywhere in the hotel except for the breakfast room - on a leash of course. There's plenty of grass outside and lots of places nearby to walk my dog. In fact, there's a very large dog park not more than a five minute drive from the hotel. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling thru the Boulder area.", "title": "Great place to stay with a dog", "user": "crosswycke", "date": "June 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 164912018}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed at this hotel, which is about 10 minutes from downtown Boulder, on a recent business trip. Actually, my company's travel agency recommended it. It was convenient to where I was going and had a free breakfast, so I made the reservations without any particular expectations. But what I found was a very modern hotel with good accommodations, hypo-allergenic bedding, good internet, a clean bathroom and bedding, and good air-conditioning. The room was small, but it had everything I needed for a 2-night business trip, and it was quiet. The hotel is very convenient to Highway 36 and has a large Albertson supermarket, as well as several fast-food restaurants within a 5 minute drive.The breakfast was nothing to brag about - hard boiled eggs, waffles, muffins, coffee, fruit juices, etc. - but not bad, and it came free with the room. The dining area was a bit crowded, but not intolerable. The rooms only cost about $80 per night, so it seemed like a real bargain.
