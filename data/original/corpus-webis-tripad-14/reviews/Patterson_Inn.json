The owners preserved many interior architectural details, though some are no longer in their original locations. The innkeepers on duty gave us a tour of the house: all the rooms are beautiful, though some have better views than others. We stayed in No. 9, the smallest room in the inn, on the third floor tucked under the roof. It faced front with a view of the Capital dome. Though small, it was comfortable and well-furnished, and had a large, beautiful bathroom with a cast iron clawfoot tub, thick towels, and plenty of storage space with the double vanity. The bed, being new, was very comfortable, with good pillows and nice linens.", "title": "Wonderful historic inn", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "toesmalone", "date": "September 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 141364754}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The inn is in the final stages before its official launch, so there are some bugs to work out. The good: the innkeepers on duty were really friendly, loved the afternoon wine and nibbles, the hot/cold water dispenser and ice machine on each landing, the air conditioning, the eco toilet. The inn also served a delicious (and generous) continental breakfast of coffee, juice, fresh fruit, pastries, granola, and yogurt. The (minor) peeves: given that there were the hot/cold water dispensers, it would have been nice to have had an accompanying selection of tea also on hand, if not on the landings, then in the dining room. As for the AC, it would have been good to have room control -- AC was not needed on the cool fall evening, and we would have loved to have slept with the window open for some fresh air. It would also be nice to have a lighter blanket alternative available in the closet -- I love goose down comforters, but it was not cold enough for down and not warm enough for sleeping under just a sheet. Finally, we really liked the location of the inn, but parking was a bit of a nightmare, not surprising given the age of the neighborhood and its very narrow streets. The B&B does have 3 off-street parking spots but when we arrived all three were occupied by staff.", "title": "We celebrated our Anniversary at the Patterson and we loved it!", "user": "Ted Z", "date": "September 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140507026}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Over all, we enjoyed our stay, and look forward to coming back in the near future to try out the other rooms.", "title": "You won't be disappointed!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TravelGleek", "date": "September 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139700326}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Great stay last weekend: here's our review from bedandbreakfast.com: Having already been given a tour of the Inn, we were excited to book a room (The Prague) for our anniversary.

The hosts were incredibly nice and helpful. When we arrived we were greeted promptly and shown to our room. We were also given a tour of this remarkable Inn and I can honestly say there is not a single room I would have been disappointed to have. We stayed in the Antoinette, which was on the main floor. I never heard any noise from any other guest and the room was very spacious. The room Davinci is also on the main floor and the next time we are there, I will be staying in that room. Incredible. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Breakfast was always fresh and there were plenty of options. There are three parking spots reserved for guests on the property, but there is also street parking. We didn't really walk to anywhere but we drove all over Colorado and the location of the Inn is perfect. Easy access to everything. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Denver and I would recommend it to friends and family.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LEMmy17", "date": "July 27, 2012", "id": 135533410}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a gorgeous old mansion, beautifully renovated into a new B&B.

The Patterson is a unique, Chateauesque boutique-like bed and breakfast, tucked in Denver's hip, urban Capitol Hill area. I can't wait to return in the summer or fall so we can go out and explore the neighborhood's eateries or even walk downtown. We were in the Antoinette room on the first floor and were delighted with it (the most inexpensive of the rooms). The attention to details are unbelievable; the decorator did an fantastic job in coordinating each room's ambience. The use of films to inspire each room's theme is done in a clever and classy sort of way--no tackiness here! The Patterson is an immense house, but specs of dust were few and far between. We loved the plush linens, bedding, and towels. The breakfast spread was laid out buffet style, but it was a notch above a typical continental (quiche and french toast casserole were included). I always appreciate a substantial and hot breakfst--something more than I what I would do at home. The onsite hosts, Mike and Melissa, went beyond the call of duty and were clearly enjoying their roles (Mike spent over an hour giving us an insider's tour of the renovation, Melissa shared a recipe). Most B & B's are pricey anymore, and not a \"cheap way to go\". Still, we received so much more individual attention than one would get at an upscale hotel. It was a fun, romantic, way to have a special weekend. Plus, we were supporting an historically preserved property! This place has great potential as a venue for weddings, catered events, etc. I'm hoping it will be a success; it is a relatively new business and is finding its stride. The money spent restoring this place was phenomenal, I'm sure.
