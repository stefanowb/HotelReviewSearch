There was a free shuttle service to and from the airport, which we loved. We arrived early at around 9:00am but the front desk personnel very graciously allowed us to check into our rooms even before the check-in time. The rooms were beautiful, very modern, tastefully done, and spacious. We had our 4-year old daughter with us, and she was given an extra rollaway bed, free of charge. That left the queen-size bed to me and my husband, so all of us slept very well and comfortably. All the basic amenities you'd expect in a hotel are there; slippers, coffee and tea, toiletries, mini-ref... The only thing that puzzled me was that there was no divider between the rooms and the bathroom. The bed is just basically right next to the sink, mirrors, toilet, and showers (although the toilet and showers mercifully are enclosed). So, if you'd be doing your thing in the toilet, everyone in the bedroom would be sure to get a whiff once you open the door and step out. The service was superb. Even the housekeeping staff were very helpful in answering our questions. We didn't avail of the hotel breakfast, but since the hotel is directly connected to Citygate Mall (just an escalator ride and you're already in the mall), we didn't run out of choices of where to eat. Speaking of the mall, it is just as big and complete as those in Causeway or Central, with lots of popular retailers, and the shops are outlets too so we were able to buy a lot of things on sale. The mall also has a supermarket, money exchange center, and big fast food area, as well as a very convenient MTR exit (Tung Chung station). The MTR station is just next to Disneyland's Sunny Bay station, so if your main purpose for visiting HK is to go to Disneyland and/or shop at the outlet stores, this hotel would be absolutely perfect.

It proved to be the perfect start and finish to our holiday. When you get off a 12 hour flight you are a bit numb! You just want to 'crash\". This place was perfect. The pool is fantastic so we had a swim before hitting the sack. There are blackout curtains on the windows and the place is silent. It was perfect. On one direction we took the local bus, a 5 minute walk away, to see the giant Budda. A great trip, and I expect that if you had a head for heights the cable car could be quite exciting! There was excellent shopping in the attached mall. We thought that we might be missing out on the HK experience being this far from town. However on the return trip we got what must be one of the easiest MRT trains (another 5 minute walk) for the 45 minute ride into town. This just confirmed we had made the right choice.
