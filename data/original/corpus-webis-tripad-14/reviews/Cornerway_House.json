Room was small but clean and the bed was very comfortable. Robin and Dee, the propietors, invited us for a drink in the evening and although Robin is a bit chatty, he did share his extensive knowlege about the area and made a good recommendation for dinner. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and Robin recommended we stop at a new animal park that had just opened - Teniqua. Had he not mentioned it we would have missed out on seeing a very special place indeed. Cornerway House is well located in Plett and we would definately stay there again if we were in the area.", "title": "Friendly Hosts", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WHERESWAUGH", "date": "October 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 10111651}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled solo", "text": "Having never travelled to South Africa before I was not sure what to expect.
