The spa is an experience not to be missed with treatment rooms overlooking the harbor. We had a 38th floor corner suite with harbour views, even from the tub. It was hard to leave for dinner when we went back to change, it was so beautiful. Hong Kong is a gorgeous city with so much to do.

The hotel is basically across the street, but since it was my first time, I'm glad that the driver was there. The hotel van was a very nice Mercedes black van, got a bottle of water from the driver. I would have definitely gotten lost trying to find my way to the hotel from the train station with my suitcases. Bellhop took the suitcases, while I went to check in. The check-in staff was very friendly, they spoke great English. After check-in the lady who checked me in, took me up to my room, and gave me a tour of the room. The room was amazing, very large and comfortable. I was fortunate to have the Deluxe Harbour View Room. Great views of the Harbour and Kowloon. Bellhop arrived promptly with my suitcases. The desk area was very big, the only downside was that you had to pay for internet access. It was about $20 USD ($160 HKD) a day for internet access. The room had a mini bar, but I was able to keep a couple of bottles of water and soda in there to keep them cool, as I did not want to pay for the overpiced mini bar items. The room comes with a flat panel 42\" LCD, and DVD player. There is also a smaller LCD in the bathroom. Didn't watch much TV while I was there. You can get to the IFC mall via the hotel lobby by walking past the Blue Bar and taking the escalators upstairs. From the IFC mall you can grab the MTR or the Airport Express train. There are several place to eat in the mall as well as a Starbucks. The hotel restuarants have a business casual dress code. My room came with complimentary breakfast, so you could eat at either restaurant for breakfast. The food was delicious and the service was great. I didn't get a chance to check out the gym or the roof pool, as there was so much to see and do in Hong Kong.

The room had been redecorated, and superbly. I had a more classic, modern room which is precisely to my taste.
