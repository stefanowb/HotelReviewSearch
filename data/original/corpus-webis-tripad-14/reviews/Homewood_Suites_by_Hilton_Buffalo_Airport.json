The location is excellent - about a two-minute drive from BUF and less than 10 minutes to Walden Galleria and the shops around it. We stayed in a two-bedroom suite (1 King, 2 Queens, living area with sofabed), and it was large enough for our family of 7 (2 adults, 5 kids). The pool was good sized (and indoor, which is probaby smart planning for upstate New York). The fitness room is larger than average and well-equipped, with a fair amoutn of strength training equipment, not just a couple of treadmills and an elliptical. THe management and staff were very friendly and helpful, and the hotel has won numerous Hilton awards and accolades (proudly displayed in the breakfast room).

It is convenient to both the airport and to the Depew Amtrak station. We took the train. ALthough there is no shuttle service the front desk staff were good enough to get us a shuttle from another Hilton hotel when we arrived back from NYC later in the evening. If you are there in time for the included buffet dinner on weekdays it offers pretty good fare. There is a convenience store right across from the hotel and there is a grocery store just about a half a kilometre away. The rooms are roomy and clean.

We book a two room suite at a nice hotel and shop til we drop. We then go back to the hotel, swim use the hot tub and play card or board games in the suite until bed time. The next day we always have breakfast and then hit the shopping malls once again. This past weekend was no different, except we didn't get the chance to stay overnight. We arrived at the hotel around 5:30 pm Saturday, and were told as I had lost my credit card and had to cancel the card, I could not stay in the hotel. I had booked the hotel several months ago and given my credit card info to Hilton reservations. I had cash on me to pay for the room and have always been able to pay cash for a hotel room upon check in last year and the year before we stayed at the Staybridge suites in Buffalo and this was the case, I like this option to pay for the room up front in cash as then I know how much spending money I have left if I decide to go shopping again that night. I offered to give more cash as a down payment as the front desk supervisor advised they need a credit card in case there are any room damages, movie rentals etc. I am a 51 year old woman with a 23 year old daughter. We don't party, trash hotel rooms, steal towels etc. I explained this was my Mother's Day treat and could they not make an exception. The front desk supervisor advised me this was corporate policy which she kept repeating to me, and told me should could lose her job. She then told me she had called the Comfort Suites across the street and they had two rooms left and would take cash. I declined this, as I did not book the Comfort Suites, I don't know anything about the hotel and am very fussy. I liked the reviews I had read online and was looking forward to staying at this hotel. The front desk supervisor then suggested that I could go back home and get my husbands credit card and a permision note to use, I explained this was not an option as I live over 2 1/2 hrs away in Canada. I was then told they would accept a fax copy of his card. This was at almost 6:00 pm on a Saturday night, pretty sure my husband was either still on the golf course or out to dinner with our son as this was his plan. My daughter left very disappointed, finished our shopping and drove back home exhausted, oh and we had to pay duty on everything we bought as we hadn't been away long enough. I believe that good customer service is about bending some rules, looking at who your customer is and making some exceptions, I showed my ID, had my passport I am a Hilton Honours member as well. Long story short, I will not book again through Hilton reservations as no one explained I had to use my credit card to pay for the room, only to hold the reservation. I will not return to this hotel and most likely will pick the Staybridge Suites or a Marriott next time as we have in the past in Buffalo.
