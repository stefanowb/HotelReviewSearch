Ok so it was a shared bathroom, but the communal areas were attractive, the staff were lovely, bringing us breakfast on the terrace, and the place was spotless. We looked at other places but would have had to stay in a dorm for the same money. The riad is located by the Royal Palace, south of the mellah, which is about a 20 minute walk from the square, so isn't brilliant if you don't like walking. However on the way you pass through many interesting sites, the mellah market (a much more authentic feel than the main roads of the souks), the excellent kosybar and tanjir bars for a late night drink, lots of hammams, shops etc. Seeing some reviews of other riads makes me think people have unrealistic expectations of what they will get for their money, so don't expect luxury rooms or 5 star service or no- dirt on the street, local kids being kids, dust or hassle because that is what marrakech is like and if these things offend you then you shouldn't go there. But if you like simple clean attractive accomodation with lots of character then this place is great and I would go back tomorrow!", "title": "Great value riad!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Monkey4009", "date": "December 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 22585185, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, the terrace", "disliked": "\u2014 Shared bathroom"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Riad Chamali is a lovely guesthouse in the middle of quite a suburban area (about 20mins walk from the main square).
