My husband and I were celebrating our 30th anniversary and had dicided to combine a vacation with visiting our daughter, a student at Cal State Fullerton. A pleasant surprise to us was that she decided at the last minute to stay with us while we were there. We weren't sure if that would work spacewise however. Upon check-in, the young man at the front desk upgraded our room to a suite at no additional charge. He could not have been nicer and as we were the only ones at the front desk at that time, the young man working next to him was a lot of fun also.

I was worried at first because the room was immediately over the bar/patio area. They had live music that night. The good news is that it did not bother us. We could hear it with our windows open, and feel it a little from reverbations, but it was all over by 10:30 and totally quiet after that. I might change the lightbulbs to be a little brighter as it was dim in the evening. Our daughter was working on a paper and it was hard for her to read. Comfy bed.

I was upgraded to a room situated sweetly over the store lined street with a beautiful view of the pier! Each night my room being lit with the sparkly lights and the soft sounds of the restaurant below. I was new to the town and each question I asked was met with such generosity!

All employees were unbelievably warm, friendly and helpful. The service at the restaurant, Zimzala, was superb and the food was relatively inexpensive and high quality.
