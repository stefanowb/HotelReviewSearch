Our second visit was better - call it fairly good food (fish was right to slightly undercooked but I appreciate that as overcooked fish is easy but not good). Liked being on the beach better than inside. We ate at Govenors Mansion which was good, ask for the gallery tables (res. sugg.)

One plus is that car rental counters are there in the lobby. The taxi to the airport is $20.00 one way - no hotel shuttle. When I asked about departure tax at the airport I was given 3 different answers (No one except the manager knew that AA' s tickets already include this).

Sunsets are lovely through the palm trees. Stop by the deli for pate and cheeses and hit the beach with a glass of wine. The beach was a tad \"trashy\" now and then.

We selected wine and cheese, and they asked when we would like it delivered. We asked for 4 pm. The elevator was down in our wing, so a bell boy helped us carry our bags up to the room. On the walk to the room it seemed as though the hallways could use a fresh coat of paint. The furniture in our room was pretty dinged up, but the view was beautiful and we had a small balcony with chairs and a table. There was no fridge in the room. There was also no amenities book so we had no idea where the ice machine was.

If you go here, I would definitely recomend renting a car for the day and exploring the island beacause it is beautiful. This is the only day we left the resort and it was awesome! There are a ton of \"hidden\" beaches down the coast. There are little signs and you pull off the road and go to the water and you will just see some of the most beautiful sights you have ever seen. I would definitly recomend going to Big Knip. Ask any of the staff at the hotel how to get there. It is the most amazing beach in the world.

We loved the beachside bar, the Board Room, for drinks and lunches. The pool is very attractive, with lots of shade as needed, and a swim up bar with a 4.30 happy hour. Snorkeling was great as well! In and around the rocky reefs we saw lots of colorful fish. We went in on the opposite side of the beach where the watersport hut is, and swam around the rocks back to the main beach side.
