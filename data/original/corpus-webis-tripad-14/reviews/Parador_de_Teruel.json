Not special. The parador is located just at the outside edge of town, not one of their old castles refurbished but a modern building. We found the staff unfriendly at best. The room was large as was the bathroom but not really anything unusual. The bed was the most uncomfortable of any hotel bed in all our years of travel.....no sleep even though every blanket to be found was put between mattress and sheet to soften the surface. Would not return based on this experience. One positive thing.....they had the most sumptuous buffet for breakfast ever seen anywhere....included in our booking package....16 euros per person had we paid separately for it.", "title": "Nice relaxing Hotel - a bit lacking in character", "user": "GILLHerts", "date": "September 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 118490534}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is clearly a modern Parador which lacks the character of some of the old buildings but you couldn't fault the service.
