I read several of the reviews prior to choosing this destination and I was rather nervous. I'd have to say that when things first started off we too had a very bad experience. The Rep that we were given was too young, not married and had little experience. Since we were planning this wedding from California, we didn't have the time for mistakes. The Rep's big mistake happened when my wife flew down there and he didn't show up where he was supposed to and several hours passed by and then he blamed her for the mishap. Bad idea. It was at this time we had had enough and we gave the hotel an ultimatum and they stepped up. The Rep was promptly replaced by the Director of meetings and special events, Mel Van Den Bergh. From that day forward, the entire experience changed. Mel was always in constant contact with us, arranged every last detail, threw in many extras and turned our wedding into the most perfect day possible. Working with Mel was truly first class. I do not think he ever said \"No\" to us. Everything was possible and I mean everything. We received bottles of wine and champagne, chocolates, flowers, golf shirts and cards signed by all the staff. We didn't know if it was going to rain or freeze us out on our wedding night and when the clouds went away and the evening warmed up, they didn't charge us for the tent or heaters. Mel took care of all the little particulars and he also wasn't afraid to make several recommendations which turned out to really make things special. And it wasn't just Mel. Once we arrived at the hotel everyone knew who we were and went the extra mile to please us. Not only us but all our guests and family! On the day of the wedding Mel assigned two coordinators to help my wife with any last minute details which really took a load off of her and most of the wedding party. Maria one of the coordinators was just outstanding. As for the food, it was insane. Our guests still talk about the appetizers especially the lamb chops! We had a surf and turf sit down dinner that would rival any five star restaurant. Mel and the Ritz Carlton made our wedding the best it could possibly be. There are many other tidbits that I could talk about that were also special but I wouldn't want to take away those moments from anyone else who is lucky enough to have their wedding there. Needless to say, I would recommend the Ritz Carlton to everyone who wants a story book wedding down on the beach. We plan to go back every year to celebrate what a fantastic experience it was and hopefully say hi to Mel and all the staff because they have become family!

When making the reservation, the agent noted a request for a room upgrade to a suite and said we would probably be granted the request as the hotel wasn't busy and we've spent 60 nights this year alone at Marriott hotels. This didn't go so smoothly. They had plenty of suites available but the clerk decided he wanted an extra $150 per night and denied the request without additional payment. This normally wouldn't have been an issue but our 12 year old daughter was with us and their small rooms and beds would make for an uncomfortable stay. The first night we had a horrible sleep with two adults in a hotel double (which is really a single) so we decided to call and ask the hotel manager nice again for the room upgrade or pack up and leave on the day of our anniversary and just one day into our three day stay. I spoke with Lorna who was absolutely understanding, apologetic and wonderful in providing the upgrade to a suite at no additional cost to us.

Sun was not out all the time due to Tropical Storm Debbie coming in, but we got 2 days of decent weather, but the main reason we stayed here is the quality of this property. It is just lovely from the moment you step through the doors, EVERYONE was so friendly and helpful. The front desk didn't have our room ready so we were able to change in the \"spa\" and hang out at the pool which was very nice and quiet. When we were able to check into our rooms, we were Not disappointed, they were lovely with a \"Bayfront View\". Every amenity you would expect of a hotel of this caliber. We dined in the restaurant that night and had one of the best meals of my trip, it was stunning. Breakfast every morning was great as well. My daughter \"Who's 26\" hung out in the bar after dinner and caught the Basketball finals on TV and just had a ball. It was all very classy. The best part was you had access to the Ritz Carlton Beach Club on Lido Key. We had our own car, but there is a shuttle that departs every hour. It was not too busy and we had a great spot on the beach. The staff was very attentive and set us up with towels and a bucket of ice and water. We had lunch in the club and it was really good. We went all 3 days and although we didn't have sun the last two days, it was still warm and great to just sit and visit and listen and watch the ocean. I highly recommend this property. I only had one complaint and that was the staff uniforms they were just dreadful. I so wanted to re-do all of them. Nothing fit on ANYONE from the main desk to the staff in restaurant. It is not a big deal, but you would expect a hotel like the Ritz to have their staff reflect their environment and this just did NOTHING but scream 2 star hotel. I would hope they would re think the HUGE grey blazers and HUGE pants that was like a ONE SIZE fits all!! I felt so bad for them. I am not a clothes snob, but I know they could do better than this. But trip was great and I can't wait to go back again, as I was in Florida for over a week and those 3 days at the Ritz were the best nights sleep I got. The beds are heavenly, the bathroom was huge and the room itself had a large balcony overlooking the bay and pool. We spent quite a bit of time out there in the evening. This is a perfect place for families, or couples and def. a place for conventions. There were 3 conventions while we were there but you would never know it, it was always quiet and peaceful.

Pampered by all staff that you encounter. The Beach Club was superb. Laid under an umbrella with my hubby at their beach. Ordered their famous mai-tai and snack food and spent a wonderful day. Later on that evening went back for a delicious dinner. Than back to the hotel for drinks and dancing. Repeated the same the next day. Sarasota has a lovely main street with shops and restaurants. There of course is St. Armands Circle which the Ritz will also take you to on their free shuttle.", "title": "The Best Time for a Great Weekend Away!!!!!!!!!!!", "user": "God-Family-Travel", "date": "June 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132234665}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The only things to remember people love to dress up for their dancing with their live music which is quite good.", "title": "A retirement home disguised as a Ritz-Carlton", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Kurt P", "date": "June 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 131853769}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Upon check in ask for extra towels and extra regular coffee if you use a regular amount as I thought what was there would be enough.
