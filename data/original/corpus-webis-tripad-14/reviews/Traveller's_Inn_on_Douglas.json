But when we got there, it turned out to be almost dumpy--not quite a full dump but very close. The hotel lobby where you check in was nice and flashy but then when we went to the building next door where our room was in, the lobby smelled strongly of grease and oil ! Our room was very dark and featured old furniture. The bathroom had bar soap which is not hygienic. The beds were alright and I did not see any any bugs during our stay. The TV was pretty big and there was ample table space. Overall, the room was very dark and dingy. I pulled out some kleenex from the box provided in our room and found some to have blue stains--so I pulled out more and more and found the stains to be getting larger and larger. I have a feeling that the housekeeping is refilling kleenex into the boxes rather than buying individual boxes and some of their cleaning chemicals spilled onto the tissues. The housekeeping girl was very helpful and friendly. The hotel does charge for local calls which is ridiculous because you know there is no charge from the phone company for making a local call. We complained that they never informed us about this and they credited back the amount. The hotel is located on the bus route, which was excellent for us. I would have given this hotel a better review but the room rate is overpriced for what you actually receive.", "user": "CanadaTripReviewer", "date": "August 4, 2007", "id": 8351236}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "False Advertising", "text": "What do you expect when you book a stay-and-play golf package in a hotel?
