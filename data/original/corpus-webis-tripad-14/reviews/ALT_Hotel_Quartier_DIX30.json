This hotel is what his/ her loft condo would look like. You have exposed concrete walls, a black, grey and white colour scheme, halogen lighting, and fixtures in the style of Ikea. A multimedia centre under the wall-mounted flatscreen TV accepts USB connections and HDMI. Continuing the DJ theme, there is even a DJ in the lobby during the evening spinning tunes. Certainly you will find this hotel memorable and unique, and the non- mainstream fixtures make it feel like you are staying at a friend's place as opposed to staying in a hotel. Great for younger travelers or for a romantic night. What's more, the price is excellent for the amenities you receive.

Before I purchased them, I decided to call at the Alt Hotel (in order to report that situation and see if there could be a possible arrangement). I have been terribly shoked by the way I was answered by the front desk clerk. She really had a bad attitude with me, using words that were unappropriate and unacceptable for a person doing her job. I was suppose to be there to relax and here I was upset not because of the 20$ I had to pay but because of this rude person that didn't even try to understand and accomodate me with my problem when it is mainly the reason why she is getting paid for!
