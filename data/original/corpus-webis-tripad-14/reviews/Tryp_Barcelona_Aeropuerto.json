So we opened the window in desparation to cool down, about 4 am, my friend woke and had been bitten at least 14 times on her face and eye lid, and her face was swollen and eye was completely shut from swelling. The next morning went to breakfast, which was cold. When we checked out we explained we had had to open the window because there was no air con working and breakfast was cold and we were not happy, the did give us 50% off the price of our room, but the damage was done by this time. we were staying in Barcelona from 04/06/09 to 08/06/09 and my friends face did not look any better for 3 days. I cant fault the cleanliness of the Hotel, but surely the air conditioning is important to most people who stay in Hotels in a hotter country than ours. We wouldnt reccommend this Hotel unless you have a guarentee that the air con is working.", "title": "Clean Hotel, Shame about the Air Con...????!!!!!!!", "user": "winnipeg08", "date": "June 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 32121157}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Tryp Barcelona for one night because we arrived late into Barcelona airport.

It would have been nice if the airport shuttle came more often, but when it did come, it was very convenient. The decor was very sparse and modern, but the room itself was very comfortable. Definitely the most comfortable bed we had during our trip. The hotel restaurant was closed for no apparent reason (according to the hours it should have been open). We ordered room service instead, which was nice, although the food was nothing special. We also had some difficulty ordering since we did not speak much Spanish and the staff taking our order did not speak much English. In the morning, that shuttle came on time and we got to the airport with no problem.

The woman on the front desk disagreed with me when I asked a question about confirming my flight and was quite rude until I showed her how to do it. Nor did she apologize for her mistake.
