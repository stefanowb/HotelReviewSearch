Convenient to take a taxi to and from the airport (or you can take the bus). B&B owner Aileen was wonderful, warm, helpful and humorous. Enjoyed our chats and the \u201cextras\u201d she provided. We were treated more like family than customers. Our lovely room was beautifully decorated, comfortable, roomy and had everything we needed, including cable TV and all the necessities to make tea or hot chocolate (a treat when returning each chilly night). The townhouse is elegant and skillfully decorated. Everything was spotlessly clean. Tasty breakfasts of cereals, yoghurt, fresh fruit, full Scottish or anything in between started each day. We had some event tickets mailed to Aileen ahead of our trip and she let us know when they came and had them in our room on our arrival. We broke up our week long stay with a two day trip to the Highlands and only took overnight bags with us. Aileen kept our suitcases and had them in our room ready and waiting upon our return.
