Though the rooms interior are modern with a fairly sleek design, the room had a stale and worn impression. The balcony of my room was located right under overhang of the hotel next to some poorly shielded dump area (or some form of maintenance facility). Therefore it was a dark and dreary experience. The room was clean, but appeared very used and offered a minimum of amenities. The bathroom offered nothing but cream soap and no shampoo for cleaning, which was far away from what I expected. There was a tea kettle, trousers presser and in-room safe available though. Hot and cold water for the shower took a while to figure out and adjust.
