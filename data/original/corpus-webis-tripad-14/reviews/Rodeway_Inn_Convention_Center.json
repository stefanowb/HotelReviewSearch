We enjoyed the king suite (room 104), especially for the total price of $124.73. Not bad for being a little over a mile from the convention center. The room was clean with a microwave and refrigerator, and the bed was comfortable. The water was hot when we took a shower in the morning. The suite had a separate room in it with a couch, chair and big screen TV. Since it is downtown Los Angeles, the location is not ritzy. But we felt safe since the property (besides the driveway entrance) was entirely surrounded by a high metal fence. The continental breakfast was very basic, which is not suprising given the price of this hotel. In other words, \"you get what you pay for\" applies here. When we checked out in the morning, the kind gentleman behind the counter graciously made a couple of copies for us at no charge. All the staff at this location were friendly and courteous. As a point of information, it took five minutes to drive from this hotel to the convention center at 8:00 a.m. We paid $10.00 for all day parking a couple blocks from the convention center.

One main benefit, of which I have not previously taken advantage, is that it is located on a main bus line. At the last minute, I decided to cancel my one-day car rental and to rely on public transport. A wise decision; because of good schedules, even on weekends, and the 25-cent fare for senior citizens on weekends, I was able to make two trips to the heart of downtown, over two days, for a grand total of $1.25, instead of spending $51 for a one-day car rental.

We felt fine even when we walked to the McDonalds, 7-11, and Pollo Loco a block away (several trips). Parking is gated, with several covered parking spots, the staff was outside of the office quite a bit, and someone was nearly always in the back parking lot, which gave us an added sense of security.
