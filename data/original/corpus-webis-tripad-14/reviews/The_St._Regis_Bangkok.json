The breakfast buffet at Viu is great and it has an amazing \"Viu\" of the Bangkok Sporting Club while you eat. My room was beautiful and well kept. It seems like nothing makes the hotel employees happier than servicing their guests with top notch service. I love the location as you can walk to many great shops and restaurants. I am often in Bangkok and will absolutely make this my hotel of choice going forward.
