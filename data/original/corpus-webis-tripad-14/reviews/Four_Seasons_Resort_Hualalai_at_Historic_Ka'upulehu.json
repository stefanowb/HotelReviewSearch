I travel in 4- or 5-star hotels (including Four Seasons) for business with some regularity, and simply put this shows that there's a huge difference between a 5-star hotel and a 6-star *resort*. Stunning, amazing, beautiful -- adjectives don't do this place justice. It was absolutely agonizing to leave such a wonderful property. Service is fantastic and friendly without being too in your face or overwhelming. Every detail that you can think of has already been taken care of -- the rooms are phenomenal, the grounds immaculate, and the scenery is great. If you go, think about getting a ground floor room rather than 2nd floor -- it's actually cheaper and you get a private, outdoor shower.", "title": "Spectacular", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Andrewshi", "date": "June 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 67195653}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was such a special trip -- definitely worth the splurge.", "title": "Low key elegance", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "oceanside-Mary", "date": "June 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 66199902}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Beautiful hotel and plenty to do including several shops.

We wanted a quiet room and the location by the King's pond was perfect. Spending time in a cabana is the height of luxury -- cold washcloths, water with lemon and poolside lunch make you feel special. Don't miss the cultural center where you can take a ukaleli lesson or make a shell bracelet and learn more about Hawaii from the staff. A little known pot of coffee can be found from 5 to 7 AM next to registration. You can take advantage of opportunities offered at the resort to feed the Ray and tour the ponds and gardens. There is a part of the Ancient Hawaiian Trail that crosses the property. This is a very special place with good weather on the Kona Coast. Shops had vry helpful staff.

There are 5 pools, lap pools, children pools, snorkeling pool, and private adult only areas. There are lots of walking paths by the beachs. Everything is set up in separate areas, so if you have children, they will be with others, whereas if you are a couple and want to be alone, you will not even hear the children area.

Service was spectacular (my father had a strained neck and a on-call doctor took care of him right away; my son fell and bruised his knees and bandages and followup calls were made by concerned hotel staff for several days). Food was spectacular (from breakfast buffet to in-room service to pool service to night time restaurants) and all kids were given complimentary ice cream every day at the pool. The resort location is quiet and the guests are very civilized (a rarity nowadays even in high end resorts). Rooms are spacious and thoughtfully laid out. Conceirge work very hard and were even able to book a fishing charter with little notice.
