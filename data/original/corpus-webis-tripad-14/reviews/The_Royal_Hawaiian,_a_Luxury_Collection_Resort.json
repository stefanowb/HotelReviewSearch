Front of the house did a great job, but the pool area and beach need some work. The pool is very small, and the ocean is packed.

It looks really nice as it's right against the ocean and there are lawn chairs placed in the shallow water of the pool. We enjoyed drinks at the Royal Hawaiian outdoor bar and we sat on the beach on the hotel chaise lounges each day. It's a bit irritating that people run down at 6am and save beach chairs that sit empty for hours until they come back. We soon learned that that is the only way to get a chair so we put stuff on our chairs early in the morning and went to the fitness centre (which was pretty good) to work out and then hit the beach after. You can take surfing lessons right there in front of the hotel and the waves were perfect for learning. The swimming is good at the beach but very crowded.
