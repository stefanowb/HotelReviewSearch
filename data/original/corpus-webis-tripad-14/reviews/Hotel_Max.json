The rooms were small due to the fact it was converted from an old building,staying for a week may be a bit challenging, but quite adequate for a few days. Ths staff was great, told us of all the sights to see and how to get around Seattle. The area was great, restaurant next door and room service. Walking distance to Pikes Market and all the shopping you would want. The monorail is only two blocks from the Hotel and takes you to the Space Needle, park, science center and music hall. Upon checking out and getting to the airport we realized we had left some things in the room. When we got back to California I called the hotel and they put me in touch with their houskeeping supervisor. She informed me the housekeepers had not finished the rooms but would get back to me, she called within 5 mins. and had found the items. They were mailed immediately and we received them within two days. Kudos to all the staff.

We stuck with the larger artist king since we were only staying for 4 nights. It was perfect for the two of us. We had a great view and it was a cozy and hip room. The hotel and rooms really reminded me of a smaller, less expensive W that I have stayed at in NYC. There is little storage space and the bathroom is small. When I did more research, I found out that Hotel Max used to be an older hotel, which explains the smaller bathrooms. I personally thought they were cute and completely sufficient. To solve the storage problems, I asked for more hangers and less than 10 minutes later, we had them. The staff was very helpful, someone was always at the front desk for any questions or needs we had. Harry made sure we had a cab for our night out and a car for the airport. I HIGHLY recommend getting a car instead of a cab. It's cheaper, safer and nicer of an automobile. Also, the hotel is close to many attractions, shopping and restaurants.
