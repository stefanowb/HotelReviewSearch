It's in the middle of the most beautiful waterfall and woodland but you and are 9km from the nearest form of civilisation. The location relative to everything else is miles away yet we were led to believe it was just outside Chiang Mai. It will costs you at least a 900Baht round trip, if there's anyone there to take you and we were told it would be an hour's wait. if you want to go out to eat in Chiang Mai, it's 30km away - we rented a scooter but is still cost us 1,600 Baht to get to the rental shop. The food in the resort restaurant was awful and they are obviously abusing their monopoly. Our tent was stunning once inside but all the wood it's been built on is rotting away so we had to be very careful not to fall through it - it's only been built for 5 years so you'd have thought they'd have treated the wood properly. It was the most expensive place we have ever booked in Thailand and we'd have had better service and food in a guest house, as we did in other parts of Thailand.
