The bad is that there is not a ton of space in front of the desk, so if a line forms or there are just a lot of people, you have to find different places to stand out of the way. As I said, the lounge area with the fireplace is far enough away from the front desk that you can sit there and not hear the desk conversation. The staff is very nice and very helpful.

It makes me happy to stay in a quality, pet friendly hotel, whether or not I'm traveling with my own pets. I particularly love the Monaco properties. I guess I'm a sucker for the loaner goldfish. This trip was the third time I've stayed at the Denver Monaco. On my first trip, my request for a \"quiet\" room on a \"high\" floor was honored and I was duly impressed with the property. On my second trip, my room was much closer to the street and near an elevator. Unfortunately, nothing else was available and I was forced to endure a night of car horns and sirens and drunken wedding guests mistaking my room for their own!! On two separate occassions, someone tried to use their room key card to open my door...scaring the bejeesus out of me and forcing a useless call to the front desk for security. On that stay (late fall '10), it was also COLD. I was staying in one of the last of the unrenovated rooms (to my knowledge, they have all been renovated since)...my duvet was threadbare and the heating system seemed to have 2 settings---icebox or sauna. It was a miserable night. In spite of all that though, my husband and I did reserve a room there again (after assurances from Kimpton about the renovations being complete) for a recent road trip. Thanks to a promo (or perhaps my TA backpack), we received an upgrade to a suite. Unfortunately, the renovations did not include better soundproofing in the windows, nor did they bother to clean the window sills before adding the additional pane of glass...so there were dead flies and dust sealed between the glass that looked impossible to remove. Shameful. We were woken up multiple times by sirens and once by someone with way too much base in their car.
