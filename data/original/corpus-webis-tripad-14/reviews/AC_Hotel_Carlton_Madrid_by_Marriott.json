The desk staff made check in easy and fast and we were napping in no time. Our airline lost our bags and we are not fluent in Spanish, but the desk staff took it upon themselves to make inquiries on our behalf. The hotel is conveniently located near Atocha (the main train station) and is a short walk from downtown. The staff was so fantastic and helpful during our entire stay! At the end of our trip (we covered 7 cities) we stayed there again and were recognized as having stayed already! They really are spectacular at Hotel Carlton. Alfonso Lopez was amazing with giving directions and recommending places to check out. He also helped us the most with locating our luggage, although we never did receive it while on our trip.", "title": "Exceptional Service!!!", "user": "JB0", "date": "January 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 53138851}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel is ideally located for easy access to all Madrid locations.
