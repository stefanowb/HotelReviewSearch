My room was ready when I arrived which was great. We went up right away and stowed our stuff. The room was very clean, the king bed was very comfy with a lovely white duvet and good pillows. We asked to have the fold out bed made up and left for most of the day. The only negative was that I didn't ask for a non-smoking room, as I assumed hotel rooms usually are non-smoking. There was a smell of cigar when you opened the room, but after a minute in the room, it wasn't noticable.

We picked that hotel because of our long stay we wanted to be comfortable. The hotel was way more expensive than many others available. It provides sort of a seperate living room and a small kitchen very badly equiped, everything is old and falling apart. This allows the hotel to label their room as \"suites\" and claim the extra $$$. The bathroom is 1960 style with not updates, there is definetly a problem with the plumbing, after a shower you can swim in the tub and the towells provided are awful. I don't think that the place has been painted in the last 20 years. All the accessories/equipment in the room are so badly abused (ironing board, iron, hair dryer etc) , you do not feel like using them.
