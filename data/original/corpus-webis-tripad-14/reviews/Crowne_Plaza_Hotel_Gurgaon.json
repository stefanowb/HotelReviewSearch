The house keeping will make your room few times a day. The room was super clean. The breakfast is nothing but Deluxe. If you need or want something, just name it and see how they are working it out for you. The gym is located near the spa, and it is open from 0530 to 2300. if you are not looking to go there after midnight, it should comply with any schedule. The only issue, if I have to mention, is the Wi-Fi charge of 800Rp a day. 800 rupees are not a lot of money, but at this days Wi-Fi is like a towel or a pillow. You don't want to pay extra for a pillow, aren't you? So, if you are ever going to be in Gurgaon area, and want to feel like a King for few days without spending tons of Dollars, Crown Plaza Hotel is the place for you!
