The concierge promptly unloaded our luggage and whisked the car away while we were speedily checked in to our rooms, 316 and 317. We stayed in the Victorian quarter and our rooms were luxurious and spotless. The large bathroom was stocked with the usual amenities and a gorgeous rainforest shower head (although it perhaps could do with being descaled for more pressure). There was always an abundance of roasting hot water and the heated towel rails were very useful.
