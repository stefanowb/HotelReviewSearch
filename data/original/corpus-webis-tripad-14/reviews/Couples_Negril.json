Cassava terrace dinners were simply not good on any of the evenings we ate there. The repeaters dinner was, as usual very good. Breakfast is hard to mess up, and generally I was pleased with the results. It would be nice to see more Jamaican offerings at breakfast, but I understand those might not go over well with everyone. The few times I did see Jamaican offerings at breakfast, they were not bad. Desserts have never been my favorite at couples, but this year, there were some definite standouts in the crowd. I had one surprise when a tray of cheesecakes was marked as \"chilly cheesecake\", but was in fact chili cheesecake... Not my favorite, nor what I was expecting! Service at all of the restaurants was quite good... Not the typical \"Jamaican time\" you often hear about. One night was funny -- at hellaconia, I did not eat my meal one evening. I was not feeling the best that night, and most likely should have skipped dinner.
