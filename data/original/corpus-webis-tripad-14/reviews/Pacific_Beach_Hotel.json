Other wise nice room with coffee maker and refrigerator. Water pressure in the shower was excellent. Water was always hot even when I was the 4th in a row to shower.

The in-room safe had a sticker indicating a $3 per day charge but we were not charged at all for 10 days of use. My only complaint is the parking is expensive--- $15 per day so $150 for the trip...almost as much as the rental car. Overall, a very nice stay and I would recommend it and I will stay here again. The front desk said that next month (April) they start a remodel. There is an ABC store right off the elevator in the beach tower and there is an ABC store on every block.
