{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 21, "name": "Two Seasons Coron Island Resort", "reviews": [{"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "The staff of Two Seasons is the saving grace in this resort. They were simply terrific. Cordial and helpful. They seem to genuinely care about whether we were enjoying our stay or not, especially because we were mostly rained in while we were there. Luckily the one time we went island hopping, the weather gods were kind to us till we headed back to the resort. That said, the amenities are still wanting. The food at the restaurant was a hit or miss. The Filipino breakfast was pretty good (no buffet breakfast), Asian Egg Noodles was pretty yummy but the Beef Rendang was too salty and the ramen was so-so. The common areas and rooms were nice because the resort is primarily and relatively new and possibly the only resort in the Coron area of this \"supposed\" caliber. But at $500/night, I did not expect the following things: no stationery in the room, not even a pen; serving \"instant\" decaf coffee at the restaurant; we were given cloth table napkins on the first day but on succeeding days, we had to use these very thin pullout paper tissues because the laundry is done only once a week in town. Considering that the resort wasn't fully occupied, what will happen if they are full capacity? Unacceptable. Given that the signal of Globe Telecom is weak in Coron compared to the very strong Smart Telecom signal, you cannot blame the resort if your Globe mobile phone often has no service in most areas, especially in the room but why on earth did they choose Globe as their internet provider? By doing so, you can only connect at the reception and the bar. Not even the restaurant adjacent to the reception had a strong wifi signal. Don't even think of surfing in your room. They will offer a pocket wifi but you will still have to place it and surf outside on the veranda or the front entrance to get a decent signal. This wouldn't be an issue if it is sunny and you can busy yourself with kayaking and other outdoor activies but if there is a torrential downpour outside and you're stuck in your room like us, the tv and the wifi are your only salvation. Hopefully in time they will improve but until then, it might be better if they don't charge as exhorbitantly as resorts in the Maldives and the like so our expectations won't be as high.
