At first sight, we were astonished at the number of cars lining the entrance, and then the cars that filled the enormous parking lot. The pictures on the new website are extremely misleading, the \"resort\" is more like Disney land with out the rides. Each of the hot pools was filled to the brim with people, with people sitting on each other. (honestly, we were so turned off my how crowded it was we were too grossed out to get in. There was no room to get in without touching someone else.) The man at the front desk was relatively cordial, but a total deadbeat. No helpful information, just the facts about the reservation. No friendliness, no enthusiasm. He might as well have been a sign. At least he wasn't rude. For $125 a night, we expected much, MUCH more. Quote from the website: \"In order to allow our guests to enjoy their Sol Duc getaways with as few distractions as possible, our cabins offer no telephones, televisions or radios.\" While we have no complaint about the lack of telephone or TV, there were plenty of other things to distract us. The cabins offer no privacy and are lumped together about 15 feet apart from each other, with hardly any trees. People were walking by all of our windows the entire time while we were there, as well as campers from the nearby campgrounds picnicking literally steps outside our front door, not to mention the children running laps around our cabin at 7:30 in the AM. We have nothing against children, it just was not our idea of hot-spring soaking and relaxing (of the three spring fed pools, not a single one is \"adult only\", watching children snorkel around in their water wings is anything but relaxing.) As for our cabin, one of our windows screens was actually duct taped to the cabin, and when we opened the curtain in the morning, the entire screen fell out to the ground (which we found unacceptable for the money we paid.) There were spiders nested in two corners on the ceiling in the bathroom, but at least the linens appeared clean. We were looking forward to a nice dinner in the restaurant after reading the previous reviews on trip advisor, and having cooked over a campfire for the last 3 days, but it was really overpriced, which just fueled our frustration and disappointment, since one of their rules is \"absolutely no food in the cabins\" leaving you no other choice. We ended up canceling our second night's reservation and headed back to Seattle early. We would not recommend this place to anyone who does not have kids with them. While the location and National Park trails are gorgeous, the \"resort\" is not worth visiting, never mind paying for, espcially if you like privacy, or were hoping for \"cozy\" or \"romantic\".

First to turn off the road and find out I have to pay $10 to get there, then to find way more cars than the cabins can accomidate, (come to find out all the campers use the hot springs as their bath) so it was hard to find a place to park. The cabins are in a circle looking at each other so no privacy like I was hoping for on my extended weekend, the insides were filthy cobwebs and felt dirty allthe way around, the light next to the table didn't work, something was wrong with the socket. the light next to the bed fell apart in my hand when I turned it on. The hot spring was soo crowded people were touching arms. the food was awful (don't try the tortelini with white wine garlic cream sauce, it comes to you tortileni wth big pieces of breaded chicken swimming in chicken broth tastes terrible. the women that was waiting tables in the morning told a couple of elderly ladies that they could not wait in the dining room for their room to get finished becaause they were cleaning.

I have been camping and staying with the resort for about ten years. The resort has had a new company own it called Aramark, I think that they have really made some great changes, the staff was very courteous, especially the front desk and the meals were just lovely. (I especially liked the steel head) I too arrived on a date when the large pool was closed, but I did understand the circumstances. I mean the life guards are not hired to be baby sitters. That's not their job, that would be the job of a parent. There are some circumstances that just can't be helped by the staff, you can't really expect the resort to have to refund every person, because one person wasn't paying attention. How was that their fault, I've seen that they have a little swimmers, notice on the wall, and if a child isn't equipped and isn't old enough to contain it's self than perhaps unsupervised that big pool isn't the place for them. I also found the rooms quite cozy...rustic but cozy. I had a little miss communication about what our room price entailed and the staff was very sympathetic and went above and beyond their call of duty to help figure everything out. I have been to one too many snobby hotels that didn't give a darn about my problems or complaints to let their good work go un noticed.
