We then had a whole day of mountain biking instruction by Mike in Dalby forest. Mike is a fantastic coach: on the first morning we only started suspecting that most of our ideas on how to ride a mountain bike were wrong, but by night we were completely converted into the new technique and had a full complement of the most up-to-date riding skills to take home and practice! The greatest fun was to test the tricks Mike taught us on all those berms, drop-offs and bomb holes which I never thought I'd be able to ride. When we came back we were treated to some delicious flapjacks cooked by Amanda. Outrageously good! And the best thing ever? In the morning we had to do it all over again!
