Although it wasn't awful, it wasn't ideal either. I expected a lot more from a category 5 Marriott property. We had requested a room on an upper floor away from the lobby and elevator area, but we got a 2nd floor room very close to a ballroom type area where a high school reunion was going on. Additionally, the climate control unit in the room was excessively loud and clicked on and off at random waking us up all night long. Our room overlooked a courtyard where there was a tent set up, luckily there were no events in there as I would assume that they would have been very loud.

We can't say enough about our wonderful experience at this hotel. As you first walk into the lobby, you are greeted by a sparkling two-story Christmas tree and glowing fireplace. The staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful. We absolutely loved our stay. Don't be fooled by the online pics on the Marriott website - this place is charming and cozy. Exactly what you would want for a ski destination. On Christmas Eve, the attentive staff even left a small goodie bag with homemade chocolate chip cookies and 2 candy canes. Room was clean and what you would expect from a Marriott. It is a little off the beaten track from Park City's Main Street and skiiing resorts - but there are free transportation options to get you to where you need to go. There's a complimentary shuttle that runs you up to either Park City Mountain Resort or Deer Valley. The city bus stop is right outside the hotel. Breakfast buffet for $11.95 included OJ or coffee, made to order waffles and fantastic omelets. Also, guests can check out games (we chose a brand new version of Monopoly). Similarily, we saw other guests playing games in the lobby. Overall, the pleasant ambiance will definitely bring us back when we visit Park City again.", "title": "Little touches made the difference.

The hotel is located about a mile (2 km) from downtown Park City and just a ten minute drive to the three ski areas surrounding Park City. It's surrounded on all sides by city streets, literally just a sidewalk away. This was a problem with loud traffic throughout the day. One evening after a few days of heavy snow, the city snow plows decided to widen the street by moving back the snow banks on the street outside our window until past midnight....quite loud!! The desk staff were always very friendly and helpful in answering any questions about the area. The room was your typical hotel room, nothing fancy. It had a small refrigerator but no microwave oven. The beds were very comfortable with feather pillows and a down duvet. The hotel cleaning staff is your typical \"south of the border\" cleaning staff with poor communications skills. They left dirty silverware in our room for three days and occasionally left dirty towels as well if they weren't specifically thrown on the floor. The internet service in the hotel room was intermittent at best for the entire weeklong stay and we were told more than once that a technician was looking into the problem...with no real resolution to the problem. The hotel has a nice indoor pool and a small jacuzzi that holds maybe 6-8 people. Towels were not always stocked around the jacuzzi area like they should have been. Parking at the hotel was free.
