The property is set in a lovely location in the countryside and is in fact an Equestrian centre as well. The rooms have been recenty decorated I think as everything is pristeen and also kept spotlessly clean. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious with full tea / coffee facilities and flatscreen tvs. The owners are very friendly and welcoming and had some good recommendations of places to eat in Frome. A full breakfast is provided to order. We only stayed one night but thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to go back!", "title": "Lovely spot, very friendly and comfortable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "FayeW", "date": "July 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116082750}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 8}, "aka": "Brookover Farm Bed And Breakfast Frome, England", "slim_ranking": 0.521739130435}
