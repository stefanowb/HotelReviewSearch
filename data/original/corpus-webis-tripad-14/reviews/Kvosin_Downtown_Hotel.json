They are completing a new restaurant which will be the cherry topping on the cake. The restaurant that they currently use, provided a delightful breakfast and lunch if you chose to eat there.

Comfortable beds, beautiful bathrooms, Aveda products, and scrumptious breakfast every morning at Bergsson downstairs.

We can't thank Kvosin and it's amazing manager Birgir enough for the hospitality and for going out of their way to make this a memorable stay for all of us and our guests. We had an overflow of guests who had to stay at other locations and I think they were all jealous of what they saw at Kvosin.
