Perfectly reasonable hotel overlooking the sea, free WiFi which worked well in the room but not in the restaurant area.

We did not take breakfast as \u20ac11.50 seemed very expensive for a seaside hotel.

The piped music reminded us of a funeral dirge, and certainly did not put us in a positive eating mood .... in fact we should have left and found one of the other plentiful restaurants in town", "user": "KnightyatNo5", "date": "April 7, 2013", "id": 156883267}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Whilst past reviews of this hotel have generally been good there are a few criticisms about it needing a makeover, being a little shabby etc. Well that's been done as best I can see!
