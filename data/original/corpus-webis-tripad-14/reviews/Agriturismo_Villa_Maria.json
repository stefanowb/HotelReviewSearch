We were exhausted and starving when we arrived so the staff made a special snack for us. (In Italy, lunch is served strickly between 1230-3p - miss it and you are out of luck finding lunch anywhere! Although there was an additional charge for the lunch, it was still above and beyond for them.) This farm stay produces tons of lemons, cantelope, peaches, huge figs, grapes, meat, cheese -everything home made. The food on the first night was great (9 our of 10), but the second night it was just OK (5 out of 10). Ask what's for dinner, before you agree to dinner plans. However, staying at these agriturismos in Amalfi, I would highly recommend dining at your farm stay for dinner. It is difficult enough to find your way in the daylight, so in the dark would be a real challenge, especially if you plan on enjoying the local wines. We never have had a bad meal just had a preference of the food served on the 1st night over the second. The rooms are basic, roomy, clean and comfortable. Great high speed wireless here. We had an absolutely amazing top floor to ourselves. Amazing view of Minori and the sea. Magical. Currently there is only one room on the top floor with an enormous sun deck and outdoor hot/cole water shower. Definatly ask for this room! We showered outdoors every day (of course there is a nice bathroom/shower, but we preferred outdoors as it was very warm and totally secluded). Each room is unique and surrounded by grape and flowering vines - very romantic setting. The family who runs the property is very hospitable and friendly. There are many stairs up to the office/rooms, so do not bring a lot of luggage. They will drive the luggage up in their truck - a death-defying experience should you choose to drive up the winding, narrow path with them. We surely would have stayed longer had they rooms available. There is one thing we disliked which was the barking dogs at night. We travel with ear plugs so were not disturbed, but other people commented at breakfast about the barking dogs in the \"neighborhood\". They are dogs belonging to the surrounding farms. If you close your doors it will not be a problem at all. We chose to sleep with the doors/windows open to enjoy the cool clean air. I would stay here again and highly recommend it to all.

No request goes unfilled. The farm is set high up in the hills, so be prepared to walk uphill. If you can book the Camelia room which is the largest and is upstairs from the other rooms with a private terrace. But all of the rooms are nice with large doors protected by shutters which we left open all night to get the fresh air. We ate two dinners and one lunch - which were all beautifully prepared and included amazing fresh fruit - all the figs you could ever want. Breakfast every morning was cereal, toast, jams and a pastry - and always fresh lemonade. There is not enough space to describe how wonderful Nadia and her family are. Plus because there are only 6 rooms we got to know our neighbors and hope to see them again. We ended up putting three tables together for our last dinner. Be aware though that to get to the farm you must walk. Vincenzo picks you up with your luggage, but during you stay, depending on when, you may need to get the community bus which lets you off at the base of the property or you can walk up a lighted staircase from the town center. This takes about 20-25 minutes. But we were stranded one day in the pouring rain, and up drives Vincenzo to rescue us! Plus he had to pick up two other couples who were checking in. Nadia is amazing and her entire family speaks perfect English as does practically everyone we encountered in Minori.

I have heard rave reviews from friends that the food was fabulous, so we booked a luncheon and it was fabulous!Nadia, her mom Maria, and dad Vincenzo were so kind and gracious. And the limoncello is absolutely out of this world. Too bad I was only allowed 3 bottles back. They also have homemade lemon marmelade that is great!

From our initital contact we were impressed, Nadia replyed to our emails at lightening speed and gave us all the information we needed. Upon our arrival, Vincenzo was warm and welcoming meeting us at the bottom of the driveway to take us and our bags up the very steep driveway (this ascent is not for the faint hearted!!). Upon reaching \"the summit\" we were not disappointed - what a view! Absolutely beautiful. The Villa is very clean, the rooms are well appointed, spotless and comfortable. Apart from the amazing view, Maria's cooking is fantastic! If I could take anything I wanted away from the Amalfi Coast, it would be Maria - WOW. We stayed at Villa Maria for 4 nights and ate their each night, enjoying a 4 course meal with beautiful wine and of course the fabulous Limoncello made by Maria to end the evening - a couple of bottles also accompanying us home at the end of our stay. I intend to return to Villa Maria with my daughter to attend one of Maria's cooking courses and enjoy once again all the Amalfi Coast has to offer and of course the wonderful care given by Vincenzo, Maria and their family. I have only one hint for future guests - there is no parking other than on the street below the Villa which is extremely limited and very challenging. Next visit, we will use the regular bus service (SITA).
