When we tried to book they didn't have any availability but took our number to get back to us if they could fit us in. They phoned back twice; firstly to offer us a time which we couldn't do, then secondly to offer us a different time due to a cancellation. We were very impressed with their efforts to accommodate us. When we arrived we were greeted by a very pleasant young lady who sat us in comfortable seats where we were served with our first drinks. We sat and enjoyed the surroundings of the stylish restaurant which had a lovely buzzy atmosphere. The staff were all smartly dressed and very polite and helpful. Our meals were beautifully cooked and presented . We both had steak and some delicious side orders and my husband finished off his meal with a home made tiramisu which was lovely. We will definitely return as we were impressed with the whole experience and look forward to a few return visits.", "title": "Lovely new restaurant.", "user": "jencatt", "date": "May 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 129589371}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the new Holiday Inn Express, Hoylake over the Bank Holiday weekend, the hotel is new and very clean.

The restaurant was buzzing but despite this the service was speedy and attentive. A query about a dish on the menu was answered promptly, indicating staff have been well trained. We both had a different version of the mozzarella starter and it was of a generous proportion, although my avocado was quite firm. I wanted a rib-eye steak for main but they had none left so I went for the lasagne instead which was an extremely generous portion. It was a tad dry but I took that to mean the meat was better quality and not fatty. My wife had a chicken main which she enjoyed. No room left for desserts but they looked tempting. We did think the wine was a tad pricey at almost \u00a320 for the cheapest bottle so went for a drink each instead. Total bill was just under \u00a340.
