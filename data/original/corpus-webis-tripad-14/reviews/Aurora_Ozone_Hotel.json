The hotel is in two parts across the road from each other, and they couldn't contrast more. There's a historic, but VERY shabby, hotel on one side, and a very, very new modern part on the other side. We were put in the modern part, and our room seemed to be so new that we may well have been the first people to stay there. Which might explain why it was so completely and utterly soul-less.
