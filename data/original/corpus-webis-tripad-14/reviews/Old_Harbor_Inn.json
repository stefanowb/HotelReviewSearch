We liked the many thoughtful touches like complementary water and soft drinks in the refrigerator in our room, a basket of snacks and robes in the room. The owners, Judy and Ray were warm, welcoming and very helpful and gave us great recommendations for restaurants and trips. We thoroughly enjoyed our three-night stay at this beautiful spot.

The bathroom was large, light and airy with generous supplies of towels, toiletries etc. the separate sitting room contained a sofa bed which was fine for our son.

Snacks and baked goods are left out all day long as well as access to cold drinks, or coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. The rooms are spacious and very clean! The common room hosts a beautiful fireplace to either sit and talk to to other quests, or to just simply read and enjoy the warmth of the fireplace on a cold winter day or night. Judy and Ray are willing to answer all your questions and direct you on places to eat and things to see and do while staying in Chatham.
