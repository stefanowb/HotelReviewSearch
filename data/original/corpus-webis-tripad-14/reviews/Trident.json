The staffs were friendlier than at any other of our Indian hotels (including Taj Vivanta ones). Although we didn't stay at any Oberoi hotels (out of our price range), the Tridents are owned and run by Oberoi and are excellent. Food was good -- we ate breakfasts and \u00e0 la carte lunches and dinners (we don't 'do' the buffet), and were very pleased (although the Udiapur Trident wins our India prize for best vegetable biryani!). I inquired as to why the staff (virtually every single employee!) was so excellent, and apparently they have their own Oberoi training program. In any case, we couldn't be happier with our experience. The rooms at the Udaipur and Jaipur Tridents were identical -- so they clearly have their \"style\" -- and yet they provided everything one would want and expect.
