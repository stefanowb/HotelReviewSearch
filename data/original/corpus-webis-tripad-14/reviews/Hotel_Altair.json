It was chosen as the 1st favourite hotel in Santiago de Compostela. Now I understand why... Although it was a bit hard to find it, since all streets in Santiago are narrow, confusing and all look the same, once we found it, it was like finding an oasis. No exaggeration. The welcome was very warm. It is a typical house in the old town, only 10 min. walk from the Cathedral. It is very well decorated. It has a lift! Our room (standard) was incredibly clean and neat. The bathroom was one of the cleanest ones I've ever seen. It included toiletries by Yves Rocher. We had a small balcony facing a private garden, where we could see all kinds of trees. It was very relaxing, indeed. A flat TV and free WIFI Internet completed this amazing familiar hotel. Not to mention the breakfast: all fresh and natural products in a beautifully decorated and comfortable cafeteria downstairs. Undoubtedly, one of the best stays I've every experienced.
