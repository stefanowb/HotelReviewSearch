My stay was three years ago, but I still shudder whenever I think of my ONE night in this hotel. After a trip to Scotland, I met up with a friend of mine from the States who had been visiting her family in Germany. We spent the day together in London before heading home. We decided on this hotel because it was recommended by Rick Steves, even though I had been to London twice before and had stayed in a hotel that was a little pricier, but very nice. Although Mrs. Patel was friendly, I found the hotel to be shabby, dark, and dank. The room my friend and her son stayed in was the size of a postage stamp...one had to basically leap from door to bed to sit, as their suitcase took up all the floor space. The bathroom was beyond tiny and had a horrible smell that permeated the whole room. My room was on the very top floor, and since it was impossible to drag my suitcase up the many flights of very narrow stairs, I had to leave my suitcase in the office and carry up only what I needed for the night. My bathroom had recently been redone, so was passable, but totally incongruous with the nasty attic room. The bottom part of the bed was horribly stained with God knows what, along with many other disgusting things too numerous to mention here. At least my room had enough space to walk about a bit, and my friend could sit on the one metal folding chair. I stayed awake all night, terrified I would miss my airport shuttle in the morning and have to stay an extra minute in this horrid place. I have been to London before and since, and believe me, Rick Steves got this one wrong.

They leave a basket of fresh fruit and granola bars for breakfast which we take to eat on the way to our first destination. There is a computer to use in the entry, blow dryer on request and TVs in every room. No elevator, but they accomodated me by giving a first floor room with my bad knee when set up ahead of time. They like to be paid in cash. There is a pub less than a block away, but the food is pricey.", "title": "Good Position, confortable for maximun one night", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Yuza77", "date": "November 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120694658}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled solo", "text": "The Hotel is less then 5 minutes on walk from Victoria Station and Bus Stops.", "title": "Nice little place", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "petz79", "date": "November 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120382513}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room is very very little but for one night is fine.", "title": "Great Little Place!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "catch242", "date": "November 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120355652}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled solo", "text": "I was in London just over a year ago. for two week. and stayed at Cherry Court Hotel.

(good paced) walk to Buckingham Palace. there is a pub at the end of the street that has great food. The rooms are small but very clean and tidy and if you are just sleeping there at night its all good. While i was there my room got a new T.V. Very nice i have to say. Hugh Street is quiet well lit at night and clean. The staff answered every question about where things where and how to get there. i got there early (Fight was ontime) and they let me check in early. so nice of them.
