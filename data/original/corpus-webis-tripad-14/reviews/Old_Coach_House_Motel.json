They were attentive and freindly without being obtrusive. The rooms in this ideally located hotel were clean, comfortable and spacious with everything one would need. The breakfast was again perfect in every way and nothing was too much trouble. We would highly recommend a stay here for a business trip or for a base for visiting the lovely countryside of Lincolnshire. Thanks to Martyn and Barbara our stressful period during our move was aleviated by the warm friendly welcome they afforded us.", "title": "Home from Home", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RobSu", "date": "February 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 95590991}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "We enjoyed a comfortable two night stay at this bed and breakfast \"motel\" in the village of North Kyme - handy for visiting south Lincolnshire and as a base for visiting Lincoln, if you don't mind the 20 mile trip.
