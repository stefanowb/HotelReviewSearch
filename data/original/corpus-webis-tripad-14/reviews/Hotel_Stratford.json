In trying to air out my room, I found that the room became a bit cool.

As hard as I tried, I could not help causing all kinds of floor creaking as I walked around my room. The room itself was OK, but certainly nothing to write home about, as other reviews here would have you believe (I'm wondering if they were written by employees). It was clean, that is true. But other than that, very basic. It had an old-style bedspread as opposed to comforters you tend to see in modern hotels. Very cheap and minimal toiletries.

The TV is a 30+ inch flat screen with a lot of satellite channels (most of which you will not watch as they are the standard fluff channels found in every TV market) plus a few movie channels. Microwave and fridge in room, marble counter for sink, closet for clothes (and it has a bench for your suitcase). Shower was nice, but the shower head didn't appear to be adjustable in the angle of the head. My only complaint was that the bed was stiff and flat, causing me to keep turning over through out the night due to pressure points on my shoulder and hip. If the bed was better I would stay here again. However, if you are a back or stomach sleeper you probably won't have any issues with the bed and pressure points. Other than that it is a great value motel to stay at and I recommend it to anyone.
