You had to break up their laugh fests to receive any service. Room was fine, if a bit small, and very little soundproofing between rooms.

The view from our standard room left much to be desired just some old roof tops were visible. The bathrooms also were updated and very clean. We did have drinks at the bar both nights before we went out and they were reasonably priced and the bar tenders offered some good insight to the area. I think that my favorite part was the location.
