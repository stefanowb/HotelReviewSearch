The host was very kind and great conversation at 7am coffee and continental breakfast in the main lodge. Price was great too. We were able to hike, crawl and squeeze long hours in the park and then have nice hot shower and comfy warm bed at night. The park was great and was like the tubes on Big but more concentrated in one spot. Recomend the park and this hunting lodge to anyone with a love of nature and people. Very clean place. Capt.
