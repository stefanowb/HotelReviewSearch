My friend and I stayed here for a couple of days this month. We were allocated to Room 46 on the top floor - probably the most characterful room in the hotel (although they are all quite non-standard). It has a tiny little window in the middle of the apex of the room and the beds were fitted into the Apex so a wee bit unusual. I am surpirsed, given that the hotel is over 100 years old, no-one seems to have mentioned the little \"Caspers\" (friendly ghosts!) at the hotel. There were definately things going bump in the night!!

The hotel is surprisingly big and, if you can, try and book a room with a view out over the Firth of Clyde. Very tranquill! Rooms have fairly good facilities, not quite Hilton or Marriott standard but close enough. The bistro restaurant has a good menu, with a variety of dishes from curries to fish & chips, haggis to sea bass. At breakfast though, I couldn't get any porridge! The kippers looked good as an alternative, but a bit pungent for me in the mornings.

They had a kids club for the over 2's and had a babysitting service and baby listening service for younger children.
