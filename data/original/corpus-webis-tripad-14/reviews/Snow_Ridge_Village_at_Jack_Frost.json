It also did not have a jacuzzi or electric fireplace. (If you want firewood, they sell it at the check-in counter for $4.00.) However, the price was right, $175 a night, for President's week. It was very private and faced a lake (frozen). It had a nice deck for star gazing. It also had thermostats in every room, including the bathrooms, which was terrific. The television in the living room was a nice size and came with an old play station with one game. The very old and tiny television in the master bedroom did not work. Both bedrooms were nice size. The master had a very comfortable queen size bed. The second bedroom had two singles. The kitchen was old but worked just fine (the microwave was the largest and oldest I have ever used ). The entire condo was covered with grasscloth wallpaper from the 70's. (You know, the kind that looks like tiny bamboo shoots all put together). Okay I guess, but certainly in need of an update. The location was fantastic for skiing at Jack Frost. Literally, five minutes door to door. Keep in mind, Jack Frost closes at 4:00PM (tubing also). The ride to Big Boulder takes 20 minutes. You make a left leaving Snow Ridge Village (just as if you were going to Jack Frost), pass over 940 and continue on that road following the signs. So, therefore, if you really plan on skiing Big Boulder, pick someplace closer like Splitrock. Let me tell you, travelling on those long winding roads (that are pitch black at night) gets exhausting and eats up a lot of gas. Not to mention that completely annoying stop to pay the 25 cents (both ways!). Back at the condo, if you need provisions, make a left on 940. There you will find a beer distributor about a half mile, maybe less, on your right that sells cases only, and other assorted items, including candy and cigarettes at very reasonable prices. All in all a very nice place to stay. Very country like and spotlessly clean. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Can't wait to visit again. We booked through Worldres at (--).", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ChampagnePrincess", "date": "February 22, 2007", "id": 6829373}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Place to stay with friends and close to the slopes!", "text": "Staying at Snow Ridge Village at Jack Frost/Big Boulder was really nice.

Very close to Jack Frost but our unit was not within walking distance to the ski slopes. I was told that some units have jacuzzis but you have to request that when you make the reservation.
