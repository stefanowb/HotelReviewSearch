Shuttle arrived a little late but to no avail since there was no room on it. The driver called around and confirmed that no other shuttle could pick us up either and since by then we were becoming concerned that if we waited for the next and a similar situation occurred we were at risk of missing our flight. The shuttle driver told the receptionist to call a cab which she did. This arrived reasonable promptly and was charged to the hotel. The airport was busy and we had about 20 minutes to spare at the gate - so glad we did not risk the next shuttle even though this should have been due 15 minutes after we left. It seems that the shuttle service is some sort of joint arrangement between local hotels so out of the control of individual hotels. Be very careful you allow plenty of time for a flight. We would not risk it again, Shuttle issues apart this is a standard 2 - 3 star establishment with comfortable bed and large rooms and if the price is right could be worth a try", "title": "Took good care of our injured party.", "user": "Duece1623", "date": "December 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 147450698}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled on business", "text": "With our son who is in the Navy came home for the holidays.
