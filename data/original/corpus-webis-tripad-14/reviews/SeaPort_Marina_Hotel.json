I'm sure that in its' day it was one of the prime hotels in the area but it is getting on in years. There are signs of wear everywhere you look but there is still a lot of life in the old gal. Our room was very large, clean and quiet with a good mattress. The location is great as you are on the Pacific Coast Highway at the intersection of 2nd Street which has dozens of shops and good restaurants and it is reasonably close to downtown. The staff were pleasant and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.", "title": "Aging princess but still in the game", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "EB3", "date": "February 7, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3167471}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Price, nice rooms and what a great breakfast for only $4.00", "text": "My Wife and myself stayed at the Seapport for 3 days, I had a great time, lots of great restaurants all around the hotel.

Originally booked the room for 2 days - at the outrageous price of $99.00 per night. No breaksfast was included in that charge. The room did not have a coffee maker, a fridge or a microwave. The TV was the pits, with a very old converter box and terribly colours....and worst of all, the room was smelly to boot.

What do people want?", "text": "Have had several occassions to have out of town guests stay at the hotel. Never had a complainant from any of them. If one wants the \"looks\" and \"beauty\" of a 5 star hotel, they should stay at one and hopefully get their monies worth. For what the prices are at the Seaport, the rooms are clean, the staff very helpful and the service fine. I will agree it could use some remodeling and upgrading, but after spending several million dollars, the price would be that of a Hilton. If you plan on staying at a hotel to spend most of your time in the room, rent an apartment.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 9, 2004", "id": 2874093}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Long Beach"}, "stars": 1.5, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 11, "very good": 12, "terrible": 37, "excellent": 6}, "aka": "Seaport Marina Long Beach", "slim_ranking": 0.736842105263}
