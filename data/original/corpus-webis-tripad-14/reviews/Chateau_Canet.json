It was absolutely perfect. Our family of 12 celebrated my parents anniversary here (ages 7-76) and everyone found something to do. Victoria and Floris are wonderful hosts and went out of their way to arrange our numerous side trips with interesting locals (truffle walk, personal tour of Carcasonne, private chef, horse riding, dinners out). The property is gorgeous; we walked out to pick fresh figs every morning. That was just one of the highlights. The wine was good, the markets were nearby and delicious. There was plenty to do in the area surrounding Rustique - never a dull moment. It really was the perfect holiday.

As we number 40 or so, it wasn't going to be practical to do this at home, although we do live in a wonderful part of southern France. We found Chateau Canet on the internet and guessed immediately that it would be an ideal setting, 10 individual gites and excellent facilities in a beautiful setting, quite near to Carcassone. When we met Victoria we realised we had found our perfect facilitator. She was an essential ingredient with suggestions for activities, excursions, catering, arranging taxies and buses to meet parties arriving and leaving: nothing was too much trouble. Our week at Chateau Canet was a delightful experience, with Chardonnay , the largest gite, as the hub of a rewarding gathering. Our grandchildren played for hours in the pool, the grownups played tennis and boules, we barbecued and partied to our heart's content and by the end of the week felt that bonds had been wonderfully strengthened amongst our widely scattered young ones.

But best of all were our hosts. Victoria and her staff, including her incredibly charming children.
