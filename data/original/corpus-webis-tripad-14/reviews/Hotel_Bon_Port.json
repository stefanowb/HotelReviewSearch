On entering the .Hotel the reception, bar and dining area were nicely decorated. But this is where it ended. Going through the door to the bedrooms was a time warp. The corridors were lined with chairs, giving the appearance and feeling of an old people's care home (in fact this is probably an insult to modern care homes!). As we were on this deal we had to accept pot luck as to the room we were allocated. Unfortunately this was at the back of the building. The view was of flat roofs, rubbish skip, bonfire, washing line and several old freezer cabinets. Ok look beyond this and there are trees in the distance. The room d\u00e9cor was very tired and dated. The plus side is that it was immaculately clean and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. There were sufficient towels and basic toiletries. The shower was above the bath and was the clip on hand held type. There was absolutely no power and when my husband showered the hot water ran out.", "title": "An Hotel cannot survive on view alone", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sauvarin", "date": "August 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173953370}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The main air conditioning unit outlet seemed to be very near to the outside of the window and was extremely noisy in the quiet of the night, making sleep difficult.

When faced with an unusually (and unnecessarily) awkward type they displayed reserves of civility above and beyond the call. Indeed they were visibly shaken by the experience yet maintained a level of personable presence that was by any standards commendable. Said Saeed?

As our faithful pooch (Haggis) goes pretty much everywhere with us, he needed to make sure the accommodation would accept him also - step in and take a bow Hotel Bon Port! It did take a few wrong turns on some very narrow roads before we found the place but it was sure worth waiting for. Set high on a clifftop, the views are simply stunning. There is plenty space surrounding the hotel for both humans and dogs alike to enjoy walking, playing or just generally relaxing. Our room was downstairs and to the side but even the view from this window was quite lovely as it overlooked the next bay along. The room itself and en-suite were clean, spacious and very comfortable - more than adequate for our needs. So imagine our surprise (and sheer delight) when we got a call from reception to say that they were going to upgrade us to one of the even better rooms upstairs with a balcony and view to die for! This room was even more spacious and grand. We stayed at the Bon Port for 4 nights and after staying in some really nice hotels all over the world, I can honestly say this is one of the best. This is a family run hotel and the staff are very well chosen because they go above and beyond just providing good service. Nothing was ever too much trouble and I even got a lovely card, balloon and birthday cake from them on my special day. It's touches like these that make all the difference between a great stay and an unforgettable stay. We certainly have some fab memories (and pictures) from this trip that will last a lifetime and it's largely thanks to the management and staff at the Hotel Bon Port.
