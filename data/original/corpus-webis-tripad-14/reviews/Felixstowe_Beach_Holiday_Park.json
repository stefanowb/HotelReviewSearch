We got a last minute deal and checked the reviews after booking. But we enjoyed every minute and I really feel a lot of complaints are unfair. We stayed for three nights in a silver caravan (yc 07) and was dreading opening the door, I needn't have worried. Check in was friendly and fast. The caravan was spotlessly clean with no nasty smells, sheets were like new. Ok, so a few minor marks on furniture and carpets, but that's what happens when you have families going in one after another and this was no worse than any other caravan I have stayed in. Plenty of crockery and completely clean.
