I had a great time. I was able to check in at 10:00 am with no problems. They had no problems with bringing my dog. I was able to walk her around the hotel with no problems. The room was very clean. The beds were VERY comfortable. Bathroom was clean. When I checked in they gave me a ticket for a care package to be sent up to my room because of the construction on my tower. The package was great. We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast and had no problems.

I was lucky enough to be in the North Tower. I have to say the room was very nice. Obviously, you get the comfortable bed. But my room was very attractive, with new furniture and a most excellent flat screen TV mounted on the wall! Shula's was closed for renovations, but the sports bar was open and the 2 lunch sandwiches I had there were great (and reasonable by downtown/big city prices). The lobby was always extremely crowded (we had at least one covention, and a huge family reunion). Do take note about the sketchy location. It's a 4 block walk to the convention center, and a good little walk to Inner Harbor. The surrounding area is hit and miss, and you do NOT want to make a wrong turn.

There are two towers a north and south. The north is is much better shape. Our 1st room in the south tower had no dresser, the frame for the closet was wallpapered over, the toilet seat was haning off and this was one of the rooms which was just redone. Friends had another south tower room and were never told that they would not have any water from 10am till 3 pm everyday during their stay. We were moved to the north tower and was much better. After many discussions with the manager we were given free breakfast buffet which was in Shula's resturant in the hotel. Breakfast was a lot to be desired. Want a huge breakfast, walk down the street to the Days Inn right across the street from the convention center. Shula's is estremely expensive and the service is very very slow. We waited 40 minutes just to get menus to our table. Only reason we stayed was to see how long it would actually take. Travelocity was contacted and stated that they were sending a team down to investigate. They never notified us that the hotel was undergoing renovations.

I called the hotel immediantly and apparently the next person who had our room was charging things to the room. The hotel never took off my credit card from the room. Luckily, Discover resolved this.

Not only did they conveniently \"forget\" about the agreed-upon rate of reservation upon check-in, but the rooms were NOT CLEANED when we went in--disgusting! To add to that, the staff sent to fix the room took their time arriving and were incredibly rude. The hotel didn't do anything to compensate for the mess that they left, and the rooms themselves were hardly anything special - small, cramped, and with few amenities. You'd think a hotel would have the customer in mind rather than the bottom line, but sadly this is not the case.

We have been to the Inner Harbor Area before to see a baseball game 2 years ago and said that this time we would like to stay at the Inner Harbor. After searching through many hotels and getting discouraged by the ridiculously high prices some of the hotels were asking I recieved an e-mail from the Sheraton and figured from their reputation that we couldn't go wrong. After reading some of the reviews I must say I was concerned that maybe this experience would be different. Everything was just fine and then some. Parking was nearby (across the street @ $18 per day) and convenient. Check-in was efficient. We requested 2 rooms in the North Tower that were ajoining which was honored. The room was more than adequate. It was new and clean with a nice flat screen T.V. and a nice view of the pool below. The location although not directly on the Inner Harbor was good and as long as you stick to the main roads for ultimate security there is no problem. Chambermaids and Bell staff were friendly and helpful and check-out was effortless. Our bill was under the door the morning of our departure with an additional memo concerning the high volume of check-outs to be expected that day because of the Ballgame and Jazz festival . An explanation of special provisions to be made for luggage storage of patrons checking out that would be attending the game that day were included. I was impressed to say the least.
