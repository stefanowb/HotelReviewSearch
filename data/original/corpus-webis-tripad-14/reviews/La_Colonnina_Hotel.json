Less than two minutes walk from one of the main squares, down a quiet little laneway. We had a triple room, which actually consisted of a room with a double bed, with another room off of it with a single bed. Even though our room did not have a balcony, right outside our door was a little patio, and one floor up was a rooftop patio, both with views over the old town and towards the ocean. Lovely, bright breakfast room with very friendly staff, serving a generous continental breakfast. We had originally picked another hotel in the new town, but found the location of La Colonnina to be far superior...much quieter, less touristy, and surrounded by houses of local residents. The one drawback, in our eyes, was that it was further from the train station (which was only an issue because we brought too much luggage). We were a little nervous about mailing a bank draft for our 200E deposit, but it all worked out fine - they were very prompt about acknowledging receipt of the deposit and reassuring us of our reservation.", "title": "We Lucked Out Here!!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "16canuck", "date": "August 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8489894, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great location, cleanliness, super friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Tiny bathtub - but this a minor complaint!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Nice accommodation in the cirque Terre clean and close to beach.", "title": "Nice place", "user": "james_denicolo", "date": "August 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8462390, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The room"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "After reading the reviews of this hotel, we chose to stay La Colonnina Hotel for 3 nights in July. We were a family of 1 adult and 4 children (2 teens and 2 younger ones), and they put us in a double room with an extra bed attached to a small room with a double door for the younger kids. Thankfully, the air-conditioning was superb since we arrived just at the tail-end of a heat wave. The hotel is located just a little ways up from Ghirabaldi Square, a quaint gathering place all throughout the day and night. The hotel was clean, quiet and convenient to the beach (about a 2-3 min. easy walk down a narrow street). Our breakfast was ample and good without much variety, but for 3 days, it was fine. The hotel and town felt safe for the younger ones but had enough variety for the older kids.

The accommodations were lovely with a great bed, spotless bathroom and wonderful shower. Breakfast was terrific and plentiful. The location was perfect, close to the beach, all the shops and great restaurants. We were offered beach towels for our swim outings and were told to help ourselves to any umbrella in the stand by the door on the one afternoon it rained. They go out of their way to make you feel like they are there to make your stay the best it can be. We will stay here again and recommend to all our friends. A real gem of a hotel.

Great staff. Wonderful location just off the the main street (Monterosso is tiny). Fantastic view from the rooftop terrace (great for nightly happy hour). The breakfast room is beautiful and the food and service excellent. The Cinque Terre hike is phenomenal (and difficult at times) and the sea was crystal clear. This is not an \"old world\" hotel. Modern, comfortable, air conditioned. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. They do require a deposit via wired cash or euro traveler's cheques, and don't accept credit cards for payment (not a problem with ATM machines nearby).

As several other reviews commented, it was a bit of a hassle and a little bit disconcerting to have to send a bank draft to the hotel to guarantee the reservation. The hotel also only accepts cash, which seemed like another hassle. Thus I was expecting some mom and pop-type establishment when I got there, but was pleasantly surprised to see what a really delightful hotel it was. We reserved a room with a balcony (I emailed them several times and then finally one became available) and it was definitely worth the additional 20 euros. Our friends reserved a room without a balcony and their room was much smaller as was the bathroom. In fact their bathroom had no shower (an oddity for Americans) but rather a deep tub with a hand held shower head. On the other hand, our bathroom was quite roomy with a large shower and a very large vanity which afforded two of us to easily share the sink area with all of our toiletries. The overall layout of the room and the contemporary furnishings gave us a lot of area/places to organize and put our things (clothes, daypacks, shopping items, books, cameras, phones, etc.). We stayed in five different hotels during our two week, five city trek through Italy and the La Colonnina was the most functional room of the five (hotels). While we didn't have time to enjoy the balcony, it was quite private set up with a cute little table and two chairs. The rooftop patio was very nice with a view of the sea. On our last night at the hotel we brought up a bottle of wine and some cheese and enjoyed the sunset. I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel but my husband said it was very good with a broad selection. The front desk was extremely friendly and helpful. They made several good restaurant recommendations in Monterosso, one in particular that unfortunately I cannot remember the name. (If you mention that the hotel referred you, you get a 5% discount off the tab.) All four of us liked it so much that we went back the next night for dinner. They served a steamed whitefish that was huge, platter size, which they filet at your table. It rivaled the whitefish that we enjoy in the UP in Michigan. The next night we enjoyed a seafood risotto that was big enough for four of us to enjoy. We were stuffed! Both meals were very reasonable and delicious. Getting back to the La Colonnina, I highly recommend this hotel. It's a great value (slightly over 100 euros), friendly and efficient service, and very comfortable. Hotel has air conditioning which even in early October is a necessity. It was HOT in the Cinque Terre (and I'm from Washington D.C. where we have steamy summers), especially if you do the hike. Monterosso is an excellent choice as it is the major train stop of the five Cinque Terre towns.
