We walked next door to the Long Beach Motor Inn to admire the property and inquire about rates for a possible future stay there. There was a woman sitting in a chair outside the office who is the same \"woman\" on the phone that the negative posters have spoken to. I am also sure that this same woman is the owner. When we saw her, she had her arms folded, no smile or even a hello, and was definitely not welcoming us onto her property. She was extremely rude to us, and my young children were nervous as they had never really met someone like her before.", "title": "Another Bad Experience with the Woman at the Long Beach Motor Inn", "helpfulness": 40, "user": "SuzanneE", "date": "May 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0}, "id": 5223935}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "A couple of years ago I saw the Long Beach Motor Inn listed on the web site of the York Chamber of Commerce so thought maybe there was a new owner and called to ask about rates.
