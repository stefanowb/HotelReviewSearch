It was extremely comfortable & very quiet except for the last evening when one of the guest below decided to use the whirlpool bath for half an hour & then have a battle with the other guest below as to who could have the television the loudest. I never understand why these places fit whirlpool baths they are just noisy & intrusive to other guests & we never use them for that reason. Maybe they are a novelty to some people. There is a large hotel in Kennebunkport that has no TVs in the rooms - that must be absolute heaven. I have to agree with a previous reviewer about the owners. They never introduced themselves to us and for some time we just thought that they were staff. However, all the staff - that includes the cleaners & groundsmen were all very efficient & friendly & my waistline is still feeling the effects of the breakfasts.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Scallywag", "date": "November 2, 2007", "id": 10529571}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "All in all excellent service & comfort that in some respects would shame some so called luxury hotels.", "title": "Great Experience", "user": "Minerva16", "date": "October 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10328654}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Captain's House Inn (10/19 - 10/21).

The location is very convenient and the staff was most helpful with recommendations for dining and other activities. Reviewers who fault the Inn for falling short of a 5 star hotel shouldn't be staying in a B&B. This is not a Ritz Carlton and should not be compared to one. It is a warm, comfortable, inviting and attracitve place to return to after a day's activities. Probably the nicest B&B we have stayed in, but not inexpensive.
