Even though the hotel was crowded our room was very quiet. The room was large and well appointed. The new Marriott bedding is great...especially the extra pillows. The staff was very friendly and professional. The breakfast buffet was above average.....nice to have real cups and glasses as opposed to styrofoam. Another plus with this hotel is the fact that you are in walking distance of IHOP, Jason's Deli, Outback, Applebees, and Cheddars. There is also a WalMart next door.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "krla", "date": "August 9, 2006", "id": 5589854}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Comfortable", "text": "This is a nice option on Lubbock.
