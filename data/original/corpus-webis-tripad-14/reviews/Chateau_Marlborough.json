As previous reviewers have mentioned though, the quality of the fittings in the bathroom was not to the standard of the rest of the room. Everything was clean and functional, but the contemporary, fresh fittings in the bedroom only highlighted the tired and rather shabby look of the bathroom. I understand that they're currently in the process of modernising their bathrooms - had they done this before our stay then I would have no hesitation in giving it an 'excellent' rating.", "title": "A bit disappointing - but still a comfortable stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Anon0", "date": "May 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 16364862, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Disappointing bathroom"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A great place to stay", "text": "A very pleasant hotel in a town where most of the accommodation is in motels or B&Bs.
