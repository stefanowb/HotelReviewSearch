I also found Vancouver at night very frightening with pan handlers everywhere. Fantastic in the day. Stanley park and the Aquarium are definatly worth a visit. We ate in gas town the first night at the old spagetti factory after having a great meal at the one in Banff. Well it was not at all like that, very disapointing. The second night we got a take away from China Town and it was fantastic. We ate it in our room which had a kitchenette and lounge area.
