We did a couple of trips with him I will post some photos of him in the next couple of days.

We had decided to do a day trip to Kandy, taking in the Elephant orphanage at Pinnawala as well. However, once we arrived at the Blue Water we discovered the hotel's hidden asset, Ruchi. He isn't employed by the hotel, in fact, isn't allowed on the premises, but he is one of the people who can make your holiday one to remember. We booked two tours with him. The first was a 2 day trip to Kandy and the Elephant orphanage amongst other attractions. Nothing was too much trouble. For instance, we insisted that we went with just one other couple with whom we became friends and this was no problem for him. The other trip was a 1 day excursion to the Dutch Fort at Galle. This took us through an area which was savagely devastated when the tsunami hit on Boxing day 2004.
