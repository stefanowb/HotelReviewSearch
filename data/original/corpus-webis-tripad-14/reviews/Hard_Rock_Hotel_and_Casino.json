Standard rooms aren't very big, but they're made for sleeping and they were clean and pleasant. The casino was a little smaller than I thought-- but had everything you needed. The pool was amazing, and if it was that good during the fall-- I can only imagine the summer. My favorite restaurant in the Hard Rock is Mr. Lucky's 24/7 which is a diner that is always open. The staff never gave me any problems and I did like it because it was in a world of it's own off the strip, but a very cheap, quick, and convenient cab ride to the strip. There are local stores and strip malls nearby when you need a dose of reality and not the Las Vegas glitz.
