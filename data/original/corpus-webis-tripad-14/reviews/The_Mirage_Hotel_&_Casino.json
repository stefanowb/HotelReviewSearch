We visit Vegas 3-4 times a year but had not stayed at the Mirage until this weekend. We had read great reviews and were excited to stay. The location is great, however the cleanliness of the rooms was not. We were able to check in early and the front desk associate stated that she had given us a complimentary upgrade to a pool view room. However, when we got to the room (12th floor)our view was of a drained pool through some bushes. We had to switch our room 4 times due to the rooms not being cleaned properly! The first room had stains with a dripping pattern down the entire headboard and ripped, stained sheets and comforter. We called down to the front desk where they said they would switch our room. When we arrived at the second room (11th floor) the musty dirty smell was overwhelming. We again called the front desk where we were given a 3rd room (16th floor) but told that our keys may not work and we would have to wait for someone to bring them back up. We were let in by security and hoping to finally get to relax but yet had stains covering the sheets, rings of dirt and hair all over the nightstand. I then went down to the front desk and spoke with a manager and showed her the pictures we had taken of the rooms. She apologized, gave us a new room and a $50 food and beverage credit for the inconvenience of having to switch rooms yet again. The fourth and final room (23rd floor) had a beautiful strip view but also had blood stained sheets and what looked like remnants of vomit on the headboard. I called down and spoke with the same manager. She sent a housekeeping manager and they proceeded to wipe everything down and strip the beds and replace them with new sheets and comforters. This whole process was at least a 2 hour process. I' not sure if it was our bad luck or lack of housekeeping. We have stayed in numerous hotels and recently stayed with my husband at the Aria Sky Suites a few weeks ago, but have never experienced rooms that were not cleaned to this extent.

Also if you request a corner suite there is a little 1-2 min walk from the elevators.

Boy have things changed since the recession! While hotels are making higher profits than ever before (according to the financial news reports) many have cut staffing and services to the bone, including the Mirage! We were there for the catering convention recently (April 2013) and there were so many issues with this hotel that I would never want to go back, even though this was my first and only stay with them, it was not a good one! With the exception of the night manager Luis, our stay was very disappointing.... When you first walk in to the lobby you will notice the partitions for the construction of Tom Colicchio's new steak house, very obvious with big signage. I really don't care if Tom is Coming!!! What I do care about is that there was a 200 yard walk to the elevators through a casino that made you wander along paths designed to entice you to gamble. I get it, it's Vegas but not everyone wants to dump their cash into the slots upon arrival! The adult pool was closed, not even available for one day a week while the family pool closed at 5:00 PM. Really, in Vegas? Our conference was not over until 4:00! There was a huge attendee list so you would think that they would want the bar business at the pool? Guess not. My biggest gripe was COFFEE! You either order a pot via room service for 18.00 (2 cups) or go down stairs to one of the two coffee vendors and wait for 30 to 40 minutes for your hand crafted cup of expensive coffee! 5.50 for a small Latte...? What ever happened to in-room amenities? The booze was expensive in all the bars, 7.00 to 9.00 for a Corona. The restaurants were okay, nothing to write home about and they should probably change out California Pizza Kitchen with a signature restaurant like David Paul's. :) The servers in most of the bars and at the tables were really unhappy people, all signs of managements drive for dollars. Over all, the only thing that I really enjoyed were the conference facilities which were ample and the Hooka Lounge was happening at the Rhum Bar. Other than that, you can find much better hotels for around the same price or just a bit more, but when you are in Vegas, you really should enjoy the best it has to offer!

Beautiful place, great location. Used the pool this time and the chairs are way too close together to enjoy yourself. Too bad, cause it is really nice. Stayed at 3 places this trip and of all the rooms, this was the worst. Even New York New York had nicer rooms. Seriously, a camper has a larger bath tub than here! May not be a biggy to alot of people, but to me it is. Could care a less about the view, but I do like to bath every night after gambling and walking. This time we were still down the hall quite far and let me tell you, it doesn't matter where your room is....it will still be noisy! Can't be helped if the doors don't close all the way because there is no seal. When we approached our room, we could see inside the room through the side and top of the door. Both stays here our rooms were comped and neither time were we able to upgrade(even for a fee) to a larger bath room. So this part of the review is for those who gamble. The Mirage will offer a couple of nights free, never 5 or 7 we always stay. Although after staying for a couple, they are then willing to comp the rest of our stay, but never upfront. Hello, take a look at our play! We gamble the whole time we are there.Dollar machines and 25 to 50 bucks a hand at black jack.Now, after gambling, they do have good express comps and point play or cash back. Better than the Harrah's group. Also upfront, very seldom offers for cash free play. This time Caesars offered us 3 nights and 550.00 in free play. And when we checked in, they upgraded us to a suite with a jacuzzi. So why stay at the mirage as an mlife member? We have always managed to be a bit up or even after our 3 days here. And I know we spend the money, but is frustrating with some clubs that you play and play and then have to pay for meals, etc. So, on the gambling end. the mirage is a 4 for me, but the hotel itself is only a 3. Oh, and by the way, forget about ever getting a drink in this casino! Literally, hours or thousands before seeing a waitress. This trip, after our first night, a floor worker recognized us from the night before and she made sure a waitress came by. The duration of our stay she would check regularly to make sure we were being looked after. Can't remember her name but thanks so much! So, to make a long story short, we will probably continue to return until we lose our butts! Then I guess there will nothing to lure us back! Also other reviews complained about the cleanliness of the rooms,.... this is true. Neither stay our carpet had been vacuumed before we got into our room and this time there were curly hairs at the base of the toilet from check in till check out! My husband had to fix our toilet everyday, The internet never worked and although they said they would send someone up, they never did in the time we were there.Ate at Carnegie deli(awesome again), blt burger(good as always), the buffet(not even close to worth 27.00 for breakfast, it was all cold), and tried to eat at bb kings but after sitting at a table for 20 mins. and noone even acknowledged us, we got up and left.", "title": "Still trying to figure this place out", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Jackie155042", "date": "October 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 142826720}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed at The Mirage October 6 to 10th.

What a truly, amazing holiday. We stayed from April 14th until April 21st 2013 and had the most wonderful time. One week just wasn't long enough to take in all the sights and attractions that Las Vegas has to offer and the Mirage hotel and casino was an awesome base to take shelter. From the moment that we arrived, everything about the hotel impressed us, from the sheer size of the resort to the cleanliness and the efficiency and friendliness of the check-in lobby staff. We were greeted with real smiles (when a person is happy in their job and takes real pleasure in helping guests you can tell in their eyes) and the extent of their helpfulness and willingness to go that extra mile for their guests excelled. Yes you do have to walk through the casino to access the guest elevators but that's the same in most Vegas hotels, no? and if you don't want to part with your money and gamble it away then simply don't. As for the guest rooms... that bed!! WOW. It was like sleeping on a cloud for 7 nights. Everything clean, housekeeper was friendly and worked hard. Everything always replenished when needed and little extra touches here and there make it more personal and special. We had a fab outlook from the room onto part of the strip from floor 17 - glad of a higher floor as i think being at the bottom a view might be limited depending on where the room is located. Down now to the pool and sunbathing area, what a pool! Be prepared to arrive early for a decent sunbathing spot though and this was only April.. however that's nothing to moan about as it's more or less the same all over the world. The pool is brill though, clean and spacious and great for cooling off in the Vegas sunshine! Comfortable beds around the pool and friendly, hard working staff serving drinks as and when if required. We didn't eat around the pool but the Paradise Cafe looked inviting and would of liked to have had a bite to eat there but somehow didn't end up trying it. Oh also, the hot tub is AMAZING. As for eating in the hotel - BLT Burger is THE place for the most tastiest and sexiest burgers around! Even if you're not a burger person, these are different somehow and just so tasty.. damn i'm hungry now thinking about it. Oh and the milkshakes.... this is what you call a milkshake! Cravings buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner was also real good value with various cooking stations for all your different tastebud needs and wants.. heaps of food, tasty and awesome desserts! Some of the servers did look a bit stressed out through being so busy and forgot things at times but a friendly reminder and all was fine, they were however friendly and apologetic. I must say... the Roasted Bean was an amazing place to get a cup of tea! pastries, cakes, bagels, wraps, salads.. this place was a little godsend to us and the staff were friendly and always smiling, good atmosphere. There were various other places to eat and drink inside the hotel from casual to fine dining and although we didn't try all of them in the week they certainly looked busy and popular. Bars and lounges looked the part, especially the RHUMBAR.. in full swing, looked awesome. The Mirage's very own Siegfried & Roy's secret garden and dolphin habitat... View White tigers and the chance to get up close and personal with beautiful dolphins, nice little retreat from the chaos of Vegas. Wishing we had of got the chance to see Cirque du Soleil's 'The Beatles-Love' live from the Mirage but simply did not have the time to fit everything into one weeks stay. Oh the volcano that errupts nightly outside at the Mirage on the hour every hour is well worth a watch! Catch the Mirage tram straight down to Treasure Island to save those little legs! At the beginning of the week you walk EVERYWHERE to take everything in and so you don't miss a thing, by the end of the week you've walked that far (the strip is bigger than you think) that your feet are twice the size and walking anywhere becomes effort! We only found out on the last night that you could catch a monorail from the back of Harrah's hotel to either direction, towards Stratosphere or to the right down towards MGM Grand right at the other end of the strip, cheap fast and efficient and just saves those feet when they begin to throb!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "archman8", "date": "May 6, 2013", "id": 159755999}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Overall, would definitely recommend staying at the Mirage and will no doubt return in the future.
