We had a much better meal at the coffee house just down the street. The second thing that would keep me from rating this property \"excellent\" is the parking fee of $6 every night. There was really no need to do this since there were other hotels all up and down the street and there was no way someone would want to park in their lot unless they were staying here. And last, the size of the master bedroom width-wise was barely big enough for the bed and dresser. When I had to get up in the middle of the night, my husband's feet and the blankets were right up next to the dresser and I nearly tripped trying to walk by. That was a bummer.

It felt like a home away from home. The breakfast was wonderful (make your own waffles, eggs, sausage, cereal, yogurt, granola, I could go on and on). The was just enough seating during the very busy times with the tables in and out. It is a beautiful hotel with great customer service. They will even pick up groceries for you for free! We stayed in a Two bedroom kid's suite. It was very roomy and quiet, three tv's, a kitchen & a living room. The only thing odd about the room was the bathroom was located through the Parent's bedroom (we had an infant that would nap in there and was disturbed anytime someone needed to use the restroom). I think our kids looked forward to returning to the hotel every evening just as much as the attractions we were visiting. There were many other friendly families there, all the kids played together. We participated in the evening reception on our last night and wished we had discovered it sooner. We had lasagna and salad and drinks (red & white wine, and a microbrew on tap). It was so wonderful not to have to head back out in the evening to find some food, we got to swim, relax, eat, and swim some more. They also have bar-b-que's available for anyone to use.
