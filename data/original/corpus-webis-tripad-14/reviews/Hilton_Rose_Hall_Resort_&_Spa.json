We were booked in a resort view room and My wife simply asked if there was any rooms availible with a view of the ocean & were put into a room with 1 of the best sightlines I have ever been in , 607. Overlooked not only the ocean, but the golf course & mountains as well!! The room : Was very clean looking , updated style , beds pretty comfy , lots of pillows very comfortable feel .
