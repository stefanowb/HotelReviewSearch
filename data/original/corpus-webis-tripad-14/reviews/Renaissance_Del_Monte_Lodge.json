We finally took advantage of the adjacent bike path on the last visit (rental nearby) and it was a very good experience. There are also canal boat rides very close. The exercise room is very small, but they do offer passes to a larger heath club. There is an excellent full service spa attached to the hotel. Good selection of restaurants within walking distance.

My new husband and I hosted our friends and family to our wedding at the DelMonte 3/3/06 and we were all treated to an amazing experience. The rooms are phenominal. Not overly spacious, but appointed with high-end linens, thick towels and the beds are so nice, you don't want to get out of it! What impreseed me the most is the service and attention to detail. I am a very detail oriented person, appreciate and pay attention to the \"little things\". This hotel has not overlooked one little thing. The staff in general are so gracious and helpful - I feel like there is nothing I could ask for that they wouldn't have accomodated. If you stay here (or better yet have a wedding or coroporate function) you MUST eat here. The food is the best I have ever had. All of our guests were also impressed - the quality, quantity and presentation were unforgettable. I do not believe the hotel deserves the three-star rating, as to me, this is better than many five-star hotels I have stayed at in major metro areas (Boston, Chicago). Lastly, treat yourself to a Spa treatmet if you can - again, gracious staff, warm interior and aromatic. I am so fond of this hotel and their staff I have \"fired\" my hair stylist of 20 years and now go to the DelMonte Spa for all of my beauty treatments - but I am lucky enough to live nearby. If you have any questions or hestistation at all, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. I can not say enough about this property as a whole.

That is so nice when you have a few more work things to complete before heading out for the day. I'm looking forward to my next few trips.
