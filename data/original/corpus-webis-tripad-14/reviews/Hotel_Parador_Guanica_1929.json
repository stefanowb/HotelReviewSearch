It's pretty well kept; the staff is super friendly. Food is nothing to die for. Average puertorrican food. And I'm saying it on a positive way. What I mean is that it's tasteful but don't expect gourmet food. This is not a Ritz Carlton. It's a \"parador\"; a small inn. Simple but nice. Very quiet. Would like to go back soon. And in the evenings, don't miss the winery that is next door, BODEGAS ANDREU SOLE.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "golflover26", "date": "December 8, 2013", "id": 187119834}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "While the concept is different the place was neat, well located, rooms where big and clean. The pool was close by from my room and close to the restaurant and front desk couldn't complain. The food was great in the restaurant. There is like a small park at the other side of the hotel, great for kids to my daughter a few times. The beach close by from there playa santa was really great that time of year. The beds where really comfortable had a great night sleep.

I heard every noise made in the restaurant kitchen, including the music the staff was hearing. The electrical outlet in the bathroom did not work and I had trouble plugging the hair dryer in another outlet. I took a hair dryer (thank God) because the room had no dryer or iron like the website had announced it would. I requested the iron at front desk.
