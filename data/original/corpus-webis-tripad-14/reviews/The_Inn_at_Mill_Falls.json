We had been there before and really enjoyed it. We stayed in the new Church Landing building in the Harbor View room. It was absolutely beautiful. We had a birch canopy bed,window seat,fireplace,pull out sofa and balcony with a great view. We had dinner the first night at the Lakehouse Grill in Church Landing. The menu was limited, but the duck was very good. We had breakfast both mornings there for the convience. It was just Ok. The second night we had dinner at the Italian restaurant in the Boathouse. We had preferred seating at the window because we were guests at the Inn. It was very nice. The food at both restaurants was good, but not of gourmet quality. All the grounds are beautiful and a lot of detail. Great place to go to relax. We hope to go back for the New year's weekend package.", "user": "claudiale", "date": "October 17, 2006", "id": 5965000}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nothing special", "text": "claudia", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Heslomonik", "date": "September 19, 2006", "id": 5817309}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very pleasant stay", "text": "somerset, mass.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "brittaboo", "date": "August 11, 2006", "id": 5600340}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Don't complain about the housekeepers.", "text": "We spent 2 nights here towards the end of a 2-week trip around New England and New York. We decided to splash out a bit and book in here as we thought it would be worth it to stay somewhere nice like Meredith. The hotel staff were friendly, but the hotel itself is a bit outdated. Our room was full of floral decoration! The room was clean, but the shower was pretty old and there was a damp patch on our carpet. The room also smelt a bit of smoke despite being non-smoking. There was no coffee maker in our room, but you could get coffee from the lobby. Our air conditioning unit was really noisy which made it a bit diffcult to get a good night's sleep. Meredith itself is pretty to look at, but there's absolutely nothing else to recommend it. It has very few eating establishments, and they don't serve food very late (we struggled to find somewhere at 9pm that would serve us).", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 12, 2006", "id": 5458551}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Inn at Mills Falls is actually four different inns around the town.
