The overall experience was good. I liked the decor of the hotel. I am not sure if it is a historic building but it is a nice building. We usually stay in other hotels when visiting the Valley but it was a special occasion and we tried this one. Also, we got a very good deal for the weekend. I did not have the chance to try the restaurant but I could see that it is a nice location. I would recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend or if you want to enjoy a nice, and different, hotel experience when in McAllen. It is in a walking distance to downtown (something different to do than going to the shopping malls, etc). The staff was able to accommodate some special requests (it was my wife's b'day). The rooms are small but nice. Note: I read some reviews about people complaining about an odor on the way from the parking lot to the hotel. It is not bad as they said but I would recommend doing something about it (or maybe it is part of the building because it is an old construction). It is on the 83 bus and the main street, so it is easy to drive around and it is located in a quiet neighborhood (a plus was not to have noisy people like in other hotels).", "title": "Nice hotel in McAllen", "user": "ExploradorMexico", "date": "June 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 163583399}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "It is a beautiful hotel and the handicap room that we requested was very nice with a view of the courtyard.

From the minute we got out of the car, it felt as if we had stepped into paradise.The grounds are simply gorgeous, the sausage trees, flowers and other greenery is breath taking. Walking up to the lobby, takes you through inviting courtyards that offer a very relaxing place to sit and sip a Mimosa or coffee, or cocktail at night. The lobby area is beautiful. There is a reading spot, to cozy up on a loveseat and read a newspaper, or book. They even offer a selection of magazines and books. The bar and it's decor...just perfect! There was no wait to check in, the staff was very helpful and made us feel comfortable and at home. The manager, Matthew Keller, was very gracious and even gave us a tour of the hotel, and told us all about the hotel and it's 95 year history. The room was spacious and inviting. The bedding is so comfortable, didn't want to get up the next morning. The hotel offers turn down service, and leaves chocolates at the bedside. The breakfast buffet offers an assortment of delightful dishes, including pastries, fresh fruit, and the best eggs ever! The lobby also has a pitcher of chilled water that has been infused with fruits, etc. It is very refreshing when coming in from a walk downtown or a day at the pool. (Wish we had remembered to ask for the recipe!!) The pool is beautiful, with lights that change color at night. An awesome view from the balacony of our room. There was construction going on at the hotel, but we did not hear any of it in our room, it did not disrupt us in any way. The hotel offers covered parking, which was is another plus!!!
