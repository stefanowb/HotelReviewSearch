Sophie who speaks excellent English was a great support and we really enjoyed it here but had one grump. The cleaning of the room was very cursory and toilets were left grubby and floors unwashed. Toilet paper at a minimum. The cleaners need a kick up the backside. Which is a real shame, as this was the one big negative. Snacks and drinks are available free all the time and their is a variety of stunning places to sit and enjoy the beautiful architecture.", "title": "Amazing place", "user": "SusannaSofia", "date": "June 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132930351}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We fell in love with Dadi the little dog who was everywhere and loved its tummy tickled.", "title": "Like living in the past but with a mix of the modern!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Patriciaychou", "date": "March 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127007244}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled solo", "text": "Lijiang is absolutely stunning and frankly you would not find anywhere nicer to stay.", "title": "Excellent Courtyard Hotel in Lijiang!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "giovannacl", "date": "November 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120497327}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We booked this accommodation in Lijiang for 4 nights snd totally loved it!
