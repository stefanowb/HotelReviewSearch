Check-in was the longest we had experienced on our entire trip; granted that it was quite a busy time but if the Westin can get us through the door and into our room in under ten minutes how come it took half an hour here? Parking is ridiculous; I can understand that the hotel wants to deter the general public from parking by having a gated lot but why should hotel guests have to pay a surcharge of $10 to park at the hotel? Throughout our stay the barrier was up which nullified the whole point anyway. As another reviewer said here - get rid of the charge or include it in the bill! The room itself was really nice (inspite of our door constantly jamming so it had to be rammed open and shut all the time - sea air?); the i-pod dock was a nice touch. However, the big sell here is the magnificent view (I'd hate to stay here and not have the view!); being able to watch the sun going down over the ocean and falling asleep to the sound of the waves. A degree of romance that evening was recovered after the aforementioned problems and my having been told off in no uncertain terms for swearing loudly at the constantly jamming door!", "title": "A bit over-rated", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "flos", "date": "August 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 19368201, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Views", "disliked": "\u2014 Price/quality ratio"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I'd say that this hotel is in no way a beach resort, it's a Best Western with a fabulous view and at $200 a night (for a beach view) it's a hugely overpriced Best Western.
