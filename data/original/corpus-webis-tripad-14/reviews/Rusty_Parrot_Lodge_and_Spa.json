First of all, i booked an upper room, which was really bascially on the first floor, the lower rooms are basically in the basement. The rooms are comfy but look more similar to an upscale hotel chain, then a luxury lodge. And while we were lucky and had a little patio there were no views for any of the rooms, except streets or parking lot. I had a massage which was nice, but there is no real spa, u have your treatments in various rooms aruond the hotel. The dinner failed in comaprison to the price, it was fine but nothing to write home about. It was a nice hotel, but not as much as a treat as i expected. There are far better places, esp. for the price. PS. the breakfeast was amazing, but the cook was not very friendly to some other guests who made minimal extra requests.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "meptravel", "date": "October 16, 2007", "id": 10085587}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "When you walk in a hotel and they greet you by name and wish you a \"Happy Birthday\", you know you've made the right choice.
