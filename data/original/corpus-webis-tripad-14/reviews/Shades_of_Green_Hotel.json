We did rent a car since unlike the Disney hotels, there isn't a free shuttle; but other than one quick trip to Publix and transportation to and from the airport, it wasn't really necessary. Warning, the parking spaces in the parking garage are very narrow; and if you do drive, request a room on the third floor or above for easy access to your car. We were on the first floor and that is the least convenient floor to access anything other than the pools or restaurants. The Shades of Green buses were prompt, clean and made getting to and from the parks worry free. The schedule for the buses are kept at the bus depot. I mention this because although I received a bus schedule when I checked in, my sister did not, and I stood in the reception line for 15 minutes waiting for a chance to talk to a clerk to get one for her only to be told they were kept by the buses.

It was good, but lacked variety from one day to another, so at the end of the week it got a little boring. The weekend buffet was punched up a bit by adding an omlet station. It cost a little more ($10.95 versus $8.95), but was worth it. My omlet was made to order and very good. We only ate dinner there once, but it was okay. We each ordered a pasta dish and although tasty, they did not drain the pasta well so the sauce was watered down. The prices are very reasonable compared to the parks, and priced comparable to eating off property. We ordered room service once and \"to-go\" once, both were easy and the food was good. The lasagna from the quick service by the bus depot was excellent and highly recommended. Also the homemade ice cream in the ice cream parlor was excellent . We did not get anything from the sports bar by the pool, so I cannot review them, but it should be changing soon anyway. My understanding is when they finish redoing the italian restaurant which was closed when we were there, they will redo the sports bar. All in all, the restaurants are okay, and considering how tired you are when you return from the parks, they are a welcome relief to either driving off property or paying twice the price at the parks.", "title": "Great First Disney Experience!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "GoNavyMichigan", "date": "August 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 39162254}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We had a great stay over Christmas at SOG.

We have not stayed in the Magnolia wing ever since the new wing opened. The rooms are large with 2 queen size beds and couch. There is a table with chairs. There are only 2 chairs, so we had to eat in shifts. Bathroom with 2 sinks and separate toilet and shower. We bought milk and donuts at the store. Room has a refrigerator. We had a balcony room overlooking the gazebo. We even got to watch a wedding. You do not need a rental car, but it does make it easy to run to the parks and stores. The buses run on time but they did not always follow our schedule. We usually drive to EPCOT, Studios and Animal Kingdom. We did use the bus to Downtown Disney, which was great because parking is terrible there. The room was very clean. The whole resort is very clean. The only food we ate there were hot dogs and ice cream from the ice cream parlor. If you are looking for that \"Disney\" feeling while you are there, you will not get it. The first time we stayed there (after staying at Disney resorts 4 times), I missed the Disney feeling. But now that we have stayed so many times, Shades of Green is like home. Everyone is so friendly. Everyone that stays there are special people. Beautiful grounds with lots of paths for walking.

And I could see in the busy season why it would be difficult to take buses. They do fill up quickly in the morning, but we never had a problem. But overall, fantastic. The food at the buffet was good; breakfast was very good; dinner was good to tolerable. But, they didn't charge for the kids and we saved $$$ by not eating at Disney every meal; so we're not complaining. The AAFES store was very convenient; we bought Capri Suns every morning to take with us for the kids. All 3 of the pools were clean. We're definitely going again!", "title": "New management has ruined some of the best parts of the resort", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Laura99", "date": "October 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 47519997}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We have visited the Shades several times in the past 15 years. We have always enjoyed our stay and loved the quiet and the location. The shuttles to the parks are also great. You can also monorail to the Polynesian and walk to the Shades. With this last visit from October 19-22, 2009, we found some very bad changes had been made. We have always enjoyed visiting \"Evergreens\", the sports bar/restaurant by the pool. It was one of the best parts of the resort and was always packed when we visited. The new management has gutted Evergreens, the place only serves hot dogs and PB&J sandwiches and some premade stuff. Just terrible. The Garden buffet was just OK and served the same food every night we were there. We ate at Mangino's, the Italian place and had the strangest experience we ever had in a restaurant. We both ordered pasta and were told that they no longer served any bread with meals. Now, there were plenty of dinner rolls in the Garden buffet, just across the hall. So, I got up and walked over and retrieved some dinner rolls myself. When other diners saw this, they also complained , and the manager obtained rolls for them from the buffet, following my example. We asked to speak to the manager and he refused to speak with us ... and he left the restaurant. Very bad customer service if you ask me. We ordered a take out pizza the next night from Manginos and it was not very good. Avoid this restaurant if you go to the Shades. The rooms were very big and had 2 large beds. We had room 155 near the Mill pool. It was first floor walk out to the pool, and was near the Arcade.We had a fridge but no microwave in our room. The only complaint I have about the rooms is that the shower was very difficult to trun on. You need to pull the handle out from the wall to get the water to come out. We tugged as hard as we could and finally got the thing to work. My husband also requested a humidifier for the room, but the request was ignored and no response was ever made to our request, So come to the Shades and visit the Guest relations office to urge them to restore Evergreens and get rid of this new management.", "title": "Loved the Shades of Green - Will go back soon!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "txshan130", "date": "October 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 46299361}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Absolutely loved the Shades of Green.
