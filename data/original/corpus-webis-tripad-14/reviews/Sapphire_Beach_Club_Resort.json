It was a thrill many years ago to come here; however, in recent years, we have seen a steady decline in the condition of the resort. The only reason we continued to vacation here is the location. This latest visit offered the following: an air conditioner that kept the room just a bit below room temperature and there was a dampness to the entire unit. The bedding is sketchy, especially the bed pillows - mine smelled of sweat. The hot tub worked for the first several days (surprisingly), and then not at all. The kitchen lacked complete sets of everything and we ended up purchasing dishes for the next visitors. Also, the burners on the stove did not work well. There was a huge thunderstorm with high winds that blew pool umbrellas over and a lot of the chairs and small tables in the pool. There was no attempt by resort staff to retrieve them, so my husband and I went down to the pool and did it ourselves. The fitness center has nothing that works. We go elsewhere for exercise. One positive point is the cafe. The food is very good and staff is friendly. Overall, the resort has gone drastically downhill in the last several years. We noticed that there has been some painting done in an effort to improve the appearance, but there is a tremendous amount of maintenance and updating that needs to be done to the entire resort. It will take several years for this to be accomplished. The 'manager' is never around when you need him. Although, if you really want to find him, just go to the bar at happy hour and you can be sure he'll be there hanging out with his friends, oblivious to everything going wrong around him.

Thank god we only stayed one night because it was a last-minute trip and the hotel we wanted wasn't showing availability the first night. When we first arrived, check-in was smooth and as soon as we got in room, there was a knock on door and a maintenance man (who spoke only French and we weren't sure who he even was at first) came in to fix the balcony door. We had just checked in and no one had mentioned he would stop by or that there was a problem. The door wouldn't open. After drilling for 5 minutes, he got it to open and close, but it wouldn't lock. Apparently he needed some parts or something. We said fine, come back tomorrow after we leave (for good). Not really a security issue since no one can access the balcony to get in room. At first, room looked great -- spacious, big bath, updated kitchen, hot tub on balcony. But look closer: 1 bath towel provided for room. Period. No washclothes, hand towels, or any other towels. Just 1 towel. No hot/warm water working in shower or bath sink. Only cold faucet worked. No Kleenex provided at all. The hot tub looked like the water is never changed and it had debris in it and did not even work when pushing the button. Just a tub of dirty water sitting on the balcony. The safe was broken so we had to keep valuables with us. The kitchen looked fairly updated with full-size fridge but we didn't use, so can't comment much. Our room overlooked the pool area, which looked depressing and claustrophobic, as no beach in sight and it felt enclosed. We tried to walk to Cupecoy Beach (outside to left and down dirt road, which just led to water crashing on rocks - no beach). On the plus side, we were able to find parking outside hotel and it's only a short drive to Maho nightlife and Simpson Bay restaurants, etc. But please do yourself a favor and stay in a nicer place. I can't believe Wyndham associates itself with this property as we've had positive Wyndham experiences before.

We only paid $300 for the entire month due to usage of a family member's time share. After 15 hours of travel, we arrive on a late Saturday evening at the resort to check in, and are informed by the bell boy that the elevator is broken and he could not understanding why the hotel clerk placed us on the 3rd floor. I was looking at him, thinking he was going to assist us with our 6 pieces of luggage up the 3 flights of wet/slippery stairs, but the bell boy just shook his head in dismay, continuing to wonder why we are on the 3rd floor. No big deal to us, we carried our own luggage, and are so excited to check out the pad, and relax in the hot tub on the balcony. When we get in the room, the appearance was almost depressing and run down, it just did not look clean at all. But we decided to keep a positive outlook, and unpack. The shower lacked a shower curtain, and there were loose dark brown hairs noted on the floor. The fridge ice maker was broken, and appeared in need of a new filter. Our ice had black specs throughout. Once unpacked, we check out the hot tub which looks disgusting, water feeling slimy. By then, we just wanted to sleep. We crawl into bed, and the sheets kept coming off the bed, there was no fitted sheet, and the pillow cases were too small for the pillow, hence falling off multiple times. Forget it, get some sleep to enjoy the vacation fresh and rested. We woke up the next morning, after tossing and turning, the bed was just not comfortable. We could not even consider attempting to sleep on the pull out couch as it looked like it was from a frat house with stains, it just looked very diseased. One amazing thing and positive thing about our room was the beautiful view of the ocean from our balcony. Every morning and late afternoon, we did get to enjoy the view of the ocean. That was a plus, and the room was adequately cool with an effective AC system. I will have to say that throughout our week stay, it was very difficult to get anyone to answer at the front desk when we tried to call. I had the phone ringing for greater than 10 minutes, and finally went to the front desk to assess the situation and the front desk clerk told me my phone must be broken. I said, no, let's try it now. I called up to our room, asking my husband to call the front desk to test it out. The front desk phone begins to ring, and I asked the clerk if she was going to answer it. So our phone worked fine, but no one would answer when we called. Getting clean towels or fresh bed sheets was a chore in itself. (new sheets were needed due to sand/beach use). Upon getting new sheets, there were some nasty stains on it, so we requested another set, which also had stains. It was very difficult to have any sufficient intimate time with the thought of the condition of your linens. There were grease stains on the door/walls (I only hoped it was from sunscreen and not something else). The safe in the room was broken, and they said no one was available to come fix it until Monday (2 days after check in), so we have to carry around all of our personal items in which we would have locked up (jewelery). We never even assessed the resort, never even made it to the pool, just used the facility as a place to rest, shower, and get our workout in multiple times a day since the elevator was broken. And as we used the stairs multiple times, we got to enjoy trash sitting out on each level, water on the stairs (praying we would not slip), electric cords dangling out (praying we would not get shocked), and to top it off, there was a broken dishwasher on the stairwell. Once you get to your floor via stairwell, you have to figure which door to open (there was 3 total, not of which were labeled), and when you opened the correct door, you were in a dark hallway, with more trash. It was just unbelievable. I would have to say I would never recommend this place to anyone. I was appalled with the facility, only 3 positive things about it were our view from the balcony, the working AC system, and the price. I would have paid double or triple to not have had to experience this place as our hotel stay. I am just blessed to have had my husband to experience it with, we made light of the situation, and are just thankful to have had an opportunity to visit St. Maarten.", "title": "I only wished I had packed my Clorox Disinfectent Wipes on my carryon...", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Anakalika", "date": "November 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 86410586}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel did not meet expectations.

One of our guests had requested an ocean view room but somehow ended up on the other side of the hotel from the rest of us, with a road view where she could only see the ocean in the distance. She was consoled by the fact that instead of a studio she was actually in a suite. But the direct ocean view from our room really was to die for. We also had a view of the pool, and the debris that floated in it for a couple of days. Our private jacuzzi on the balcony was an exciting idea until we saw some leaves, etc. sitting in the bottom of it. However, I will give kudos for the fantastically large bathroom with marble counters, the flat screen TV that could swivel, the retractable divider between the living room and the bed and the well stocked utensils for self-catering. We discovered though that some of the utensils were begging for a good cleaning and others needed to be replaced. We bought a sponge and dishwashing liquid to get the job done - two days before we left these items were suddenly provided by housekeeping. The staff were all friendly, very helpful and promptly responsive to any minor issues or questions we had. The location just a few minutes from the airport was perfect for picking up and dropping off our guests. And watching the planes taking off and landing was fun. The sand blast the planes create on the runway, almost covering Bliss nightclub is a sight to behold! Unfortunately though, we will never stay at Sapphire again - upon returning home, we discovered that besides the $150 hold we authorized at check-in, a day before we checked out another hold, or an attempt to take the money equivalent to the balance that would cover our hotel bill, had been done on our credit card unknown to us. And we paid the entire bill the evening before we checked out! Days later this mysterious double charge was still pending our card and even after numerous calls to Sapphire to get to the bottom of it, no one could explain who had initiated this transaction and the accountant did very little to try to resolve it. We went to a lot of trouble to sort it out on our end instead, through our bank. This was a very frustrating and disappointing experience after our wonderful vacation and wedding.

That should have been our first tip off that things were not the same as they were in the past. They charged us $40 for internet that only worked in the lobby occasionally. Our first room, hot tub was broken (wooden frame falling off and missing in spots) the motor ran every five minutes but no bubbles and would not shut off. The loud noise on and off kept us up all night. We went to make my daughters bed up (sofa bed), thank god it had vinyl mattresses after hearing about bed bugs, anyway there were no sheets. We called the front desk they said, \"yeah, yeah\" and nothing happened, then after more calls we got the sheets but no pillow cases. We called again it is now 10pm our request for pillow cases went unanswered. My husband went down to the lobby. The night manager (the only friendly person in the hotel) had to go to the hotel next door to get us pillow cases. It took another 1/2 hour. At least he tried. We asked for maintenance to fix hot tub. He did come up to look at it after WE tracked him down the next day. He said he had to order a part (I guess that is his answer to all problems). We asked to move to another room. Two nights later we moved. The next room had a working hot tub but the ceiling fan was hanging off the ceiling and made a terrible noise because it was unbalanced and I feared was going to fall down and kill us during the night. My husband shoved a folded up piece of cardboard in the space between the fan and the ceiling to try and quiet the noise. The air conditioner barely worked it put out semi cool air, all be it stinky, but didn't dehumidify (our clothes were damp in the morning). The dishwasher when you opened the door, fell out of the cabinet (the whole dishwasher fell forward). I ended up with an ear infection and after reading about them having poop in the pool in June and the hotel not treating it, now I know why. My husband came home with a lung infection that took a month and two bouts of antibiotics to clear up (probably from the mold in the air conditioner). Other annoyances were, stray cats roaming the parking garage, bad smells everywhere, run down landscaping, there were pop ups on the TV every hour saying that you better pay your cable bill or the cable will be shut off. The pop ups took up the whole screen and lasted at least a minute (the staff said ignore it, hummm, did they pay their bill....not so sure). The staff (except for one night manager, who we said was the captain of a sinking ship) were rude, mean and made it clear that they had no intention of helping us. Of course, they must listen to complaints all day long and they have no power to make things better. What is really bad is that we spend numerous hours when we returned complaining to Wyndham and basically they said that the places are privately owned and that they will report our dissatisfaction to the resort. Ha! They did offer us a $100 voucher for our troubles. That is to stay in another one of their hotels........we will never stay in a Wyndham hotel or resort again. Shame on you Wyndham.....they just sell their name out to who ever and then stand back and say we are not responsible. We love Saint Maarten and have stayed at other resorts on the island but this time we were looking forward to returning to Sapphire beach with the great views and nice amenities. We researched other resorts on the island, but thought since we stayed at Sapphire before that we knew what we were getting into. How wrong we were. The only thing positive about the resort are the incredible views from the rooms high up.

We were also pleasantly surprised at our accomodations in tower three which is the newest of the resort buildings. The rooms did meet the criteria for a four star + rating espiecally compared to other island resorts with the exception of the Royal Islander. The bar was understaffed and the bartender was slow even when there wasn't a crowd. The beach was also non existent during our stay however there is a great beach nearby. The resort also provided a shuttle service to the local casino who also gave out free coupons which made daily visits fun. Day activities at the resort were limited to water excercises and diving instruction. However, the resort arranged a number of low cost buffets and evening activities and entertainment that was a lot of fun.

We had a deluxe room overlooking the pool with an ocean view. The room was nice and large with full kitchen facilities. The a/c and ceiling fans worked great. My only problem was with the Front Desk Staff - they were very nice, but very slow and on island time. It was difficult to get and/or retain their attention and/or cooperation. The Dutch need to realize tourists sustain their travel industry business and employment. The only restaurant on-site was not very good for food and the drinks were just okay. In addition, there is absolutely no beach at this hotel for laying out or relaxing - minimum sand with low tide and lots of rocks. Thus, the hotel name is very deceiving. If you need a taxi for an early morning flight, you must pre-arrange at least 12 to 24 hours in advance - no taxis like a normal hotel. Tony was to arrive at the hotel for me at 5:30 am to take me to the airport; Tony called the hotel at 5:30 am and said he would be there in 10 minutes, yet was actually 20 minutes. The island tour was a great deal at $20. You can sign up at the recreation desk in the lobby. Orient Beach was my favorite area of the entire island. Also, ONLY buy souvenirs at Rima's - all the shops and vendors around town buy them here and you can save money! Example - one necklace in Marigot at a street vendor sold for $12; however, at Rima's you can buy 3 for $5. I would only stay here again (versus the Summit Resort) on my way to/from another island.

I am writing this email to let you know how dissatisfied I was with this property. Staff at check in was friendly enough but that is where it ended. First problem was that we were traveling with relatives and our rooms were as far apart as you could possibly be at this resort. We informed the front desk that we would like to be closer to our relatives so our children could be closer to their Grandparents room. Front desk said they would check on moving us and give us a call......we never heard from the front desk the 1st or 2nd day. I then started checking back with them each day for the first 5 days of our trip with no results......this is understandable except for the front desk not getting back to me as promised. Next thing was the condition of the rooms. The hotub on the balcony did not work, TV Audio on 1 of the TVs was terrible, mirrored closet door was cracked at the bottom and would barely slide, shower had no shower curtain (this was by design but what a mess!!!!)..... there was no way to shower without soaking the bathroom floor and creating a safety hazard on the slick marble floors!!", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 20, 2005", "id": 3687854}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Overall the room and property had considerable deferred maintenance. Last but certainly not least was the checkout problem we had on our last night. We had an early flight the next day and went to the front desk at 3pm to ask about check out procedures for the following morning. We were told that there may not be anyone to check us out at 5am and to come to the front desk before 8pm that evening and they would complete our checkout. We arrived (both my father in law and I who was in a separate room) at the front desk at 7:15pm and were told by a security guard behind the counter that the evening employee had not shown up yet and there was no one who could check us out!!!! We were told they would call us when she arrived. 8pm rolled around and still no call from the front desk so we called down and they told us she had still not arrived. Please remember you can get anywhere on the Island within 45 minutes. To make a long story short, we called and went to the front desk 3-4 more times between 8-10pm (we wanted to go to bed around 10pm because of our early flight)before finally making an International Phone call to Wyndham Customer Relations.
