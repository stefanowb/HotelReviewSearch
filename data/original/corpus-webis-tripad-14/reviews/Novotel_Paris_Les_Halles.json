Rooms are spacious, quiet and clean - it is true what another member said about the hot water (not always warm enough, especially in the morning). You must understand the Novotel system with the beds: There are no twin beds, only one (fairly wide) bed. But the sofa turns into a second bed if you are not used to sharing - do not hesitate to convert it into a bed, it is easy and ready for use. The only complaint I have about this hotel is the breakfast, but they do warn you in the lifts. Have it before 7.30 a.m. if possible - beyond this time, it is a real problem to get a table. Very friendly staff and nice bar with a good bar pianist. While some people may find the area a bit seedy, I like the huge shopping mall adjacent to the hotel and the large number of restaurants.
