When we arrived the room was ready and it included a microwave, kettle, tea, coffee, cakes and munchies. This room (room 203) was the best set out room ever. It had plenty of space, a queen and a single bed, table and chairs, separate toilet, great bathroom with a wonderful sized bath and a huge separate shower, very modern. The beds were comfortable with quilts and plenty of pillows. Perfect for people due to hop on a plane the next day. Very, very clean.The breakfast was extra but was good, choose your own from a cafeteria style set up. Every thing was packed in plastic cups and disposable.
