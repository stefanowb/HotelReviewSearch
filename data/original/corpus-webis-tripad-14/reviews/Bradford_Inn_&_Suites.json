My mother loved being there on the water. She had health concerns (hip replacement - lung problems - visual etc). There was only one handicap parking spot for the whole hotel and it wasn't even adjacent to the hotel. They have improved a little now. I think they had two spots last year. WOW whoopity doo. If you don't come in for the night at 5pm - don't get them! Tough Luck. One summer I called ahead and asked to try and reserve a handicap parking spot for her. They said yes on the phone but when we got there - they said no. It would have been so easy for them to have put an extra Handicap Sign on a Spot for patrons. THEY DON'T CARE. We returned for sentimental reasons. Now that my mother has passed away handicap parking is no longer an issue for me.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 18, 2004", "id": 2458598}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Governor would be proud!!", "text": "We love the view - we have a nice weekend but nice ?

This is great for early birds who want to shower/make coffee, etc. but not wake the other person. We originally reserved a room without a view, but when we arrived we couldn't resist. The view is outstanding! You look to the right and see the Mayflower and look to the left to see the fishing boats and excursion boats. The staff was very friendly and welcoming both when we arrived and when we checked out. They offered suggestions of places to visit and eat. The rate of $76.50 for no view then went to $114 for a direct view. It was worth every penny. A continental breakfast is offered from early a.m. to at least 11.
