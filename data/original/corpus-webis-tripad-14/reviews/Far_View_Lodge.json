The room was a bit rustic and the walls were on the thin side, I didn't hear any voices but coughs and sneezes could be heard. I was careful not to play the radio/cd player very loud but I didn't hear them from the other rooms. Our view was fantastic, topped off by seeing a bull elk the last morning of our stay. The biggest downside of our room was that the refrigerator froze all of our food. I would agree with the other reviews of the Metate room, the service was disorganized and extremely slow, I could only put up with it one night, the thought of going back was too much for me. The food itself wasn't bad. Unfortunately the Metate room was the only food option for dinner because the Far View Terrace had closed early for the season without any explanation that we could find.

That's when we discovered that the phone didn't work. We go back to the front desk where we are told that they are aware that some of the phones in that cluster of rooms don't work. They also acknowledged that the beds are \"mini queens\" - whatever that means. They send a maintenance worker to see about the phone. He arrives very promptly.
