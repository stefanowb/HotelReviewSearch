However it does not lack anything due to this style. the rooms are fairly spacious with good facilities. We had a bath in our room (No35) and very good shower. The shower cubicle is partially int he bedroom (maybe not a good idea if you are the shy type). The area for hanging clothes is very generous and there were bath robes and slippers. Breakfast was fast and good (I assume they took note of the comments which said it was slow). Location couldn't be better as it is on the main shopping street but very quite at night. You do hear the trams early in the morning if your room is at the front but it's not too bad.

The bedrooms are gorgeous (ours was just a standard double) - incredibly comfortable and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was amazing with a huge rainforest shower, a flower mosaic on the walls, and speakers that let you listen to the TV while you are in there! Free Lanvin toiletries and you can borrow DVDs free from reception and watch them in your room. The breakfast was delicious too. The staff are delightful - very polite, friendly and attentive. And all this for about \u00a380 per night - amazing. Definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in - when I think of Sofia I don't think of the city, I think of this hotel!!
