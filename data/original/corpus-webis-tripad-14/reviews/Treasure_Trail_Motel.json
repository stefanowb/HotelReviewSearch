The Treasure Trail Motel afforded me a very reasonably priced home away from home that is centrally located in the city of Kanab to permit walking to restaurants, shops and markets. The room was very nice, clean, comfortable with all the amenities, excellent service and a quiet calm to enjoy sleep after fun filled amazing days of adventure. I had never been to Kanab before, but my choice of stay was the best decision I ever made. Day trips to Zion National Park, the Grand Canyon, Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, Jacob Lake, Lee's Ferry and Lake Powell provided me with more scenic beauty than any where else I have stayed. I enjoyed a four wheel expedition through the canyons and plateaus of the majestic landscape to find wonderful Indian artifacts, beautiful water falls and the opportunity to watch the Condor fly. On another day I played golf (included with the room) on a well maintained and challenging golf course, Coral Cliffs Golf Course. There is so much to see and do, five days was not enough and therefore I am planning several trips to the area I call, \" A Taste of Heaven\".", "title": "Kanab, A Taste of Heaven on Earth!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "augusta4golf", "date": "April 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 104639767}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled solo", "text": "Recently I had the priveledge of staying at the Treasure Trail Motel in Kanab, Utah.

When I booked the room I told the person on the phone I had pets, but apparently the $5 an hour girl who messed up is more important than a customer.
