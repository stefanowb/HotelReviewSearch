The bathroom was dirty and not very well maintained. We did have a nice view of the harbor and the staff was very nice.

Four of us stayed in a triple room with a rollaway bed for 85 euro, full buffet breakfast included. Parking is available in a gated lot under the hotel (I think it's 7 euro/night--they forgot to charge us). The room was comfortable and clean, and the staff was friendly. The location makes it a great place to stay if you're day-tripping to Morocco: it's a straight line from the dock to the front door of the hotel, so you don't have to lug your handmade rugs and souvenirs very far!", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 23, 2004", "id": 1737377}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled solo", "text": "After traveling all day from Madrid, I arrived in Algeciras at about 11PM local. I browsed over my Forbes travel book before getting off of the train and discovered that Al-Mar seemed to be about a 4 or 5 block hike from the train station. The locals were very helpful and explained the simple walk. Although I did it, I would not advise walking alone at night from the station to the hotel as it was a bit shady. Upon entering the hotel I asked if a room was available. To my surprise there was one available with a soft bed, a hot shower, and a plentiful breakfast buffet in the morning. The rooms were clean, the staff spoke English, and the price was very reasonable (55 or 60 Euro)! The ports for ferries to Morocco are just outside the hotel (visible and a 5 minute walk). The buffet is served on the top floor offering a spectacular morning view of the ports and the Mediterranean Sea! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to or from Algeciras. I liked it so much that I stayed there a week later upon my return to Europe after traveling trough Morocco.
