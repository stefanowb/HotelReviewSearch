I spent ages online trying to find a booking website - I eventually found one and submitted my reservation, but I never heard anything back, despite sending 2 chaser emails afterwards. I was still undeterred, so when we got to Ireland I tried again, I finally got an answer to the phone but the man was incredibly unhelpful, asking me a string of personal questions about who I am and where I was coming from before finally telling me they didn't have a room - all of which was quite aggravating when making international calls from my mobile.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "n0tagain", "date": "July 8, 2007", "id": 8075857}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "I never saw the place and I know several people have written glowingly about it, but I wouldn't want anyone else to waste so much time on such an unprofessional outfit.
