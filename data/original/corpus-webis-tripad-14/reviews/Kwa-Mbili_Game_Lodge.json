The highlight of our trip was our stay at Kwa 'mbili. It is a really special place run by people who clearly love Africa and its natural history. We were treated to respectful close-up game viewing of all the large game animals, but in addition, we were shown the small creatures of the bush country (that could have been easily overlooked) by highly knowledgeable and competent guides. Although there were chalets available, we wanted to experience Africa in a safari tent. Ours was beautifully furnished and exactly what we hoped for. The staff was outstanding and the owner and his wife were attentive to every need. He is an enthusiastic birder who was eager to share his knowledge; she arranged for, and accompanied us on interesting side-trips. Our menu included samples of typical 'bush' food that we did not get anywhere else. Although it was considerably less expensive than those advertizing as \"luxury game lodges\", I can't help but think that we had a far better experience than if we had paid three times as much money.

This means good sightings, either while out on game drive or on foot during bush walks. KwaMbili means \"Place of Two\" in the local Shangaan language.Our knowledgeable rangers will introduce you to the tracks, movements, sights and sounds which give you a window into the secrets of the African bush. Back at the lodge, view wildlife from the safety and comfort of our well-positioned hide. If all this calls for time to just let the experience sink in ... take a dip in the swimming pool, just relax in an armchair or enjoy a cool drink at the bar."}
