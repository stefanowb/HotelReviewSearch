This is a large block of apartments on the seafront in Playa de Palma. They are very run down and much in need of modernisation. We were there for five nights and not once was the apartment cleaned. The apartment was filthy and infested with fleas which bit us from head to toe. It was a nightmare. Guests are expected to take their rubbish to a wheely bin on the landing. No problem, except in the fact that they were left for days on end overflowing and obviously attracting all kind of wildlife. Noise echoes down the corridors and between the balconies and it can be so loud that it feels as if your neighbours are in the room with you. People were out on the balconies making noise until the early hours of the morning or coming in at unearthly times (5.30 a.m ) and shouting down to their friends on other floors. It is true that the position of the block is good, there are good views and the reception staff are polite/pleasant BUT this does not make up for the fact that you will be staying in squalid, unhygenic surroundings. Avoid at all costs. I am still itching just thinking about it and would suggest that if you have booked already, I would advise that you seriously consider cancelling. We really like this resort and have been several times.
