The entire establishment is beautiful, filled with friendly staff and had us oohing and ahhing from the minute we arrived to the moment we left. We stayed on the 11th floor and had unobstructed views of the ocean and resort below. Our room was spacious with 2 queen size beds, a large balcony, flat screen TV with Foxtel and in-house new release movies, a large marble bathroom with huge tub separate toilet and a shower big enough for the two of us! The room rate included a full buffet breakfast each and we couldn't believe what was on offer when we arrived at the restaurant each morning. Bacon, eggs (cooked to your liking), sausages, hash browns, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, spaghetti, baked beans, toast, pancakes, fruit, cereals, yoghurts, the list goes on! The hotel pool was olympic size and one of many pools on the island that we enjoyed taking a refreshing dip in. The main resort pool is enormous and has an island bar that serves delicious cocktails during happy hour each day. We hired a buggy during our stay and had fun cruising around taking in the sights, snapping photos and stopping to admire the amazing views. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from including one on the ground floor of the Reef View Hotel but The Steakhouse and Italian Restaurant on the Marina get a big thumbs up from us. Both served delicious food that left us wanting more and tasted as good as the water views surrounding them! We ordered room service from the Reef View Hotel late one evening (around 11pm) and our order was delivered within 10 minutes and tasted great. The staff were friendly and helpful, which made check-in/check-out quick and easy.
