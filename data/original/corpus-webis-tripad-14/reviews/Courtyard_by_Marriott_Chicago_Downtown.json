Overall easy check in process, polite hotel staff, requested highest floor available and was able to get 22, out of a possible 24 or 25. Clean lobby, pretty good doormen and good housekeeping. The room was a general updated Marriott hotel room, about the only thing not really updated was the tv, but it was still fine. If there still was some outside construction going on at the hotel, certainly couldn't tell or hear, so I'll just assume that's done. Location was good, one block from Michigan Ave, few blocks from Millenium Park and Navy Pier, and about 3 blocks from the Grand EL station.

We stayed here for a day but everytime we had interaction with any staff the outcome was perfect. There is a starbucks on site, as well as state stree bread co. Had food from state street and it was pretty good.The room was spacious , and clean . The beds were heaven. We were on the 6th floor, same as the pool , hot tub and health room. There was also a sauna but it was out of order. I did not notice the chlorine smell other reviewers noticed. Also when you came off the elevator it smelled like new carpet, and the carpet looked new so I am assuming the hotel was renovated recently , or at least the carpets. Business center was sufficient but SMALL.

The price flucuates with what events are happening in town. The strong point of this hotel is the staff particularly the bellhops who are very knowledgeable about tourist attractions, restaurants, etc. Also the location is good when connecting to buses & trains. The hotel has a Starbucks off the lobby. There are several good restaurants within walking distance. We found a Greek deli bar (one block N on State St) with a great $5 breakfast. Shopping is also close by on Michigan Ave & State St. Rooms are small but with a nice decor. I asked for a new shower curtain liner & got it immediately.
