I chose monkfish one night as it is something I had never chosen before - unfortunatelt it came smothered in an overpowering garlic sauce and I still don't know what monkfish tates like - it could have been anything. if it had mentioned that sauce on the menu I wouldn't have chosen it. That aside, we ate there 2 nights and every other meal was really good and no complaints with that. However, the wine was extremely expensive i.e \u00a34.50 for a quarter bottle of wine!!!", "user": "CHRISTINED563", "date": "May 9, 2013", "id": 160133694}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited June 2013", "text": "ate here each evening during recent 4 night stay in Jersey.", "title": "wonderful food and service", "user": "colant", "date": "June 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 165070387}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Food", "text": "Food excellant quality, portion sizes rather large so certainly never left feeling hungry.", "user": "Christabelle176", "date": "June 24, 2013", "id": 165040992}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent food", "text": "Service always perfect, happy, smiling staff.", "user": "Kerry S", "date": "May 30, 2013", "id": 162454638}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lovely little Italian", "text": "Reasonably priced, quality food, try the scallop starter and steak!", "user": "ExploringGlory", "date": "May 30, 2013", "id": 162404558}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited May 2013", "text": "A good menu with good service. food always of good quality.
