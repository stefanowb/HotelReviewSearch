The only complaint about the property is that the pool is across the street and the pool area lacked amenities (towel service, snack bar) though that may be temporary, as the poolside restaurant was closed for renovations. The beach area and plantation gardens are postcards in the making...all beautiful. Staff were friendly & responsive.

The unit we were in was updated and nice. Be prepared to be serenaded by the roosters that begin crowing at around 3:45 am! Also, next time I would like to be a little more towards the center of the complex and away from the noise of the road. I was also worried about not having air conditioning but with the ceiling fans and the plantation windows it was never a problem.

This was not important to my family, but turned out to be really nice, with great island gelato and sorbet, decent convenient market not much more expensive then the bigger markets in Koloa, and good restaurants. Keoiki's Paradise has good fish and live entertainment, although you get some noise from this in the units close to the road. But nothing really late at night.

Nice place to read and relax, can bring snacks/drinks, which a lot of people did. The condo itself was unexpectedly spacious, separate bedroom with big, slightly soft bed. Bathroom had good shower, separate vanity area. Big living/dining area with older rattan-type furniture. Nice big lanai overlooking garden in our case. And full kitchen, so we bought snacks and drinks for our stay. Maid service once every 4 days or so, which we liked. Can request towels if needed before that. Our unit was on 3rd floor and back by main road, farthest from beach. Can walk to Poipu shopping mall with Starbucks, etc. Short drive to Joe's on the Green, a beautiful place to breakfast - try the early bird special! Short drive to Kukui' ula mall, a newer place with nice shops and restaurants. Try happy hour at Tortilla Republic, one of the better bargains on the island.
