During my stay, I ran into a few minor problems and needed assistance from the staff. They were all pleasant, but did not go the extra mile and were not proactive. I got the impression that they didn't really care and just wanted me to go away. Receiving mediocre service during travel complications is extremely frustrating. Also, I do not own a laptop and was unpleasantly surprised to find that the hotel does not offer free Internet computers. They have a small business center that does not operate 24-hours a day and charges over 5$ per 10-minute session. Other hotels in the area offer free, 24-hour Internet access. Dining options were also a let down at Casamagna. On my first night, I arrived late and ended up spending over 30USD for an unmemorable sandwich, soft drink, and small dessert from room service. I like having ice in the room and got really tired of having to walk to the bar every day because the ice machine was out of order for the entire week. Before leaving I needed help contacting a taxi service to get to the airport, so I approached the concierge. After a huge hassle and many failed calls, I asked the staff if the hotel offers transfers. It was frustrating to find out that they do offer them and they could have saved me a huge hassle by just mentioning this in the first place. Again, the service at this property is sub par and bordered on passive aggressive.

You obviously think you are mistaken. The next day, you get the menu and the value of beer is 60 pesos. You call the bar manager and explain what happened. He just say: what can I do for you? How about excuse us? Reports to the general manager of the hotel in writing all the names of employees and you even get an apologize for reporting a problem.
