Everything worked well. The staff was generally courteous and helpful especially the front desk staff and the room attendants. If I have to find fault, the breakfast staff probably need to smile a little bit more - almost all of them looked aloof and long faced throughout my stay. I used the gym once and found it to be well equipped. My room was quiet. I didn't eat in the restaurants except breakfast. I arrived at midnight and had to order room service. Because of the 24 euro which I paid for a sandwich - a very high price for a sandwich anywhere - I had decided to eat out for the rest of my stay. There was a Chinese restaurant one street away that charged 7.50 euro for a good spread of buffet lunch and dinner. Next door to the restaurant was a gourmet hamburger bar that also served other western dishes at very reasonable price. There was also a shopping complex with a supermarket close by.", "title": "A real 5 stars hotel at a reasonable price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "engam", "date": "July 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 70221430}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Location wise, the hotel was close to 2 Metro underground stations, and was handy to anywhere.", "title": "Very Nice Property", "user": "bobecus", "date": "July 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 70036479}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I will definitely come back again.", "title": "Worth of money", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jorch67", "date": "June 26, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 68773274}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Real Palacio is a 5 Star Hotel is Lisbon - and was worth every Euro.

Of particular note is the excellent service provided by the front desk staff. They were willing to take the time and show us good locations with a map, describe in perfect detail how to get there and what to see. In particular we were advised to go to a particular restaurant in Belem which was just incredible - Pasteis de Belem. All spoke excellent English. Breakfast included the standard American style buffet and European style breakfast - all very good. Internet service was very fast and always available at their business center (no extra charge).
