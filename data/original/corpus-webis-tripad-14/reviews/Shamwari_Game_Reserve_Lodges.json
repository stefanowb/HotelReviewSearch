Dave, our ranger, was extremely polite, and knowledgeable. He really made the experience special. We saw the big 4, didn't manage to see black rhino, but caught the white. We were up close and personal with lions, elephants, leopards, and so many more. Dave also personally woke each of his guests up with a phone call every morning to make sure you are up in time for breakfast, a very nice touch. He also dined with my father and I, along with the other 2 guests we shared the drives with, at breakfast and dinner. It was lovely to sit around and talk about what you had seen that day, and Dave could share his experiences from the past with us. You are fed 4 times a day, and the food is exquisite, probably too much based on my waistline once I left. Nothing is too much hassle for the friendly and attentive staff. The surroundings are amazing, especially the BBQ in the bush.
