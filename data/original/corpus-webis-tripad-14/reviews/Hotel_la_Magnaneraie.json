Parking is free and easy to use. Decor is very nice and suits the old building well. I would not eat dinner in the restaurant. The Maitre D is a bit snooty and recommended an awful wine. The food was not good. Go down the street to Le Prieure, which is expensive, but super for dinner. Breakfast was good.

Also, this hotel isn't in the town center of Villeneuve, but about a 10 minute walk from it. It's an easy walk, and Villeneuve is quiet and charming but for those who may have a hard time walking, it's not the best location. My husband and I had a car, but found it much easier to walk for dinner---parking downtown was hard in Villeneuve and even harder for Avignon. There is a GREAT garden-style, family-owned restaurant on the way to the Villeneuve town center from the hotel, and Villeneuve itself charming and quaint. La Magnaneraie is a very pretty hotel, but it was expensive considering the location and the fact that the room is well-appointed but not spectacular. The staff was relatively friendly, but quick to push their restaurant rather than offering options elsewhere.", "title": "Very nice hotel, but too expensive for what you get", "user": "travelnowandalways", "date": "July 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35073669}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009", "text": "This hotel was incredible.
