There \u2018s no swimming pool and the only restaurant serves either a fixed menu or buffet. But when you\u2019re completing your checklist of worldwide wildlife, Sepilok Nature Resort really is a luxurious place when you compare it to for example the lodging in some destinations in Africa or Latin America. Though the air-conditioned cottages lack a writing desk \u2013 which in my opinion is more a necessity than the television (who needs TV here?) \u2013 they do have a coffee/tea maker, a ceiling fan, large beds, a veranda and a safety locker. However, don\u2019t expect everything to be perfect. In our cottage (where we stayed early May for 2 nights), some of the former occupants thought to be funny to close the safety locker before leaving. When we reported this at the reception, they immediately sent a mechanic to fix this. And yes, with our own eyes we saw how safe a safety locker with a 4-digit code was. The man had absolutely no problem in opening it with his master key but as it wasn\u2019t possible to enter 4 new digits, we still couldn\u2019t use it. Moral of the story: don\u2019t think the locker in your room is absolutely secure! It\u2019s not safer than entrusting your valuables to the receptionist! Anyway, you would be extremely unfortunate to be robbed here, so it\u2019s safe \u2013 though a bit uncomfortable \u2013 to carry your money and passports on your body while you\u2019re going to see the orang-utans. Perhaps you may also become interested to join the night walk. We didn\u2019t, as we thought it to be extremely expensive. While you may well expect to see interesting species, if your itinerary includes places such as Sukau and Kinabatangan River, Tabin Wildlife Reserve or Danum Valley, it\u2019s probably better to save your money as a guided night walk in any of these places is much, much cheaper \u2013 and probably even better. Regarding the birds on the lodge premises, we cannot say avifauna was particularly abundant \u2013 but it\u2019s likely you can spot here several spectacular species such as pied hornbill, stork-billed kingfisher and black-and-red broadbill.", "title": "Someone in charge is taking the...", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "octopusmessiah", "date": "June 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 67826307}], "location": {"country": "Malaysia", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 32, "very good": 76, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 53}, "aka": "Sepilok Nature Hotel", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "Hidden amongst a veritable treasure trove of tropical plants and grasses, hug trees and spectacular orchids in bloom, the quaint bungalows of the Sepilok Nature Resort are within walking distance of the world-famous Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, precious home of the last wild Orang Utans of Northern Borneo.
