The room was very large, with separate bedroom and sitting rooms. I did not have a problem with any noise, but regarding the prior reviewer who experienced the noisy wedding reception- my room was directly across from one of the conference rooms. While I was getting settled in my room, music was playing on the conference room sound system and I was ready to complain and request to be moved because I could clearly hear it in my room which would drive me nuts. However, the music was turned off within a few minutes before I could complain and I had no further problem. But it seems clear that if your room is near a conference room, there could be an unfortunate noise problem. Enjoyed the pool, didn't have a whole lot of interaction with the staff. The hotel is located in an office park area, so there is no place nearby (shops, restaurants, etc.) to walk to. The location was fine for me because of the conference- but I would not likely stay here otherwise because it is not really near anything except office buildings.", "title": "Large room size was great", "user": "hmmsbrown", "date": "December 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 51825961}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel room I had was right next to the stairway and was very quiet.

This hotel was a bit isolated in an office park, but decent by most standards of the chain. We had snacks and a few beers at the bar, so I cant really comment on the food. There were lots of people in the bar area eating and I didnt see any leftovers. The staff was cheerful at the bar and the front desk. Breakfast was cooked to order and good, but the coffee was tepid - from the urn, the waitress and a supposedly fresh brewed pot.

Quite area. The restaurant is an embarassment to the Hilton name. If the restaurant was a stand alone business serving this food, the doors would have been closed long ago. They charge prices that are on par with fine restaurants, but serve food reminiscent of a snack bar. A whopper from Burger King has 10 times the taste and flavor of their $11 burger. Wilted lettuce filled the salad. $10 for a glass of wine!!!! Overcooked and mushy vegetables. Pasta sauce was tasteless, canned variety. I didn'expect much until I saw the prices, then thought to myself that you can't get away with charging those prices unless the food is decent, WRONG. Steer clear of the Wild Goose!
