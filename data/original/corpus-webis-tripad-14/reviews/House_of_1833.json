The House of 1833 was truly awesome, even in the midst of winter! The house is a huge Greek Revival Mansion. Evan and Robert must have been collecting furniture and knick-knacks for years as they furnished it in less than a month. It won't be to everyone's taste but is is so completely over the top that it is wonderful to behold.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Charmingbubble2", "date": "April 1, 2006", "id": 4826848}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect getaway", "text": "Our bed was very comfortable and the bath was the best I had during our whole holiday.

I have a terrible time with directions and they are extremely gracious about my shortcomings (maybe next time I won't get lost!). The breakfasts are yummy and huge and made while you wait. It is also enjoyable chatting with them in the kitchen. If you sleep a bit late (like I do), breakfast will still be made. I'd tell you the room we stayed in, but....they are all fabulous so I'll keep mine a secret!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "lip89", "date": "May 15, 2004", "id": 2061856}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Mystic"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 14, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 82}, "aka": "House Of 1833 Hotel Mystic", "slim_ranking": 0.0769230769231, "description": "The House of 1833 is A Greek Revival Mansion & National Landmark on 3 acres of gardens and fountains featuring a seasonal full-size swimming pool & including a full New England country-gourmet candlelight breakfast; all guest suites feature full private bath, working wood-burning fireplaces, air conditioning, cable, am/fm CD players, 19th c. antique furnishings...four of the suites with over-sized jacuzzi hot tubs and HD flat panel TV, two with private garden porches."}
