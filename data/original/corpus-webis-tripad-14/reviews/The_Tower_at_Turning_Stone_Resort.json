My husband liked the conference rooms and was impressed with attention to room temp, etc. Meals were good, as well. We had dinner together at the Brazilian restaurant. Food was good there as well. I enjoyed the pool, shopping and the sweets and coffee at Opal's. I tried to gamble, but I am a hopeless...I just don't have the attention span. The other reviews are spot on with the smoking. Whether you are in the non-smoking section, or the smoking section, there really isn't much difference. I could only stand it for an hour and then I found other things to do.

This place pretends to be high-end but is not even close. The room was nicely done but there were way too many negatives, especially given the price. The lobby, common areas and restaurants stink from smoke and you must rush to the elevator to avoid this.There is nowhere you can go in the hotel besides your room if you don't want to smell smoke. Water pressure was terrible in our rooms including toilet and shower and we were told there was nothing they could do about it, something with the pump. Light bulb was burned out in bathroom. Maid service was totally unacceptable- room had not been made up all day and when we called and said we would be leaving again in 20 minutes they came and tried to clean while we were still there getting ready. The pool and gym require a $10 fee per use. They call it a resort but there is nothing to do if you don't gamble or play golf. The staff outside the hotel are so busy trying to take your car to valet that they didn't listen if we were trying to drop someone off or pick up. Overly pushy and annoying.

We love the resort- especially the Towers. The rooms are very modern and trendy- very clean. The bathrooms are beautiful and spa-like. Huge showers with great water pressure! We're always pleased with our rooms. Take advantage of the spa services at the hotel...they are wonderful. The \"Total Relaxation Therapy\" massage is the best! The golfing is excellent- definitely the best in the area. Our favorite restaurants are Peach Blossom and Rodizio. They serve Starbucks coffee in the hotel too- added bonus! The lobby is very inviting and warm with a huge fireplace. Make sure to grab a canoli before you leave- they are fresh every day! The gambling is good...though the minimums at tables on weekends could be better. Turning Stone usually brings in really good concerts and shows so we enjoy coming back time and time again. The night club Lava is very nice - there is a dress code. The grounds are kept immaculate.

Very odd that there were no outlets to plug computer into on desk, others said they had a lamp with outlet but this wasn't the case in our room.
