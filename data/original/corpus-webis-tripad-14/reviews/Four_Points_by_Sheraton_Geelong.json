{"user_rating": 3.5, "review_count": 231, "name": "Four Points by Sheraton Geelong", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best Geelong hotel -- by far", "text": "Over the last twelve months I have stayed in the Four Points by Sheraton Geelong on ten occasions, most recently on 9th. August 2005. It is a classy hotel, by far the best in Geelong. Its prominent position on the Geelong foreshore provides great views from its restaurant and many of its guest rooms, particularly from the higher of its seven floors. Corio Bay is literally across the road, where there are many recreational facilities and lovely walks. The Geelong CBD is only two blocks away and at the rear of the hotel is an entrance to one of Geelong's major shopping complexes. The reception desk is sometimes busy, as the hotel is the venue for many conferences and meetings, but check-in and check-out waits are usually short. Staff at the front desk are efficient and pleasant. Concierge car parking is the norm, and is best used. Voracious parking meters line the roadways on all sides of the hotel and allow only 3 hours parking. They operate from 8.00am until 8.00pm and chancing your luck with the parking inspectors is not a wise move. Rooms are small but adequate, with balconies. Guest rooms are always well appointed and presented, and are available as singles, doubles or twins. Bedding is excellent and a choice of pillows is available. Very effective air conditioning with individual controls is fitted in each room. Each room has internet facilities for guests' laptops or through the TV. A number of excellent and well regarded local restaurants are within easy walking distance of the hotel, but its own Waterfront Restaurant should not be overlooked. It serves distinctive, well cooked meals. Its waiting staff are well trained, and always pleasant. This same restaurant is used for the hotel's buffet breakfast, serving any number of juices, cereals, fruits or cooked meals. Cooks will prepare special cooked meals on request. My one grumble about breakfast is the \"stewed\" coffee, which always tastes stale and is sometimes not hot enough. It is freshly prepared but is then stored in metal urns, altering taste and temperature.", "user": "wasamaid", "date": "August 10, 2005", "id": 3752835}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Superb", "text": "But under the Sheraton banner the Four Points Geelong is an excellent hotel, in terms of service, facilities and location.", "user": "aliandmark", "date": "April 29, 2005", "id": 3425376}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My partner and i stayed here on xmas eve for one night under their summer package deal.", "title": "Bad experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "qprjames", "date": "December 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 11971298}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Upon check-in i was not greeted by any kind of 'valet-parking' service. instead i just had to leave the keys at reception, whilst leaving the car on the forecourt.
