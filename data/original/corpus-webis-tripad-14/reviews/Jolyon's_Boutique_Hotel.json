We had a second floor room overlooking the Roald Dahl Plas and Millenium Centre. It also helped having the best weather for years during our stay! The room was fine, though the shower over bath sprayed over onto floor as no shower screen. I don't think it's really a boutique hotel but I didn't book it because it professed to be. Only minor gripes - pedal bin in room didn't work, old fashioned tv (they should've had a small flat screen at least for the price, although I don't tend to watch much tv on holiday), bar area very understaffed - the staff were great but the owner should look at providing additional staff at busy times to help the others out. Breakfast was good although it was served in the bar area but they obviously had limited space for a separate breakfast area. Nice beer garden area.

It seems there is no parking there, the gallery pictures on the website do not reflect the hotel itself and in all honesty neither do the reviews taking this into account.

Upon arrival we were shown to our room and given some bottled water and some freshly based Welsh Cakes (yummy). The room was very clean and tidy and again the view is great from the window. Bathroom is well decorated and the bath finishes it off. Only downside is that the bathroom has a massive window, which is great for makeup etc, but you have to keep the blind down as otherwise everybody outside can see in.... including being seen on the loo !! One slight criticism I would add is that the rooms really could do with updated LCD TV's - I found trying to get the tv to work impossible until we turned it on left it with a fuzzy screen and took the door key card out of the socket and put it back in ...and magic it worked...little tip for those struggling like I did. Maybe there is method in their maddess not to update them into the 21st Century in fear of would be rock stars wanting to throw them out the window....cos nobody will have the strength to lift it off and 'chuck it' out the window !!!

When the taxi driver dropped me off at the hotel I honestly thought he'd taken me to the wrong place, he hadn't it just doesn't look like the photos on the website. Great location right opposite the millenium stadium and a short walk from some nice bars, restaurants and a few shops. We (7 ladies of 30 something age) weren't there for a quiet peaceful weekend, but beware if you stay here, which i would again just don't stay on the back of the building, i was in room 4 and friends were in room 1 and both were very noisy about 7am - 8.30 with one of the pubs at the back emptying there bottles into the bins, not a fault of the hotels but doesn't make you want to stay there. Maybe the hotel needs triple glazing or needs to ask the pub to wait until a more reasonable time to do this? The rooms and the hotel/b&b was very clean, very well presented and the beds were very very comfy with good bedding etc. There was a few little niggles which i would've expected a boutique hotel to have done something about, i.e. 2 spotlights in bathroom had gone, there was black mould in the grout on the sink behind the taps, the lovely big window in the bathroom looked over a busy street and beer garden where anybody sat out there would see you on toilet unless you pulled down the roller blind, would be better if they put a frosting on the glass particularly the lower part of the window at least. And lastly the lovely curtains in the bedroom had water stains up the bottom of the curtains, looked unsightly and cheapened the hotel. I cannot fault the service, the staff were friendly and the breakfast was good, although i think the sausages were under cooked. Apart from those little points which need improving, the pub downstairs could do with a bit of tlc and the drains stuck particularly by the mens toilets, also the beer garden was a bit tatty and i feel cheapens the hotel a little, a bit of tarting up to get to the same standard as the inside of the hotel and this would be a fantastic place.

It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but we fell in love with it. Jolyons is just over the way from the Cardiff Millenium Centre, and ideal if you want to see a show there. The hotel only has six rooms so it's quite difficult to book at short notice, and it's popular. It's kind of an old Cardiff townhouse, with a really lovely pub in the basement. It's interesting that when a hotel gets it right, you don't mind if they don't always get it perfect. I ordered a salad from the bar, and they came out and told me they'd run out of salad. So I asked for a few olives and some bread, and they came out and said - sorry we've run out of bread. So they brought a huge breakfast bowl of olives to make up for it! As if I could have eaten all that. But the thing is I felt very happy there, very relaxed, and the staff are all friendly and really want to help you. The bar has outside seating, where we sat, but inside it's very small, terrific atmosphere, very crowded. It has a stone pizza oven, with an open fire, and so that's what they serve, and very delicious the pizzas are too. My one niggle is that they don't do Gwynt y ddraig Welsh Cider, but you can't have everything. There is a large squashy old leather corner sofa, a popcorn machine, wooden tables and incongruous decor, but it achieves naturally what so many pubs strive to achieve with fakery, and fail. Upstairs, our room had a large wooden kingsize bed, with very old looking furniture. Apparently it used to be a seamans lodge, and still has some of the original furniture - some of which might have been in our room. Having spent all my school holidays in Cardiff, I would say it was furnished just like my grandmothers house! The bed must have had a very expensive mattress, and I slept like a log despite outside noise. This hotel is not quiet, due to the nightlife in Cardiff Bay, but it is so relaxing. You can be yourself here, it's fun, you can dress up or down, you can laugh out loud and just enjoy yourself. The bathroom was lovely - large, with a hugh basin, a bidet, lovely towells, super toiletries. And, a gorgeous jacuzzi bath - our first experience of one! The shower fitting on the taps had mold on it, so I can't give 5 stars for cleanliness, but everything else was very clean. I would say there is no attempt by Jolyons to seem posh, or have the best decor, matching furnishings or anything like that, but they want guests to enjoy themselves here. The little lollipops that turn up everywhere seems to say that. Breakfast was one of the best I've ever had. They keep loading you up with toast and coffee, and the full Welsh breakfast was superbly cooked. It really was Welsh too, with lovely bacon and sausage. We asked where they got their meat from, and they told us it was all local, and mainley comes from Cardiff Market. We actually went there after, so we could bring home some sausages and bacon! When we want to go to another show at the Millenium Centre, we are coming to Jolyons.
