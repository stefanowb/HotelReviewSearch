The room was more than enough, and the small table with kitchenette was perfect for our small breakfast of breads and coffee. They were more than accomodating. We asked advice on everything from how to find the Eiffle Tower to where to get the best bread, wine and cheese and always were pleased with the results. We even had a little balcony with a small table and chairs and had a wonderful view as we wereon the top floor. The staff made sure we were comfortable and our needs were taken care of. We even forgot a cold pack, special butter and an insulated bag when we left to continue our vacation of Europe. We called two days later and ased if it was still there. It was.
