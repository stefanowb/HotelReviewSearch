The tram to the Haputbahnhoff was easy from the hotel and not too expensize with a weekly open pass.

First we were given keys to an uncleaned room. Once they gave us the correct room, we had to ask for extra pillows, then bathrobes, then internet access - all of which were to be included. Flooring wasn't nice, had molded areas. Although the room was to have coffee service, sadly it didn't have a coffee maker but a hot pot with granulated coffee, 2 each decaf and regular. Front desk staff raved that everything in the mini bar was included, that was two bottles of water and soda. Rain shower was a nice touch, but it dripped and was noisy. Sink not user friendly, stainless steel and at such an angle that it splashed you. They say it's 800 m from train station, that is underestimated, it's quite a walk.
