There was also some shooting for a new Will Smith flick taking place practically outside the lobby. That was fun. The wireless worked ok on the fourth floor which allowed this geek to keep in touch. We never visited the in-house restaurant or bar so we can\u2019t comment on it but they looked quite nice. Overall, our stay was very nice.

The building is very emblematic, first having been the residence of the Welsh writer, Dylan Thomas and later, the headquarters of the New York Pharmacists Club. The Eurostars Dylan Hotel combines the classical lounges and guest rooms of the period with ambiances and areas in contemporary design. We are a non-stop hotel, because the Big Apple never stops. For this reason, the gym and the Business Centre are open 24 hours a day."}
