The location is good. Close to downtown Monterey, Fisherman's wharf etc. The grounds & pool area were nice. Lots of beautiful flowers and tasteful touches. The bed was VERY comfortable.

First, the room we had was TINY. I would expect more room for the price. The setup of the hotel is much more \"motel\" than \"hotel\" - as there are all external walkways with the doors & windows facing out onto the walkways and parking areas. This setup caused us to have very restless nights because of the noise! The hotel doesn't have air conditioning, which would generally not matter in cool Monterey, but because of this, we had to keep our windows open all night long - and it was LOUD! People arriving to the hotel at all hours talking and laughing and slamming car doors. People standing right in front of our open windows talking loudly. It was miserable. Also, the parking situation is very difficult if you have an extra large vehicle - so beware.", "user": "llfitz", "date": "September 5, 2007", "id": 8660666}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not three and one-half stars!", "text": "For the price - I would recommend finding another place to stay.", "user": "RMS3", "date": "August 28, 2007", "id": 8523084}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Ignored by incompetent staff, noisy, crowded, constuction", "text": "My husband and I stayed here over Labor Day weekend. I booked through Priceline we paid $147 per night. After reading some of the reviews about the construction I was a little nervous so I called the motel and asked some questions. They assured me the construction was contained toward the lobby where they are remodeling the lounge. The staff was very friendly, we were upgraded to a room with a king bed at no charge. We stayed in room 523, upstairs toward the back in one of the newer buildings. Our room was nice, very clean and the bed & bedding was incredible. Yes, the room is small so it may not be the best for a family but it was just my husband & I so we didn't need much room, comfort and cleanliness is more important to us. If you are looking for a place to stay with a beach view this is not the right place. The Casa Munras is located on Munras Ave. where there is a string of 2 star motel chains, the comfort of this room I found to be far superior to those chains and we paid less than what those chains were asking for a holiday weekend. Amenities were nice, pool area was clean, starbucks coffee in the room was a plus. I would reccommend this motel to friends.

The walls are so thin you can hear everything! I was on a downstairs room and you can hear every footstep coming down the walkway and stairs. The rooms are very small and no AC.
