While I got an excellent rate through Priceline, I had the most terrible night I have ever had in a hotel. The hotel apparently has very poor sound insulation between floors. The inconsiderate people in the room above us were constantly moving furniture across the floor (at least that is what it sounded like) which made a terribly loud sound in our room keeping us from getting any sleep until after 4:30 am (even my ear plugs would not allow me to get to sleep). After 3 trips to the front desk to complain, at 4 am the Tampa police was finally called to remove the large group of people from the room (I was told over 10) but they still allowed the couple who rented the room to remain. There were at least 2 other rooms who were also complaining about this party room. It should not have taken over 4 hours to solve this problem. Hotel management should have removed these people after their first warning (around midnight). Waiting until 4 am to do anything to solve the problem only lost them good customers who were \"playing by the rules\" of decency.", "title": "Terribly Noisy Night", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BLec723", "date": "September 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 179133904}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I talked to the am front desk manager and insisted on a refund.
