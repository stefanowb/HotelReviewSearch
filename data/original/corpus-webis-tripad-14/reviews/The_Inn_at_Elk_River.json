We are very discerning and the Inn was perfect. The view from the porch in front of our room was wonderful. We were greeted with cheese and crackers with fresh fruit and a glass of wine by the wonderful InnKeeper, Arya, who showed us around the Inn and helped with our choice of restaurants and made our reservation for Saturday evening. Arya also served the most tasty and beautifully served breakfast we have had in our travels. A fluffy spinach and sundried tomato omelet with real potatoes, asparagus, fresh fruit and sausage. What more could you ask for. The only suggestion would be for the owners to try a bit harder to update the decor. The rooms - while the beds were comfortable and spotlessly clean would have benefited from a few more pictures, etc. The price was reasonable and, again, the view awesome. Our favorite part was relaxing on the big porch at night and looking at the stars.", "title": "Wonderful romantic getaway - Ignore old posts about this Inn", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "yomaryjo", "date": "August 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 73431615}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Inn was in poor shape, room had socks behind the dresser from a previous guest.
