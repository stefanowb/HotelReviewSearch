Other reviewers are correct in saying that it looks like it's had better days and was quite tatty round the edges. The staff were very pleasant though and the room was clean with a working fridge. I don't know what they charge on peak season but for somewhere that cheap, we really couldn't complain.

We stayed on the beach for a few more hours before packing it up and heading back to our room. 331. It is the last room on the 3 rd level that you can still see somewhat of an \"ocean view\". Ridiculous!!! You have a better view of the pool then you do the ocean. So, don't bother if you are really wanting a view. The room was also located next to the vending machines, elevator and of all things a \"Courtesy Smoking Station\". OUTRAGEOUS!! The 2nd floor rooms are all smoking rooms, put the \"Courtesy Stations\" on that floor. The icing on our cake was at 6:30 am we were woken up to the sounds of stomping. It sounded like a group of people were doing jump and jacks above us. Low and Behold we found out that it was the \"Continental Breakfast\" being served above us in the Sky Room. DIRECTLY ABOVE US! Also, our room did not have a working a/c or fan. It was horrible at night. Especially after spending a day at the beach. My two kids were sweating all night so I finally opened up the bathroom window and prayed that we would be safe.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 1, 2005", "id": 4078807}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not great", "text": "This hotel was in a good location for the beach, but was very noisy with lots families staying there.
