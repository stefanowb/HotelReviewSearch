My husband spoke with planning coordinator and was told they usually close the bar at 12 a.m., but would stay open later if there were enough customers. At 12:15 we were told it was \"last call\" by the bartender. We asked to speak with a manager who said he could not help us. We were offered no solution on what to do with our friends and family.

The next morning, the same thing happened. Since noone was turning it off, we guessed that the guest had checked out without turning off their alarm. So we called the front desk and asked them if someone would come upstairs and turn it off. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't do that because a guest was still allegedly staying in the room. We were a little frustrated, but we understood. The alarm turned itself off again after 10 minutes. HOWEVER, the phone in the adjacent room now started ringing. Every other minute. We guessed it was the front desk trying to get a hold of the guest to turn his alarm clock off. But by this time the alarm clock was off, and now we had to deal with a phone ringing every other minute for the next half an hour.
