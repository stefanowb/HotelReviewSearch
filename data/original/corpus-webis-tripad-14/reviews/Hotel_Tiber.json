The hotel shuttle from the airport to the hotel was right on time. I suspect that the shuttle only runs at the listed times on the transportation section of the hotel web site, so be prepared if you arrive at other times. The cost of a taxi should not be exhorbitant, especially with two or more passengers, in comparison to the 6 Euro shuttle charge. Plenty of great sea food and pizza places walking distance from the hotel. The hotel is clean and modern. The biggest negative was the totally indifferent front desk customer service in the late afternoon and evening. No real greeting upon check in and he was so busy playing with his computer that my impression was that he definately did not want to be bothered with questions like \"where might be a good place to eat?\" Would I stay at the Hotel Tiber again? Probably. Although their customer service is not the best, especially in the afternoon and evening. Morning front desk staff was better. The breakfast buffet was adequate but not any better than a breakfast at a chain medium priced hotel in the US. The one staff member was also pretty indifferent toward the people eating breakfast. The hotel had no ironing boards in the room and no ironing boards/irons available at the hotel.

It was a buffet style with choices of fruits, cereals, breads, pastries and cooked items. The restaurant had a very fresh decor and was a conservatory style on the roof overlooking the harbour.
