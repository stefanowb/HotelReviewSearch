We arrived for a 5 day stay in the middle of the week, when business was a bit on the slow side. We were provided with a room closest to the elevator and next to a stairway. Apparently the hotel knew the coming weekend would have the arrival of several bus loads of young (preteen or early teen) hockey players. You can guess what followed- running and shouting in the hallway,, fights in the stairway, etc. Despite the efforts of the front desk to calm the actions, it was not a quiet weekend.", "title": "It's now our little retreat!!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ErinPoirier", "date": "September 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5823345, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Decore and the Food!", "disliked": "\u2014 It has wireless internet!!!!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Great Place to Stop!", "text": "In circumstances of impending tournaments, other hotels usually will book business travellers (and none tournament participants) in a separate wing or at the end of the hall.

We went to an information place, and looked at the hotel brochures. My husband picked up the one for Universel and joked, \"Imagine if we could afford to stay here\", and I looked at it, and I knew I had to stay there. We checked the price, and it was the same as everywhere else! So we went there, and had the most beautiful time. Fist of all the decore in the lobby is FAB! Our room was perfect! The restaurant is amazing, the food was delicious, and the decore there is beautiful as well. They give you fancy breads with oil and vinegar, and as much as you want, they will keep filling it with no problems! We will definetly be coming back....definetly!
