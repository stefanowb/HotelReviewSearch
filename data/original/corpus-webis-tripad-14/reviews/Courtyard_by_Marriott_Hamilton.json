We heard nothing at night, it was peaceful and the children slept well. I was shocked to read the complaint of mice in January of 2011 considering we also stayed at this property during that time. I was naturally curious and looked on \"youtube\" for the video as promised, and yet there is nothing. I have to say we have stayed in many hotels over the years and this hotel is impeccably kept and the housekeeping staff take pride in their work. I would highly recommend the property to anyone.
