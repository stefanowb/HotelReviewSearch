I encourage readers to consult other Travaasa reviews for more detailed experiences. In my opinion, the spa / resort feel has been replaced by a destination experience that strives to capture the \u201cfeel\u201d of the Texas Hill Country. The property does indeed seem more \"Western.\" The property has undergone quite bit of change and amenities added, including televisions in many of the rooms, a ropes course and a mechanical bull riding workout \u2013 really! Many of the buildings are repainted and the dining area was remodeled. They also appear to be preparing for equine activities of some kind, though the staff would not confirm this. A small but welcome addition is the paving of walking paths leading to the various quest quarters. It\u2019s just plain easier to walk and pull luggage than the former crushed granite pathways. The Spa and pool area remain well maintained. The location is about a 30 minute drive from downtown Austin and about a one hour drive from the airport. After my last stay at the property as the Crossings, I wondered whether I would return. In light of the upgrades and changes, I would be willing to give Travaasa a chance.", "title": "A Texas Hill Country experience in a weekend!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TexasEXtraveler", "date": "April 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 106022144}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled solo", "text": "The Travaasa is under new management and is a wonderful place to go to relax and unwind.

If you think you are checking into a luxury resort, forget it. If you are not a nature lover or staying on property the entire time for a program this is a lousy choice...remote, limited services and downright spooky at night. The restaurant closed at 9, chairs and equipment were piled up in the former bookstore and classrooms. It's outrageously overpriced for what you get. There was no tv in the room (understandable for a \" holistic retreat experience\" but not as a luxury accomodation). Our package included breakfast for an additional $50 but not worth the 45 min. it took the first morning or the second morning which I chose to skip entree choices due to the long delay in even getting coffee. The scone I settled for was tiny and cold. The property was nearly deserted but we were put in the farthest building (next door to a building that was totally dark and looked abandoned and very creepy at night. We had to walk 10 minutes in the dark to get anything out of the car which had to be left at the top of a hill in a parking lot. Big, uncovered holes along the path could have been a disaster as could the campfire left burning and unattended on a windy night with acres of dry timber. The golf cart that transported us (crammed up next to our luggage) to our room at check in had wet seats, but was better than checkout where our luggage was tossed into the flat bed of another cart filled with tools and maintenance equipment and no room for us. Not my idea of either luxury treatment or a retreat experience. This place is riding on the beauty The Crossings created and charging rates you would pay at a true luxury resort, but it is far from luxury. I think even the staff is uncomfortable being in what feels like an isolated, if not nearly abandoned property, since my walking in the door during the day caused the clerk to jump and say I had scared him. The largest number of other people I ever saw in the place was 12 and 8 of those may have been part of the crew doing a promotional photo shoot there. I was so disappointed that such a formerly beautiful and peaceful place now seemed to be so badly exploited. Or was it just me who felt exploited? I can tell you I did when I checked out and saw a gratuity had been added onto the entire cost of the bill on top of the already excessive costs. I will never stay at this place again as long as it is under this banner.", "title": "Creepy, Isolated and Waaaaay Overpriced", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "TexasTraveler605", "date": "March 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 100270664}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Austin"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 17, "very good": 50, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 252}, "aka": "Travaasa Austin Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0276243093923, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Located in Austin Hill Country only 30 minutes from eclectic downtown Austin, Traavasa Austin is nestled into 210 acres of the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve overlooking beautiful Lake Travis.
