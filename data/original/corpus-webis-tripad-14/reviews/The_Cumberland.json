Also some of the design features of the bathroom weren't very practical. I have to say the thing that stood out the most to me was....no MINIBAR in the room. Yes, finally a hotel that doesn't bother with a stupid mini fridge crammed with extortionately priced drinks and treats that you can just stare at and salivate over (god forbid you actually touch anything or dare to remove it for more than a millisecond or you'll get zapped with charges). Instead we had an EMPTY FRIDGE so we could stock up on snacks and drinks ourselves at the Tescos or Marks and Spencers just round the corner at a fraction of the minibar prices. Kudos to the Cumberland for providing this fridge, I wish more hotels would do this. We got a very good deal for this hotel on a website and felt we made the right choice.", "title": "We were pleased with the Cumberland", "user": "warwick290", "date": "December 29, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 91022173}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Average", "text": "This is a expensive hotel in a very expensive city.

On the plus side, the service was first class - all the stuff were very friendly - and the location is simply amazing - just at the top of Oxford Street. On the downside, whillst the room was clean and modern it was a little characterless (like a fancy Travelodge, really) and it didnt have a DVD or CD player, which is a bit disappointing at this price. The bathroom too was clean but unspectacular, with a few chips off the bath, very few toileteries, and no bathrobes.
