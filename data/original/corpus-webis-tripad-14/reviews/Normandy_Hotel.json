The Normandy makes false claims that there is air conditioning, but it is a free-standing floor unit that does not work,. The old wall-mounted hair dryer was not powerful enough to dry our hair. They put small flat-screen TVs in the sitting room (we booked a so-called suite), but the furniture is so old, that it is impossible to comfortably sit on anything to watch the TV. The bathroom tile is falling apart and the grout is moldy. The hallways are disgusting and poorly lit.
