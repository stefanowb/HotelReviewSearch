I booked through Chase \u2018n Rainbows which customer service was very efficient and everything was done in 20 min. An advantage to book directly through owners is you get a room exactly what you want, and a disadvantage is when you arrive, even if you don\u2019t like the room with some reasons, you are stuck with it. I liked the fact that the owners had 3 other units in Mahana and if emergency, I could contact Chase \u2018n Rainbows which had a local office in Maui. The unit 1104 was exactly what shown in the pictures. It was very clean, high quality, tasty decoration and very comfortable. I am picky about a bed. The still new king size bed was not too hard and not too soft, very comfy bed. The kitchen had all the basic stuff you need, not for a heavy duty cooking but who wants to do in vacation in hot weather. I recommend checking in the room first and see what the unit has in the kitchen such as salt, paper, coffee, sugar, BBQ spices,\u2026 then go to a store. There were 6 beach chairs, 2 of which were high quality ones and we borrowed them every day to beaches. There were also 2 cooler boxes. The refrigerator had an ice maker, so we didn\u2019t\u2019 need to buy ice. When we went to Hana, we took both cooler boxes packed with a salad, bread, lunch ham and drinks we bought from Times and we had a nice lunch at Hana Beach Park. Someone posted about the building repair construction recently, but I didn\u2019t see any construction guys or didn\u2019t hear any noise even in daytime. Also many people posted that Internet connection was not so good in rooms, but I was surprised we didn\u2019t have any problem in our room. I think we had a modem in the room. The dual sinks in bathroom were large enough for two of us and were convenient to get ready in early morning. There was a plenty of bath towels and kitchen towels but not a hair dryer there.

We chose the Mahana after reading several reviews from various sites. I must admit that pictures don't do justice for the beauty and location of the Mahana. We had a two bedroom, two bathroom condo for our week stay. I would highly recommend calling ahead of time and requesting a newly remolded condo and placement on a higher floor(although all of the rooms are ocean front) Not sure how the other condos looked, but ours was more than we expected. Spacious living room, flat screen television, full kitchen with supplies, washer/dryer, dishwasher, balcony, etc. All of this for the same price of a hotel room! The hotel staff was average, and housekeeping services are provided. Be sure to ask for extra towels however as they seem to provide the bare minimal. As for the condition of the condo, no complaints here. But as I said before, this may be due to my request of a newly remolded condo. There are a few cons however to the Mahana. There are no on-site restaurants. This isn't a big problem however because mostly everyone rents a car and there are a couple of restaurants located in the hotels next door if you chose to dine there. I would recommend going to a grocery store and purchasing a few breakfast items to save money. There is a grocery store Star Market located across the street, but be warned that prices in Hawaii are much higher. Also, the crowd at the Mahana is a little bit \"older\" so don't expect a party scene at night. This was perfect for us however since we were celebrating our anniversary. We simply took a 15 minute drive to Lahania's Front Street at night for the bar scene. Also, the beach in front of the Mahana is not suitable for swimming(it's very rocky). This also was not a problem because we simply walked 3 yards down Kaanapali Beach to a strip in front of the next hotel that was perfect. There is one pool at the Mahana also that was average. It never appeared crowded, as I believe everyone opted for swimming in the ocean. The Mahana also had a couple of activities during the week which is why some people chose a big hotel chain. There was \"Learning to Hula\" and a movie showing poolside. Overall I would highly recommend the Mahana if you are traveling for romance or with a group/family.
