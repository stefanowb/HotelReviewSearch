Well, the temperature in the hotel room was terrible and I quickly found out there was no airconditioning. The window only opened a crack and the room did not cool down. There was no bathtub to cool down in, so after a cold shower, I had to sleep with a cold wet towel on my body to keep my body cold. Worst hotel experience I have ever had. Of course, if it had been the middle of winter, a hot room probably would have been cozy. Overall, the hotel was nice and the location was good for visiting my business' office. But next time I travel in the summer I will always ask about the AC.", "title": "NO AIRCONDITIONING :-(", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "europa00", "date": "August 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5577487, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 No Air Conditioning"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Going back again soon....!

My views differ from the majority posted below. The best price I could get was \u00a380.00 a night. (much better value available at other hotels in central Manchester) My room had the smallest bathroom in the world, although great shower. Rooms appear large because sink is in your room not bathroom. Not very private if with your partner. Carpet was worn and had lots of stains. Staff were great and couldn't be more helpful. Check in has a bar at attached to it so if you arrive around 7pm get ready for everyone at the bar to be staring at you and sharing your conversation with the check in staff. This hotel is most basic, would be ok for \u00a340.00 a night, If you get asked to pay any more look elsewhere. Loads of great 4 star hotels in this area for \u00a370-80 per night", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 29, 2006", "id": 5231997}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "Excellent stay!
