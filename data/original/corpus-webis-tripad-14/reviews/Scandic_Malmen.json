It is a large hotel but check in was fast and friendly. Hilton Honors guests have access to bottled water and fresh fruit 24/7. The buffet breakfast was fine with the typical meats, cheese, breads, eggs and bacon, yoqurt, cereal and juices. The room was typical small 2 twin beds but ample for 2 people. We were there on the weekend and with the window shut to sleep no noise problem. A/C worked fine also. There is plenty of nightlife across the street in the square a popular trendy club Snaps which was great with outdoor tables and down under a candle lite pub and on the same street as the hotel is Charles Dickens a sports pub, Bullwinkle another club and more all the way down the pedestrian street which will take you to Old Town which has lots of bars and shops. The underground T stop is right outside the hotel entrance and 2 stops to Old Town 3 stops to City Centre. Very easy and cheap to use. For the price we paid about 150 US$ it was a deal!
