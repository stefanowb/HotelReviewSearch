The hotel was not bad a typical Sheraton lobby decorated to a high standard but the rooms not so good. The good news is I always look at the picture of my room before I book and had to have the manager out to show them the room then there was no arguement. It was not cheap $400 a night RO. We upgraded to half board they wanted $200 each but negoiated it done to $80 each which was more worth it. Food was ok but everything was very slow. I am from London so used to a fast pace. The first night went to the bar and an American said relax its the Bahamian way and smiled said he was fro NYC and was the same when he arrived wanted a drink pronto but after a week accepted that it takes ten minutes and the service is SLOW... The hotel was ok and would recommend but service is a must for me and you kind of feel a little that the locals feel you should be grateful that they allow you on their island.. Hotel right on the beach though..
