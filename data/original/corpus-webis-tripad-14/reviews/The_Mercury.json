At quarter of a mile from jct 5 of the M61 motorway at Bolton (with plenty of free parking) it's perfect for travellers stopping off en route and is equally placed between Manchester & Preston.

We quickly became acquainted with the owners, Kwez & Glynn who took a very personal 'hands on' approach to making us feel very welcome from booking in and throughout our stay.
