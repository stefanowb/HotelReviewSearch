Seemed like a cool concept, but in practice that's all it was - a cool concept. My room was very clean (always important!) and very minimalistic as far as decor, which was fine. But that's where the praise ends. It was very dark and half the lights didn't work. It was pretty small and in fact the shower was set up so that you could see the person showering from the main room (some sort of weird glass, rather than a wall, connecting them). One of the blinds was totally broken, making it darker. The lights above the bed didn't function, the toilet ran constantly and there was a sound like being in the middle of an airplane hanger. The wakeup calls came late and no one called to check when one day I didn't answer (I was already in the shower). They didn't bring me any new towels (even though I made it clear that I needed them). The cordless phone was out of batteries.

Kind of weird walking into a hotel lobby with the noise blasting at you. Ceiling about 25\" tall. Easy check in. Accommodated a change in type of room that I wanted. They put me on the second floor, right above the bar area. I was leery of being able to sleep, but didn't hear a thing. I couldn't believe it. The rooms are spacious. The room has indirect lighting. Strange configuration. Either all the lights are on, or all the lights are off, except for one over the shower. So if someone gets up in the middle of the night and wants to turn the bathroom light on, the switch turns them all on. There were no drinking glasses. And only one regular coffee set up and one decaf. So if two of you are there, someone gets decaf. And you can only make one cup at a time anyway. The beds are not Sheraton standard, not quite as comfortable. There is a half-ironing board, not full size. And the room has a fridge, but no microwave. Also, they don't have vending or ice machines anywhere other than in the lobby. Free wired and wifi, and portable electronics plug in and play on tv screen. Which is a 35\" flatscreen. There is no inroom directory or phone book, so if you want a pizza, you have to figure that out some other way. There are two desks in the room, but only one chair. And it is shower only, no tub. There were two styrofoam cups for the coffee. There is a parking charge of $8. It is only one block from the convention center, so very easy to leave your car there and walk over. There is a place to order food. I had a breakfast sandwich, and it took a good ten minutes. There were only a few people in front of me, but the cook told me he is only allowed to make two sandwiches at a time. This was 10:00 on a Saturday. I don't know how you would ever get anything hot on a weekday at 7:30 am. Probably have to settle for bagels, cereal, or yogurt. The employees are friendly and will go out of their way to help you with anything. I didn't get a chance to see if there was a restaurant anywhere near by.
