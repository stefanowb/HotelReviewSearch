Breakfast was amazing, a huge selection of hot and cold food and eggs made to order. There is free wifi in the lobby which was a nice addition.

It was a birthday trip so we decided to treat ourselves to a 5 star hotel. Big mistake!. It has 5 stars and prices to match. If you like impersonal hotels with additional \u201ccharged\u201d services, this is the one for you. Our check-in experience left a lot to be desired. We had travelled by car from Madrid with our one year old. It was a Friday afternoon and we asked if there was parking in the area. \u201cParking is available at \u20ac18 a day beneath the hotel\u201d, we were advised by the surly receptionist. We asked if street parking was available but she responded that it was all pay parking. We reminded her it was a weekend and she grudgingly admitted that it was free Saturday and Sunday. When we got to our room, we found a supplementary bed had been put in the room rather than a triple room which we thought we had ordered. On reading the small print of the booking form, it became evident that even though the booking engine said Triple Room, the printed booking form stated supplementary bed. We moved the two single beds to one side of the room so we could ensure our child was safe beside us for the night. It felt like too much work to talk to the reception again. We noted the \u20ac2.49 bottle of water on the desk. We checked the tea and coffee facilities, 2 decaffeinated coffee sachets, 2 tea sachets, 2 sugars and 1 milk portion. No real coffee. This was taking the \u201cchargeable\u201d element a bit far. We went across the road a bought a litre of milk so as to have our morning coffee next day. The room was clean but basic. The bathroom was again clean and the shower and bath were good with strong water pressure. Bath gowns were provided with slippers. The air conditioning in the bedroom was very loud and we had to turn it off so as not to wake the child. The room became quite stuffy overnight even though the weather was cool outside. The door staff in the hotel were all very pleasant and attentive. The hotel is quite a distance from the centre of Lisbon but is right beside the Metro. We found a number of excellent cafeterias/bars in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. We took a full lunch menu (soup, choice of up to 10 different main courses and dessert and coffee for less than \u20ac5 each and a breakfast the following morning for \u20ac2.50 each. These were the regular Portuguese prices and the quality was superb. The hotel is in quite an industrial looking area so other than the local eateries, it is best to head directly into Lisbon. There is a zoo in the park nearby, but we did not check it out. All in all, I think we would have been better booking another hotel with a more personable reception staff and more generous in their facilities. It started to feel like Ryanair with a price on everything.", "title": "Incredible value", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Cliffordpaul", "date": "October 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 83628695}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "well worth it", "text": "The Corinthia is a big hotel, make no mistake but the service and surroundings made for a very comfortable stay.

The man at reception wasnt the most pleasant and offered us twin rooms with a conjoining door (perfect if you have kids staying with you, but we didnt) i explaine we had booked two superior double rooms and in fairness the mistake was quickly rectified. The man checking us in mellowed a little and was quite pleasant after that even recommending a fish restaurant across the road which was superb. we had booked superior doubles with breakfast. All the rooms in hotel are either superior double or suites. The room itself was small but perfectly fitted out. bed was comfy, plenty of pillows, flat screen tv, the only gripe i had was whilst the mini bar was payable (as it usually is in most hotels) they did supply a bottle of water but it was 2.95 euro for same. i feel for a 5 * hotel it would have been nice to supply a bottle of water and maybe a turndown service free of charge. bathroom was adequate with a few toiletaries. rooms, corridors etc were spotless. we had booked breakfast and i must say this was absolutely womderful. plenty of tables, you never had to wait and the hotel did seem full. there was something for everyone from a diet section(which we didnt bother with), hot buffets with the most wonderful omelettes cooked to your liking, cold buffets, absolutely everything, the waiters and waitresses were constantly around to top up your coffee, a few hotels ive stayed in should take note. foyer, bar, toilets, gardens, shop all superb. the bar was small and fairly expensive but i suppose you would expect this in a 5* hotel. The pool is small but is lovely and relaxing, a couple of the railing dividing the childrens section with the main pool were broken and in need of attention. we didnt use the gym but it looked very well equiped. the hotel is out a little, about 5 euro for a taxi into town, however we used the metro right across the road (jardim zoological) is the name of the station and is on the blue line. the metro is perfect for getting around this small city and you can buy a multi day pass which does the buses and the trams. all in all i was delighted with the corinthia hotel and would definitely stay there again", "title": "Fantastic", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Debstwo", "date": "October 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 82083945}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010", "text": "We spent there 3 nights and was perfect.The breakfast and the bar and the staff 5 star.", "title": "Perfect in everything", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Gumilabu", "date": "September 18, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 80069980}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Thanks", "title": "Do you want to be able to sleep in your hotel room?", "user": "FailteEire", "date": "September 18, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 79987211}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you are looking for a hotel in Lisbon within which you can get a great nights sleep then this is the hotel for you.

Executive rooms on the top floors offer a nice view on the city of Lisbon and include complimentary services on the very elegant 24th floor such as free WiFi, business center, free drinks in the afternoon, a more personalised breakfast service etc. Meeting rooms on the 1st floor are quite convenient and staff is extremely helpful. Good quality coffee breaks and lunch buffets available. Nice environment and hotel is maintained very well; no significant signs of aging or inconvenience otherwise. Very nice and clean hotel overall. Elevators, hallways etc. however tend to be a bit hot and the hallways might need some ventilation to allow some fresh air coming in. I personally feel the air-conditioning in the room was rather limited in power (even though I turned it to 16-18\u00b0C the room would never really cool down as expected - this was not really a problem because I kept the curtains closed but a more powerful system would have been appreciated in this range of hotel). Housekeeping, bell-boy, front desk, and other staff members were all very efficient and friendly. Hotel is not located in the center but a taxi would get you right to the center of Lisbon for less than EUR 5 on average (in less than 10 minutes). Hotel is close though to the El Corte Ingles and Cobra shopping malls and within walking distance of the Gulbenkian Museum. For a wide choice of restaurants just take a taxi to the center or the 'docas' area (would recommend 5 Oceanos at Doca de Santo Amaro).", "title": "Nice stay, with a few quibbles", "user": "Amberine", "date": "August 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 76806648}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room was really bright our room was on the 20th floor so we had a magnificent view over the city the metro stops right across the street wich is very easy.", "title": "Fabulous Holiday", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Laurens T", "date": "August 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 76775067}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "In our room we had a nespresso machine with 3 types of cupes and the gave us everyday new vanity kits shower caps and the usual bottles of conditioner shampoo bath foam and body milk", "title": "Great value, but not 5 star", "user": "Julie029", "date": "August 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 76537883}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "The breakfast in the skylounge is overwehlming there was a lot to much to choose 9 different types of coffee 9 different types of tea you could order your eggs as you like and the prepared it in front of you it was to much to choose. from 16.00 until 22.00 there were canapees pastry and a lot of drinks for free.", "title": "Magnifique h\u00f4tel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tessMons_Belgique_", "date": "August 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 76447317}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "IF I COULD I WOULD LEAVE AGAIN", "title": "pleasant, comfortable with great views", "user": "ATH04KAR", "date": "August 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 76069922}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed for 4 nights at the beginning of August, for a super rate of 58 euro a night for the room.
