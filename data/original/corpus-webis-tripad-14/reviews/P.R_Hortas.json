I booked a single room and it was quite spacious and clean, with basic but modern furniture and a nice bathroom. The heater is quite efficient (where you can set the temperature). It is located in a quiet street just off the Cathedral. Staff was very helpful and polite. My only complaint would be about the wifi not working very well in my room, but that's it.
