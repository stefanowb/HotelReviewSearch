Yes the TV didn't get many channels, the couch was not that comfortable and shower leaked, but we didn't spend that much time in our room for that to really matter. Staff was kind, helpful, replaced the towels and made the beds every day. There are computers in the lounge you may use for a small fee, free wifi in the lounge as well, but we were able to get the wifi connection in our room on the 2nd floor without a problem.
