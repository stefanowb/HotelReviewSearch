All we needed was good sleep, so I booked a superior, high floor. Ended up on the 11th - not that high, there are 21 floors - but OK, except that the hotel is on a busy street and the sound-proofing (if there is any) is useless. So passing lorries, motorbikes, all get heard. So sleep wasn't very good, so not good value, in my opinion, for almost 500 reais when you count breakfast (= about USD285, or Euros 210,00, at time of writing).", "title": "Noise from the street means not good value for money", "user": "JeffStranks", "date": "November 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120544699}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "The hotel doesn\u00b4t worth what we pay for it.", "text": "The room faced the street, so perhaps if you get a room at the back it's not so bad?", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 19, 2011", "id": 119485679}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled on business", "text": "That said, I couldn't disagree more with others about staff - all were very attentive, in my opinion (I speak Portuguese, so maybe that helps).

When we got there they did not want to let us check-in because we did not have our 3 kids passports. They have a policy of not letting adults stay with kids unless they can prove paternity, but in this case it was soooo obvious that we were a whole family group!! Both sets of grand parents, uncles and aunts, etc! And we had our kids school id's, and health insurance cards for all of us. They made us go to the local police station, then to a judge court, and only after neither of them could help produce the document the hotel was asking from us, and after the whole family came down to the lobby to beg with us, they finally let us in... Very stubborn people, clearly no focus on welcoming clients.
