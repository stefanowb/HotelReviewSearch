I noticed just before I departed for Madrid it had slipped down to number 19 and is now even further down the ranking. I would have to say that I agree that it should never have been no.1. The hotel in itself is functional and clean and situated in a perfectly central area for seeing the sights etc. Most of the staff seemed fine and perfectly adequate, polite and professional. The problem for us was the the organisation in the breakfast room which I thought was nothing short of chaotic at times. There did not seem to be any proper supervision there. They were constantly running out of utensils such as spoons, knives and forks, plates, cups etc. The layout of the buffet area was such that you were in danger of often bumping into other guests who were moving in all directions round this area to to try and get their food which also quite often seemed to be running out causing delays.All in all it was really badly organised to the extent that on a number of days we just did not bother going.

The location on Abada Street (which means rhinoceros in Spanish!) is just off the Gran Via and Carmen St. It is a short walk to the major plazas, restaurants and stores. We did not take the Metro but understand that that is a convenient option. We did walk and took a few cab rides. We eventually realized that the II Castillas is a good value for the price: clean, quiet, good AC, and boasting excellent security. The security is definitely needed because there is a major \"street of prostitution\" one small block away! The hotel is locked at night and you have to be buzzed in to enter. One small complaint is that the lobby lights are dimmed to semi-darkness at night. I don't know if this is an energy saver or a feeble attempt to create atmosphere. Occassionally it took a long time for hot water to come to the sink. We had a full enclosure around our shower so the typical water-in-the-floor was not an issue. The busy staff was helpful in finding us a large taxi to take 4 people & lots of baggage to the airport. There is a large coin-op internet cafe just around the corner, so you can check your email.
