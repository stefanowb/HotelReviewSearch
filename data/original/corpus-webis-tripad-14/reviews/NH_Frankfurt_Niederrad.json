The airport shuttle was very handy. But be sure to book a seat on the shuttle for your return trip to the airport as the shuttle only hsas room for 6 persons. The front desk staff were very nice and spoke excellent English. We did not try the breakfast buffet as it was 19 euros. A bit out of our budget. ;) There is a supermarket right next door which has excellent pastries and sandwiches. It opens at 7 am. The room was a decent size. The televison is an old crt type but serves its purpose. The beds are comfortable and the shower is a nice size. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone that wants a short stay. It is about a 10 min walk to the Sbahn which is one stop away from the central train station. But I would suggest going two stops further to the middle of the shopping district.
