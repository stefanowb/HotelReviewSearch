Expensive pool side drinks and snacks, and its forbidden to consume your own food/drinks purchased from off site. Food average for Turkey but evening meal is late 20:00, stomach thought my throat had been cut. Been to several Turkish hotels and this has to be, by far the most unfriendly place I've ever stayed in. If all this sounds appealing come ahead you'll realise I'm not exaggerating.

The hotel had a annoying policy of not allowing any items bought outside, such as bottled water and snacks etc to be brought in,so you were forced to buy their stuff.

Only problem was the evenings were a bit chilly, not like here of course but the first week we had to buy a jacket for my little boy to wear. Luckily we wore the jackets we travelled in. When we arrived 'Shrek' the security guy had a thick arran jumper on, i thought oh dear! By the second week it was fab, the evenings were lovely NO MORE JACKETS, we never had a bad meal, desperate to go back, even my daughter loved it. Just watch the young turkey guys, they have roaving eyes but after many mommy looks it was fine. The web cam facility was fab at Buzz Beach bar, we text home and they logged on and saw us, fantastic.

We think the hotel rooms are very clean, they were cleaned every day with fresh towels etc, they were small but served the purpose. We stayed half board and found the food to be lovely, breakfast there was plenty of choice from cereals and fruit, a version of a cooked breakfast i.e. eggs, beans, meat etc. They also made fresh pancakes and omelette twice a week. Evening meal was pretty consistent with soup to start, then salad followed by your main meal, with a selection of fruit and desserts to finish, but all was fresh and tasted lovely. The only fault we could find with the hotel was with the air conditioning. There simply isn't one, the one that was there was noisy and ineffective. This made us consistently tired as we never slept well for the entire holiday, leaving us feeling exhausted. In our opinion this needs updating desperately, or they will lose bookings. We will not go back there due to this, which is a shame as the hotel was lovely.
