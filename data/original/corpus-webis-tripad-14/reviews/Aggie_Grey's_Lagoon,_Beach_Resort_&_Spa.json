If you go to Samoa, go directly to the Savai'i Lagoon Resort and spend your last night (only) here i if you have to. The food was barely edible and only got eaten because there was nowhere else to go. The staff were indifferent and I suspect this is because they are either micro or mismanaged, no genuine smiles or talofas when passing them during the day. Resort was filled with families and other tourists who seemed to be going through the motions. Nothing special here, and what rip-off prices. Stock up on duty free in AKL before leaving. Bring snacks, because did I mention, the food is terrible. The only outstanding staff member was the lady on the egg/omlette station in the morning, she was great!
