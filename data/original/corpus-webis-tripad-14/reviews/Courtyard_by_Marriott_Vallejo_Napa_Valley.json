We asked for 2 connecting rooms and had no problem getting them. The rooms were very clean and nicely appointed for the price range, but on the small size for US hotels. Although the breakfast was not included (about $10 for adults and $5-6 for kids), it was very tasty and offered a good variety from waffles, cook to order eggs, boxed cereals, and fresh sliced fruit. You could also order off an ala carte menu. Breakfast was relaxing because the staff wasn't chasing you out (like other hotels do) when breakfast hours ended. When we checked out the second day, we were allowed at no extra charge to store our luggage while we enjoyed Six Flags again.

The hotel is very close to a shopping center if you forget anything, there is a Target & a few food venues (Olive Garden, taco bell, etc.) across the freeway and about 2-3 miles away. The hotel was able to offer us a discount on the park tickets too which was great. We woke up early for our breakfast buffet, which was included in our room rate and it was a welcome, substantial breakfast, with made to order omelets, oatmeal, cereal, breads, donuts, sausage, bacon, waffles, scrambled eggs, & juices, coffee, etc. We had a great time at the park the next day & then stayed at the hotel another night. We had a few family members who joined us at the park who live locally in the bay area & we went back to our room to relax afterwards & we ordered up some pizza from the hotel (they only offer pizza at the hotel for evening food). It was pretty good.
