The hotel itself is comfortable, relaxing and quiet.

Some rooms had bathrooms en suite and others didn't. Those that didn't still had their own private bathroom, just down or across the hall. The beds are amazing - best beds we slept in during our trip through Argentina.

So we began making emergency phone calls to find a more desirable place to stay. The Malabia had a cancelation (we had tried to book there originally but they were sold out) so we headed right over and were so glad we did. It was adorable. We were greated with coffee and pastries in their sitting area, and were escorted right to our room even though we were several hours early for check in.

The B&B was recently restored, and has more the feeling of a house than a hotel, with elegant modern furnishings that provide hints of the building's past. The breakfasts served famiy-style are also a treat, with whatever request you have been quickly prepared while you enjoy coffee/juice/etc. The staff, however, is what really separates Malabia from the competition, as they arranged whatever nightlife you wanted (Tango shows, dinner reservations), provided tips on what there was to see and were very friendly for casual conversation (they also remember every guest's name, which is a nice touch). We had a bad experience at another BA hotel, and were thrilled to come back to the warm hospitality of Malabia House.

We had a superior room which is smaller than the others, you pay more but the bathroom and toilet are en-suite unlike the other rooms. So check out exactly what type of room you want when you book. Not a lot of space in the room and the bathroom is a tight squeeze but hey! Are you going to live in the room all day? I doubt it. Queen size bed is a fantastic by the way!
