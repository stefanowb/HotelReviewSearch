We booked a private en suite for 2 nights in mid-October. When we first arrived in the cab, driving through many roads with graffiti and etc, we questioned for a split second and then put our trust in previous reviewers - they were completely right. City Circus is in a fantastic location near the heart of Psirri nightlife - far enough away to be quiet but close enough to be within 3 blocks of some fantastic restaurants and bars. (Niklaus restaurant was great, by recommendation, and Beer Time is a new favorite bar.) Our room was in the basement and as some others have said, sound does carry and we did hear some couples checking out in the early morning. Shower was fantastic - actual hot water that lasted more than 2 minutes! City Circus also recommended the free walking tour, which we took and loved! Highly recommend - we will stay here if we are ever in Athens again!", "title": "Loved the location!", "user": "Alybyzrp", "date": "October 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 181734556}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "City Circus Athens provide comfortable accommodation 10min walking distance to the vibrant Monastiraki district.

It's super super clean, nicely designed and managed. The mattress for the bunk bed is good quality and very comfortable. Bathroom is even cleaner than what's in my own apartment. Staff are very friendly. He explained to me for 20 minutes on the map what trips I can take to go around Athens. There is a free laptop in the common area for use. The free breakfast is basics but the fruit Greek yogurt is yummy. Considering the budget price, it's good value for money. The location is close to all the shops, train stations and restaurants. At night avoid walking to the neighborhood in the north which looks a bit of nasty.

It's in the heart of Athens, in the hip Psirri neighborhood, beside numerous eateries and watering holes and a short walk from worthwhile sites. City Circus is in a 4-story, restored early 20th century mansion, complete with fresco-ed ceilings, wrought-iron balconies and baroque tiles. We\u2019ve dressed it up with vintage furniture, reclaimed materials, modern design elements and street art by a selection of fresh local talent."}
