The decor and ambiance were so inviting and comfortable, not to mention stylish too! We originally stayed here because there was little accommodation in Hobart and I'd definitely recommend the location. It's 45 minutes outside Hobart in an area that is worth visting anyway. It's tranquil and peaceful but has enough facilities (supermarkets etc) nearby, which you'll need if you're going to be using the bbq!
