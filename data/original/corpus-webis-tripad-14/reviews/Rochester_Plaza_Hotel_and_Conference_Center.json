Check-in was reasonably quick, considering the crowd attending the event. I found my room to be very clean, with rather dated furnishings, but all in good repair. Bathroom was very clean, with a small selection of toiletries. The alarm clock could not be set correctly, but that wasn't important to me, as I used my cell phone. Other reviewers are correct: the hotel parking fills up very quickly, so you will probably end up parking in the public lot across the way, which really is no big deal. Another thing to keep in mind is that downtown Rochester is actually a pretty deserted area after hours, and don't count on finding a CVS or grocery store within walking distance. I think if you can get a good price you would be ok staying here, but I would probably find a hotel outside center city when I'm in Rochester again.", "title": "Clean with comfortable bed", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Bandlady", "date": "December 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 121811336}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled on business", "text": "We paid about $150.00 a night for this hotel. What we received upon arrival was a) not what the website led us to believe we would receive; and b) not worth that price. The website tells you that on-site parking costs $4.00 & we were prepared to pay. When we arrived at 9:00 pm, the lot was full! They told us that we were on our own \u2013 and that we would find alternate parking in a garage across the street. The website also promised a spacious desk with chair; this was important as we were there on business. There was a small desk with an arm chair (not a desk chair) \u2013 so it didn\u2019t reach the table. This rendered the desk completely useless and we were forced to work on the beds. Our room was dimly lit with grout in the bathtub, peeling wallpaper, and sliding closet doors that are off the track. The white comforters had visible stains. (At least the beds were comfortable.) I ordered a garden burger from room service, as I\u2019m a vegetarian, and was brought a hamburger instead \u2013 after waiting thirty minutes. We checked out the menu for the hotel restaurant, which was posted online, and when we walked downstairs to eat \u2013 the menu was exactly the same as room service! When we asked if they had the food that was listed on the online menu, the waitress said \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d\u2026before admitting that the website hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time! The entire experience was one thing after another that continually proved that this hotel has serious managerial issues. Please don\u2019t waste your money. If you\u2019re looking for a hotel to connect to (or that is in the vacinity of) the Rochester convention center \u2013 try the Hyatt or Radisson.", "title": "Less of a 'Plaza', More of a 'Strip Mall'", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "jmasc1", "date": "December 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 121500293}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled solo", "text": "I used this Hotel for an overnight stay for my daughter.", "title": "excellent customer service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "badboy1228", "date": "November 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121106878}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "They picked her up at the airport.

After the first one I informed the desk that the smell of pot smoke was stron through my entire floor the staff did nothing. At each fire alarm the staff would not answer any other guests questions or even direct us where to go to evacuate. There was a wedding that took up the entire parking facility-which was very small- and even though we paid the desk clerk told us we had to \"figure it out\". We ordered room service and it never came to our room. The houskeeping staff barely made our beds and we had to ask for new towels. Our bathroom ceiling was caving in from mildew. The entire room smelled old and musty. Do not believe the pictures on their site-I was in 4 separate rooms of people on the trip with me and all of the rooms were sub-standard. I could hear the tiniest noise outside my room and through the walls to the next room. I could go on and on with examples.
