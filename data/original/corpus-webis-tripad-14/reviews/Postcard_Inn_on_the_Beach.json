Let put a few qualifiers in because I saw quite a few younger people as in college/univ students and was prepared for noise and lots of partying. I left my two teens at home to avoid this. They had a large beach area where we could hear some music at night, not too loud and I said to my husband if it had not been so cold at night I would have gone down for a listen. The rooms were basic but clean and the beds comfortable. The bathroom could be a little bigger,ok a lot bigger,but for the short stay it was adequate. They also had a beach restaurant that served some simple but good breakfast (other meals too but we only ate breakfast and the front desk staff were helpful.

The beds are great with down comforters in white duvets with new flat panel tvs. The staff is wonderful and there is an amazing barbecue restaurant onsite open for lunch and dinner. If you are looking for an ultraluxury 4 or 5 star full service resort this may not be for you - but if you want a clean, comfortable, convenient, beachfront resort with a great location, fitness center, swimming pool, and warm staff you will have a lot of fun at Postcard Inn on the Beach.

I had booked this hotel on Hotwire and had read some reviews on Trip Advisor prior to our departure. Well needless to say all the reviews were very accurate. This hotel is rated a three star and it is a two star at best. The air conditioning does not work in the room and I found from other guests that this complaint was quite the same. The hotel walls are so thin you can hear everything that goes on in the room next door and if you are in the lower level and someone is in the room above you forget about getting any sleep. The shower drain does not work and the tub fills up with water all time. There is no fan in the bathroom so since the air conditioning does not work the room gets like a sauna. The rooms are very dark and the refrigerator is so small why even have one in there at all. This hotel has put a lot of money in retro decor but they need to fix the air conditioning and do something to alleviate the noise problem in the rooms. Also, they may want to invest in a heater for the swimming pool as it is so cold there was never anyone swimming in it. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!!", "title": "Great place", "user": "travel9009", "date": "February 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 55035159}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed there with my boyfriend and we have enjoyed it immensely - a beautiful beach with just few people around, friendly staff, nice bar on the beach and, above all, great, relaxed atmosphere of that nicely furnished/stylish place.
