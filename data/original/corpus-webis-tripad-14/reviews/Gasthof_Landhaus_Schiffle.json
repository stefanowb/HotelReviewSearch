The hotel is a short walk to the center of town. The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The hotel's restaurant serves tasty regional cuisine (veal, lamb, etc.) at a reasonable price. Complementary breakfast is varied and satisfying. Staff could not be more helpful, including efforts to deal with Lufthansa after it cancelled my return flight. Reception staff speak English. Owner even drove me to the train station when it was time to leave.
