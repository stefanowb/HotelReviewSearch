This was our first time in Edmonton and we chose the hotel primarily due to its affordable rates and the good reviews in Tripadvisor. I must say we weren't disappointed. The room we had was large and more than adequate for a family of two adults and two children. The included breakfast was about as good as you can ever expect with plenty of variety in hot and cold items. Location, though not perfect or ideal, was not too far from anything that Edmonton has to offer if you have a car. We also used the pool and slide a couple of times and that was a lot of fun. All in all, our stay here was very pleasant and I wouldn't hesitate staying here again in the future or recommending it.", "title": "Can't Ask for Much More", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ulical", "date": "July 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 134985071}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012", "text": "Our family of 5 stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of July.

My preplanned room was not ready which would not have been a problem but then I was told I was being upgraded. I received my keys and walked up to the door of my room, opened it and went WOW! I was in a room with a jacuzzi, a fireplace, a soft housecoat, and king size bed. It was amazing. I had a great evening, a good sleep and then to top it off got free breakfast and coffee the next morning and my a chariot (Taxi) was waiting to take me to the meeting.
