I thought I had done my home work by looking at the reviews on Trip Advisor, getting in contact with the actual hotel in advance to give them notice with my requests....all for nothing. I has specially ordered a cheesecake to be made and brought to the room in time for check in, I even told staff we would check in at 3pm but the cake wasnt brought up till 5ish. A bottle of chapagne on ice with some flutes?more like two plastic cups! I booked 2 massages which cost a small fortune and let me say my body was not 'buffed' at all. More like some woman just running her hands over my body....may sound nice to some but not really what I wanted. Some candles burning, soft music playing, felt like I was on a 3rd date, not about to get my knots worked out! I came out feeling more tense than before, probably because the therapist kept blushing every time she saw my breast! If you want excellent spa treatment, go to the Dorchester! The staff were not particularly accommodating and made us feel like we didnt belong in the hotel. In all fairness it was abit too old fashioned for my tastes. Maybe something my parents would appreciate, too fussy,chintzy. The one saving grace was room service and the amazing marble bathroom. I was quite glad to be going home the next day.

The hotel is supposed to be 5 star but the service is quite awful - and this seems to be a recurring view that I've now read in other reviews. I've written again as a matter of principle and received some kind of holding reply, but this was weeks ago and I still have not received a proper response. My conclusion: don't bother; even in London you will find better levels of service at this price.", "title": "Great Hotel, Great Service, Great Location", "user": "BabyBolly", "date": "September 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 20346462, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness and size of the rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 Bar area can get noisy and busy"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008", "text": "upon a friend's recommendation and reading the reviews , i booked and stayed at the Landmark seven days with my wife and our eight year old son. we all loved it. spacious rooms, big bathrooms, warm rooms in the cold of december. the staff keptour extra baggage at no charge while we travelled to italy for 5 days, then came back for one more night and the same top quality experience. i have never seen anything more magical and electric as London at Xmas time with all the lights and eager excited shoppers. every meal i had was the best food no matter which restaurant i chose. far different than my school days of early 1980s. of course i returned with no money left. phew> great memories", "title": "Lovely hotel of ancient times but not worth 5 star", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "flausi", "date": "August 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 19484846}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "We booked a deluxe suite at this hotel for a special occasion - we have visited the hotel many times for the great Sunday Buffet with unlimited champagne.

When we were waiting in the bar area we were accosted by a security guard and asked if we were guests of the hotel and told not to take photos of the footballers - we said we did not even know what they were talking about and the security guard was very aggressive and told us celebrities were not to be disturbed and he almost tried to chuck us out. On checking in we were given a dirty non smoking room that stank despite requesting a non smoking suite. Eventually we were moved to nicer room. We then requested an ironing board which never materialised. Breakfast was another disappointment - poor choice and very slow service. The staff joked with each other and the restaurant manager told off his staff within our earshot.
