Super modern decor, friendly staff, spacious and comfortable room. Only drawback is that its a bit far from the center, especially in the cold of winter so we spent quite a bit on cabs each day. Also there is no wi-fi, just a cable connection which was a bit expensive. Another quip would be that the room service seemed to be pretty poor. On a Sunday we decided to stay in for awhile but the kitchen was closed so we ordered tea and orange juice before heading out. The juice was far from fresh and basically undrinkable and the lipton tea was uninspiring. After this experience we never tried to order anything else from room service. Other than that it was a great bargain and I would definitely stay there again. I would certainly recommend splurging on the executive room. We took a peek at a standard room and they're pretty small. The executive room has twice the space, and an awesome bathroom/shower/tub and you can usually get it at a great rate. You can control all the lights in the room from remote controls on either side of the bed and there is a handy \"do not disturb\" button that's great for sleeping in late. A great little hotel in a great little town.", "title": "Modern Fun In Florence", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BAJZK", "date": "December 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 11880560, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Modern Design", "disliked": "\u2014 A bit far from the center"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled solo", "text": "I loved this hotel. I had sourced it through tripadvisor.com and tablethotels.com and found a fantastic rate on expedia. The hotel is across the river from most of the sights and tourists spots but it is a very short walk - along the river and a chance to see the real Florence. The hotel itself is very modern (but comfortable), clean and professional. If you like design hotels you will appreciate all of the touches including the beautiful lobby and the doors to each hotel room (framed portraits). The buffet breakfast (included in my rate) is fantastic and was the best I've had in Europe - eggs, sausage, fresh pastries, fruit, juice etc. I was traveling alone (I'm a woman in my thirties) and was not disuaded by the walk into town - I usually ventured back and forth a couple times a day and felt comfortable walking at night. I stayed here on two occasions during my trip - the first for four nights, and the second for two nights - and found my experience consistent.
