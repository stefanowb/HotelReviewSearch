The room was larger than most hotel rooms and had a good sized balcony overlooking the marina, the Long Beach skyline, the Queen Mary, and out to the ocean! We had room service dinner on the balcony as the sun was setting - beautiful and romantic! The rooms are all new, with comfortable beds, a large HD TV with connections for your laptop, complete with two wine glasses for your enjoyment. The bathroom was completely redone, including a new tub. The bathroom is on the small side, but I'd trade that for the beautiful balcony any day!", "title": "Great Value, Stylish Hotel", "user": "Billyphx", "date": "December 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 90945794}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Long Beach"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 42, "average": 87, "very good": 217, "terrible": 21, "excellent": 231}, "aka": "Maya Hotel Long Beach", "slim_ranking": 0.19298245614, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Hotel Maya is the first distinctive full-service, luxury Long Beach boutique resort hotel, located on the scenic downtown waterfront.
