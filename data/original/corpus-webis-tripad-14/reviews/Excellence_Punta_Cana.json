The food was great and the choice in availble drinks was quite refreshing (no limitaions to generic stuff here). Also, it was particularly wonderfulI not to have to make reservations for one of the several classy specialty restaurants at the resort (Italian, Mediterranean, Asian, French, Mexican, etc) although that policy resulted in unusually long waits for dinner on one or two occasions during peak periods at some of the popular restaurants. For lobster lovers, we suggest the Lobster House. It is a must-try: Delicious! Excellence Punta Cana has a very good mix of evening entertainment options - manager's special receptions, shows, the casino (small, but fun), disco, etc. We particularly loved the piano-saxophone duo, led by Domingo, and their soothing, danceable renditions of smooth jazz with a Latin flavor. Some little but important oversights, especially for the VIP section which we paid extra for - staff needs to consistently follow up on promises; staff needs to double-check the rooms in between guest to ensure that gadgets like in-room jacuzzis and whirlpools are clean and in working condition - that way, guests won't have to waste valuable time waiting on or for repairs/cleaning; the hotel needs to pay attention to and properly maintain the exterior of some of its buildings.

We got the Honeymoon package which gives you a couples message and facial, I dinner for 2on the beach and breakfast in bed on a morning of your choosing. All just fantastic. While having dinner on the beach, they run your jacuzzi for you with bubbles, and throw rose peddels all over the bubbles. My wife loved that touch. I ordered a bottle of Dom which we drank lounging in the tub. It was one of the great nights of my life and I thank Secrets for that. The pool was fantastic and so was the beach. We split our time at both, took advantage of the beach barbeque almost every day as well. The people who work there are simply wonderful people. There were times where we were saying to ourselves, they are happier then we are and we are on vacation.LOL! Seriously they could not have been nicer and the service on the beach and at the pool were also impecable. The food was good at every restaurant we ate at and we tried them all. I didi not know what to expect from soem of the reviews but I thought all the food was fine. No it was not 5 star cuisine but if your looking for that, you dont go to an all inclusive. As far as the previous review talking about having one or 2 restaurants closed a night. The hotel was not at full capacity. Now I dont know what time they were going to dinner but I had to wait 2 or 3 nights and although they tell you its 30 minutes or an hr. wait, it never was that long. All you did was go to the bar, have a few cocktails and eventually eat. Not a biggie for me. Another thing that surprised me wa sthe bug issue. WHERE WERE THEY?? I didi get some bug bites but I was never swatting at bugs and getting over whelmed by them. You would have thought from reading some of these reviews that there were swarms of bugs desending on you. Mayeb its a seasonal thing but it was not an issue. All and all it was everything I could have hoped for. The only knock I have is that the ride to and from the airport is rough. BUT they are about to pave a brand new highway which should serious;ly take 1/2 hr. off the ride because its more direct. The outside of the hotel needs a face lift as well but as far as the rooms were concerned, but now I am really critiqing. Its a greta hotel, maybe not 5 star but a very high 4 star standard.

The ride from the airport is really not a problem and the driver done well to make it comfortable. 1st impressions of the hotel, again very good, rooms and grounds are very clean, very nice and to a high standard, worthy of the 5 stars given. Food on the most part was very good and we could always get something we liked, A few problems like no English tea in the morning (they ran out apparently) & no cold milk most mornings for your cereal, may seem petty but after 2 wks gets a bit much, Not the kind of thing that should happen in a 5* hotel. The overall service throughout was very very poor indeed, everything just seemed to be very unorganised. Several times we were given the wrong order or other peoples orders, 1 time we were actually given the next tables food and my husband had eaten a piece not realising, then the waiter came up and took the plate from our table and put it on the next one!!!! Incase your wondering Yes we did tip, often and well but it made no difference. The beds are so uncomfortable, I was in agony every day with it. If your planning on peace and quiet then beware, theres work being carried out and the noise most days was pretty unbearable. The pools are lovely, but getting a bed proves a little difficult, we were up at 7am every morning and still missed out at times, this was partly due to some Americans having 2 beds in the sun, 2 in the shade & 2 floats under their beds even though they were asked repeatedly to leave them in the water. We even seen a couple reserve all these beds & then go inside, they never re-appeared until after 3 pm, so selfish!!! We also seen them in the pool with up to as many as 4 floats piled high, god forbid anyone else have a go for 10 mins!!! I know that your thinking, your on holiday chill out & enjoy, the pace is slower in DR, we do know this we have been to the caribbean several times now but have never experienced anything like it, by the end of the vacation we were like \"CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A DIET COKE AND A BEER\" not asking much!!!! Also the hotel is bad for getting pestered during the day at the pool, even if your asleep, there is people round constantly asking you to do things & a polite \"NO GRACIOUS\" doesnt do the trick, then theres the night time stalls who also dont take no for an answer, we ended up going detours all the time to avoid them. Also dont bother putting your do not disturb signs up, they are just ignored anyway. The people are very nice and do work long & hard hours, its just the organisation that let the place down.

We could go to their room, use the same beach and pool as they did. Our room was on the 2nd floor Excellence ocean view room. It was big with two sliding doors. Great view. We always tipped - and they are very grateful for $1-$5. I think that they would be nice and friendly either way. Make sure to bring plenty of money (dollars) there the ATM machine only gives pesos and they dont give out dollars at the front desk. We didnt have any trouble with finding chairs at the beach. It seems like everybody wants to be at the pool instead. The water is rough - but if you walked to the left of the resort on the beach and go to the bend t(big piece of wood in the sand) the water is smooth and great for swimming! The horseback riding was fun. The spa was the best! The foot heaven and excellence massages are the best! The food was good. Toscannas and Oregano we liked the best! Michael Jackson concert was good.

Did not happen that way he decided not to go NOT MY BOYFRIEND ANYMORE. In any case I went on my vacation. The plane ride was the plane ride from h**l a family with 3 children on the flight let thier children cry and carry on for the entire 4hr flight. So now I'm thinking this trip is doomed. The bus ride to the hotel is a little long about an hour, however the driver from Pierto Tours was great, one of the other passenger was joking about how he could go for a beer the next thing we knew the driver pulled over to get beer. Once at the resort I forgot about the plane ride. We were greeted with champagne and cold wash cloths. I stayed in the Excellence Club. As soon as I gave my name to the host I was promptly greeted by my conceige, pointed to my bags and in my room within 10 minutes. In the Excellence Club you will find a fully stock bar (all top shelf), big screen TV, 3 computers w/free internet also food all day. I must say the food at this resort is the best that I have had in Punta Cana. This was my 4th visit to Punta Cana. This resort is by far the best of the 3 that I have stayed in. I consider myself a very picky eater and I must say I have no complains about the food. I would advise anyone travel outside the U.S. to always pack some snack foods if you are like me you will crave some potato chips or candy. The room was large and had stocked bar with liquor. I do not like the Dominican rum that was left in my room so I asked if it could be replaced with Bacardi rum, I had the bottle within minutes. I will suggest that you bring you own iron the one in the room was not a steam iron and if you were not very very careful your cloths will be burnt. The beach and the ocean were great the water was warm but very rough and you are on the Pacific ocean. If you want to pick up a gift for someone go to Nancys she will bargain and give a great deal. Also if you want a massage ask Nancy it's only $45 for 70 minutes. Nancy is located on the beach if facing the ocean go to the left just outside the resort line. If you want to have fun I suggest you get involed in the daily activities offered by the resort and the entertainment crew. (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez ) I must say the entertainment crew are wonderful people they work really hard and long hours but are always smiling and very cheerful and upbeat. I must say if it was not for the Entertainment crew (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez) my trip would not have been as wonderful as it was. The nightly shows were great. The disco is a must while you are there go and learn a new dance from the Entertainment crew (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez) If you want to plan an excursion go see Johnny @ Pierto Tours in the lobby. I did the zipline what a blast. I will say the staff at this resort go above and beyond their duties to make your stay enjoyable and accomodating. For example one day they had rice pudding (very good) out and I did not see it the next day and asked for it they brought some out to me right away.

These guys know what they are doing and that's why this hotel is called excellence! The rooms are clean, the restaurants are great, our favorite was Chez Isabelle and the Spice, our least favorite was the Lobster House. You must eat at the Grill for lunch, everything on the menu was great. Toscana was great for dinner as well, if you like risotto, then you'll like this italian restaurant. Even room service was great and always arrived hot and with a smile. The entertainment staff was fantastic. These people work their butts off to ensure that you are having a great time. You must meet Rosemary and Innes from the entertainment, they're great. As far as excursions, we booked them through Happy Harry at the activity centre where you rent the boggy boards. He'll be sure to hook you up with any tour you want at the best prices and with a smile. As far as the beach goes, you are on the Atlantic side which has more waves then the carribean side but let me tell you how much fun that is. If you are not a good swimmer, then stay closer to the beach. Make sure you get a boggy board from Happy Harry and you'll have a blast in the water. Beach service is great, you don't have to get off your chair for a drink, they come to you. The best advice I can give you is to bring lots of dollar bills, these people deserve every penny of it.

Needless to say that we were looking forward to this vacation after a year of wedding planning! The resort is average, so if you go there with high expectations, LOWER THEM! The trip from the airport is like a ride at Six Flags, without the safety harnesses! It takes about an hour and a half to get to the resort, that's IF you don't have to make any stops at the other resorts. We used VIP transfer services. I do recommend them because I talked to other visitors who used private taxis or other transfer services who were not reliable at all and were stranded at the airport. The island itself is not somewhere you would ever visit if you're not staying at one of the resorts. What a dump! The resort itself is absolutely beautiful. The glass of champagne was much needed after that trip from hell from the airport. We had the honeymoon package and never recieved our banner for the door or rose petals on the bed. Never had a bath drawn for us like they advertise. Our romantic dinner was a nice touch, though. Our favorite restaurants were Spice and The Grill. Everything else was mediocre, at best. Do not go to th Lobster House for breakfast-horribly bland food and TERRIBLE service. My husband on multiple occassions in different restaurants had to go get our water for us. The waiter at the Lobster House for dinner was exceptional. My husband had to leave the table for a moment before our food was brought out and the waiter saw this, so he kept his food warm for him. The nightly shows were cheesy. The Michael Jackson show was great, however. We stayed at the pool bar all week long and met some great people who we will keep in touch with. This is where the partyers go, so if you like a quieter scene, stay at the Cascade pool. Stay away from the fruity drinks as much as possible. My husband and I both ended up with E. Coli and we attribute it to the fruits and possibly the ice. They say they use purified water for everything, but I think they most likely let some things slide. My husband is Latin and loives his flan. One day at the Toscana lunch buffett he asked to take some flan to go and they wouldn't let him, only pizza. He spoke with concierge and they were of no help. They told him to call room service and have it delivered. When he did, they don't offer it! The service is VERY up and down. It's either exceptional, or very poor. And forget eating luch by the pool, there is NO service there for food except for the occasional waiter carrying around soggy nachos. And, you have to be 100% dry to eat lunch in one of the two restaurants offering lunch. Breakfast at Toscana is not very good, either. The Martini Bar was fun. Make sure to ask for Marino if you like Dirty's. He makes a mean Dirty Martini. Try a Coco Loco, but only one! And, don't order off any of the drink menus. You'll get extremely week, way too fruity drinks. Stick with what you normally drink. Trust me, you'll get a much better drink. Yellow beach towels are like gold there. If you find some, it's like hitting the lottery! Only one day during our 7 day stay were we able to find towels. And, we got the last two at the Club House! The seas were very rough, so head down the beach to the right a ways and the waters are much calmer. Would we go back-no way! No more near hospital stays for us! We were so sick, my husband had to have antibiotics once we returned to the States. We had to buy Pepto and PediaLight at the Drugstore for $24!! During two separate occasions, my hubby had issues with the female hotel staff being in the restrooms. Once was in the lobby bathroom. There was a woman folding towels in the men's restroom. He asked her to please leave and she refused. I know there was not a lack of comunication because he speaks fluent Spansh. He left and went to our room to use the restroom. The housekeeper saw him walk into our room, even said hola to her. He walked back out of the restroom and she was in there making our bed! No knock or anything! And, having him speak Spanish was great, because the staff speaks very little English. The entertainment staff really tries to get everybody involved and they have so much energy. We're not into all the little activities, but if you are, there's plenty to do. So, to narrow it down: the major pro is the beauty of the resort.

It was an amazing time had by all that attended. We arrived at the resort around 4 am because of a delay at the airport in Vancouver, but even at 4 am, the service of the bellhops and the front desk was up to par. Our bags were unloaded and immediately tagged and set to one side of the lobby while we were handed cold scented towels to cool off with. Check in was fairly expedient and we were in our rooms within twenty minutes. I had never been to an all inclusive resort before, and wasted no time enjoying the pleasures of the mini bar in the room, as well as the ample storage space for our things. Room service even at 4 am was great, the girl on the phone said it would be about 40 minutes for the food, which seemed a little long, but I think they only say that to cover there butts, because it took about 25 minutes at most. The activities during the day were well thought out, though, there was some delays and cancellations due to weather conditions (beach volleyball cancelled to due strong winds.) The entertainment staff was amazing and extremely friendly, a special thanks to all my friends, Ines (my fiance,) Altagracia (who lovingly reffered to me as Flaco Loco, which translates into Crazy Skinny Guy,) Eliza and Johanna (my disco dance partners,) Sexy Cesar (who taught me all the sexy dance moves I now know,) Julio Cesar (the MC for the games and parties.) The restaurants I can't offer too much help with, I didn't eat at all of them, but of the few I did eat at, I recommend Toscana for the huge buffet everyday, breakfast here is well prepared and quite delicious (although I don't recommend the scrambled eggs.) The omlettes are delicious and you HAVE to try one. For lunch, you have to check out the grill on the beach, different food everyday, always good, and makes the beach smell amazing. For dinner, I liked Spice ( asian cuisine,) Agave (mexican, but don't eat the calimari from here, very rubbery,) The pizza that is delivered to the pool and the beach is awesome, make sure you try that. The bars were awesome, you get accustomed to speaking the language when ordering drinks, instead of drinking your usual bacardi and coke, try the Brugal Extra Anejo, they call it the Dominican babymaker, and it's obvious why once you try it. The stuff tastes amazing and it does magic for someone trying to loosen up on the dance floor. The disco is great too, although sometimes a little empty, but still worth checking out. The worst part of my trip was the vendors, they don't let up, and I am a very well mannered person, which makes it hard to shut them down over and over again, make sure you don't tell them you like anything until you know you're going to buy it, otherwise you'll have to beat them off with a stick to get away. Try to make it to the theatre for the shows at 10pm every night, they are worth it. The ice breaker shows are fun too, it gets people into the swing of things. All in all, I would highly recommend this resort for anyone going on a honeymoon or a romantic time with the better half, there is not a very big single crowd, so parents beware taking your single sons and daughters to this resort if they're looking to party with other singles. Hope this helps you.

The airport that is closest to Excellence is the Punta Cana Airport! We had to spend big $ to switch airports and airlines for our departure. Next, because we arrived so late, thanks to the long ride from the wrong airport, we were told that the room we paid for, which was partial oceanview, could not be honored, as they only had a courtyard/palm tree view available. Depressed and discouraged, we sucked it up until the next day, when they moved us to another courtyard/palm-tree room! As a compensation for this 5 day disaster, we were offered and accepted a dinner at the beach, even though all meals were paid for and inclusive. They actually told Liberty Travel that they felt that this was adequate compensation! In addition, the air conditioning in both rooms was not adequate, and sleeping was difficult. The first room had plumbing problems. When the toilet did not flush properly, and began to overflow, we called the plumber at 3 am. He kept us up for about an hour, working inside and outside the room. When we never heard from him again, we called the front desk, and told them not to send him back in, and that we would also deal with that problem on our own.

We did have the Excellence Club package and thought that it was worth it. You could get food or drink there all day if you preferred. Ricardo, Johan, Ana, Roberto, Magdilina and Carlos were really our family for the week. Their help with some problems we had w/ Expedia excursions was much appreciated. They couldn't do enough to make your stay \"Excellente\" . It was such a nice touch to have a prepared bubble bath awaiting us when we returned to our room after dinner on our last night there. All the staff members were courteous and helpful and always greeted you with a smile. Our room was great. Spacious enough for two and had a nice little patio and hammock in the yard.

We were celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We arrived after a long flight and 1 hour journey by bus very tired and were welcomed by the reception staff with a drink of wine each. When we got to our room we were 'over the moon' with it, it was fantastic with a four poster bed and jacuzzi we had never stayed at a 5 star hotel before so this was all new to us. The hotel itself was fantastic and the gardens were very well kept, we stayed in building 9 our room was on the seond floor and the view of the gardens and fountains was fantastic! It was so peaceful we never heard any noise at all in the fortnight we stayed there. We tended to go to the beach most of the time as there was a lovely breeze there you can walk along the beach for miles in both directions but beware of the beach vendors who will 'pounce' on you and then hassle you until you buy something from them. Also when it is cloudy beware as you will still get burnt as we did so make sure you use sun cream all the time and cover up. The mosquitos also come out late afternoon so cover up then as you will get bitten. The staff do come round every evening in a truck with what looks like a cannon that fires out mosquito killer stuff out of it and this seems to kill them off for the rest of the evening. They couldn't have treat us better on our Anniversary Day we had a champagne breakfast in bed and a lovely meal in the Spice restaurant on the night-time it was really special. I would recommend taking loads of dollar bills for tips and also remember to keep 20 dollars each as you need this to get out of the country. The only downside to this holiday was the roads - full of pot-holes - and the fact that there was nothing else to do or any where to go outside the hotel, also some of the restaurants were not up to standard ie Toscana, The Grill and Chez Isabelle the others were ok - Spice, Agave and Oregano. The food for breakfast and lunch was the best as it was buffet-style and the quality and choice was really good.

Second choice would be Barcelona. This is the Mediterranean restaurant and was very good. I had the mushroom risotto and my husband had a shrimp dish. This restaurant is connected to Toscano and could be missed as its not on the map, but please try it out. We really liked it! Third pick would go to Agave (mexican) due to the fun atmosphere and great food. The Grill and Toscano are the only options for lunch each day and got a little old after a few days as the menus don't change. But the food was good and it hit the spot for a nice afternoon lunch. Breakfast is only served via Room Service, Toscano and Lobster House. We went to Toscano each morning except one where we chose RS. This was fantastic and I highly recommend it. We had a wonderful meal in our PJ's on the balcony. Again, as there are only a couple of choices for breakfast, it became a little repetitive. But the food was always delicious! The only bad thing I'll say about the restaurants is that I felt they were a little too bright in the evenings.

The food at the seafood restaurant was precooked and stored in heating trays. The selection was very disappointing because seafood was not even on the menu. Our only choices were various fish fillets. Seafood such as lobster and shrimp was on the menu at Secrets Capri in the Mayan Riviera. The quality of the food was also not to our expectations. Some of the food was cold and the fish had a bad taste. We were also disappointed that the salads and desserts were on a bar that was self-serve.

The drinks at the main pool swim-up bar were served in cheap disposable plastic cups and an employee would push around a large trash can to collect the cups. At Secrets Capri drinks were served in fancy plastic reusable cups that were shaped like regular hurricane or margarita glasses. Needless to say, we felt service around the pool at Secrets Excellence in Punta Cana was poor. Food service was even available around the pool at Secrets Capri. No food options were to be found at the pool areas at Secrets Excellence, except hard, dried out fried foods that sat out all day and which you had to go get yourself and the very far end of the lagoon style pool.

My wife was very upset at this turn of events. None the less, what could we do? We took the 'club excellence' room. The 3 days in the 'club excellence' room were ok, but not Excellent. We didn't get fresh fruit nor, did we get a beach bag. In the grand scheme of things, it really didn't bother me but, we were promised it and it never came. After the 3rd night, as promised we were moved to the Honeymoon Suite. This caused some bit of distress as we had to repack our bags for the move. In the confusion, my wife left a dress behind. She didn't notice it till after we moved. We felt the hotel offered minimal assistance to retrieve it instead telling us (with a smile as always) to call the old room directly. The new guests in our old room didn't answer nor did they return our call. (why should they?) As far as the Honeymoon Sutie, we saw the outdoor jacuzzi was badly in need of maintenence. It wasn't cleaned thoroughly and had a large unsightly crack on the top. Since it was above the waterline, it was still usable. Really wanting to use the jacuzzi, I gave it a quick cleaning and attempted to fill it up. Ok, so now the drain doesn't work. A quick call to the front desk brought a maintenence man who found a worn gasket and replaced it with a new one. (Again, great response and service from the staff). But, come to find out after filling the tub that it had a slow leak from an unknown source. By this time, we were too burned out from constantly going to the front desk and concierge to get things fixed. Not wanting to go through another room change, we decided not to take any further action on the jacuzzi. Although it leaked and had a crack, it was still usable. In addition there were some other inconveniences at the resort. They're proud to say they have 8 restaurants. Yet, on any day, 2 of them are closed. Also, unless you choose to have dinner before 6 or after 9- you can expect a wait of over an hour. A couple other things were disappointing, the resort allowed aggresive outside vendors in to the resort 2 nights a week. We did not pay so much to be hassled by commissioned sales people to buy their \"chotchkas\". They also promoted specific major league baseball games in their sports bar. The only games shown were what ESPN has as their game of the week. A quick tip for travelers to resorts in the Dominican Republic: It helps to have a rudimentary knowledge of Spanish. Knowing Spanish helped alot when I had to explain things to the maintenence staff. Most staff are fluent in English but, they really liked it when spoken to in Spanish. All that being said, we did have a great honeymoon but, felt we didn't receive the total value we expected. Was it Excellent? No. But, it was still pretty good.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "SassySouthCarolinian", "date": "July 19, 2008", "id": 18046521}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed at Excellence Punta Cana from July 5-July 12 with my boyfriend. I was very scared to go considering the plethera of bad reviews I was reading... there were bugs, the maid service was bad, the car ride was nauseating, the food made them sick... etc. The trip to the resort was not as bad as the hype. You could tell the roads were in bad shape, but the ride wasn't bumpy enough that it'd make you physically ill or anything The drivers do the best they can to avoid the pot holes. We chose to stick with the free transfer as opposed to getting a taxi or private car, and as it turns out, the bus ride was still only an hour and went directly to the resort. Therefore, I recommend that you don't shell out extra money on unnecessary transportation. The resort is beautiful. The rooms are spacious and beautiful as well. We had no bug problems in the room, although the mosquitos outside are pretty bad. We brought bug spray and still got quite a few bites. The maid service was great, our room was cleaned daily so we had no issues with that. The restaurants are okay- neither good nor bad. Go early though, because from 8 o'clock onwards, you're looking at a good hour wait no matter which restaurant you choose. The nightly entertainment was cute I though. It was nice because it ran from 10 pm- 10:30 pm and by that time you're pooped from the sun and just want to head to bed anyway. The drinks were delicious. I recommend the coco loco in a coconut. If you want a bed on the beach... GO EARLY... just put a book or something on one of them before breakfast to reserve it. The shops on site are nice but expensive. We ran out of sunscreen and had to pay 18 bucks U.S. for one there... it hurt. STAY AWAY FROM THE VENDORS ON SITE THAT ARE WEARING GREEN SHIRTS... THEY HARASS YOU TO BUY THEIR STUFF. IT IS VERY ANNOYING. All in all, it was a very enjoyable trip. I wouldn't go back because there's so many other places and resorts to see but I definitely don't regret going and sincerely enjoyed my time there. I will never forget my 7 day stay at Excellence Punta Cana. Two more things real quick... #1- you will make so many friends while you're there... the other coupls are so friendly #2- the Dominicans really appreciate being tipped in ways other than monetary. We gave things away like clothing, books, and school supplies. If you can fit stuff in your luggage, bring random stuff that you're not using anymore.

Secondly it's passing time at work, and the majority of the complainers, I would be willing to bet have nothing better to do with their free time. I've visited 11 all inclusive resorts in the past 3 years with my job and this is by far the best.

No tip No service, or I should say, service at there convience. (Just my experience, been to both twice.) Like the last review I read said, $75 dollars would be fine. The food was great. I was there to enjoy the peacefulness, surroundings, my new wife, not to critique the food. Yes, the food on the buffet wasn't always warm, but what buffet is? Grab a plate of the lbs of fresh fruit, and enjoy yourself. If your main concern is the buffet, I recommend hitting up a Western Sizzler on your way to 6 flags for your honeymoon. Yes the waves were big, but we enjoyed that, if you don't, you can take your pick of a number of fantastic pools.

Mosquitoes hang out in front of the door and rush in whenever you go in or out. There were also little bugs crawling around in the bathroom. Bring neosporin and bandaids and anything else you would put in a first aid kit. The drs. office was terrible.

The room was nice but full of bugs and the main problem I had of the room was the mini bar I call 3 times cause it was not working the drinks were hot, when i finally got someone to check it out I was told the mini bar was suppose to keep the drink in room temperature. ( how the hell someone is gonna have a beer in room temp) I complained a thousand times to the General manager Mr Montanez problem never got fixed. The food was horrible, room service was the worse I rather eat White castle hamburgers. If you pick this resort for the Lobster House like I did don't is the worsed restaurant in the resort. The only restaurant that's good is the Spice, and the grill. By the way if you wanna eat at the Agave keep waiting every night it was full so you really eat at 2 of the 8 restaurant. the service was horrible in the restaurant it takes about 15 min to 30 min to get your order if you are lucky. And the service by the pool or through out the resort is also horrible I think this resort is under staff. I use the word horrible a lot cause thats the only word that can described my experience in the resort.

Make sure you tour the property when you arrive, we didn't find the sports bar or the second pool till our 3rd day. We tipped but only when someone did a great job; I felt that sometimes they expected a tip in advance, got a little sick of that.

Neither of us got sick; but we stayed away from fish, fruit and salads (and therefore gained 10 pounds a piece while we were there!!!)
