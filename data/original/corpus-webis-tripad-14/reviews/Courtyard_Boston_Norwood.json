The hotel met our needs, providing a third bath towel/wash cloth for our 17 yr old. Our room was quiet even though the hotel was packed with soccer players participating in a tournament, who were located on the first floor near the entrance to the indoor swimming pool. We had a very comfortable king mattress, and the sofa bed sufficed for two nights. Sofa bed mattresses are just never going to be the greatest. Make-your-own waffles pleased the kids and plenty of other options made for a delicious breakfast. The hotel is a older and shows its age only in the size of its bathrooms, which are on the small size. The staff was very nice and made us feel welcome. We would definitely stay here again.", "title": "it worked for us", "user": "Liz1953", "date": "May 31, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7725267, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the overall courtyard product/staff", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing bad about this hotel"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite for 1 night with our two children (5 and 7).
