I'm a SPG platinum member and I've stayed at this hotel dozens of times and the regular staff recognize me by face. There is no such thing as an \"upgraded\" room at this hotel cause all the rooms are basically the same. Some have old tube TV's and the newer/upgraded rooms have a flat panel. Other than that there is no difference in rooms. Many times I've checked in with a confirmed king bed reservation and all they have are double beds. As a platinum guest I should ALWAYS get my confirmed reservations regardless of capacity. I always request high floors because the windows aren't that well insulated. If you happen to get a non-street facing room, especially on a low floor, you will be bombarded by noise coming from a bar on 24th street. This bar has an outdoor back patio and the noise carries all the way to the top floor. If you happen to get a room next to an Ice Machine...then goodbye sleep. Another MISS are the pull down shades. While they look modern and trendy they don't block out any light. Good luck trying to sleep in. Once I did have a room with curtains and pull down shades and this was a slight improvement in blocking out the light. When I was there last they were upgrading/fixing the elevators. They did an upgrade to the elevators a few years earlier which resulted in a really bad wood stain on the panels and burlap type of material on the rest of the cab. Unfortunately the stain was very poor and the fabric material is worn and doesn't hold up to the daily wear and tear.
