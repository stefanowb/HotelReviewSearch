When we presented ourselves at the reception desk for our 3 night stay in July 2008 we were politely told that our Straits Suite had been double booked. This news is normally a vacationer's nightmare. But instead of any anguish we were upgraded at no extra cost to a much larger and luxurious Writer's Suite (the Somerset Maugham), about 135sqm of absolute comfort on the first floor of this magnificent 1885 building. This seafront hotel has been refurbished without regard for cost, maintaining its marble and wooden floors, wide passageways and high ceilings. It is visually impressive but functional and comfortable. Our suite consisted of three rooms - a bedroom, large bathroom (with his/her wash basins) and a huge living/dining room. There was one toilet in the bathroom and another in a room off the living room. We had excellent ocean views, and windows which fully opened. Airconditioning was silent and very effective. All staff at the E&O are friendly and obliging, and we were treated to a butler, who was available at the ring of a bell. Breakfasts were in Sarkies Corner, the groundfloor restaurant. All manner of food was available. Guests could sit in the restaurant, or outside on the verandah near the sea wall. We chose to breakfast outdoors, to enjoy the cool morning air and the ambience. Three internet computers were available to guests, and there was no charge for their use. And there is broadband connection to rooms, for guests with their own laptops. For dinner there is a buffet in Sarkies, with a different theme each night. We dined there on the first night of our stay (a Saturday). Whilst the food was extensive and very appetising (all you can eat, with free flow of wine), the restaurant became very congested and noisy, and my wife and I were pleased to have chosen an outside table, on the verandah. The outdoor pool at ground level is clean, cooling and tranquil. I shouldn't forget Farquhers Bar, where I spent a little time. It is a good place for a quiet drink, a pub in colonial Malaya style, just off the lobby. As other advisers have reported the E&O Hotel is in the heart of Georgetown. Getting around on foot or by rickshaw or taxi is very easy, and there is plenty to see and do close to the hotel. For guests who book direct (as we did) and are not on a package, it is worth noting that in addition to a room charge, the E&O imposes a 10% service charge and a further 5% government tax.
