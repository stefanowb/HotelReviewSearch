This is a very touristy hotel and you have to expect a lot of people at breakfast. We struggled to get seats and had to sit seperately with other people. We lined up for our breakfast and a woman supervisor behind the serving counter was quite rude, People were asking her for what they wanted on their plates and I heard her saying 'oh my god' to the other girl because one person didnt want everything available. Wouldnt they prefer people to say what they dont want on their plate, instead of wasting good food? I asked for Bacon, egg and toast and got sausage banged on my plate regardless!!
