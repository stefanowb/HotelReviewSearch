Nothing was mentioned about the $15 resort fee upon check-in, but we knew about it going in. The hotel was a good size, but certainly not HUGE, in my opinion, like everyone has said it was. We've stayed at several hotels in Las Vegas and those are huge. Even the Gaylord in Nashville, TN was larger than this one. The walk to our room was very pleasant and did not take long at all. We had an atrium view room, which was beautiful, to say the least. The room was perfectly put together and the bathroom was gorgeous with its marble tile floor and granite countertops. The shower had a very forceful stream, which to me was very nice. People has complained on here about the \"plastic\" cups in the bathroom. They were plastic, but were a better quality than you find in your local Super 8. I, personally, don't care if the cups are plastic or glass. That's not on the top of the requirement list when I'm looking for a hotel! The beds were super comfy and there was a flat screen TV that was at least 42\" in size. I didn't use the WiFi internet, but did use it via the cord provided at the desk and had NO problems whatsoever with connecting. I agree with some previous posters about the AC unit. It does get a little loud when it kicks on, but it wasn't loud the entire time. In other words, it's not distracting. I had to call for extra washcloths once and they were in our room within 10min. Every hotel employee we came in contact with was extremely friendly! We called \"conside it done\" for valet and our car was there every time we got outside. They tell you to give them up to 10min. to have your car ready. As far as the food in the hotel, it was all great. Yes, pricey, but it's a RESORT! My advice is to buy some sodas before you get there because a 20oz soda costs $3.14 with tax. We utilized the pool facilities and they were very nice. My only wish is that there was an outdoor pool. They have several lounge chairs on a patio, but no outdoor pool...just an indoor. There are, however, 3 jacuzzis (one inside and two outside).
