S-L-O-W doesn't even begin to describe it and the manager on duty actually argued with us about why we had not even received our drinks after 20 minutes and another family came right in and sat down and were served right away and that was just one of the 3 days we went there for brkfst! UNBELIEVABLE!! We resorted to finding other dining outside the resort, we HIGHLY recommend The Hacienda right down the street from the Condado for breakfast/lun/din, great seaside affordable dining experience, their coffee was awesome too! The rest of our stay was awesome, the hotel was beautifully decorated, very chic! One of the many highlights of our stay at the Condado, we had our 15 yr old son with us, was the staff at the Aqua Bar, Sterling, David and Joey (Eyes). These guys were the greatest, Sterling makes a mojito to die for, my son really made fast friends of these three, he looked fwd to each day going down to the pool and chatting with them, if you go tell them the Elliot's from Indiana say HI!. Wish the beach was bigger but still a great location for being close to a ton of things to do and see, El Yonque (caribbean rainforest) is a must see and El Morro in Old San Juan was amazing as well!

So if the toilet was busy, forget about someone else getting clothes, ice or anything else. Our son jumped in the shower,only to find that the shower drain was plugged, flooding the room.

The staff was very nice and accomodating and very helpful...the pool area was fantastic... the beach at the hotel is very tiny but serves a purpose...If you want more of a beach then walk up the street to the Marriott (public beach) rent chairs for $5 for the day and enjoy. The food and drinks are a bit pricey at the hotel but you can also go up the street we found alot of nice places to eat and the food was fantastic! I recommend Hacienda Don Jose right up the street.....ocean view to die for!!! great breakfast, lunch and dinner and very inexpensive. Also for dinner we went into Old San Juan and ate at a very nice place called Raices (Cuban food) (make reservations the hotel will make them for you). very good!!! Also try Cafe del Angel up the street as well and Ropa Vieja.......Tip....buy your beer, wine, etc at the package store up the street as well and buy a small cooler as you can take it on the beach becuase it;s public instead of buying a beer for $8 of a frozen drink for $10..We loved it so much that we just booked another trip for april!!!!

We played tennis in the morning, and there was no problem getting a reservation. Our room was well cleaned, sheets included, every morning. For the price we paid, I believe this is a good value. To be honest, there were a few things that caught our eye: This hotel does need a facelift. Carpets and walls were well worn. Our room was nice, but overall things could be updated. I am not usually petty; however, the condition of the carpets in the hallways really stood out, and gave this hotel a \"motel\" feel. If you prefer a beach setting this is not your place. The beach is tiny. The pool area is nice. If you have children they will love the water slide. Overall the pool/beach area was just ok. Again, hate to complain - just pointing out a few problems. We chose to take the C10- .25 cent bus to Ocean Park beach. Now there is a beach!! Beautiful. On a good note: The bed, and down comforters, and pillows were excellent. Very Very comfortable. Shower pressure, excellent (which is a definate plus in the Carribean!). We took the advice of some previous posters and headed down the block to La Hacienda for an absolute delicious breakfast next to the open windows overlooking the ocean.

We ate lunch at the pool bar every day and found the prices and service wonderful. We discovered 2 great places for breakfast and dinner within a very short walk from the hotel. We had full eggs/bacon breakfasts at the Nueva Hacienda by the open windows overlooking the ocean crashing on the rocks. Breakfasts were around $5 and wonderful, especially the coffee with steamed milk. The Waikiki next door was even more scenic as we sat outside on the terrace and again watched the ocean crashing on the rocks beneath us. Meals were under $20 for dinner. One night we went to a highly recommened restaurant, called Ajili Mojily (slightly more high end) on the lagoon side. We didn't have a table with a view, but had an enjoyable meal with a very friendly staff, and the highest price meal was around $26. The casino at the Condado Plaza was good size for Puerto Rico and we had fun there too.

Also, they tack on a porterage fee if you are part of a group even if you don't arrive as a group so you end up tipping twice.

What do you expect them to do change out a mattress in 24 hours..they probably didn't even notice until you pointed it out. And everyone has a bad day..don't blame the concierge for everything. Yes this hotel has a vibrant lobby, but I did not hear it from my room. And it is fun and convenient, you can get dressed up and go down for a couple drinks, then to the casino adjacent. This was a very modern, CLEAN hotel and very fun! I travel once a month, I work for an airline so I'm always somewhere, and this is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. Nice, modern, fresh lobby, has a very miami vibe. Great DJ on the weekends. The rooms are modern and clean, comfortable bed (definetly spring for the ocean front room..it makes all the difference!) The view can't be beat, and the waves crashing onto the rocks while you sleep is sure to slip you into a great calming dream :) The staff was totally nice and so helpful. Didn't have a problem with anyone and I stayed for 5 days. The facilities are very nice, great gym, two outdoor hot tubs, and big clean pools. It has a beach on the side which is also a public beach but very safe and clean. Small but lovely, it is on a lagoon which on sunny days is perfect for snorkeling! This is a great base for exploring the island or for before or after a cruise. I had a great time!

The room was unclean and adjoined another room which was something we specifically asked not to happen. Again we were told that there were no other rooms available until the next day.

The staff was exceptional! ex: Carlos from housekeeping- day 1 I went to a cart outside my room to ask if I could have a few more coffee packets- he gave them to me with a smile- instead of acting like I was keeping him from doing his job- the next day I went to a cart outside my room -again it was Carlos, he smiled and said \"coffee- regular not decaf, right?\" he remembered what I wanted and that detail made me feel very welcomed and at home. another example - Michelle, our poolside server, was very accommodationg- to us, and those seated at the pool around us- we ordered breakfast poolside- one morning it must have been 11:30 by the time we ordered and instead of saying \"no\" and handing us the lunch menu in her hand- she went back to the kitchen to get us the breakfast menu and check with the kitchen to see if it was o.k. to order breakfast. It was! We were there Superbowl Sunday and the hotel went to great lengths to make it special- they set up big screens in the main lobby lounge, the poolside restaurant and one in the back of Varita restaurant- we chose the lobby - it was sponsored by Rums of Puerto Rico and there were raffle tickets if purchasing discounted rum drinks. Many peope won t-shirts, Rum, travel mugs and gift basket- it was fun and festive! I really enjoyed my stay thanks to the customer service skills of the management and staff. I own a small Boutique on the CT shore and people come in this time of year looking for resort wear- when we share Caribbean destination stories- I will recommend Condado Plaza for service and value. I plan to make this long weekend and annual event. I do have one negative about my stay which the hotel has no control over- except the impression on its visitors- we walked Ashford Avenue the first afternoon- leaving the lobby the first thing we saw was the abandoned, graffittied, crumbling building next door, it made me sick to see such a sight- so sad in fact we turned around and went right back to the hotel.
