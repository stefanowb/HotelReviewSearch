I was there for six nights. While we had a room street side (on Pike) we did not find the traffic noise too unbearable. The suite was large and comfortable with a full fridge, microwave, two burners, sink, dishes, utensils and appliances. Ice machine location was quite inconvenient. Unfortunately the hotel allows smoking so either the smoke or the powerful chemical \"cover-up\" fragrance attacked you in the hallway. This is the reason I went 4 stars on cleanliness otherwise it was superb. The free breakfast (every day) and dinner (Mon to Thurs) with beer and wine was a pleasant extra. Local newspaper and free internet were appreciated. The staff were friendly and provided great service and advice. Flat rate by taxi from the airport to the hotel is $32 and once at the hotel they have a shuttle for various locations downtown. This location is ideal and we walked to the convention centre two blocks away, Key Arena, Pike Place Market, and around downtown.
