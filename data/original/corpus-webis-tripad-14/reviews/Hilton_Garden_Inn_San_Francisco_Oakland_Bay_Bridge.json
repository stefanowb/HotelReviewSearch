We were told that the Emery Go Round provided service which is fine however she discovered the next day that the Holiday Inn has a complimentary shuttle for guests to and from the BART station. No one bothered to tell us this at check in despite our inquiry! Also asked at front desk if they had BART schedules...which they didn't. I didnt think that this was an unreasonable request since two BART stations are fairly close and it would seem logical that out of town guests might need to know this. The front desk clerk said \"oh, they run about every 20 minutes\" which we found out is totally untrue-it's actually about every 5 minutes so I am perplexed as to why they would give information that isnt accurate at all. I then decided I would just use the business center computer/internet to find the schedule myself. There was a fee to use the internet which was hard to swallow since I was used to places such as the Berkeley Doubletree Marina just up the road where guests have access to computers/internet/printers for free. I went ahead since it was necessary and when I tried to print out the schedule, the printer wouldnt work. I then went to the front desk and explained my problem. A different clerk, who was alone, said \"I am really not technologically savvy so I dont know what to do.\" I then asked if there was someone else on the property that could try to help me with this problem and I was told \"no I am the only one here.\" At this point, I am thinking you have got to be kidding! I have paid for the business center which isn't working and this is the help/response I get!?!?!? They never even offered to comp the charge much less try to help. Unbelievable! Aside from this, the front desk personnel is NOT friendly and obviously not helpful at all. They seem to have an attitude that they are being bothered despite me asking nicely for all the things above. My other problem is that in terms of the condition of the hotel and rooms, they are not worth the $99 per night I was charged at all. The place is quite rundown and the room was very small. The final thing was we asked that the room be away from the elevator and we expressed that our request was in the hopes that we might have a room that was on the quiet side. So where do they give us a room...on the end of the property that has a 24 hour gas/convenience station just yards away...brilliant! All of this happened within the first 15 hours of our stay!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Drummer46241", "date": "February 24, 2005", "id": 3229103}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not Up To Par", "text": "I have traveled a great deal, rarely if ever complain (or have a problem), and can make the best of just about any hotel stay but this experience was terrible!

The room was okay - no fridge, but clean & large enough. The bed was terrible - king-size, which was great, but saggy in the middle & creaked & groaned. Time for a replacement. We were booked for three nights but on our second night, the hotel was swarmed with teenagers & occupied the rooms right next door to us. They partied all night long - we were woken after midnight & had to call the desk twice. The kids were out in the hall, yelling, singing, moving from room to room & just generally being kids, which is not okay when ensconced right next door to middle aged folk who need to sleep. Next morning we asked to be moved but were informed if we moved to another floor we would have the same problem. There were teenagers all through the hotel. So, essentially, we were told tough luck. We checked out & left San Francisco one day early.

I was very surprised at the quality of the room. The hotel is newly remodeled. The rooms have flat screen tv's and the alarm clock/radio has an MP3 connection available. The rooms is pretty large. The bathroom, though not particularly big, it is much bigger than at the Four Points. Front desk was not particularly friendly and they assigned me a room right next to the elevators and overlooking a roof with an air conditioner. I could hear people when they got off the elevator. Luckily it was not too busy at night. The bed was also at a 45 degree angle to the TV which I found awkward. I did not get a chance to try out their restaurant or room service. Although it is close to the Four Points, walking to the bay st area for shopping/dinning/movies is not much of an option compared to the Four Points. The freeway is in the way and you would probably have to drive. Although I normally prefer the Four Points, if the room rate is lower, or the same, the Hilton is a better choice.", "title": "Great recently renovated hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "travelSanFrancisco", "date": "June 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 7752272, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness, size of room, room amenities", "disliked": "\u2014 Room location, view"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Terrible Stay", "text": "Rarely do I complain about a location I've stayed at, but this was terrible. 1st they gave me a key and programmed it wrong.
