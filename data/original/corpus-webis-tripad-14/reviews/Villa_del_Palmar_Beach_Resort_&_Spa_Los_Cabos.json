I had found a package online for an amazing price and of course we had to sit through the 90 minute timeshare presentation. Which, by the way, is NEVER only 90 minutes even when you tell them you have another committment. Too much high pressure. We really liked the resort, the food, the barstaff etc. Didn't like the fact that you must sign for everything even though we were all inclusive and had our bracelets on. No cash at all....just like on a cruise ship. On our last night, we had the bill slipped under our door to review and had the option of filling out the paperwork and it would automatically get charged to our credit card. We chose not to do that because we wanted to pay cash. The next morning upon checkout, we had the correct amount of cash in hand and the desk clerk prints off another bill with a larger amount. Try to get them to explain why the amount went up from about 8 hours before (which by the way we never left our room or charged any additonal charges to it) was nearly impossible. They just kept saying, this is your new bill.....that bill is wrong. But to this day we don't know why it changed. As a result we did end up putting it on our credit card and now that we are home, trying to dispute it with the card company. Just be very careful.....they will try and scam you if they can.", "title": "Nice place, but beware of your final bill.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Laurie W", "date": "February 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 124575940}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed at the Villa del Palmar for 4 days in February 2012.
