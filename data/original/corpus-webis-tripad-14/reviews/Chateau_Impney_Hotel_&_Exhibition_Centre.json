The xmas meal was then shown to us at the carvery table and we were attended to by 3 members of staff. The meal was lovely, well cooked and the vegetables just right, The meat was lean and cooked to perfection, all of us remarked on how well the food tasted. The waitresses very attentitve , After puddings we were shown back to the piano bar and given mince pies, coffee and sparkling wine and served from the bar, The pianist was still playing .

After reading the reviews on here I was very sceptical about booking but I\u2019m so glad I did. Yes, the hotel has recently been sold, yes it needs a substantial amount of money spending on it, yes the room had a very shabby and stained carpet, chipped woodwork and the d\u00e9cor was very dated. Now on to the positive points. The room was huge (as was the bathroom), was well furnished and best of all absolutely spotlessly clean. All the furniture was highly polished and there wasn\u2019t a speck of dust anywhere (I even scrutinised down the side of the armchairs, very sad I know!).
