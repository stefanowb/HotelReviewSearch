It had more character than most Holiday Inns and was well decorated. I just stayed here again last week and was truly sorry I did. Maybe the hurricane damage or money problems are the cause, but it just looked shabby and dirty. I convinced two other friends to stay and they were equally disappointed. One friend had to move rooms due to mold on her wallpaper and a broken air conditioner and was given an equally bad room with peeling wallpaper. My toilet broke on the first flush. Even with armed security fuards downstairs (who we had to call to escort us to our room after being followed by a drunk, lost and menacing guest ), we were scared to walk the long hallways at night alone. There were no visible video surveillance cameras. The front desk was often understaffed, the elevators were frightening (one broke after making awful sounds for a few days) and dirty, and the place smelled of smoke. The pool was the jewel of the place, still beautiful after all these years. I would say for the price, try to get a different hotel!
