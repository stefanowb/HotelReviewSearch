A very small, but clean and perfectly adequate accomodation. This one was on 12th floor, so really nice & quiet that far up from the street. Excellent location with a quick 7 blocks to Pike's Public Market and only a few blocks to Monorail going to Space Needle. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. As an added review I would suggest Elliott's for dinner, right on the water, wooonderful food!! Skip The Fisherman's restaurant down the street from it (mediocre at best & in similar price range) and as far as transportation to/from airport, the Gray Line Airporter Shuttle is fine coming from airport, but DO NOT get the round trip ticket(s), as the bus never showed up for us after waiting over an hour and finally rushing to take a cab.", "title": "Good Value and Close To Convention Center", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Factory_tour_man", "date": "June 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 32059424}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was exhibiting and attending a conference in the compensation and HR industry for my company (---------------) at the Seattle Convention Center.

And the staff finally had one of their own operating the elevator. When I returned some hours later, the elevator again would ignore the button at the first floor and would not open unless someone from another floor happened to come to the first floor. Quite annoying. There was one guest who was being particularly obnoxious to the staff and the staff were calm in the midst of adversity which I appreciated. The room: I think offering four dollars for use of the bottled water was a bit much and the hotel should re-think its policy on that. The television was appreciated. The coffeemaker ran well and did its thing. The divider doors in 1203 do stick and not close correctly, but I didn't need that. Overall good experience.
