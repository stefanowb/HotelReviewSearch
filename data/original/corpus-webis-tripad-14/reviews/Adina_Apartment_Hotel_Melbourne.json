We booked a one bedroom unit which was on the 9th floor, very spacious and had great amenities like a full kitchen and laundry in the unit. The location of the hotel is also really fantastic. BUT.... the airconditioning didn't work, in fact I think it heated the room rather than cooling it. Thankfully the windows opened, and we actually prefer fresh air anyway. The laneway which the windows opened onto was a little bit noisy at times but not too bad. The bathroom was not very clean, the vent in the ceiling was full of dirt and dust. The shower was terrible, spraying every where but down. The cleaners were supposed to service the apartment, but this only involved making the bed. One day the cleaner didn't arrive until 4:30pm, then when we asked for 5 mins so that we could go out while they cleaned, they said they couldn't wait because they were finished for the day. Then at the end of the stay, they tried to charge us for two in-house movies that we didn't watch, when we weren't even in the hotel at the time - when we disputed this the manager waived the cost, but the person on reception treated like we were being dishonest. It was a shame because the location was really fantastic, but we won't be staying here again.

The one issue was the showers had no water pressure and it was difficult to keep an even temperature when standing under the trickle- it was mostly cold if I'm honest! As you can appreciate when there are 8 of us trying to get ready to go out this was a nightmare as we could only shower in one bathroom in each apt at a time. I also had a room next to the lift. This wasn't a problem for me as living up north I am used to constant noise from industrial a/c. You would have to be a very light sleeper for it to be a nuisance.
