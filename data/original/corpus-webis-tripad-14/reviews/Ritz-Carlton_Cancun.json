We tend to like non-chain type places but we were traveling with extended family and opted for compromise. That said we had a great time. It was quiet, not a lot going on in the way of activities and small enough to be manageable and comfortable and really family friendly. It was esp. great for families with young children given the \u201ckids club\u201d and overall highly accommodating vibe. We got a surprisingly reasonable deal by going through AMEX, so I strongly recommend that you call them to arrange your accommodations if you are a cardholder. We probably saved $600 just by doing that; our family of four ate breakfast for free everyday, we got a free night, a free upgrade & $100 toward any hotel service we wanted (we used toward the kids club which is only for kids who are potty trained.) This ended up being a much more affordable hotel choice than lower quality hotels after all of the AMEX discounts were applied.

The ladies obviously had s strategy; the kids were dying to go back the next day, which was great. The only con for parents here is that the pool doesn\u2019t have any zero entry points, which is not ideal with little ones. I would bring floaties if you are with young swimmers. As a plus the pool is really warm & well heated so it was still usable on chilly days (we had 2 of those.) Another con is that the ocean is too rough for little ones, but great for adults.

You may take a taxi if you want to go to the other end. Or, catch the bus in-front of the hotel. Public transportation is readily available. Buses are modern, clean, safe, and fun to ride on them. The beach is clean with very fine white sand that feels like talc. The ocean is inviting and there are many aquatic related activities worth pursuing.", "title": "Luxury stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Luis S", "date": "November 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144615873}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I was there for the Cancun Travel Mart and was really disapointed, my expectations very high due to the reputation of this chain but the rooms are not anything special, Internet in the rooms is pricy, impossible to drink Coke since the owner of the property aparently is the owner of Pepsi distribution in Mexico....the service is good but nothing out of extraordinary.

I realize it is \"The Ritz\", but really, $20 per day per device for internet access? This alone would add $40/day to our tab for the two of us, or $520 to our planned 13 day stay. Rather than allowing ourselves to be victimized by these thugs we have accepted the inconvenience of having to walk several blocks where free internet service is available, and apparently still profitable to the provider. What a way to treat one's \"guests\"! Then there's the matter of $15 for a pot of coffee in the morning. No continental breakfast...that's just for the coffee! And the food in the hotel's restaurants? Count on 3 times the cost of outside restaurants of comparable quality.

I highly reccomend dinner one night in the Casitas, wonderful experience, so relaxing and the food was great. We loved how they had a double chaise lounge outside each Casita for you to relax in between courses. The water at the beach was so beautiful, there were plenty of places to sit by the pool, we went in May. I would highly reccomend this hotel.

The hotel is elegant in most respects, though some wear in carpets, and coffee pods for the machine are included only the first morning which seemed a silly cost-saving. We had an easy time scheduling events for the kids through the concierge, and our trips to Excaret, Chichen Itza, etc., were good. Lovely white sand beaches with first-class lifeguards which is important as the surf/current can get a bit rowdy. There are two outstanding gourmet restaurants, expensive and worth every penny. The other two restaurants are very good and quite reasonable. The only downside was that it being July the pools were too warm, even hot by mid-afternoon, since they are only 4\" deep.
