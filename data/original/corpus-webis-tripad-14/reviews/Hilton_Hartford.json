We only stayed for one night on a quick trip to the city. Very close to the Gallery as well as the buses, so handy for getting to Mark Twain house. We were running a bit late getting ready so they gave us a lift to the theater to see Jersey Boys (altough this was after I rang downstairs and asked them to book a taxi which never showed). We were able to walk back from the theater after though, as it wasn't far away. We ate the next night in the hotel. Our waitress was really nice and helpful, but unfortunately the food really wasn't what I would've expected.

Alas! It was quite a disappoint to find no fridge within the cabinet beneath the television. No microwave either. Being a vegan and hard at work gave me the convenience of heating up frozen foods or leftovers while working in my room, however this was not an option for me here. I was very relieved to have the restaurant downstairs to avoid roaming the streets in the dark by myself looking for a place to eat dinner. The restaurant provided me with a pasta your way option. The hotel does have a fitness center on the 5th floor which suffice for my running workout. The room itself was clean and functional. I am very disappointed with the bed and the pillows. I am still massaging my neck from the pillows that provide no support whatsover. The bed offers no support either. The bathroom door opens right unto the toilet which was a few inches away from the tub, however, the toilet paper is at least 3 feet away. Weird...No HGTV, oh well. I did love the shuttle service that took me to my work which saved me from parking fees. Front desk was very helpful with walking directions to Starbucks and the bell captain holding on to my luggage, but I never received the 6am wake up call I requested.

It seems that corporate HQ is most likely skimping on building maintenance and staffing in order to make a buck in this slower economy. Hey, tough times for a major corporation is not my problem. When I pay a premium for a room I expect the t.v. to work (fuzzy fuzzy picture, checked connections, they were ok) and I do not expect pipes in the bathroom to be banging all night. Waking up numerous times throughout the night---10;30 p.m. pipes banging, 1:30 a.m. pipes banging, 4:30 a.m. pipes banging, 5:30 a.m. pipes banging. Now when the pipes are banging, this is going on for a good 10 minutes straight, sometimes more.The weary staff have probably heard complaints about the pipes many, many times before, and informed me that it was because people were taking showers. Well, you can't tell someone \"Stop taking a shower, you're waking everyone up!\" Can you? It must be endured. The Hilton group obviously does not want to spend the money to fix a problem of which they are fully aware. I was told that my room would be changed the next morning but that fact would not necessarily guarantee there would be no banging pipes in the new room as well . I spent the morning calling around to find another hotel, but, as luck would have it, with a convention in town, everywhere was solidly booked. The next night, no banging pipes in the new room but as fate decided there would be no sleep for me that night either, a fire alarm went off at 11;30 p.m. and in my pajamas,wrapped in a coat, I walked down 19 flights into the cold night rain and stood across the street under an awning for what seemed like an hour until we got the all clear to go back to our rooms. I can't blame Hilton for a fire, evacuating people is the responsible thing to do but I was pretty darn cranky due to the lack of sleep that was their fault on the previous night and all I wanted to do was SLEEP!! As compensation for I was given $65 dollars of my final bill (that's 50% off of the rate for 1 nights stay) That was very decent of the manager but when I'm on holiday, I expect to get what I originally paid for which is a night of sleep. The prospect of no sleep for a discount does not appeal to me. My trip back to stitches east will totally depend on my accommodations, if the Hilton is the only place with vacancys, I shall skip the whole thing! Hilton Hartford better get the money while they can because I can't see why anyone would ever spend good money to be a repeat customer and there won't be many unsuspecting customers forever. To prove a point, call up and ask them if they can guarantee you a room with no banging pipes or your money will be 100% refunded, I bet they don't do it!!!

The snack selection at front desk is very limited and there is nothing open around the hotel outside business hours. We paid $18.00 for parking but had to park our car as there is no valet parking. The staff was very friendly and helpfull but the Hilton Hartford lives up to the Hilton name for its rooms but for the rest, you could change it to a Hampton Inn since the services are lacking. We would still go there again but if you do want to book it, don`t expect much in the service departement.", "title": "Hartford and Hilton have seen better days...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PageturnerNyc", "date": "October 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 46366315}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled on business", "text": "During 5 day stay my room was changed twice: first because the internet did not work (which was $9.95 per day); and second because the air conditioner was broken.", "title": "NICKLED and DIMED to Death - and Depressing", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "xenonian", "date": "October 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 46308860}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled with family", "text": "The room I finally settled into had a view of the highway and a stained carpet and chair.", "title": "There must be better hotels in Hartford", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BeauregardeNewJersey", "date": "October 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 45843417}], "location": {}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 39, "average": 64, "very good": 122, "terrible": 23, "excellent": 67}, "aka": "Hilton Hartford Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.0}, "description": "The Hilton Hartford hotel is a shining star in the skyline of the historic city of Hartford, Connecticut.
