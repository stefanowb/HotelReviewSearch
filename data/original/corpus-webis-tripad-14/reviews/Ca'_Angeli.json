Venice is LaLa land and like disneyland almost unreal, too touristic, and and outrageously expensive. You will spend more for food to dine out then other places in Italy so budget accordingly if you want to dine well, take that mandatory gondala ride (around 90 eoros) and have that frightfully expensive but necessary beverage at a cafe in St. Marks square watching the pigeons do you know what to the tourist. Make sure you map out and have you ducks in order as to how to get to this charming place once you disembark off of the water Taxi at Silvestri stop on the Grand Canal. It is a maze in the beginning , especially if you are tired coming off of a train or plane , but you do get used to it. Also, for those who plan to leave Venice by train and it is still tourist season which unbelievably runs throught late october, do book passage out on the Eurostar train (the Fast one) a head of time, otherwise, you may have to take the local. The staff are so helpful ,and the view in the sitting room overlooking the Grand Canal so delightful, and the breadfast is more than adequate-so what can I say , you are so lucky to stumble on to this place and be fortunate enough to stay there. This opinion is from someone who also stays at five star properties. There is this famous bridge called the Rialto (I hope my spelling is correct) and the Rialto bridge is one of a handful that cross the Grand Canal. Once you cross the Rialto which is a short walk from the Bed and breadfast, and you must do so to get to St. Marks, the world and atmosphere changes and there are more tourist and congestion. In other words, you will appreciate going over the Rialto on your way back leaving and getting away from all that hustle and congestion and consider yourself so fortunate with the location of this bed and breadfast. When you leave this property and immediately get on the main drag make a left (away from the direction of the Rialto bridge ) if you want to explore the more authentic less touristic parts of Venice by foot.
