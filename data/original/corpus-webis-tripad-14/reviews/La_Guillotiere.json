Sean and Anne are great hosts, the breakfast is delicious, and the house itself and pool area are charming. We stayed for a week in June this year and also had a 1 yr old baby in tow so were looking for somewhere quite relaxed and child friendly. We made good use of the small kitchen and ate some of our evening meals by the pool, which was very enjoyable. We were certainly made to feel very welcome during our entire stay and nothing we asked for was ever too much trouble. If you're looking for top quality guest house, then this certainly ticks all the boxes.

Sean recommended a restaurant and Anne called in our reservations. The breakfast Anne and Sean served in the morning was wonderful - pastries, juice, coffee, cheese, etc. It was nice to sit around the dining room table for breakfast with other guests - two families from Germany were staying there at the same time.
