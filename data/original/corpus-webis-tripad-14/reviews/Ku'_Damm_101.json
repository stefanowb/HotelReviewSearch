The very stylish, minimalist decor appears to have fallen straight out of the pages of 'Wallpaper' magazine. My room (404) had a very high ceiling and was bathed in relaxing, monochromatic grey-blue colors. The only thing \"off\" was that the gimmicky T.V. that rolls back and forth had left marks on the walls (from a prior guest). Also, I never figured how to adjust the T.V.'s contrast. Bathroom was spare but attractive; the bath head was adjustable for either bath or shower use. The only disappointment in the room was the lack of floor rugs (except for one small one)which gave the floors a Northern European hospital feel. Service was reliable and always pleasant. I booked on ---- and was pleased that the breakfast (about 15 euros) was included in the room rate. A word about the breakfast: it is the best buffet I have seen in any hotel. There are separate stations for coldcuts, cereal, eggs and even vegetarian offerings. Superb quality and, especially, presentation. There is a terrific view of Berlin from this 7th floor restaurant (breakfast only). The lobby bar is lively with guests (mainly Euros) and neighborhood types. There are 2 free internet terminals in the lobby (although no printer!). The location is in a mixed but nice commercial residential neighborhood. I do not recommend this hotel for 1st time visitors since it is a hike to the Adenauer U Bahn station (which doesn't have any direct trains to the prime tourist areas). The S Bahn stop is closer but transfers (some tricky) are still necessary. As a hotel professional (Concierge) I recommend this hotel for repeat and frequest Berlin visitors.", "user": "Steedappeal", "date": "October 27, 2005", "id": 4065867}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent choice, superior than 4 1/2", "text": "I was totally impressed by this hotel.

I can only say GREAT things about this hotel. During our trip we stayed at 5 star hotels but this one beat them easily when you compare pricing. We paid $65 pounds per night including breakfast!!!

The superior hotel, located at Kurf\u00fcrstendamm 101, opened in 2003 and has been making an impression ever since, with its incisive design concept and young team. Zurich-based creative agency Kessler+Kessler, who designed the interior together with international architects and designers, bought into functionalism and purism combined with mellow colours and creative detail. The guiding aesthetic principle from the lobby to the guestrooms was reduction: no frills, no superfluous decor just clean lines and warm light."}
