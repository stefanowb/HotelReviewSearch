Thankfully we put my MIL at Springhill Suites attached to the JW. While waiting to check in, we heard the F-BOMB thrown around by one of the convention goer's several times. We also heard the derogatory term for the female anatomy and what one does when one attends to the loo. I was not impressed. The worst part was, the hotel employee that the man was talking to did not ask him to be more discrete about his language.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 12, 2012", "id": 129832715}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Our room was not ready upon arrival so we checked our bags and ventured off to check the MIL in. An hour later, I got a call that the room was ready and we could pick our bags up... no bag delivery to the room??? Again, that is how a luxury hotel handles a room not being ready, not pick them up at the front desk. We came back to the hotel and picked up our bags and went upstairs to the room. The room was very nice and well laid out. There was no mini bar or refrigerator in the room at all. The bathroom was VERY SMALL and only had a shower. The body sprays in the shower were a nice touch. You could not open the door to the shower and the bathroom door at the same time. I am pretty sure the bathrooms at both Springhill Suites and Courtyards are a standard size that is larger than this. Again, a luxury hotel with a room with only a shower. Disappointed. Upon use of the shower later we learned that the body sprays overwhelm the drain and we had to keep turning them off or the water would have overflowed on the floor.

The bathroom had a wonderful stall shower and everything was clean and comfortable. I had dinner and breakfast at the Italian restaurant in the hotel and the food was great. It was great having the convention right in the hotel so you could access all of the meeting rooms from the hotel elevators and didn't have to go outside. It was cold while we were there but it was still a comfortable walk to any of the downtown restaurants.
