The package included two hotels as well as a short cruise to the Bahamas. Since the first hotel was a dump we decided to leave early and try to find a place in Key West for one night. While enroute, I called the visitor center there and found that they were really no help. We then called the Douglas House from an advertisement in the Travel Guide. Even though we were at the peak of the busy season, we were offered a 900 sq. ft cottage type suite for $299.00.

Simply stated...visitors who have been to Key West before [and love it] will be more than happy at the Douglas House. Service is friendly, competent and accommodating, surrounding area is on \"quiet\" side of island, although EVERYTHING in Old Town is walkable and the neighborhood is SAFE for anyone who has every left \"Mayberry\". Price tends to be on the \"affordable\" end of the spectrum [for Key West] and room decors vary, but at worst; it's simple and comfortable at best more than worth the money! Most rooms have large outdoor balconies or patios (as well as kitchenettes), which are nice for \u201chappy hour\u201d before heading to see the sunset. In reality, the question you have to ask is \u201chow much time do you plan on spending in your room while visiting Key West\u201d.
