The room was large which was excellent, money has been spent on the bathrooms but not the rest of the room, but we were happy with the space. The hotel staff were the least responsive of all the hotels we have stayed at, the bar staff were great and ended up giving us the insights we needed to make our stay worthwhile.

We booked 3 rooms for our family for the WE of the 19/20 jan. So cold in one room that our kids had to ask for an electrical heater. Breakfast in the morning is simple .... and also very average. This hotel is apparently refurbished recently and rooms are OK but with nothing fancy. No minibar which is surprising for what is sold as a 4*. Connectivity is OK but there is a lack of outlets for plugs. The most annoying is this impression that everything is cold in this hotel and cheaply designed. Probably OK if we were in the heart of a main city in Europe but a bit disappointing if you re in Chamonix and look for some authenticity. One final detail which upset me. Only one toilet ... in the lobby area. Imagine the entire hotel going skiing in the morning. Thats where the queue starts....
