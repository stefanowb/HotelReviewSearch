One room was missing the door for the shower/toilet area. The other room was missing the table on the porch. The bug screen on one porch was full of holes so we were constantly bitten by no-see-ums. Because we went during the off season (aka hurricane season), there were fewer hotel staff on duty. There was ONE woman cooking for the restaurant. If you arrived at the restaurant right after another table, you had to wait an hour to get your food. The wi-fi internet was very weak and intermittent. My kids were trying to do their online homework and had to give up. I will say the staff were very friendly people at the hotel, the dive shop, and the gift shop. Even the groundskeepers were great; they cut down some coconuts for us and chopped them open with their machettes.

Who ever heard of a bar running out of whiskey???? But, just as we were discussing alternatives, the manager came round and told them all they had to do was move one bottle aside and there was the whiskey.

It makes the room feel very carribean styled. I love the huge bathroom. The room is a plus. Unfortunately we are not fans of the usvi beaches. since I was just in cancun earlier in the week this can't compare although the ocean is vast.
