Prices at Hotel Post include breakfast which is not always the case in other hotels.

Its a little bit down at heel (slightly tatty rugs in the room, slightly fraying towels) and, but it was clean, and the staff were pleasant enough. I have to admit, though it was perfectly comfortable it wasn't the best 3* hotel I've stayed in. Apparantly Mozart and Nietzsche have lodged there in times past.

It is in no way a luxury hotel, so don't expect to find interesting decor & don't look in the mirrors (for some reason they seem to have the same effect as those mirrors on old fairgrounds which make you look shorter, bigger, etc- very odd!) It's a good hotel for the price. Our room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and had both a bath and separate shower.

We asked for a comfortable hotel in a central location. We paid 104 euros for one night in a double room. When arrived at the hotel we were given a room on the sixth floor. The moment we came out of the lift I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a scene from a horror movie. The corridor looked like the hallway of a mental institution. The walls were not painted, there were no carpets on the floors and the corridor was full of furniture it was hard to walk through. It was a very scary sight. The moment we open the door to our room a smell of sewage overwhelmed us. The room matched the corridor. The dated wall paper had black stains all over it. The carpet was torn, the room was cramped with sofas and chairs which you wouldn't dare sit on. The bathroom covered with orange and brown tiles smelled so much of sewage we physically felt sick.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "persson28", "date": "May 10, 2004", "id": 1905586}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Failed to honour reservation", "text": "That day we spent as much time as possible outside the hotel as we didn't want to go back to that terrifying room.
