Right away I was taken by the charm of the hotel. The room was spacious with decor that made me feel like a princess upon waking each morning. For being an old hotel, we heard no noise from upstairs. The bathroom was large with a separate shower and a deep soaking bathroom. The water pressure was amazing with plenty of hot water. The sink had a large counter flanked by storage units on each side which made it easy to store toiletries. We were in a suite which had a queen in the main room, and a twin in the adjacent room with its own tv. The beds were extremely comfortable (absolutely no tossing or turning), and the split rooms (i slept in the queen and my friend in the twin) worked out great since she likes to sleep with the lights and tv on, and I don't. The buffet breakfast was fantastic with lots of options no matter your dietary preference. I'm a vegetarian and never felt deprived by the selections. The staff were friendly and helpful.
