Needless to say, the bathrooms were also immaculately clean too. A pair of complimentary bath slippers in the room would have been a nice touch, though.

Billy, Sarah and staff were very friendly and helpful: free use of the dining room and kitchen and the 'honesty' bar was a nice touch, giving it a homely atmosphere. A slight problem was the Barcelona 'no noise after 10pm' rule; we were stayng there with friends to celebrate a birthday and after returning to the hotel from dinner, there was nowhere to sit and chat without the possibility of disturbing other guests. It wasn't too much of an issue as we were tired from our tour of Barcelona and didn't mind an early night but it could have been a disappointment in different circumstances. For the many people for whom this wouldn't be an issue, I would highly recommend Casa Billy.", "title": "Great place to stay", "user": "Dee G", "date": "November 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120679634}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Casa de Billy is a pure delight!. My wife and I stayed for 5 nights in Oct. 2011 and the place could not be better. Billy collects antiques so period charm abounds. Our room was unusually large by European standards, with an equally large in suite bath. By bath I mean deep bathtub, not just shower, which my wife loved. And when was the last time you saw a king sized bed in a modestly priced guesthouse. Easy to get to, the location on Gran Via leaves a short walk to most important sites. Staff was attentive and helpful, and the other guests we had breakfast with were polite and interesting. The continental breakfast was served in an elegant setting with fine china and real silverware. Billy understands small details and what a traveler both needs and wants. All the little things that make you feel at home are covered, like a fully stocked complete shared kitchen. Our only issue was that internet in our room was spotty. This could be as much my ancient laptop as Casa de Billy, but during our stay Billy even tried to fix this by installing a new router. Billy has 2 other facilities in Mexico and 1 in Istanbul. I am really interested in trying the one in Istanbul. Barcelona is fabulous but still a big city.

Our room was lovely, a good size, with a very comfortable bed and good bedlinen. Our private bathroom was large with an excellent shower and a great big wardrobe (with, hurrah! a full-length mirror) for storing our things. Bedroom and bathroom were cleaned daily and everywhere in the house was spotless. We took advantage of the opportunity to keep food in the fridge in the common kitchen. The breakfast, while simple continental, was beautifully presented and provided the opportunity to meet fellow guests - very convivial. Joaquin and Sarah are lovely - very welcoming and helpful and always pleasant. The location is excellent - 2 minutes from a metro station, near the Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya and within walking distance of the Ramblas. We loved it. However, if you decide to book, choose your room carefully - some of them are quite small and have shared bathrooms. Ours was off the breakfast room/bar with a glass panel above the door, so we had to turn off all the lights in the breakfast room before we went to bed, and there was always the potential of being woken up by people getting stuff from the bar or making cups of tea or coffee. That being said, we stayed for 6 nights and were woken by a very quiet tea-making person only on our last night.
