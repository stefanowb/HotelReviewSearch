We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 (normal rate was around $200). The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed. Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient. Parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere. We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. Glad we didn't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better.

We had a deluxe room, which was only slightly nicer than the standard room our friends were in...nice view of Lake Michigan. We had recently signed up online (free) for FPC (Fairmont President's Club), which got us complimentary access to the fitness center / spa. The hotel and rooms are very nice, and the fitness center / locker rooms are gorgeous, but the biggest problem with the hotel are the showers, which to our understanding had been renovated in the last year. These are those rain shower head things that look pretty, and are probably pretty green friendly, but the pressure is just awful. I mean we are talking nearly impossible to get soap suds off of yourself. My solution in part was to use the fitness center showers, which were slightly better and had a handheld piece, but even these had mediocre pressure at best.
