The weather was on the coolish side so we did not use the pool (which looked quite nice). We golfed on the Pines Course .. I think the rate was $129 weekends and $60 after 3 pm. The villa was nice .. the gas fireplace that went on with the flick of a switch was a nice touch. The master bath did have mold on the celling in the corner. But everything else was spotless. I thought the beds were very comfortable. We were not there in the summer and our little screened in dining area outside was dirty, but it didn't matter because it was too cold to be sitting out there. We enjoyed Atlantic City (about 15 minutes away) and also the little shopping village at Smithville (about 5 minutes away). If you have a day (or even a 1/2 day) take a ride to Cape May. This seaside town has gingerbread victorian houses that are amazing. Lots of shops and restaurants. The ride took us about 45 minutes. Not sure I'd return to this resort because it was a long drive from Boston (5 1/2 hours), but I'm glad we went there. Like one of the other posters, we had a 1st floor suite and could hear the people above us walking around. I don't think it is very soundproof.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "EastCoastGirl1", "date": "October 12, 2006", "id": 5945477}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Villas are very nice, new and large. However, the room we stayed in had hair in the bath tub and on the toilet upon our arrival. It was promptly cleaned when reported. Our buffet breakfast cost $48 including tip, excessive in my opinion, and the potatoes had Hair in them. My wife was disgusted. Our complimentary round of golf actually cost us over $50 because we were forced to rent a cart. So much for the exercize we were looking foreward to. The Bay golf course was very flat and unchallenging, even for my wife and I, who are not the best golfers. This course also has lots of grass fungus as well as crabgrass. Not something I expected from a place that demands $130 per round for golf. The greenhead flies are terrible, as you would expect, being so close to the swampy areas. Which brings me to my last comment: The smell of the swampy water was unbarable for my wife, for me....it smelled, but I am used to the Jersey shore's smell.", "title": "Hair, hair everywhere", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Uncle_Nemo", "date": "August 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5574781, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Close to Atlantic City", "disliked": "\u2014 Not well kept, considering the cost"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "I would not return to this facility.", "title": "Wonderful Anniversary Getaway!", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "amc414", "date": "June 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5291237}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "Where do I begin?

Halfway through the drive she says \"Mom how long until we get to the hotel?\" I ignored her and so did my husband. Then 15 mins later, she asked again - so I had to tell him what the plans were.

When my husband and daughter walked in, they were VERY excited and pleased. The bathrooms were a nice size and having 2 sinks in each was perfect. My daughter loved that in her room there was a sofa (a pullout) also. My husband was more than pleased with the jacuzzi in our room and the seperate shower and \"waterhole\" :-) The fireplace is a great addition if you're visiting in the Winter.
