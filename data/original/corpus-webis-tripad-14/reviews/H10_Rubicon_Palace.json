The weather was as expected for January with the the last three days mainly overcast and very breezy which seemed to affect a lot of other guests attitudes in a negative way. The food was plentiful, if not a touch bland and most options were catered for. The highlight of the holiday was undoubtedly a combination between the entertainments team and to all who worked within the Miniclub team who kind of operate under the same umbrella. Pier (head of ents team) deserves a special mention for being able to keep a crowd of people laughing out loud in three superfluent languages, none of which are his native tongue! Hats off too to the FRAM (French animation????) team for their selfless dedication to the effort. Again the Miniclub was a revelation. We wasn't aware before travelling but you can actually leave your child (ages 1-3) for up to seven hours a day with this reliable team. Although we chose to stay with our daughter throughout the holiday we still used all the excellent facilities that the nursery had too offer. Unfortunately, there is a downside to the holiday. The bar staff were generally unmotivated and quite dour in demeanour which I do sort of understand after listening to the way many of the customers spoke to them. However, I can find no reasoning to ease my disappointment over the temperature of the swimming pools. Before travelling, and possibly my main reason for booking this particular hotel was the picture in my head of my daughter dragging one or both of us up and down that slide relentlessly, until exhaustion kicked in. Alas this was not to be. The water was far too cold to be in before turning blue after a minute or two, the sea was considerably warmer.
