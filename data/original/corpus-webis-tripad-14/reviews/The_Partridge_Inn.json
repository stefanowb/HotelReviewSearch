There was no baggage person, not that I am not used to carrying my own bags. Check in was normal except we over heard the phone conversation of one desk clerk advising someone the rumors were not true and the hotel was open for business. Elavators were adequate. Rooms were small but the balconies were as large as the rooms. The bathroom was old with a fiberglass tub surround. The fixtures were floating through the wall and were loose. The toilet took a long time to flush. The TV was a flat screen. Air conditioning had a musty smell like you sometimes get in the Carribian. The floors creaked and some places they were not level. Windows did not keep out noise. WI-Fi worked well however there was no room safe. The place reminded me of visits to old relatives homes back in the 50's, it was that old. We were invited to the penthouse for a party and it was decorated in pre 1970 style only it was real.The view from the deck on the sixth floor was very nice, but upkeep on the treated wood and furniture left a lot to be desired. Railing around the top were sagging and the rope lighting was not working more than working.Bugs that some of the people who lived in the area called pomento bugs were visible after dark all around the deck. I have my own idea what they were but I am not a bug expert. Walking through the kitchen there was a weird smell even different than a musty smell. The hall bathroom in the penthouse worked but it was terrible looking. Not what you would expect from the penthouse. Ceiling were not very high and there were no ceiling fans.", "title": "Tired old building", "user": "mrsaturday", "date": "June 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 131970628}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012", "text": "Meals.

Spent four nights in room 311 and have to say we were sad to find the room to be a bit run down and in need of repair. First let me say the bed was one of the most comfortable in a hotel I have slept in. The room was clean and comfortable with a coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, and flat screen TV. There was a closet to hang clothes and a dresser drawer for storage. Now the part I wish I didn't have to report. The bathroom was a disaster. The bath towel bar behind the door was bent (tacky) ok, accidents happen but the housekeeping should report it and it should be replaced immediately. The bathroom was fairly large and the toilet was back in a little nook on the oposite wall from the teeny tiny sink where there was no hand towel,,,,after looking around I located it hanging over the toilet. WHY? I used the cord from the hairdryer to hang the handtowel on to use when I washed my hands. The shower had only a small soap dish and no place to put shampoo, etc on while showering,,also there was nothing to hang onto if you slipped on the wet tiles. The worst thing for me was the broken floor tiles and the loose grout that stuck to my feet when barefoot, I used all the bath towels to cover the floor so I could walk around. I also need to express my surprise at the breakfast buffet that cost $8.00 for coffee, juice, fruit, & muffins,,,no way, go to Waffle House or I Hop to get your moneys worth. The front desk was very courtious and listened to my complaint about the bathroom and said they would e-mail me with an update, well, been home a week and have heard nothing. Also couldn't use the pool because it was \"out-of-order\".", "title": "Spring Break Visit Home", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "2TravelingTheWorld", "date": "April 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 128157223}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Personnel are very friendly and willing to help.
