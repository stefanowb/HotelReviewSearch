Palm Springs being the next stop, we decided to go for a quaint, relaxed accommodation instead of a larger hotel chain. As we did not book upfront, we viewed about 5 rooms in different hotels, all of which left us feeling bad. We were about to book a room in the Quality Inn, when I spotted the El Rancho sign across the road. Since this was on my list of favourite hotels (prepared before our departure to the U.S.), I urged my husband to go check it out. The owner, Sandy, showed us a room and a patio suite. Even though they both seemed old-fashioned at first, we opted for the patio suite (we are both smokers).", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 29, 2006", "id": 5232742}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "An oasis in the desert!", "text": "What can I say?
