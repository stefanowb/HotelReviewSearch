I am sure the 800 rip off phones are all over the UK strategically placed where tourist can be ripped off without recourse. I made an international call and the first time it lets you connect and say hello then cuts you off by way of an abrupt busy signal but still connects long enough to charge you $24.76, then you have to call back and pay $24.76 again so you can actually talk to your family the end result is for a 2 minute call the total charge is $49.52, and try battling with them, it is a huge racket. It happened to the people next to me too so it is definitely set up to chisel extra money out of defenseless travelers.
