It has always been very clean and the owners/managers are friendly and extremely nice. We go there for our anniversaries and sometimes for a mini-vacation, just to escape from stress. It is very peaceful and relaxing. We love sitting on our private porch, rocking and taking in the beautiful view. They have a variety of rooms, some with king or queen size beds and some with full size. My husband and I prefer the full size bed because we always sleep close together anyway. We have recommended the Sky Harbor Bavarian Inn to all our friends and they always thank us. If you are going to Chattanooga, TN., it is a great place to stay.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 27, 2004", "id": 2790044}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "charming!", "text": "We loved this inn.

The view alone is worth the stay. It is the perfect little country inn on the side of a mountain. We spent the majority of our time in Chattanooga sitting on the two rocking chairs overlooking the city day and night! It is definately the most unique, cozy, and relaxing little inn. The hotel was booked the weekend we were there, but we felt like the only people there! We felt very safe, and taken care of, as the owners were very hospitable and friendly. The room was clean, but the furniture and comforter was a little rustic. The pool was nice and clean and has a beautiful view also. I highly recommend a whirlpool room. Our time spent here was perfect and very romantic! If you can't relax and enjoy yourself at the Sky Harbor Inn, then you must be very, very uptight! The visit was very worth it! We plan on going back in the fall when the leaves change for the gorgeous view!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 23, 2004", "id": 2483908}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Great Get-Away", "text": "What a great place to spend a few nights. The view, along with the many splendid trees, and just plain old nature, was enough to make one forget about day to day hassles. The location is close to just about anything you want to do, but the location makes it seem you are far, far away from civilization. I would love to give it an EXCELLANT rating but I hesitate since the bedding (sheets and pillowcases) was past the age of retirement.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 9, 2004", "id": 2285094}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Chattanooga"}, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 7, "very good": 22, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 43}, "aka": "Sky Harbor Bavarian Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5}
