For Poms - quite exciting though very sad for the farmers in the Grampians. The Park was just right with a clean, tidy and well equipped cabin. The management were very helpful with where to go and what to see as well as updates on the fires. Good walks by the Burn and Hamilton is a delightful town. Didn't use the pool though it did appear a little small. The coast at Portland and surrounds was great with ample chances for a swim in the gorgeous bay and seal watching too. The drive up to Hall's gap, McKenzie falls and the lookouts was stunning and well worth the 260 or so steps to the base of the falls....and up!!", "title": "A good centre for the Grampians and the coast", "user": "lecturemusic", "date": "March 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153998407}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Mount Gambier with its Sink holes was also within reach as a day trip and very interesting.

Service was very good. Amenities are fantastic. The common room is huge with a huge flatscreen TV which was great to watch the summer sport on. The pool is very clean, no shade around the pool unfortunately and it is one of the smallest pools I've seen in a park. This wasn't an issue as there didn't seem to be too many people swimming considering the blistering heat.", "title": "Great drive through caravan park", "user": "MikenGail", "date": "November 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 5.0}, "id": 145630961}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012", "text": "The park is very green and shady.
