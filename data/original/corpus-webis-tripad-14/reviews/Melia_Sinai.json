What a mistake! Compared to the Concorde this was a most disappointing 2 weeks. Be aware that if you go AI, then you are definitely treated as second class - particularly with food and drink. The other reasons are: poor quality equipment and furnishings of the hotel in general - bed like concrete, old worn, bobbly sheets (where is the top grade Egyptian cotten?!), no hot water for three days, air conditioning didn't ever work properly, drab furnishings - and that's just the room. The beds and parasols by the pool were in poor condition and very hard to put up. The bars were dull, and staff very slow (reluctant) to serve alcohol for AI customers, some ignoring us at the bar but serving paying customers quickly, fruit juices watered down, making it very frustrating. We got served beer from bottles already opened for other customers (one bottle doesn't fill a glass, but they won't give the rest of the bottle, they put the lid on and keep behind the bar, and then use it for the next drink ordered). We presumed like others there, that staff are encouraged to respond slowly to AI customers, to save them money. One of the most annoying things was lack of water - at the Concorde water was free and plentiful - but here you had to argue for every bottle (whilst non-AI customers had no problems). Waiters got cross if you asked to keep the bottle they had poured from at mealtimes, and you are only allowed one glass per person.

The buffet salads were out from 12.30 to 3pm and had nothing to stop flies landing on them - no wonder everyone we spoke to had a stomach upset at least once. If you wanted a change of food there was only one other choice, which you have to pay for - the Pergola bar, which served more appetising food (but why wasn't this available in the AI restaurant?). Snacks and icecreams were either very hard to locate (in different bars at odd times), or non-existent, and you were certainly not encouraged to enjoy the AI experience; the hotel's policy seemed to be actively aimed at giving you as little as possible.
