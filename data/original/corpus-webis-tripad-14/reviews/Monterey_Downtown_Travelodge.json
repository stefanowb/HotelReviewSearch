It is also in a great spot where it only takes a few minutes to walk to downtown and the wharf.

It was ok for resting your head for a night but that's about it. To be fair it is fairly well-placed for the Wharf compared to the other budget hotels but some of the other ones further up Munras Av. are prettier. It also sits right next to a petrol station. The rooms would have been ok if it were not for the very dirty carpets. We had 2 rooms and both carpets left my infant son with dirty soles of his feet (as was mentioned in another review - certainly not a one-off). If they fixed this things might be ok. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I guess the place could do with a makeover. Parking area under the hotel is good. The Diner across the road is very good. If you are price conscious and take a pair of slippers - or perhaps never take your socks off - then this is the place for you. But be warned you do get what you pay for. This said it didn't really detract from our stay. However, if going back to Monterey I would pay a bit more and get somehwere with a cleaner carpet.", "user": "Dmun", "date": "July 4, 2005", "id": 3635281}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Cheap and it shows!", "text": "We stayed in this hotel as we had decided to drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles, and stayed here for one night en route.

We had no expectations, I spent most of my time planning the Napa portion of our trip. Our room had recently been redone and we were excited to find great new beds, frig, tv that worked and a big fan along with the new ac unit. I love fans just for white noise but it was really not noisy here. We parked in the underground parking and never moved our car till we left Sunday morning. We took the bus that is close by to Carmel, great move because parking is impossible there. This hotel was clean, close to everything, in a safe area and the coffee, pastry and fruit in the morning were just an added bonus. This was a great deal for the money, loved not having to drive, 10 min walk to fishermen's wharf, five min to Mucky ducks, thanks for the tip!!! The walk to Cannery row was less than 25 but kept stopping to look at the sea lions.
