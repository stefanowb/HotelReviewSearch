I have a aunt who works for HIlton and we got a two double bed room on the 26th floor. Also, let me add for 49 dollars a night. HA! We had valet parking and they were really good about unloading and loading when ever we had to. It was really awsome. The rooms had a AWSOME VIEW. We have the river/ball park view. The room was big, nice bathroom with all the stuff. I liked how there were robs in the closet. That was pretty cool. Staff was nice. The lady that work in the Gym/Pool was a RUDE person and I hope HIlton handles with them, turning out the lights and telling us to leave in a verry mean way. The management said that it isnt the first time this has happened. But all in all, everything was awsome.

Just to say the archictecture & decoration is beautiful does not suffice - you must see it for yourself! All the wood in the hallways, the engraved metal on the elevator doors, the marble - breathtaking. What I loved about this city and this hotel is that the people are just so down-to-earth and friendly - the kind of people you wish you had for next door neighbors. I'm just a plain-ole middle-class American from central Pennsylvania (and proud of it), but I did not feel out of place in this magnificent hotel - it's not \"stuffy.\" My room was immaculately clean; the bed was very comfortable; and the climate control in the room actually worked! The room-service food and all the food we had at the restaurants was very good. Like I said, all their employees were very friendly, but professional at the same time. I have NO negatives to list - I just hope I can stay here again. If you go - be sure to zip across the bridge to Covington, Kentucky (takes less than 5 minutes to get there by taxi) and take the dinner cruise on the B&B Riverboats; you get a buffet meal, a two-and-a-half hour cruise, and the best view of the scenic Cincinnati skyline, all for about $40.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MarciaM", "date": "July 23, 2005", "id": 3695069}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel on the night of July 6, 2005.
