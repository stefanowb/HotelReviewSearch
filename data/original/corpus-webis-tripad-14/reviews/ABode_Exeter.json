Great location on the Cathedral green, and right next to all the shops and a short walk to the attractive river-front area. Staff welcoming and efficient, gave me clear directions to the nearby local off-street car park for my car, charged at a reasonable \u00a39 per 24 hours. The one downside was that our room was pretty small, although functional, and rather noisy in the evening. Fairly tiny bathroom, with shower, mini-washbasin and no shelves of any kind to put things on! One chair in the room, and a standard size double bed, which did prove very comfortable. Unfortunately our room overlooked a pedestrian passageway next to the hotel, opposite a pub and there was loud music until around midnight. The problems with the room didn't deter us for a night's stay, but might get wearing if we had stayed longer. We managed to book in the famous restaurant run by the Michelin-starred chef, Michael Caines, for a reduced-rate early evening dinner; about half the price of the standard menu, smaller portions of terrific food, lovely staff and excellent house wines. Again, the staff were lovely, and the restaurant quiet that early in the evening. Great breakfast the following morning, the cold breakfast included lots of different fresh fruits, fresh orange juice etc. We really didn't need to sample the hot dishes! This hotel has been there for years and years, (was the Royal Clarence) and I was pleased to see that some of the original features remain, such as bits of leaded stained glass. And, if you don't eat in the restaurant, there is a bistro in the hotel too for informal dining. So we would go back provided the price for the room is reasonable, the experience was well worth it, and, for us, the service excellent.", "title": "Great location, good for a weekend, but your room might be rather small!", "user": "AndrewS60", "date": "February 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 152552465}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Abode - we have stayed many times and always been very happy with the service we've received! Our stay once again was very enjoyable, especially our fine dining in the Michael Caine restaurant - the staff were very attentive and professional, and the food was a delight, just wonderful! We are sad to say we didn't receive the same experience in the Cafe bar on our second night (17th Feb) - we had booked a table for 7.30 and asked specifically when booking if we could have the window table, we were told yes that is booked for you - when we arrived the table was occupied and we were informed by the cafe bar manager that they had been there since 5pm and were still drinking - we said he should have informed them that the table was booked out at 7.30 - he said he would try to get them moved to another table - when this had still not occured after 20 minutes, we said we would stay at the table he had given us initially - all very dissapointing and unprofessional - he was quite rude whilst telling us it wasn't his fault!!! On hearing what had happened to us, another couple came over to us and said they had received similar treatment when booking a table there, and not been given the table they had asked for - in advance!

As the voucher was for \u00a3100 I decided I could afford to treat myself. The cost for a 'comfortable' room was \u00a3145 and this did not include breakfast. I therefore felt that the room would have been more luxorious than it turned out to be. Don't get me wrong, it had everything that you would expect from a high-end hotel; the mattress was lovely. It felt a little too soft at first, but once in bed, was perfect. The linens were good but the towels were rather 'thin' and, dare I say it, a bit grey. There was a tea tray with the usual suspects, an ironing board and iron, which was useful, and a hairdryer. All fine. The room was warm but I was surprised that there was no central heating radiator, just a small, free-standing, oil filled heater. I didn't need it but if I had, I wouldn't have wanted one that I had to turn off and on myself, not at the price they were charging. The room was small. I was on my own so it didn't matter too much but if I'd been sharing, it would have been tight. The shower room was also small although the shower itself was decent. But the basin was so small and the shelf above positioned in such a way that it made rinsing your mouth after tooth-brushing, awkward. I expected some street noise, this is a city centre hotel, after all. I didn't mind that and the secondary glazing blocked most of it. In fact, the city quietened down much earlier than I'd expected, around midnight. The main problem was the light from the shop opposite which was so bright that even with the curtains closed, the room was almost as light as it would be during daylight. The rooms need blackout blinds as well as curtains. The staff were pleasant and the ambience of the hotel high-end. But I didn't think the room I had was value for money.", "title": "Not sure the room justified the price", "user": "spaniel11176", "date": "February 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 152424564}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "weve stayed here before its a great hotel.good service close to everything in town,the staff are alawys helpfull and friendly would highly recomm", "title": "good service hotel", "user": "Katrina R", "date": "February 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 152314447}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012", "text": "end it. beds are very comfortable and room has everything you need in it.", "title": "Lovely Accomodation", "user": "MrC1972", "date": "February 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 151631952}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed for one night in midweek, late Feb.
