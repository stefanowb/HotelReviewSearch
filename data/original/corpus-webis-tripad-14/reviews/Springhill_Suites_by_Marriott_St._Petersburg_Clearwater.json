Its wonderful. It was my first stay at a SpringHills suites (owned by Marriott). The rooms are really nice because it has a living area (microwave, fridge, sink) and couch/chairs seperated from the sleeping area by a half wall. This is great if you have a little one sleeping in a crib or pack-n-play that you want sperated from you.

There was nothing super special about the pool, whirlpool and small fitness room. The treadmill was okay for a two-mile run in the morning before breakfast.
