All the rooms I've stayed in have been clean and decent with AC that functioned properly. The food at the downsatirs restaurant was quite good and the breakfast buffet is excellent (though both are pricey). The food is certainly better than that at the more expensive Sheraton that's nearby. TheThistle also has a nice, large bar as well with (if you like watching planes) a good view of the runway. The rooms are well soundproofed so the aforementioned runway isn't a problem. The Thistle's staff certainly haven't bowled me over, but they've always been polite and competent. I've always had a car with me and while the parking lot is a bit sprawling and disjointed I've never had a problem finding a space and usually was able to park right out front of the lobby. The primary reason I choose the Thistle was it's location. Not only is it a conveniant airport hotel, but it's an easy walk to Hertz and some of the other car rental company lots which made picking up and dropping cars off very easy. On the downside, the lack of an elevator was a problem when I was travelling with my father who had some difficulty walking, but the next time we made sure we got a room on the ground floor. On one visit a room seemed a bit musty, but that's about it for problems.
