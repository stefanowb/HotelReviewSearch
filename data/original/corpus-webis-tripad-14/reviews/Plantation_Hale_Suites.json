All concerns were unfounded, however. We were assigned to unit A-16, which is a one bedroom condo unit. It was in good condition, although obviously a lot of things were done low budget, as one would expect for paying a little over $100 on such a touristy island. But everything was very clean. Concerning roaches and other bugs, as one other reviewer wrote a bad review about - no bugs at all, and in fact, the hotel sprayed for bugs while we were staying there. Apparently, Best Western itself owns buildings A-E (those were the buildings sprayed during our visit), and perhaps the later units (F-J) are privately owned as some have noted, and may not be cared for as well.

The Coconut Marketplace is only a few yards away, which is nice for evening browsing. There were two grocery stores within walking distance with many other shops.
