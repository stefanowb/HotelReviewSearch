The floor in our room creaked so badly that we woke each other up if we had to get up in the middle of the night.

The two pools (one on the roof with an infinity edge) were not big enough to service a full complement of guests. Staff were friendly and the hotel was clean but the atmosphere was totally lacking.

Having now stayed at 4 newly built Pullman,s I can say that this Pullman has their strengths and weaknesses. It does provide reasonably good value for money at this level. We got a deal of 121$ a night with breakfast. The problems are that these hotels seem to be built at a price to simulate luxury. The halls are not carpeted, and the doors not thick enough to stop the echoing of people using them. This is an annoyance. The wooden floor is lifting a little in our room so it squeaks when you walk on it. The facilities are all there, nice spa, restaurant and two pools. However, they are more of a business hotel than those of a beach resort. The pools are ok if there is not a high occupancy as both are small. The roof pool is the better of the two. The sun longes are excellent. We found service to be pleasant and helpful at all times. The restaurant is just ok. The buffet was very average though the accompanying dancers and musicians were fun and very good! The restaurant needs to improve. breakfast buffet was better but changes little day to day. One oddity is that many of the rooms near the garden pool are unfinished, as are many others.
