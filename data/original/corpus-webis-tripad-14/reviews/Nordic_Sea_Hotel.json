It felt like you were staying on one of those cruise ship interior rooms. They were small but clean and comfortable. You just have to watch yourself on the top bunkbed because of the low ceiling. We appreciated the plush towels that were placed on the racks in the washrooms each day. The washroom was of average size. The TV was very small and hung from the corner of the wall. There is an impressive aquarium situated in the lobby. The breakfast buffet was plentiful - think IKEA breakfast but with a more variety of foods.
