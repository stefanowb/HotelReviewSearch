It's several years out now since the renovation, but everything is still in very nice shape. Noise has sometimes been a problem with the continuous day/evening work on the World Trade Center site, and most of the rooms face that direction. There are rooms on each end of the hotel that face the opposite direction and they are quieter (although the view isn't nearly as interesting). These rooms are also significantly bigger than the typical rooms facing the WTC site. I've stayed in four of these end rooms, and it seems to be hit or miss if you get one. I've attached some pictures of one of these bigger rooms, so for the standard room, imagine something much narrower. The staff is courteous and professional.

We weren't disappointed. Using our points and reserving on line, I was offered the opportunity to select to an upgrade. I chose all upgrades and at check-in we got a King Jr. Suite with a city view. It cost an extra $49/N which was a bargain for the view! We were on the 34th floor, (room 3411)a 2 room suite with a first room with a sofa, lounge chair, desk, honor bar and a flat screen TV then the bathroom (great water pressure!!) and a nice size bedroom with king bed and large flat screen TV. The best part was the floor to ceiling windows with a spectacular viewsof the Hudson River, Empire State Building and the WTC site. This was a corner room, so views really spanned from the Hudson on one side to the Brooklyn Bridge on the other. We were able to see both the Macy's fireworks and those at Liberty State Park. It was such a clear night that we could even see fireworks in the distance all around NJ and LI. The hotel is located downtown and if you are looking for nightlife closeby, you would probably prefer the midtown area; however, if you want to be close to everything (many subway lines within walking distance, 2 within a block) and like the peace and quiet, then this is a great choice. In my opinion, you will not get a better value in NYC. This is a lovely hotel in a very safe neighborhood. We were given the choice of free breakfast, free internet or 1000 points as Gold members. We chose the breakfast, which was adequate for a continental breakfast. (Yes, as previously mentioned they charge $24 for the buffet which is high, but perhaps not for NYC.) They also had an option to upgrade to a 'real' breakfast for $6.50. With all the great food options in NYC, we only wanted a bit of breakfast so never bothered with more than the buffet.
