This was our second visit to Oahu together: in 2006, we stayed in Waikiki and loved the powdery-soft beach at Lanikai. I definitely recommend staying at Lanikai rather than Waikiki for a relaxing vacation, and we would recommend this specific B&B. In particular, the garden studio was perfect: it was close to the beach, there was a cool breeze, it was comfortable, the gardens were pretty, the kitchen was well-stocked (to prepare your own meals), and Nini was very, very friendly. Nini and Rick provided backpack-style beach chairs, a cooler, boogie boards, and even a welcome Dole pineapple and muffins. There was even a binder of local restaurant menus which was helpful. We would definitely stay at the garden studio again.", "title": "Best Location for Lanikai Beach", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "RomanticTravelers888", "date": "August 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37430392}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We have just returned home after staying 10 nights in Oahu. This was our first trip to Hawaii, there were 5 people in our group. We spent 3 nights in Waikiki and had a great time there but were footworn and tired when we arrived at Lanikai Hale Mahina for 5 nights. We arrived to find a charming, comfortable and absolutely spotless home that contained everything we could need for our vacation. Clean, fluffy white towels, beach towels, beach matts, floaty toys, cooler for packing your lunch, a full sized fridge, spacious table for eating or playing games, screens on all the windows that can be left open day and night to allow the trade winds to blow - none of that relentless blowing of an air conditioner but plenty of fans to cool the rooms. Lanikai is a very short drive to Kailua town with all the shopping you need, try Don Quixote for groceries, Safeway, the Thursday evening market has plenty of veggies, fruit, flowers and plate dinners. Day trips to Honolulu and Waikiki are also an easy drive. I would absolutely recommend this accommodation to my family and friends. We also got a peek at the garden studio that is part of this same property, it has a private garden, beautifully decorated, again spotless, and is perfect for 2. Rick and his family were very welcoming, but not obtrusive. This accommodation is a licensed bed and breakfast and is a member in good standing with the Better Business Bureau, with no complaints when I checked before booking. Lanikai beach is beautiful day or night with the moon shining across the water, swimming is warm and safe. Do the hike up Lanikai ridge for the spectacular views.
