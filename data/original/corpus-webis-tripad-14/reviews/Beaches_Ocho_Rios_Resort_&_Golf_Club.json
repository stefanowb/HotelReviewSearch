We had a room at the airport with complementary drinks, the driver told us lots of interesting facts about the island on the drive to the resort, we were checked in and enjoying a delicious supper soon after our arrival. Our son and I scuba dive almost daily. The scuba staff have very high standards for safety and I have watched them introduce new divers to the sport. They are exceptional. They will be teaching my grandchildren as soon as they are old enough. The food is fresh and well prepared with lots of variety. From International night to Seafood night the variety and quality will have you looking forward to meal time like never before. You can enjoy nice wine and cool slushy drinks at your leisure. This resort caters to children and families. Our two granddaughters were kept busy and entertained the entire two weeks. It is not the fanciest resort, in fact there are some signs of wear in places but it is kept very clean and safe and the staff could not be improved upon.

Travelled with a 13 yr. old and a 17 yr. old. Overall, we had a good trip. I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews on here. Amazing how one person loves it and another hates it. The resort is older, but in decent shape. The food was good. Eleanor's is the best quality of food and children under 12 cannot dine there. We ate there once. Arizona's was probably the worst, but it was nice to eat outside. You can get nachos, soup and a salad buffet style and order your dinner. I got the spare ribs (beef) and they were not that good. The jerk chicken is good everywhere. The desserts, overall, were not very good, which was probably for the best. They did have a chocolate buffet one night, which was really good. Entertainment is good. Kids did get a little bored, as they are too old for the Sesame Street thing and got bored with the XBox thing. Beach is very small, but we never had a problem finding chairs and it's the only place to find shade- none at the pool. The thing we liked best about the stay is the people are amazing! Everyone is SO FRIENDLy and I don't think it's to try to get tips. They seemed genuinely sad when we were leaving- kisses and hugs all around. We did leave a couple of tips when we had exceptional service- such as in Eleanor's (Kirklon). Girls at the BBQ Park were super nice, too. I was really disappointed that we didn't get an upgrade. This was our 5th stay at a Beaches/Sandals property and I thought we should've received an upgrade with no question, but it didn't happen. It was about 70% occupied, I would say and we never waited for dinner (went early usually) and pool didn't seem ridiculously crowded. We did get to go to a nice luncheon for repeat visitors and they had an excellent red snapper and gave us a big bottle of Appleton rum. Overally, the Beaches/Sandals propeties are a good value.

I read reviews and was a little nervous but I did not find most of what I read to be true! The beach was beautiful!! Smaller than some other Beaches properties but \"private\". I much perfer a private beach where you don't have to worry about the kids venturing off too far!! (No-outsiders except a few Jamaican's selling home-made crafts.) We were fortunate enough to get a \"free\" room upgrade to an ocean-view with a balcony (VERY NICE!!) Perhaps the older rooms would not have been as nice - but ours was great! The bed mattresses were not the most comfortable! The staff was wonderful (especially Peter our omelet maker who remember us every morning!) The nightime entertainment was lacking. Not real professional, outside of a few vocal acts. Did not compare to the entertainment you find on a cruise! They could have offered more family type entertainment / like pictionary against other families etc. They also could have diversified their entertainment to include more prizes and also more age groups. The food was comparable to a cruise. Very good! We really like the \"all-inclusive\" so we did not have to pay extra for drinks. Frozen drinks were very good! Regular mixes were very strong =). The snorkel trips were very short, like only 30 minutes in length! MAKE SURE you get a doctor's approval slip BEFORE you go to BEACHES RESORTS \"IF\" you are planning to scuba!! (Check their medical questionaire on-line)!!! Very important as I am a relatively healthy person but because I have allergies & sinus issues I had to get a doctor's permission to Scuba!!
