We had a \u201cdouble\u201d bed (if you could call it that \u2013 his feet hung off the end) and private bathroom. It's by far the most interesting hotel I've stayed at in NYC. The room is literally, a POD. Small as can be, however FABULOUS. Very futuristic in design. I would not recommend for people who are not comfortable in front of one another. The bathroom/shower are divided by a shower curtain and glass door\u2026only one side is frosted. So, if your shy around the other person\u2026you can also use one of the bathrooms down the hall\u2026if your cool with that. Room and hallway was very neat and clean. The hotel lobby was very colorful and modern. Concierge was very helpful and considerate. Roof top lounge is quaint and worth a trip to the 14th floor. Check-in/check-out was easy\u2026as was the Parking Garage down the block. Great location in a cute part of town.
