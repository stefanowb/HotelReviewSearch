It was only about 30 Euros for that ride probably only 10 euro cheaper from the metro ride and worth it every penny when you have plenty of luggage.", "user": "MalaysianLady", "date": "April 15, 2012", "id": 127906746}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very nice, quiet and comfortable", "text": "The reception was really friendly and they helpful with bookings and even our shuttle to the airport even though we didnt book it through them.

While further from downtown than I would have liked, it more than made up for that by being affordable, clean and super comfortable. Bigger room than you traditionally get in Paris, big modern bathroom and very comfortable bed. The rest of the neighbourhood turned out to be a bonus as well - lovely affordable cafe/brasserie around the corner and several markets literally right there. Steps to the Porte St Cloud metro station. You can be downtown in 15 minutes with one change at the Roosevelt station.

It's not really in Auteuil, being on top of the Porte de Saint Cloud roundabout, but it's only three stops along the metro, so close enough. Being a fairly up-market and business district, there aren't too many hotels and those that are mostly either expensive or poor. At Eu135 per night, the HI isn't exactly cheap, but it's a good price for the area. The quality of the accommodations is good - the room was quiet, with free WiFi, a hot shower with plenty of hot water and a comfortable bed - and the staff were friendly and helpful.", "title": "Surprisingly good", "user": "John987654321", "date": "October 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 143253325}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I didn't try the breakfast as it seemed rather expensive at Eu15, and the bar next door (Les Fontaines, I think?) offered a convivial traditional French one for about Eu8.", "title": "Discovered a neat neighborhood!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "slma12", "date": "September 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 140326132}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Very recommendable.", "title": "Does exactly what you would expect.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Paul T", "date": "August 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 138195289}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel is comfortable and clean.

Chose this hotel due to Brand, proximity to Metro and proximity to Roland Garros. My husband was working so needed a business shirt dry cleaned. They offered a same day service yet when he went to collect it the next evening was told it would not be back until the NEXT evening, too late for him! Their regular laundry had let them down so they let us down. The worst part was the lack of communication - they did not advise us, we found out when he went to collect the shirt. And the appalling attitude of the receptionist who could not see why this may have been an issue. Really disappointing. The room itself is very small but modern, clean and functional. The bathroom is actually a waste of space, too large for the room. WiFi was free and functional. Breakfast was fine. If I were to go to Roland Garros again I would consider staying here but it is a long Metro ride out. Couldn't find the decent restaurants that others have spoken about BUT the bakery on the corner was DIVINE !!
