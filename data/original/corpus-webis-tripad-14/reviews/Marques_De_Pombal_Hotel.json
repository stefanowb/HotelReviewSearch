Breakfast buffet is varied and the bread and sweet rolls are wonderful. If anything runs out it is immediately replaced. In our opinion we could not have picked a better hotel. Staff recommended a restaurant at the new revamped dock area for our last night, called Oceanos, the fish was to die for, the cab fare for 4 of us was 4.50 euro's and the bill was not overpriced, but you would need to get reception to make a reservation as it was full the night we were there. Lisbon is a lovely city with a very spacious feel to it, until you get into Alfama and it's winding narrow streets !!, don't miss Tram 28, but as previously mentioned get the 737 bus to the castle as it is a considerable climb to the top from Tram 28, Use tram 28 for the fun ! and sights. Buy a 3 day transport ticket exceptional value as it covers all forms of transport.

They frustratingly claim to have wifi in all public areas. By this they mean the lobby only. In the room, if you have a laptop, you can plug in for free internet access at the desk, but we found this less convenient than wifi. Rooms cleaned daily, and bathroom pleasant. Breakfast is a mediocre buffet, with the usual cereals/cheese/croissants/bacon and eggs/juice/coffee, which is fine.
