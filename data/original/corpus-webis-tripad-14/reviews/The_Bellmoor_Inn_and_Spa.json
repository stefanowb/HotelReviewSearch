I brought my concern to the front desk personnel and they quickly suggested moving rooms. I was offered & shown 2 different rooms, one definitely an upgrade room, but I just changed to same category room. Why? Because comp same catagory room size, decor and over comfort were great, so I didn't feel I needed to upgrade. The decor is lovely and the bedding & linens are very comfortable. Breakfast is served 7:00--10:30am with self-serve buffet, scrambled eggs, bacon, cinnamon oatmeal, pancakes, breads/bagels/muffins, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, OJ, coffee/tea. Plenty of seating as the hotel was not full. The grounds/court yard are relaxing with multiple seating areas around small fountains, some with koi fish. Would definitely stay here again.

The room we stayed in was very comfortable and nice, even for two grown-ups and a little kid (sometimes that can be a little cramped but not at the Bellmoor). We really enjoyed the afternoon \"tea\" and my daughter loved trying the tea and the mini cupcakes, which were refreshed whenever necessary. Breakfast was served in the same area and was amazingly extensive. Nice areas to sit in with your family, either at regular tables or on a little porch-type area.

We like to come to Rehoboth in the fall or early spring outside of the beach season and have stayed at a few properties in the neighborhood of Bellmoor, but this was the first stay there. I chose it primarily because of its location ( close to the beach and shops) and because the room rate includes a full hot breakfast each morning ( which my wife enjoys ). However, the rate was a bit high for the end of the season, but the hotel seemed to be at capacity the weekend we were there. Check in was quick and easy. We had a king deluxe room with a sofa that overlooked the courtyard/patio. The room was a good size, but the sofa and desk were in an odd configuration very close to the bed, so we actually re-arranged the furniture to have a more open space and it made it much more pleasant. My two main complaints about the room was the double-doored armoire, which held the tv, was cheap and flimsy. The drawers were loose and hard to open and close and the look and feel of the thing was pretty downscale for the $239 (friday) and $269(saturday) room rates we paid. Second was the air conditioner was a noisy old under the window type unit ; again, it gave the room a cheaper than expected feel. Other than those two things, we had a nice stay. The hotel has some great common areas for sitting and reading indoors and out on the courtyard or in the pool deck. We found the staff great and helpful and well informed. They gave us a nice restaurant recommendation on the night of our anniversary.

The bedrooms are lovely, the common areas are inviting, with plenty of nooks and crannies for private conversation, and the breakfasts are wonderful. Afternoon tea is a lovely touch. If the Rehoboth Beach weather is less than ideal, it is no compromise to return to the hotel and settle in the library/game room in front of the fire with a good book, or head to the hot tub or spa. A stay at the Bellmoor is the ultimate in relaxation and worth the splurge.", "title": "Our favorite place in Rehoboth", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NancyRae284", "date": "March 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125981819}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We just returned from a quick one night stay in Rehoboth over Easter weekend.

I booked a one BR suite. The room was large, and both the king bed and pull out were comfortable. Breakfast was really great and the staff was attentive and friendly. The location is very convenient to the main street in Rehoboth and the boardwalk.

There was a cute study / library on that floor which had books, board games and snacks available 24 / 7 (soda's, waters, packaged cookies, chip's, etc).
