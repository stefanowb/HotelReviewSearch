During our trip in Italy every hotel was at least 4 or 5 star, but Santa Caterina was simply the best. Concierges are wonderful and will go beyond their duties to accomodate u.

The room was quite and peaceful with all of the amenities of any 5 star we've ever visited... the homemade cookie tray in our room upon arrival was over the top. The hotel staff feels like your extended family (if your extended family is warm and loving). The pool experience is unmatched... the pool bar has counters piled with fresh fruit to make the most delicious blended drinks. Diving off the pool deck into the ocean and playing in the waves after the sun has dipped behind the cliff right before dusk is a must-do. The restaurants are great... breakfast buffet is to die for with their homemade pastries and marmalade.

In general I must say that we have enjoyed the place and we would go back when travelling to this location. It has clearly the best location in town - up on the hill with great views but also private access to the sea. So you dont need to go out to the crowded public beach in town. The service and food is excellent but extremelly overpriced - (non-alcohholic fruit mix drink by the pool -17EUR). Service can often depend on level of tipping and its frequency. Rental of private boat trips are also extremely overpriced - prices start at 1000 EUR/day for small 5-6 seatter. Most rooms are spacious and with the sea view, however they can get pretty noisy at night if you happen to have some load neighbours or it the big cruiseships are parked righ out of hotel for the night - having a disco on the deck until late night.", "title": "Amazing location in Beautiful Amalfi", "user": "adribuccolo", "date": "August 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 38295168}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Best location in Amalfi.

We were not disappointed; the hotel reception rooms were glamourous and beautifully decorated with antiques and pristine white squashy sofas; the floors were handmade white tiles decorated with a profusion of painted flowers. Everywhere we looked was a Wow. The restaurant was a triumph with open air terrace and spectacular views and breakfast here was a joy with the most delicious pastries and fresh fruit that we've ever tasted. Dinner at the Catarina was delicious and the service from all of the staff was amazing ; most of them had been there for many years and they created a wonderful ambience and old fashioned service that many hotels dont give now. The General Manager, Mr Armondo, was one of the nicest people I have met, he escorted us to a wonderful junior suite set in its own grounds that was like being in heaven. The interior was all white and gold with magnificent views from all sides of the room; the jacuzzi being situated in front of the side window for that wow factor. The bathing platform and pool area were cleverly designed; being fashioned from the rocks right at the bottom of the cliff. This was James Bond glamour! We had the Med as our own swimming pool and top class service from the staff. Although expensive, it was worth every penny and we had a wonderful honeymoon experience that we will never forget.

Both times, we had an amazing MAGICAL experience. Not only were the rooms, staff and service superior, but the food...OH THE FOOD was out of this world delicious and the best we have ever tasted. We had the option of going outside the hotel to dine at various restaurants but instead chose to eat every meal at the hotel as it was far superior than anything around. Honestly, we are planning another trip now. Once you have experienced a stay at this hotel, the feeling you have when you are there will become a part of you and you will want to go back as often as you can. Additionally, the VALUE you have there for the service is off the charts. I fully recommend the Santa Caterina Hotel to couples, families, groups and singles traveling alone.

Four nights at the Santa Caterina in Amalfi were the highlight of the trip. This is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in, perhaps one of the most beautiful on the Amalfi coast. There are other more glamorous hotels in Positano and Ravello, but for sheer charm and beauty, this one is my pick. It's not glitzy, just pristinely beautiful with white tiled floors, white furniture, and flowers everywhere. We had a beautiful balcony room overlooking the sea, and the king-size bed was very comfortable. A plate of fresh fruit and a vase of flowers greeted us when we entered the rooms. The exquisite pool was an elevator ride down, on a large terrace just above the water's edge. The superb breakfast was served on a terrace overlooking the sea - the pastries were often still warm when we got there, and the fresh fruit and other items were of the highest quality.
