It was sort of out in the middle of nowwhere but that was fine for just overnight. The pool was small but clean. There were lots of clean, fluffy towels for us to use and a hamper to but the dirty ones in. There was a bathroom right at the pool so we didn't have to drag wet kids though the lobby for one. The room was very clean and they gave each bed three pillows! The free breakfast was extensive and there was plenty of seating for everyone.
