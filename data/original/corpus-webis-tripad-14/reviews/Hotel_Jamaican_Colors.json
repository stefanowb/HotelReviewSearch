We stayed two nights when we really only needed to stay one night because we were not impressed at all with Port Antonio. Guess we expected it to be a bit more like Montego Bay or even Ocho Rios but instead found a very quiet town. Having been to several other cities in Jamaica we decided to give Port Antonio a try, oh well, we won't be going back. As for the hotel, not bad if you want to relax by the pool and catch a breeze from the cliffside. Beware of mosquitos at night cause they are very hungry.
