We were simply expecting a place to sleep during our shopping excursion at Sawgrass Mills. However, the rooms were so dirty that we were extremely disappointed. Yes, I said \"rooms\"--- although there was just me and my wife---because for the first time ever, I actually asked to change rooms at a hotel. The first room we were assigned was extremely DIRTY. Many surfaces in the room were not clean, but the icing on the cake were the three sizeable dried urine stains on the toilet seat. There was also a beer cap on the floor in front of the garbage can in plain sight, and it was obvious the room had not been vacuumed in some time given the various debris on the floor.", "title": "Poor housekeeping prevented us from writing a good review!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Dave_Shutterbug", "date": "March 31, 2009", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 27189835}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled with family", "text": "(For those that might say the odd oversight might occur and perhaps a clerical error was made on some paperwork regarding the room being cleaned---It was obvious housekeeping had been in the room because a fresh sticker had been placed on the toliet paper roll to indicate their presence. )", "title": "Great stay at La Quinta", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MJTT", "date": "December 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 22693690, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 New , modern rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 Smoky corridors"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled on business", "text": "When we went to the 2nd room there were pubic hairs in the bath tub and one very noticeably on the toilet; but we decided that overall the second room was much better and we were afraid to ask for a third room given that we were only staying one night and in a hurry to get to the mall.", "title": "Best Kept Secret!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Grammy L", "date": "June 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 16642938, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The staff", "disliked": "\u2014 N/A It was all good!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at La Quinta Inn and Suites for one night while in town for the Bon Jovi concert.
