It was our first holiday in 10 years. We were very cold in the room the first night and was unable to get the heating working with the controls , told by the front desk that it was not working but they would send up a heater, worked fine and was warmer in no time, remember really tired so feeling a bit cheesed off. Had the best nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel, the mattress topper on the bed and of course my choice of pillow all added to the great comfort. I am not very good at staying in strange beds usually do not sleep well at all, but this bed was great. The second day a bit brighter all round, mood better, had a great nights sleep, so opinion changed, felt the room was fine, big and plenty of space for all our stuff. I must say the staff especially the doormen were absolutely delightful, very very helpful and so so pleasant all the time. Our room was kept reasonably clean, felt it could have been a bit better but fine. The location of the hotel is brilliant just short walk to 5th Avenue, Central Station, Saks, The NBA shop, Central Park, and Rockaffella Centre. Found our way about in no time, the shopping is fantastic, absolutely no money left now, but who cares!!! all well worth it. The only disappointment is that the hotel has no bar and a nightcap before bed and a chance to mingle with other hotel guests would have been good, but hey, has done our livers the world of good.

If I need to find any flaws with this establishment (and I really have to think hard...) I would say that there was a little bit of water damage in the bathroom, but nothing that affected the cleanliness of it - there was no mildew or antiquated bathtub caulk - and the bathroom was on the smaller size. But in NYC, I expect things to be a little on the efficient, space-saving side. The other thing I noted was that the cabinets in the kitchen were on the low-budget side, but I was so tickled to even have a kitchen in my suite, I really didn't care!

Prior to arriving at La Guardia Airport, I called the hotel to see about getting car service from the airport to the hotel. The hotel uses a company called Spectacular Limo Service. I explained that there would be 3 ladies, who would have about 3 suitcases per person. The bellhop assured me that the town car would be large enough to accommodate our luggage and us. We were disappointed when we were cramped in the town car and learned that we could have gotten a larger vehicle for a better price from the Dial 7 Company. We did the party shuttle tour, but I wouldn't recommend it. It was hard to really see the buildings the tour guide was showing us; therefore, I would recommend the double-decker bus tour.

After having stayed at many New York hotels over the years I have to say that the Affinia is one of the best overall values that I've expereinced. We had a full suite - more like an apartment - not one of those tiny so-called suites you find in some hotels, and it was very quiet given it was away from the street. The staff are all a friendly bunch, all helpful, especially Rome at the front door. Ask him if he's from Rome and you'll get a very funny answer. The overall service is a cut above other hotels (and many that cost a lot more money). We asked for two small repairs and they were done within minutes. We asked for a few supplies and they brought them (and more) right away. Every restaraunt choice they suggested was better than average. On top of the large accomodations, nice furnishings and quiet room, the suite's price was equivalent to a room in many less-stellar hotels around town. I rarely leave Manhattan saying I loved that hotel and will stay there again. Well, on my next trip to the Big Apple I know where I'm staying - the Affinia. There's only one small neagative I saw the whole week at this place. The room service isn't in house, but comes from a restaraunt across the steet. It's an Indian place called The Mint. The food we ordered came fast but it was on the equivalent of a bad diner - and a bad diner with very high prices. We didn't order Indian food (maybe that would have been better) but they had a selection of Continental dishes. Speaking of diners, there's a great one (can't rember the name) about a hundred-yards east of the hotel on the same side of the street. Bottom Line: great location (next to several hotels, and conveineinet to Second Ave with more eateries than you could ever make it to), great, spacious accomodations at good prices and nice people working there.

The bed was very comfortable, i did like the coffee machine in the room. There is a laundry in the basement which was excellent. The downside of this hotel is not having a restaurant, although there is a lot and of restaurants close by it would have been great to have that option. The room service that was available is from Mint across the road, I must say it was terrible, the food was so average and overpriced. The hotel should do itself a favour and maybe get the room service from another restaurant. They do offer breakfast during the week which is toast, pastries and fruit. I would recommend people to stay here as it is clean, comfy bed and close to most things, but do not stay here if you normally stay at 4.5 or 5 star hotels.
