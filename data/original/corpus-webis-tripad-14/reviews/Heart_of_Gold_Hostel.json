As long as you know you are booking budget accomodation then you should not be disappointed. I can't comment on the dorm rooms as we had booked an ensuite twin room. The only negative about the whole experience was finding out that ensuite rooms have a private shower and sink, but no toilet!

The location is excellent - very easy to reach on public transport, close to major attractions (the Reichstag is a 20 minute walk), and in a great area for eating out in the evening. The hostel is just behind Oranienburger Strasse which is lined with restaurants and bars, so you will be spoilt for choice.

Accommodation is basic, but it's perfectly adequate. Beds and pillows were fine, although the bedlinen smelt slightly musty. There is a great bar area in the hostel that is open 24 hours for the insomniacs amongst us. The staff are really friendly and helpful, loaning us padlocks for the lockers and helping us make a reservation at a particular restaurant we wanted to eat at. There are loads of flyers and leaflets advertising sightseeing trips and the staff are also happy to advise. We went on a bicycle tour of Berlin run by Fat Tyre which was awesome - definitely recommended as a good way of seeing the main sights.
