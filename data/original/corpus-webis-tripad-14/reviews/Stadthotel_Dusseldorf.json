The hotel is in a great location, just a 10 minute walk to the Alstadt, but with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. There is also a bar joined on to the hotel reception. The room we has was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for a short stay, including a map of the city which we found useful. the breakfast was fine for the price, with plenty of breads, cold meat, cheese, eggs, bacon, yoghurt and a waffle maker.
