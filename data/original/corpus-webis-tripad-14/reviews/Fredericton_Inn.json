They changed us to room # 116 which was no better. There was mildew on the window, the bathroom floor stayed wet, even the beddings were damp.

The hotel is frequently used by small trade shows and business conventions. In addition, the hotel is adjacent to several shopping malls and fast food spots. Take away its convention/meeting space and put this hotel on the outskirt of town, you have a hotel that is outdated and just slightly above acceptable rates. Now don't get me wrong, the hotel is very well kept and clean, it just lacks the upgrades and trendy decor that would pull it out of the 1990s. Even the onsite restaurant seems to be a time piece from decades ago. In terms of my stay: there was plenty of hot water and water pressure; the bed was comfortable but not fabulous; room temperature was good with great ventilation (no typical hotel stuffiness); there are plenty of WiFi spots and in room internet; the staff was pleasant and helpful.
