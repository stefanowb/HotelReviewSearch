Haghia Sophia, Blue Mosque and other sights can be reached within 15 minutes walking. Hundreds of restaurants, stores and bars are in located within the area. Fairly quiet at night but try to get a room in the back, there is construction going on across from the hotel entrance and that can be quite noisy, even on on weekends. The hotel is a perfect size, not too big, not too small. There is a bar in the lobby and a restaurant for dinner and breakfast on the rooftop with a spectacular view of Old Istanbul. There is also a terrace in summer as well. Decor is tasteful (except for the awful fireplace), without the usual 'Kitsch' so it is easy on the Western eye.", "title": "Turkish charm", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "travellerLPM", "date": "November 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146007230}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012", "text": "Rooms:", "title": "Unbeatable location and great service.", "user": "AndyTver", "date": "November 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 145625475}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Good size rooms, comfortable beds, fully equipped with everything you might need, including a small table, 2 chairs, flatscreen-TV, Minibar.
