We had a massive room in the new section of the property which was really nicely laid out, with a comfy bed and high quality linens. I was kinda expecting olde worlde stuff which can sometimes be a bit tired, but the quality of the furnishings was excellent. The only downside was the tiny tv, but then again on a weekend away in such a lovely place with one's partner, tv should not be required!! We ate dinner at the Inn and that was good, with nice wine and all was reasonably priced. Breakfast was sumptuous and served in the kitchen by the friendly hosts - quite a nice touch. I will definitely be going back to the Fitzroy Inn, its so close to Sydney but is also worlds away.", "title": "A quality retreat in the country, on Sydney's doorstep", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CiaraB", "date": "July 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 71103430}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Historic building in beautiful gardens - friendly hosts - huge, warm comfortable rooms.
