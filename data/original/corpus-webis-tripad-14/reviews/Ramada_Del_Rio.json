Room was inexpensive, basic, and clean. Free high speed internet, a nice looking pool area but a below par restaurant (dirty, out of some menu items, etc). Paid half price since we were visiting family over the holiday, not sure I would pay full price. For a basic roadside motel, not a bad option.", "title": "Ok at half price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "rcmjr", "date": "January 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4320285}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "This hotel lies amidst busy local highways but, as long as you have a poolside room, no traffic noises at all.", "title": "Highway peace", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Tet14", "date": "December 9, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4222865}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Overbooked - with guaranteed room", "text": "Staff is helpful but slow and somewhat disorganized.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 1, 2005", "id": 3518799}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Del Rio"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 15, "average": 30, "very good": 56, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 59}, "aka": "Ramada Inn Del Rio Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.454545454545}
