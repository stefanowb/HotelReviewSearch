However be aware that the hotel or the tour providers are misrepresenting the rooms and the amenities they come with. We booked a room that was advertised as a \"full bath\" apon arrivel we were informed a \"full bath\" is shower only, this a non starter as my wife only bathes. They offered a up grade to a suite at a cost of 50.00 a night which we reluctanlly accepted. The problem we faced with our reservation seemed to be occuring to a number of other travlers as we found out while speeking to other people during our stay. We had contacted Westjet on two occasions and inquiered if the full bath meant a bath tub and we were insured that there was a tub. The people we spoke to at the hotel said only the suites have a tub and it was not their fault for the error the tour provider was at fault so the up grade cost was out of our pocket. Based on our conversations with other travlers who were misled by the advertising of the rooms all were from western Canada and used West jet Holidays, Trasat Holidays and Air Canada holidays. The holiday and stay at the resort was great but do your homework and be sure you are getting what you have paid for.

We have learned our lesson not to waste our time. You need to pay for daily maid service which is a good idea since there is no dishwasher. One good thing is that the Grand Baja is very close to the Mega for shopping. We bought all our water and breakfast foods and snacks there. It is close to the airport and town of San Jose. you can take a 5 pesos bus or 5$ US taxi into town. It only takes about 5-10 minutes into town. It is charming with a 16th century church, town square many old buildings with courtyards that house shops and restaurants. Our favorite-- Tropicana-- old traditional, with live entertainment. I would not recommend Local Eight-- pricey, small menu and so so atmosphere. We also had a great meal at Habaneros. It has a huge menu and it was very good and great service with great prices.

The weather was great the whole time but it started getting cold around 4:30pm The nights were cool and an extra blanket was needed in the room. Bring a sweater or light coat for wondering about at night. The staff were all very helpful, friendly, and the service for everything was great. Violetta thank you for all the emails and info I requested before we flew out. Hugo you were one of our main waiters and your service was impeccable. Thank you. Our tour guide, sorry I can't remember your name. You were on the bus with us on the way to the hotel and going back to the hotel. You also were presenting the meeting the day after we arrived. You were also great. Lucas the activity coordinator you were the best. You work far to hard and way to many hours. You were always around organizing everything, always there when someone needed you. And you fit me in last for Kareokee. When we went the hotel was only about 40% full. We requested a room on the 5th floor as this is the top floor and you have nobody above you. We also upgraded to a deluxe ocean view. If you want to be directly facing the beach you need to request a beachfront rooms. All the floors are tile. Monday night is musical trivia, Tuesday night is all inclusive in the sky bar from 9-11pm. Any other time you have to pay. Wed. nights was kareokee. Thursday night was live dancers. Friday was live music, saturday night was casino night and bingo night and Sunday was a bonfire on the beach with live music. This was by far the best. Guitars, bass drums and more. There are 5 pools at this resort. The swim up bar is not heated and barely any one uses it. Also the adult only pool is not heated. The main pool with the volleyball nets is big and warm and the infinity pool is warm and right on the ocean. The food was great. The home made omelettes in the morning and the fresh fruit and salad variety was to die for. There are two Al A carte restaraunts. We only went to the Mexican one. Las Jicamas. You have to make reservations for these. The mexican restaraunt was quiet and the service was slow. The portions were also very small so order lots of appetizers. It took an hour after our appetizers to get our dinner and it was also small.. Drinks flow freely at this resort. Drinks start at 11 am and end at 11 pm sharp. Unless you go up to the sky bar and pay. Everyone agrees that the drinks are watered down. But they will make you anything. The popular drink everyone was drinking was called a dirty monkey. The service was always great and the staff were all very professional.. After 11pm when the bar shuts down you have the option of ordering room service until 1 am and it is free. We tipped them I think 2 or 3 us dollars or 20 or 30 pesos. When we ordered drinks we gave the waitress 20 pesos or 2 bucks us 2 or 3 times per day. The maids we left them a dollor or two per day. They all work very hard and on average they only make 5 to 7 dollars a day. The grounds were also impeccable. And the men were out there every day clipping and maintaining them. I believe most of the rooms only have showers and their is an electronic safe in the room and a mini fridge stocked with water, pop, juice, etc. The bell boy did come to our room once and knocked on the door asking if we needed anything and he gave us 4 cervaca's for 2 bucks us. They also have a kids area and free babysitting or they will come to your room and babysit.

They where Mega Store shirts and ask you if they can help you with finding anything and then they start hitting you up on coming to see there properties offering you 200 bucks a couple and a deal on an excursion. We booked all of our excursions through the hotel. The prices were reasonable. They had a deal by three excursions and get one or two free. But they had to be the ones with an asterik by them. We didn't take advantage of this deal. Our funnest adventure by far and I highly recommend this is the Cabo Adventure tour, ziptrecking, rock climbing, rappelling, crazy bridge, crazy ladder. From the time we left to the time we got back we were gone for 5 hours..This is done in the mountains and over water. So if you want a rush try it.They take pictures of you and then try and sell them to you and they are a rip off. They wanted $120 us for about 15 pictures on a disc for the two of us. And they give you crap if they catch you pulling out your camera. My husband always went first and then snuck pictures and video of me when the guides were all on the other side. We also went ATV ing in the dessert. It was very dusty but they provide you with goggles, a helmut, and a bandana.This was fun. They took us into this old village where only about 200 people live. They took us down to this catholic rock and into the church. We rode along side the baha raceway. And afterwards they gave us all a meal and some coke. This tour was fun and we were gone for about 4 hours from the time we left. Both of these tours are in Cabo. We also took a tour through Rancho tours to Cabo and went on the glass bottom boat. We got to see lover's beach, divorce beach, and now I know why they call it that and people have died there. The current is incredible. They dropped us off at pelican beach where we had lunch walked around, and tried to snorkel. Apparently the snorkelling was incredible and you could touch the fish and the water was clear but it was a windy day and the water was to cold for me to go past my waist. We took the boat back early so we could wonder around cabo and do some shopping. The time share people are everywhere as are the vendors and watch out for the drug dealers, we must of got asked in about an hours time 25 times if we wanted to buy drugs and any kind of drugs and there were police everywhere. So beware. This tour was also great but everything is kind of expensive but cabo is beautiful. We brought our own snorkelling equipment so you have the option of taking the local bus into cabo for about 2 bucks us and paying 10 bucks to go out on the boat and get dropped off.
