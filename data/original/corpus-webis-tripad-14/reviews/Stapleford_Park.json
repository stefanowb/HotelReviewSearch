A superb Georgian house in acres of grounds with numerous opportunities for rural or health club activities. We enjoyed an overnight stay, looked after very well by the mostly young but charming staff. Full afternoon tea was as indulgent as you would expect. Other meals were a little disappointing. The 'Fine Dining' dinner menu suffered from being too fancy and, we thought, not well conceived. Too many conflicting ideas on a single plate. Also, a pre-dinner drink and one bottle of wine from a list with no reasonably priced items made a rather too significant increase in the bill. Breakfast buffet food was of excellent quality but had been sitting too long. The staff, because of their youth, however willing, were just not well enough informed or experienced. There was no sommelier for example so advice about the list was honest but unhelpful. We have considered (not seriously) going back with a hamper so that we could enjoy the place without having to pay rather too much for food and drink that don't match up to the promise of the property.", "user": "firstposition", "date": "April 1, 2013", "id": 156291231}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "needs some proper management", "text": "there is a real problem with the management at Stapleford. There are endless staff around, very few of whom have any idea how to do their job. Time and again a waiter would appear at our table and say \"have you ordered x\" and we would say no as we had ordered y. Then on several occasions our orders did not appear until we had chased them. The food was generally good but unless one orders \"fine dining\" which is good but not worth \u00a355 if one has two courses and cheese, the menu is like a pub menu. The drinks are crazily expensive. A double hendricks gin and tonic was \u00a318.50, the most expensive drink I have ever had anywhere in the world. The staff were all friendly but there seemed to be no-one in control until Easter Sunday morning when an older woman who obviously knew what she was doing took over. all in all a great location spoiled by terrible service.", "user": "cazzacLondon", "date": "April 1, 2013", "id": 156289397}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Afternoon Tea - good but missing the finer details", "text": "Although we enjoyed out visit to Stapleford Park I feel for such a grand hotel some of the finer details were missing. We were seated in the restaurant and although the service was fine I did not feel it was top notch. There seemed to be 2 very well trained serving staff and some others who were not as confident or professional. The food was fine and the scones of a very good quality. However the cups were something you'd expect to get at the motorway services and the sugar provided was in individual granule sachets. I just felt some nice bone china and coarse sugar lumps would have been more befitting and took the edge off the lovely teapots, strainers and cake stand. Also we were seated at 2.30 crossing over with the lunchtime diners. We were there for over 2 hours and in that time the two large tables either side of us were not cleared. I saw at least 5 different staff in the restaurant and felt somebody should have cleared the tables at some point. I really did like the surroundings and enjoyed the food but just felt things could have been done a little bit better.", "user": "ClaireB10030", "date": "March 31, 2013", "id": 156136818}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Absolute Luxury in Leicestershire", "text": "This former stately home makes a sumptuous and palatial hotel.
