If you don't like being on the 30th floor of some skyscraper then this is the Tokyo hotel for you. The highest floor possible is the 10th and the majority are lower. It is also very good if you want to get outside for some fresh air as it has an outdoor (as well as indoor) pool and a small garden area. This particularly suits those staying for longer periods and those with small children who need a break from sight seeing all day.", "title": "Good for those with vertigo!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "sjwoolnough", "date": "August 20, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3791581}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2004", "text": "Overall it is a good hotel although a little dated now in its decor but still immaculate.
