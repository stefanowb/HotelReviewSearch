The rooms were very modern and spacious with tons of windows. The bathroom however does not have a fan which I thought was a little odd for being such a nice place. There was a hot breakfast buffet every morning with an omelet station that I would rate as average. The person at the front desk was not overly friendly but nice enough. The valet seemed a little unorganized as it took them 20 minutes to retrieve my car and after waiting they brought me someone else's vehicle. A regular sized bottle of water in the lobby store runs about $2.50 and in the vending machines $2.00 each. A room key is needed to access the elevators and vending areas which is a nice safety feature if you aren't forgetful. There is a salon on the second floor which was nice and decently priced. All of the girls were very friendly. The beds however were extremely comfortable, great night's sleep. This hotel is very centrally located and overall a nice place to stay while in Buffalo.", "title": "Great rooms!", "user": "Ashley0202", "date": "July 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167205793}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Extra cost of parking and valet service leave a little to be desired but hotel is very clean and nice.

We were on the 4th floor. Made to order breakfast was nice as usual. The maid service was suspect. I asked for replacement towels and they must have thought we didn't want our room cleaned. Asked for extra toilet paper the next day and they didn't clean the room again! The manager's welcome events at night had pretty lousy snacks.

We were able to drive to the Seneca Casino/Hotel and park there for free while we went on the 4 hour tour (it was actually a 5 hour tour).

With a family of four we love the large rooms, two queen beds and the queen pullout couch. The hotel is fairly new and very well maintained. We asked for extra towels and pillows and they were brought up within 5 minutes. The location is great if you are doing things downtown or as everything in Buffalo and their suburbs is relatively close you are pretty much within 30 minutes of most everything. One highlight and money saver is the free breakfast which is very good, particularly the made to order omelet station. The gym is not huge, but not small and has enough equipment for most people to get in a good workout. Next to the gym is an indoor pool which is smaller than the one next door at the Hampton Inn and we saw parents with young kids using it, but it is not very big. If you're driving a car then you do have to valet it ( the Hampton Inn has a free parking lot for their guests) and it is $15 per day. The valet staff was always quick to bring the car around, usually no more than 5 minutes and when we remembered to call ahead it was always there waiting for us. We got a great rate ( pre-paid) on Hotels.com and overall were very pleased with our stay. We have also stayed at a suite at the Hampton Inn next door and in my opinion the two hotels are very similar, if you can get a suite at the Hampton Inn.", "title": "Very solid choice, great for families", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "wjnj", "date": "July 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 169365294}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Strongly recommend this hotel.
