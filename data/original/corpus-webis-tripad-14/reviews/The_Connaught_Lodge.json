We stayed for one night and whilst the check-in was efficient I wouldn't say it was partiularly welcoming or special. The room was of fairly good size but the bed was hard and the bathroom tired. There was no sound insulation whatsoever between the room and the corridor outside - a couple having a conversations outside our room might as well have been in bed with us. Breakast was fine and the guy who was serving the full English was excellent but when I asked for more coffee the waitress who went to get the pot then proceeded to go to every table but ours to offer a refill. I found the whole experience rather souless whereas at the Green House (which unfortunately for us was fully booked) the staff make you feel that you are not just another punter on the conveyor belt.", "title": "Maybe it is just me.....", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BigMac58", "date": "July 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 133465041}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just returned from a weekend at the Connaught lodge. The lodge and the facilities in the neighbouring hotel were excellent, and great value for money. We were particularly impressed with the standard of customer service. Every member of staff that we encountered was polite, warm and friendly.The breakfast quality was excellent, and the atmosphere warm and welcoming. The rooms were basic but very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Hotel is well located and parking adequate. My only minor complaint would be the communal doors in the lodge make a very loud bang when left to close on their own, and this was quite disturbing at 7am on Sunday morning! Some soft close hinges would do the trick! Overall a great experience, and has restored my faith in the British seaside hotel.Congratulations to the manager and staff you have a great team. We will definately be returning and recommending this hotel.", "title": "Connaught Lodge", "user": "suecocking", "date": "July 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 133314167}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Lodge is next door to the hotel and very well located for all amenites, both in the hotel and in Bournemouth Centre. 5 min walk to BIC and beach. The rooms were large and very clean - fantastic shower! The only problem we had was that the bed was VERY soft, but apart from that, everything was great. Breakfast in the hotel was great - plenty of variety (including gluten free, which makes a pleasant change !).
