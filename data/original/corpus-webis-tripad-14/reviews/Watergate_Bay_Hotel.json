We had a standard room on the ground floor which was perfect as we had doors out on to the garden which was great for us, dog and little one. The room was small, especially as we had the travel cot up as well, but actually it was fine. OK so it wasn't a fancy room with rolltop bath in the window, but it was very comfy, and had everything we needed. Perhaps not enough places to put things up out of a toddlers reach but that's nitpicky! The bed was large and very comfortable, black out curtains keep you sleeping soundly when the sun is up at 5am. There's no aircon and boy it was hot hot hot! But I guess in the UK that doesn't happen often and you can leave the windows and door open. I had a fan delivered from reception and that made it better. First tip: if you're using the hotel's travel cot, bring a travel cot mattress as they just provide the standard hard mattress that comes with the cot.", "user": "WaltR", "date": "July 5, 2009", "id": 33952704}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We tried all the different dining options - breakfast in the hotel is great, but beware those without children - it can get a little hectic with lots of hungry children in the morning.

Living Space is just lovely in the evening - watching the sun go down on the terrace with a cocktail - could have been anywhere in the world! Fifteen was brilliant, WAY above my expectations.

The hotel is situated on a lovely bay, on a gorgeous sandy beach with amazing views. We had a lovely ocean view from our room which was very comfortable, perhaps a little stingy with the toiletries, but that was that was our only criticism. (An iron, hairdryer, iPod docking station, flat screen tv /dvd player, broadband access ,all standard) The staff couldn't have done any more for us.They were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble - they were like this with everyone! The hotel attracted clients from all age groups- couple with young babies, young children, young couples through to OAPs. It was a lovely atmosphere and everyone seemed to be enjoying it. We were very lucky with the weather, brilliant sunshine for our 4 days.

The family room consisted of a main bedroom and bathroom (great shower!) and a seperate small bunkroom for the childfren. The rooms were well decorated and maintained and kept very clean. They were also well equipped with TV, telephones, iPod docking station, etc, though we didn't spend much time in them at all. After checking in (very easy, with pleasant helpful staff who fuly explained what was on offer - free children's entertainment and 'taster' lessons in things like surfing and bodyboarding - during our stay) we headed straight to the beach, which was excellent - clean, uncrowded and right outside the hotel! The children also used both the indoor and outdoor pools at the hotel and they had no complaints, but be aware that there are no staff on duty at the pools and that children under 16 need to be supervised by an adult. The hotel also provides internet access and there is a small computer/games room which is useful if you haven't brought your own laptop or the children haven't brought their Gameboy or whatever they use. There are only 2 computers though and I think 4 games consoles so I guess it could get busy if the weather is bad. To use the games consoles you have to leave a \u00a310 deposit for the games controllers (and also for any other games equipment, such as table tennis bats, you borrow) which you obtain from reception. There is also a large children's playroom with TV downstairs in which here was free entertainment during the afternoons when we were there, which was a nice touch. The food, both at breakfast (an extensive buffet) and dinner was excellent and the service couldn't be faulted. The staff in all areas of the hotel were unfailingly helpful and well mannered and nothing was too much trouble. The only comment I would make about dinner is that the wine can be expensive, but I guess that's to be expected in a hotel like this and you don't have to buy it! We also found the food and drink in The Beach Hut, whilst very nice, rather expensive though the food in the hotel bar area was more reasonable (and very good - the cream tea scones in particular were delicious, and definitely hit the spot after an afternoon's surfing), as were the bar prices if I recall correctly. We also used the Extreme Academy to try surfing for the first time for all the family. My wife was a bit reticent about trying this but we all ended up being totally hooked and had a fantastic time, and luckily when we booked they were doing a 2 days for the price of 1 offer! On our 3rd day the children joined the hotel's free bodyboarding 'taster' session and I just hired a wetsuit and board and joined them for another afternoon in the surf, my wife deciding to have a relaxing afternoon on the beach. The Extreme Academy staff were very good but could have been a little more proactive in the water, though I guess they were more concerned with keeping an eye on the children than with advising adults on their surfing skills, so I can't really complain about that. The owner was also a bit keen to get people out of the premises and shut up shop at the end of the day and could have been a little more tolerant - as parents it's not always easy to move at lightning speed when you're dealing with teenagers and trying to get small children out of wetsuits and showered and changed. However, the hire/tuition charges for surfing were reasonable and the instructors seemed to know what they were doing, which is always good! :-) Overall, our first visit to the Watergate Bay Hotel and it's environs made a very favourable and lasting impression and we will definitely be back, though maybe not in the main hotel as we did feel it was a little expensive (over \u00a3280 per night DBB for a faily of 2 adults and 2 children) even if it was the Easter holidays. We'll either try the Coach House (still part of the Watergate Bay Hotel but cheaper rooms) or maybe even take the children out of school so we can take advantage of some of the offers mentioned by other reviewers on Tripadvisor. We would thoroughly recommend a stay at the Watergate Bay Hotel though, and are already looking to book for next year.", "title": "Excellent hotel in a superb location, if a little overpriced", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "oracledba", "date": "April 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27992296}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "For us this was all we required for a weekend away from the kids.
