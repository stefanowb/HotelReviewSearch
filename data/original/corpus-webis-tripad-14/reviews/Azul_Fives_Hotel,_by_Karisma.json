BUT, I cannot say enough positive things about this resort. It was by far the most beautiful place we've stayed in. I've been to Mexico several times, and at high-end resorts, but we just had a wonderful experience here. Travelled with my husband and three children - ages 24, 20 and 12, and my 20 yrs. old's friend, who is 25. While my 12 year old wanted nothing to do with the Kids area, she was happy to spend the entire time with us. From the moment we arrived, we had a friendly greeting and offered \"azul/blue\" colored champagne as a welcome. My 12 year old daughter was given a nice cool bottle of water, which was very refreshing for her! While they did have the cool refresher towels there also, we were not offered them - not sure why, and we didn't ask. After we took a family photo for our room keys, we arrived before our 2 bedroom suite was ready. I took the advice of several travellers who left reviews, and asked for a suite in Villa 14 - and they accomodated us. Yes, Villa 14 is the place to be! It is in the center of everything - from the restaurants to the infinity pool and the beach. We left our luggage with them, as they said it would be taken to our suite when ready, and because we arrived almost 2 hours prior to check-in, we were able to get some lunch. As we were all driven by golf cart to the walkway to the beach, (which we really could have walked), we had lunch at the bbq area, which was delicious. The guys that prepare lunch here are so friendly, and everyone just about knows very good English. However, it was fun for my kids to brush up on their Spanish with many of the staff! After lunch, we walked around the resort and to the beautiful turquoise ocean. They had afternoon volleyball everyday as well as soccer and bocce ball. We really enjoyed the Salsa lessons too right by the pool. After we were driven to our room, and walked into our suite, we were in absolute awe. The suites are beautiful! With our two bedroom suite, there were separate entrances for both bedrooms, but connected through the main entrance. The kitchen, dining and living rooms were connected to the master room, with french doors for privacy. Each bedroom had its own patio with sliding doors, and right outside your bedroom was the sparkling pool - like a lazy river that went all throughout the resort. Several pool swim-up bars were all around as well. The restaurants were very good, and Sea Olive was our absolute favorite. Roberto, our favorite waiter really took good care of us! We actually ate there for lunch and dinner on the same day! While tipping is not necessary, we tipped everyone, as they all gave us such wonderful service. Domingo always took care of us at the pool bars, and if you want top shelf liquor, it's your's for the asking. The capacity the week we were there was about half full, which was nice to not have to wait for seating in any of the restaurants. Breakfast at Flavours was your typical breakfast buffet, but enough of a variety where you can something different every day. The sushi that everyone raved about on other reviews was just OK, it was your typical sushi -- but again, the wonderful service made it very enjoyable.", "title": "Absolutely Fabulous!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Kdisy", "date": "August 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116868686}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled solo", "text": "The beach, as told by others, is not one to swim in, however, is wonderful for beach volleyball, and soccer. We did not mind at all walking down to the other resorts to their beach. One day we ventured to the right of our beach, which was about a five minute walk, and that was pleasant. The next day we went to our left, about a ten minute walk, and that's where they had wave-runners and parasailing if you wanted, and the beach there was magnificent. The sand is so soft under your feet, and the beautiful, crystal clear ocean was remarkable.

They made us stand around for 20 mins while we were explaining that our friends were at a reception and were not reachable at their room. Finally after considerable amounts of pleading, someone tracked down a manager who knew we were coming and we were cleared. If only it were that easy. We basically had to sign three pages of waivers and turn over our driver's license before they let us in the property. What. The. Heck.The worst part was that there were three people in the front.
