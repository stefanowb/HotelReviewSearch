The Hotel was clean with nice size rooms and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We also had an hour free internet access for our laptop every day in our room which proved very useful. The restaurant also had a lovely restaurant in the basement where we ate fantastic Dim Sum. The location is right in the centre of down town Kowloon, which if you want to experience the locals Hong Kong then this is the place to be. If you prefer to be among westerners then you should probably look at a hotel further south in Tsim Sha Tsui or on Hong Kong Island. Whilst in Hong Kong you should try not to miss the restaurants on Lamma Island, especially at Sok Kwu Wan, the horseracing at Happy valley or the view from the bar at the top of the Peninsular.", "title": "Great stay in Hong Kong", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "gamby", "date": "December 30, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4311842}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Gateway to Toy Haven", "text": "Being an avid toy collector, my husband loved the accessibility of the Stanford Hotel to Argyle Street where rare collectible items can be found.
