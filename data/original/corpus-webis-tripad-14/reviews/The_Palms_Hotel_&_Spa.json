We arrived early and were happy to find out that our room was ready. I booked an ocean front king bed through Orbitz. The weird thing was that when we checked in they wanted to give us a two bed Ocean front. On our reservation it said King bed/ two beds. The person checking us in insisted that it would be a two bed room because we booked through Orbitz and that we could contact them if it was and issue. However he ended up giving us a king bed with a connecting door to another room. Not sure what the deal with this was though. It was a little annoying but I was happy because the room was ready early. The room was a little small. Our room had some water damage and the curtain had a cigarette burn on it. The bathroom was nice and modern and separated from the toilet. Our view was very nice. The beach was great and there were plenty of umbrellas available on the two days were were able to lay out. It rained the other two. One thing that I was not aware of but that I now see is on their website is the $14 daily charge. This is for wireless access,Gym access and beach chairs, local dialing and toll-free calls, Newspaper daily (I copied and pasted this right from their site). The internet access sucked.

Very modern and upbeat decor in the rooms and lobby was contemporary. The room was pretty neat and beds were extremely comfortable. The glass back splash in the bath room was very stylishly. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Aveda products in the bath room and learned that they had an Aveda spa inhouse. The private beach was beautiful, clean and not at all crowded. We caught glimpse of an American wedding on the beach during our stay. The only minus was a valet parking of $30 but considering the fact that you need to shell out $30 to park on south beach on friday night, I don't mind being charged for valet!", "title": "Absolutely Amazing", "user": "LisaRod326", "date": "September 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 140812706}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I always appreciate great customer service and as we were met at our car the Staff was immediately responsive to all of our needs.

It doesn't look like much from the front, but than we walked into the lobby and WOW it was beautiful. it is like being at a plantation and we loved sitting outside in the covered patio area. It was very romantic, like being on a second honeymoon. The pool is not huge, but it is a nice pool and the beach area was very enjoyable. We arrived right after isaac and had the best weather, clear and sunny. Our rate included the breakfast buffet which was amazing and $50 towards dinner at Essensia which was very nice. The service at both was excellent. The cons; Their drink prices were outrageously expensive. We paid $40 for two mediocre martinis. Also one day we were out of our room early and came back late afternoon and our room had not been serviced.
