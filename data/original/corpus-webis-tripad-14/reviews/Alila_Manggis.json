We had come from a villa hotel with private pool and the room at the Chedi was very small with tiny bathroom. The hotel has no beach so all sunbeds were in lines around the pool. That was all such a disappointment and so much so that we arranged to cut our stay from 5 nights to 4. However, after night we soon realised the charm of the place. The staff all went out of their way to have a chat with us and particularly to tell us about the East coast and the lifestyle there. The exec chef is new, was trained at the Savoy and is excellent. She was very keen to get feedback. There are lots of little surprises such as afternoon tea, excellent turn down service with hand made biscuits and a great spa with treatments that used products made locally and smelt good enough to eat. There was also a long list of possible trips, most of which were eco type and supported the local community.", "title": "Interesting hotel, but with downsides", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Mauritiusfan2", "date": "June 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7969564, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 staff", "disliked": "\u2014 disappointingly small rooms"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went into Padang Bai during the days for diving, but I think we might have been a bit bored staying by the pool all day - grounds are gorgeous but small so no walking around and no long beach.", "title": "The resort with personality, simpicity and charm", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "TravellerExotica", "date": "June 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7954830, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 staff", "disliked": "\u2014 journey from airport to resort"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This review is written, with references, to my other review on Alila Ubud.", "title": "So-so experience, in comparison to the other Alila at Ubud", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "sedm", "date": "January 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 13136494, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Breakfast (wide selection, small in quantity, but we are small 'eaters')", "disliked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008", "text": "My wife and I took the \"2 faces of Alila\" at Bali for our honeymoon in Jan 2008 - 2 nites at Ubud, 2 at Manggis.
