Never had the breakfast, 1st day was our own fault (up too late). The second morning we had to leave early (8am) the receptionist told us the previous day ,that they would open the Brabazon at 7am. We got up early and walked around (pretty cold windy and raining) to restauraunt. It was closed. We walked back to main hotel, NO ONE there. receptionist finally arrived around 7.40. We told about closed restaurant , she said they would rustle up something for us. It was too late as we had a driver waiting to take us to airport.

There was no background music so we thought it was closed. A girl told us, no, they were open. We asked if they did cocktails and were told no. There was another man working in the bar. We were chatting to him while waiting for our drinks (they didn't have the prosecco we asked for in the bar even though its on the menu). 2 men walked in and the male staff member told them that they were closed so they turned and walked away.

Everything is kept to an immaculate standard. On arrival we were warmly greeted and checked in, unfortunately the reception staff member was a little vague with some check in information which we didnt mind as she was being trained in. We booked one of the cottages & it exceeded our expections. The hot tub was just around the corner from our cottage in a lovely private & sheltered hedged area. We were supplied with robes & extra towels. Dinner in the restaurant was fabulous, service was very good but again one staff member currently being trained in lacked knowledge about the menu which is a pity, however this did not bother us. We enjoyed our dessert in the cellar bar by a roaring fire, infact every fireplace had a roaring fire. Breakfast was gorgeous with fresh fruit, freshly squeezed orange juice & a hot breakfast menu including smoked salmon & pancakes.

The drive up to the house along a tree-lined avenue is gorgeous. The house itself is beautiful, we were greeted by a friendly girl at reception who gave us a full tour of the house. We decided to stay in the main house, which is a little more expensive and stayed in the 'Roisin' Room, the bed was the biggest I've ever seen and tastefully furnished with cream and yellow soft furnishings and various antiques. The bathroom hosts an electric power shower and Molton Brown goodies. We helped ourselves to drinks in the self service bar and had our pick of tastefully decorated rooms to lounge in. Dinner at Brabazon restaurant was booked for 8, we were offered a complimentary glass of prosecco in the main house before hand then ambled along the pretty pathway hoping to bump into one of Tankardstown's canine friends! The service in the restaurant was excellent, as was the sommelier who poured our wine. The decor is French shabby chic and extremely tasteful. The food was delicious although I was disappointed as a poultry lover that there was no chicken or duck on offer. We retired to the gorgeous Cellar Bar for one afterwards where the friendly bar man kindly poured me a Grey Goose vodka( but only charged me for Smirnoff!) as he said the wedding they hosted the day before 'drank all around them! We strolled back to the hotel and took a peek at the gorgeous cottages dotted around a beautiful courtyard. Breakfast the next day was also served in the restaurant and my boyfriend assured me his poached eggs were 'the best he ever tasted' although my scrambled eggs were a little too seasoned with pepper. On our way back from breakfast we had a look at the magnificent Orangery where wedding meals are hosted, it's a truly beautiful room that would work well with numbers from 80-180 I would think, gorgeous patio areas for drinks outside and a pretty bar within the Orangery itself would make it a great choice if you are happy with the venue sleeping only 35 people and suggesting accommodation nearby. There is also a 'Secret Dining' area for meals for 50 or so people which would be nice for a second day.
