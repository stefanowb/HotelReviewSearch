This is exactly what you get at the Banana Lodge Resort. It is a reasonable distance from the airport and town centre to be away from the noise and bustle, but close enough to get an inexpensive taxi ride to restaurants that would do nicely for dinner. Room 217 set above the passage from the swimming pool to the beach is perfectly set for the wonderful view to be framed between palm trees. The large bedroom with two good sized double beds and the adjoining large well equipped kitchen/ dining room make for a very satisfactory living area that is enhanced with the good sized balcony. Beyond the beach lies a small jetty from which small motor boats collect clients for snorkelling on the reef. The reef itself seems greatly over-rated and not on a par with sites that we have visited in the Red Sea, East Africa or the Caribbean. However there may be many other sites along the system that could justify its reputation. A great deal of building work continues along the coastal strip and wildlife areas are disappearing fast. Small tracts of coastal woodland, mangrove and marsh remain but are badly trashed, and strewn with rubble and litter. Still, birds continue to come and can provide some worthwhile bird watching that is different from the mainland.", "title": "Beachside retreat", "user": "lizziesbirds", "date": "March 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153518759}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We enjoyed our stay at the 'Banana' and would return there again.", "title": "Enjoyed our stay", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "1sdman", "date": "February 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153341365}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Things you should know prior to booking include:", "title": "Great place in need of a little attention", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Seafood_Eatsame", "date": "February 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153223884}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "*There are two buildings, they are A & B, we stayed in A331 which was a nice suite.
