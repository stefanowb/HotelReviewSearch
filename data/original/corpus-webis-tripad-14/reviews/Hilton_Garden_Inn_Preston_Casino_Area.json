My wife and I were looking for a Foxwoods getaway for one evening, but did not want to spend the money to stay at the casino. We did very well selecting this hotel. Location is 3 minutes to Foxwoods. Free shuttle runs every hour until 1245am. The hotel is brand new and modern. Beds and furniture are in like-new condition. Rooms are clean and well appointed(fridge, microwave, free WIFI, coffee maker, HDTV). Check-in/out was quick and easy. Very friendly front desk staff, as well as the van drivers and cleaning crew. We missed the shuttle by 1 minute, and they made a special run just for us. During the brief wait for the shuttle, we grabbed a drink at the lounge. Friendly bartender, $4.25 for a decent local brew. The food menu prices appeared to be on the high side, however comparable to the restaurants at the casino. It's difficult to find negatives about this place, I suppose the price for the room may be a little high, but compared to other hotels it was certainly worth it.

I arrived at 8:30 a.m. on a Wednesday after a long drive and I stopped in the hotel lobby to let the desk clerk know I arrived in the area and would be back later to check-in. To my amazement, she told me I could check in right away! I was so happy I could take all the food and drinks I had in a cooler in the car and put them in the room fridge and get myself settled in my room before setting out to enjoy what Foxwoods Resort has to offer. The hotel room is smallish, but adequate and well equipped with fridge, tv, coffeemaker, and hairdryer, and the beds are comfortable. One thing I didn't like about the room is the exit door is blocked when the bathroom door is opened. It seems like the Hilton wanted to squeeze every amount of available space they could into this property with smallish rooms and tightly squeezed areas. The indoor pool is surrounded by hotels rooms right next to it and the restaurant is really part of the hotel lobby with tables and chairs that look like a cocktail should be enjoyed there instead of a nice meal, but the hotel offers room service. I wondered why they didn't put up a wall to separate the restaurant from the lobby. There is coffee or lemon water in the lobby 24 hours a day which is a nice touch. A free shuttle is available from the Hilton to Foxwoods casinos. A good Italian restaurant named Eli's is a short drive down the road or they will deliver food to the hotel.

Already aggravated we decided to just go to bed, when turning down the sheets there on the bed was anywhere between 10-20 head hairs bth on the pillows and in the sheets. I pulled the sheets all the way down and there half way down there were a couple of pubic hairs in the sheets as well. When i called the night manager i was told there was nothing they could do other than offering me free breakfast. It took me fifteen minutes of arguing with the manager for him to send up new sheets, and i had to ask for them numerous times.

As one of the other reviewers said breakfeast here leaves a lot to be desired. I have hilton honors so i didnt pay but i feel bad for those who did. They will pay the first time but i bet you they wont come back. This hould be included in your room based on what you get. 2 servers the female very attentive the male didnt want to be there. Horrible . Why colnt i have gotten the girl not my luck. Some tables are cocktail tables dont belong there for breakfeast.

The dog, it turns out, was directly across the hall from our room. We immediately went to the front desk and inquired about the dog and to make sure the policy was correct on their website. The manager said she made an exception to their no pets allowed rule because the people were \"Diamond Hilton Honors\" members. She had blocked off the rooms around this particular room (410) and asked the people to keep the dog quiet (which they didn't). She blocked off the rooms around them but apparently didn't consider us across the hall.
