There\u2019s that old adage for restaurants that \u201cthe better the view the worse the food\u201d. Similarly, the more hip a hotel tries to be, the more it tends to fail at the services and amenities associated with luxury properties. Not so with the Gansevoort. From doormen rushing to offer an umbrella to hyper-connected concierges, to the requisite ridiculously high thread-count sheets, this hotel actually delivers the hip with out forgetting the service. I\u2019m in New York three or four times a year and have stayed at the hip spots (the W\u2019s, Mercer, Rivington, Hudson) and the traditional luxury properties (Ritz, Four Season, W.A., Mandarin Oriental), but I\u2019ve found my new favorite hotel, the Gansevoort.", "title": "Impressed with the Gansevoort", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "NapaJack", "date": "July 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5504018}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Uber chic - awesome location!", "text": "A true reflection of the city that never sleeps!

Taxi's congregate outside the hotel almost 24/7 so it's never a problem to find one, which is usually the case in alot of nyc places.

As I get older, there's nothing that annoys me more than paying good money for a hotel room and encountering terrible or just non-existent service. But from the moment we checked in at The Gansevoort we were looked after by staff who were polite, efficient and very friendly. The rooms were immaculate, larger than many downtown hotels and showed no signs of the wear and tear that sometimes happens in modern hotels. If nothing else it's worth staying here to experience possibly the most comfortable beds in the world with the softest linens. I slept so well and even though I was on the 8th floor, I never heard any noise from the rootop bar or indeed from the street below. Don't miss the roof especially if you're there in the summer as the pool is great and reserved exclusively for guests staying in the hotel. Amazing to be able to have drinks on a Sunday evening by a pool in the middle of Manhattan watching the sunset. As the other reviews say, the location is fantastic with wonderful shopping, restaurants and clubs on your doorstep - it's great to be able to walk home without having to find a cab. I normally stay in more traditional five star hotels but The Gansevoort is up there with the best of them. I will definitely be staying here when I return to NY and it's the perfect hotel for anyone looking for a fun, chic, informal place to stay but which offers the level of service and attention to detail sadly lacking in many 'hip hotels'.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "katrineCPH", "date": "June 19, 2006", "id": 5361920}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "In heaven at the Hotel Gansevoort", "text": "We spent 4 days there last week and our stay was fantastic.

Most of the guests are young and, besides the noise of the Meat Packing District, remarked upon by other reviewers, you may get some late night hallway noise as people return from the clubs. All that being said, it is a very comfortable hotel with a fantastic breakfast. The ripe berries are provided in a seemingly endless supply; the toasted bagels (need to be ordered but are included) arrive hot. Calls to housekeeping for extra hangers or another show cap were answered promptly and cheerfully. The front desk was helpful and the check-out the quick, easy and accurate -- a place where many hotels fall down. The only fault I could find was that the bed was once made with a duvet cover as the bottom sheet vice a real sheet; this was particularly annoying since the duvet cover was too short to reach the bottom of the bed and still be tucked under the mattress at the top.

Her overall attitude was snobby and condescending. What is it with trendy hotels?? Are they told to be snobby because they think that makes people think the hotel is in demand?
