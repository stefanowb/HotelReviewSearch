We originally stayed when it was the Tivoli Inn and loved it!! Our second trip didn't go as well, but since the Inn had changed hands again, we decided to give it another try. Third time was not the charm. Our original deluxe room was extremely small (and since we had stayed before, we knew what the other rooms looked like). We were not happy about the room we were given, but were willing to live with it. When we were woken up in the middle of the night by a loud, continuous thumping noise, we decided we needed to do something (the rain gutters outside emptied right on top of the heating unit in our room and the rain became amplified and echoed into the room). When we complained about the noise, we were told there was nothing they could do about it and that nobody else had complained about it (insinuating to us that we were either lying or nuts). Since we had booked the entire weekend, they did agree to give us another room, which was a vast improvement and more what we were expecting. My husband and I love to have a 'get-away' weekend in Solvang and we have no complaints about the room we eventually got, but the attitude of the front desk staff but a damper on the weekend.

Honestly - if you pick the wrong direction, you might have to go down and then up again to get down again. No kidding. It sure would help if everything were better marked! I guess the fire thing occurred to me since the building itself looked like it needed some repair and a good paint job. Our room, room 311, had so much light coming in (even at night, since there was a bright bulb outside our room) that I had to move a chair with a towel draped over it to cover up the window that was \"on the floor\" and another towel over the door's window.

Our room (#42) was very lovely. It felt like a mini-townhome with the living area and bathroom on the lower level and the bedroom with king-sized bed in the upstairs loft. It was nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. The location of the hotel is within perfect walking distance to downtown Solvang. The gardens around the hotel are beautiful and the deluxe separate cottages looked absolutely darling. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, no problems whatsoever. If I had to say anything negative, it might be that the breakfast was just OK, some fresh fruit or fruit salad would have been nice. Also, their towels were thin and rough.
