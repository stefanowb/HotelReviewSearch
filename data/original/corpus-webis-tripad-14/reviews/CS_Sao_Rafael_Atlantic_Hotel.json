From the minute you arrive at the imposing lobby with its recessed wall fires, enormous couches and contemporary furnishings you get the feeling that you are in for a touch of luxury. The rooms do not disappoint and are huge with a super kingsize bed, wall mounted full size plasma tv, mini bar and fabulous walk in shower. The contemporary furnishings from the lobby are featured both within the rooms and are repeated throughout all the communal areas of the hotel. This is not a place to go if you hate the colour brown as the entire hotel is decorated in various shades.", "title": "Truly five stars", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "AlecCampbell", "date": "November 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 88371916}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Algarve", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 19, "average": 65, "very good": 156, "terrible": 10, "excellent": 216}, "aka": "CS Sao Rafael Atlantic Hotel Albufeira, Portugal - Algarve", "slim_ranking": 0.139393939394, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.0}}
