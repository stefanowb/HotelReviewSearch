The room was impressive & atmospheric, with lovely furnishings & a gorgeous bathroom - so that's all the positives! Just a few negatives to note - if you read other reviews you will see they mention the hard beds - well, I love a firm bed so this didn't put me off at all, but I have to say it was the hardest bed I've ever slept on & not very comfortable! Secondly, the food in the brasserie was very average indeed - my burger really didn't taste of much & my partner's gnocci consisted of 12 pieces arranged on a plate which looked pretty sorry for themselves - and at a \u00a31 a piece it was a little disappointing. Also, the service was not very attentive - we had to ask for menus for each course & for drinks - we weren't in a hurry though so not too much of a problem. My final negative is quite a big one - and also mentioned in a lot of these reviews - the heating in the rooms was on far too high, and we were unable to adjust it or switch it off (there is a decoy thermostat which does nothing!!) & you can't open the windows. It was stifling - even though it was January it reminded me of trying to sleep on holiday in Greece.

That said, the room was amazing. Huge bed, roll top bath and huge bathroom and lots of extras. We didn't opt for breakfast as we thought it a bit pricey at \u00a314. There are loads of caves and restaurants nearby. The dining room did look nice though. We did try a drink in the visitors room bar which was lovey and service was good. The only negative would be the check in/ out. It was rather slow and inefficient. We even traipsed too our room through the meandering corridors only to find the room key hasn't been programmed!! Other than this minor niggle I would return tomorrow. There is parking at the hotel for a substantial \u00a325 but anyone who frequents will know that this is the going rate for city parking. We used one of the park and ride services which was really good.", "title": "Cell room 101 something romantic about the room", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "apnrboys", "date": "December 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 147730324}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Spent a Sunday night in one of the cells, fabulous hotel, friendly staff, great for a romantic getaway.
