There are explanation in English through the room and hotel.....very helpful with the A/C - heater unit and the TV remote. The shower in the bathroom rotates between hot and cold water when you're taking a shower....very annoying. The room was small but clean and the bed was big enough for a 6'2\" guy.", "title": "Small but good", "user": "fraser82", "date": "February 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 125053588}], "location": {"country": "Japan", "region": "Kinki", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 6, "very good": 21, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 15}, "slim_ranking": 0.0909090909091}
