Pool area was great as was the Beach lots of water equipment, though I went mostly for the quiet and a chance to catch up on my reading. Computer room was no problem at all other than a couple of discourteous guests making a lot of noise. the service at the pool bar was perfect!! friendly staff and very accommodating. Service at the main restaurant was rather lack luster was really just sort of OK. The Lagoon restaurant was a definite 10+ Personally I think I would have been just as happy with a more authentic Polynesian feeling, but if your looking to be pampered. this is the place. I had read about the trash burning issue though this has been solved as the dump area was sold and is being developed by the Four Seasons.

The food was excellent, the breakfast at Te-Pahu was good as well as the lunches, the service was also very friendly. Lagoon was excellent and was by far our favorite dinner spot, sushi take hadn't opened yet when we were there (May 07). The spa was great, we had a couples massage and thoroughly enjoyed it. We did the jet ski tour and it was one of the best things we did as it is a great way to see the entire island and experience some of the beauty of Bora Bora. We were not that impressed with Bora Bora itself when we took the ferry there and if I had it to do over again we'd skip it entirely. The food at Lagoon was so good we didn't even want to go anyplace else for dinner.

Some quick examples, the complimentary champagne bottle waiting for us in the OWB was an older much better quality bottle than the bottle that had greeted us in Tahaa. The OWB was significantly larger, and more cleverly designed than at Tahaa. The spa was located in a much more asthetically pleasing location (near a man made lagoon stocked with really interesting marine life as opposed to overlooking an odd green pond at Tahaa). The internet was broadband on 3 computers in a lounge as opposed to dial up on one computer at Tahaa. Although we really spent very little time on the computers, this was an important little detail for me because I just want to have the ability to check the red sox scores and get back to the vacation. At Tahaa the one computer is either usually occupied or takes a while to navigate on the web when you finally do get on. Another difference, for breakfast, Tahaa claims to have a \"newspaper\" ready for guests. What that really is, is a one page print out of a summary from the International Herlad Tribune. That would not be so bad if it were readily available. However, it was not available on more that 50% of the days we were at Tahaa. At St. Regis, they actually print the entire newspaper of the USA Today, and several other papers, and have them sitting out literally every day for breakfast. However, the most important different for us was the food! We ate at the Jean Georges restaurant the first night and absolutely loved it. The Kobe Beef dish is spectacular. The restaurant by the beach is also fantastic.", "title": "Mixed feelings on the St. Regis", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "trvljess", "date": "November 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 10902667, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The bungalow", "disliked": "\u2014 The distance from the main area to the bungalow"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The property is very nicely laid out, and lovely. However, the thing that really distinguishes the St. Regis is their staff. Milton Sgarbi, the GM, has done a wonderful job of assembling a top notch group of people that are dedicated to making the experience a memorable one. What touched my wife and I was the incredible responsiveness if anything actually did go wrong. A quick example, we had arranged for a romantic candlelit dinner by the ocean on our last night. When we arrived at the restaurant, the reservation had somehow been misplaced, and there was another couple actually having a candlelit dinner in what I would assume is the usual location for this type of meal. The manager of the restaurant responded in an incredible manner, we were first invited to come sit by the bar where we were informed drinks were on them until a table could be prepared. The bartender then asked us what kind of drinks we liked, when we asked to see the menu, he actually told us no need for the menu if we wanted he would just mix up any type of interesting cocktail we liked. My wife and I are both fans of pomegranate juice, he created two really tasty and interesting cocktails for us based on pomegranate, vodka, and some other exotic juices. It was great! Meanwhile, we noticed over our shoulder that the manager had arranged for a new table to be brought out and set up by the water for us. It was also private like the original table would have been, and in just as nice a setting. The meal that followed was wonderful. We were really touched by the various servers that helped us that evening. There congratulations for our nuptials did not feel contrived at all, and they were very willing and eager to talk about where they were from in France or French Polynesia and ask us about New York. The bartender made several trips from behind the bar to our table to check on us as well as did the manager. The staff really made us feel like our enjoyment on our last night was really important to them, and it literally felt as though we had the full staff of the restaurant all dedicated to making this experience as wonderful as possible for us. It was definitely the most enjoyable and unique meal we have ever had at any restaurant and we still smile about it months later.", "title": "6 star prices not 6 star service", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "gemmifer", "date": "October 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10437861, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The room was our favorite", "disliked": "\u2014 The service for the prices"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Some other quick notes about the St. Regis and Bora Bora.", "title": "Arguably One of the Most Beautiful Places on the Planet", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "Shiba-Inu-Parents", "date": "October 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10088601, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The World Class Over-Water Villa and the People who made our stay Magnificent", "disliked": "\u2014 Having to Leave (Only the Shiba Inu at Home was Happy)"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "excellent!", "text": "Don't miss the shark and ray feeding tour.
