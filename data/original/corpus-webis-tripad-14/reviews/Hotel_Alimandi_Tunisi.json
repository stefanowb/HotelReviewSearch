The rooms are modern and very well appointed with every luxury imaginable, including marble everything, flat screen tv, 2 double beds, very good air conditioning. The only thing I could complain about was they seem to be a bit short staffed (although my stay was during an Italian holiday so that may explain the shortage). The breakfast buffet was just ok in my opinion. I really appreciated the free airport shuttle. This is a very generous thing to offer to guests, easily saving us about 80 euro. As noted, the location is perfect. The staff was very helpful.

Last year, it was 4 nights. Truth be told, as far as I'm concerned, there is no reason to stay at any other hotel in Rome. It will always be our home away from home in Rome. The Alimandi is a family-run hotel with the emphasis on family. The Alimandis are a welcoming, friendly, and happy group of people. The Alimandis have two hotel buildings and our stay was at the original building at #8 via Tunisi. The other Alimandi is at #1, at the top of steps that lead to the Vatican Wall.

It's served each morning from 7 until 10 in the rooftop garden (both open-air and covered seating). The breakfast is outstanding. Chef Francesco (yes, an Alimandi) serves up a variety of foods including chicken and potatoes, zucchini and mushrooms, and many other hearty dishes. He's constantly making fresh scrambled eggs. There are cereals, pastries, and sliced meats (salami, mortadella, and prosciutto, etc.). There is juice or milk or tea. There is world class coffee - even American-style. There is fruit (prunes, pears, peaches, pineapple). On a diet? There is yogurt. You can make your own toast. There are even power bars and other treats. And of course, there are wonderful pies baked by Chef Francesco himself. He is a hard-working man. Not only does he prepare the food - the rooftop garden seats around 75 or so people - but Francesco greets you and wants to make sure you enjoy your food. Another bonus, a great view of the Vatican and the tip of St. Peter's dome. After hours, you can visit the rooftop for quiet moments - perhaps some late-evening wine or a cigarette for those who smoke.
