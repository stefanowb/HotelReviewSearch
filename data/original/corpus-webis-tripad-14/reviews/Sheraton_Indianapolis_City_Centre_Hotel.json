This was a great hotel by comparison. Not luxury but very nice. We were traveling for a cheerleader competition so the close proximity to the convention center is our reasoning for choosing this property however it was a little further than I thought (about 6 blocks-they told us 2). The rooms were clean and crisp with modern furniture. Bathrooms were updated and worked great. The air conditioning was not the greatest but was good enough. The view was amazing and we didn't even have the monument view which would have been even better. We had connecting rooms (a king corner room and a room with 2 double beds) which were requested and delivered as promised. One of the rooms was not ready upon check in (even though it was late) but that wasn't a big deal. I thought the service was great. People were friendly and very helpful. There always seemed to be several staff members around to help with directions, information or anything else you might need. Parking was great and convenient though a little expensive. The hallways were a little dated. The wallpaper was peeling a little but since I didn't sleep there I didn't care. The 9th floor pool was a little dissapointing. However this is one of the few downtown hotels that has an outdoor pool. Like many other reviews I agree it was little more than a pool amoung a vast concrete roof with a few lounge chairs. The view from there was amazing though. It overlooked the monument. There is a lot of potential there and I think they could make the pool area great. The location of the hotel was perfect.

I opted to start with Starwood. This was my first stay at a non-HIlton hotel in Indianapolis where I visit regularly for business. Usually I stay at the Downtown HGI. The rooms at this Sheraton are a little dated but clean. I loved that they provided Starbucks coffee in the room and my own personal loofah. The bed comfort was a little better than the HGI but the HGI's room was more updated. The hallways needed some updating too. One part of the Sheraton's hallway had plywood on it. I'm not sure why. The workout room at the Sheraton offers much more than the HGI. I also loved the Sherton's in room dining options. My breakfast was delicious and timely. I did not like that anyone can access the elevators to the hotel rooms from the parking garage except from 10pm-6am.

During our stay the heavy use had damaged a few of the elevators, and while this was understandable it only got worse. On the floor we were staying at the down elevator button did not respond, leaving us only able to hit up and wait for an open elevator and then ride it up until we could begin to descend to the main floor. This was a inconvenience for everyone, ourselves and the people who were on the floors above us actually trying to get to a higher floor since we occupied space on an elevator and wanted to go the opposite direction. We decided to just take the stairwell to save ourselves time and embarassment. When we arrived at the stairwell there was a sign that simply stated to leave the door closed at all times, and assuming that it simply meant not to leave the door open behind us we entered the stairwell. By the time we got to the third floor the stairwell did not have working lights, and as we made our way to the 2nd we realized the doors did not open from the inside. We walked down the dark stairwell to the bottom floor and ran into a door with a fire alarm. We went all the way back up to the 8th floor checking every door only to find outselves locked in. We looked for a phone to call the front desk but the only one we found was knocked off the wall and laying in peices on the floor. We finally descended again and left out the fire alarm door, which did not sound. When we talked to people at the desk we got a simple and dry 'you aren't supposed to use the stairs, if you do you have to walk to the bottom floor and use that door' when we asked why there was nothing telling us this they didn't have a response. Apperently this problem persisted for many others because later in the day they unlocked all the floors so you could use the stairs, and they made it a point to inform everyone of this. After using the stairs without issues for the next 6 hours we suddenly found ourselves locked out of the 8th floor yet again, and had to walk all the way back to the first floor once more. When we asked yet again why we were locked out we were told someone must have locked the doors and that while it was a mistake it wasn't likely anyone would unlock the doors again. This sort of thing can ruin any trip, and the absolute lack of concern on the staff's part really left a sour taste in our mouths. While I've heard they're working to replace the broken elevators I haven't heard anything apologizing for the complete lack of concern with the problem.
