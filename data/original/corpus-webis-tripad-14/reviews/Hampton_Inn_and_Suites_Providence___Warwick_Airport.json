As a veteran of many hockey tournament hotels, this stay was by far the best experience my family ever had. I was most please with Jay Visnjic, the Hotel Manager. He continually made himself available and went out of his way to help us out. Numerous times he walked around, with a pleasant smile and greeted us and wished us a good day. He arranged a spare meeting room for our kids to play in, he allowed us to use his lobby area to have team parties and arranged shuttle rides for a few families.

We were part of a group of several other adults and children. Our group was in RI for a hockey tournament for the kids. We can't say enough about how well this hotel is run by the General Manager Jay Visnjic. He ensured that our entire group had everything that we needed and Jay and his entire staff are extremely friendly and they all do an excellent job. The hotel rooms were spotless and the common areas of the hotel were just as clean. Jay and staff went above and beyond for us by making breakfast to go bags for our three hockey teams that had games at 7am and also made enough bags to go for all the family members of the teams. Also, if anyone has been at a hotel when hockey teams are staying there for a hockey tournament, they know that it's all about the knee hockey games! Jay played it very smart and allowed our teams full access to a very large conference room and the kids played knee hockey in that room from 9am to 9pm every day. Also,the General Manager Jay Visnjic definitely cares about his guests and goes above and beyond. We actually think that he must work 24 hours per day because we never saw him gone from the hotel!

We have stayed in many wonderful hotels, but this Hampton Inn rates with the best. The lobby features a mini-bar and comfortable places to sit and relax.

We recieved a warm welcome from the shuttle driver George, who was more than happy to pick us up at the airport, and was waiting for us as soon as we exited the airport! Upon arival it looked to be an airline crew checking in, and we would be waiting a while to check in. However, Monica came out to imediatly assisted us, and got us booked into a spacious suite, and had a great recomindation of a sushi place near by, which we later tried and enjoyed that evening! Befor heading out, we were surprised to stumble across at a bar at the Hampton Inn. The selection was not that large, However Matt the bartender was able to make some great drinks with what he had and put a new spin on a Margarita with Midori, that I really enjoyed! We later enjoyed breakfast the next morning, again the staff was very helpfull, and its always nice to recieve a free full breakfast, compared to other hotels which may charge $20. They also had a great pool and xtra large hot tub which was also relaxing. We woke up feeling very refreshed, the next day, and enjoyed our ride back to boston, a great way to wind the down from a vacation.

I researched several hotels and it was the pool area that made my decision. I was pleasantly surprised at how new everything looked, and the cleanliness, as others have previously written.The beds were very comfortable, the pillows were ok...I'm a pillow person and needed 3. The linens were nice, all bright white, no stains. Bathrooms were pretty simple, no granite or anything but they were clean. The free parking, free wi/fi and free hot breakfast was a complete bonus! The breakfast space was kept very clean with a young girl who seemed very nice. My kids had the make your own waffes, big hit. They also have a little bar open at night in the area where b'fast is served. It has a little flat screen TV. I could see hubby and myself stopping in for a cocktail if we didn't have the kids with us. Our room had some views of planes taking off and my kids thought that was really \"cool.\" And considering we were so close to the airport, you could hear the planes taking off in our direction, but it was muted, and with the sound of the TV, no-one really noticed it. The TV's were great, HUGE, flat screens and my 10 yr old thought it offered a good variety of kids channels. My 5 yr old son was excited when he saw he could play Mario video games, but they cost money, so we didn't do it. That was fine, they kept busy using the pool (which we had all to ourselves both times we used it.) The pool was a great size and the hot tub was very big for a hot tub. It looks onto the parking lot, which is a little awkward knowing people can watch you (but really, the lot wasn't full of cars going in and out so it wasn't that bad), but with floor to ceiling windows, it allows for a lot of natural light. And the surround sound music was a really nice touch. We did notice some floating chunks of dark hair/lint in the pool the second day which was kind of gross. Hopefully it was on a due-to-be-cleaned schedule, but the hot tub was very clean and very relaxing! It's in a great location for people flying in for business, etc. as there's several options for restaurants in many different price categories. We had dinner at Bertucci's that night, very family friendly and good food. And lunch the next day at Iron Works, a bit upscale for kids, but great lunch prices (house glass of merlot was $3.25). Both places within 3 minutes.We will definitely stay here again if we need to be in Warwick again!!", "title": "Convenient, clean, updated!", "user": "Sumrtyme", "date": "February 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 124692718}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Providence offers a lot of hotels for business travelers.

It is a beautiful hotel, with great employees. When we arrived, our suite was ready so we were able to check in right away. It was a one king bedroom suite with a pull-out sofa. In the room, there is a small kitchen with a microwave, stove and even a dish washer and full size fridge. It also has a small dinning room table to sit and eat your meals on. The room was very spacious, with 2 huge flat screen tv's and a king bed that was a pleasure to sleep on. The bathroom was very awkward. The lights were located outside of the bathroom and on the opposite wall. So, if you are staying with people, it was very easy for them to play a joke and turn off the lights while you are showering or using the bathroom. The sink is located outside of the bathroom, next to the bedroom. This place is about 15 minutes from downtown, not a bad car ride. There is no shuttle to take you downtown, you are better off parking in a local lot. The taxi services will cost you at least $20.00 one way. The hotel also has a ginormous pool and hot tub in the hotel. Also, they offer a continental breakfast in the morning. This consisted of pastries, cereals and other quick things like eggs, waffles juices etc. We were concerned about hearing the airplanes at night, we didn't hear anything.
