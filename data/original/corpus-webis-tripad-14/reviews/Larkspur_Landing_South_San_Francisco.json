In more than 30 trips to San Francisco this is the best lodging experience I have had. The hotel is well appointed, well maintained and well managed. The list of amenities is extensive and the staff are all pleasant and helpful. Our one bedroom suite had plenty of room, a complete kitchen, two televisions, DVD player, video game, and every little convenience imaginable. The location is pleasant, in the middle of the bio-tech gulch just north of SFO. Access from the Hwy. 101 freeway is easy yet there is no traffic noise. There is plenty of free parking. This will be our headquarters in the Bay Area from now on.", "title": "By the Bay, Best deal around", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "EB3", "date": "October 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5910488, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Quality of accomodations for the price", "disliked": "\u2014 Could have been closer to the center of the city"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We booked our hotel online and read the reviews that were submitted. From that it looked like a good pick. As we were familiar with San Fran we knew that staying outside of the downtown was much cheaper. Well upon arriving we were thrilled with the accomodations. The hotel room/suite has a full kitchenette (no oven just stove top), full size fridge, microwave, dishes even a mini dishwasher. The beds were so comfortable, LARGE Queen size bed with feather/down guilts and pillows. We were near the airport and Highway #101 but noise level was minimal. The breakfast included was more than ample and could be taken to your room with no problem. The Starbucks coffee in your room and coffee, cookies and fruit served all day in the Hotel lobby was very convenient and enjoyable. Having a complimentary laundry and free access to internet was also a plus. What can we say....we were there to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and felt quite at home. We will book there again when we are in the area! HIghly recommend this hotel for location, price and clean, comfortable accomodations.", "title": "Awesome Place - Better Than Expected", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "fishingrules", "date": "September 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5818060, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness and comfort", "disliked": "\u2014 Stay outside of the city, it is cheaper.
