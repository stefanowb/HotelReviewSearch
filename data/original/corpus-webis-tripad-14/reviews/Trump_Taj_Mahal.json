I was very disappointed, again this was my first and hope the last bad expierence, I felt you needed to know. Horrible, Horrible, terrible, terrible.

The whole place is over the top tacky and garish. Check in was the fastest we have had in AC.

We did have a nice ocean view from the room and the bathroom was pretty clean and was all marble. There were lots of stains on the carpet and the sheets were paper thin, scratchy and stained.

The clientele was mostly middle class to blue collar, most wearing sloppy shorts and tee shirts. The Bombay cafe breakfast buffet was truly inedible from the eggs to the waffle sticks to the pastries.YUK! We had 2 comps for the Sultan's dinner buffet but there were literally hundreds of people in line so we ate at the Stage Deli instead which was empty but excellent. I would never pay to stay here. It is no comparison to the Borgata which is first class all the way. This was just way too tacky for us and nothing special although most people will probably be amazed at all the marble, gold and glitz. The dealers were not friendly at all. Most of them did not even make any conversation.

I recently visited the Taj Mahal, along with my boyfriend, for the very first time right after New Year's. We have been patrons of Harrah's and Showboat for years. I have to say that I was very impressed by the cleanliness of the room and the friendliness of the person who checked us in. I don't remember her name but I think she was one of the managers and Halina, who gave us our key and checked us out the next morning, was exceptional kind and professional. I can see where you have bad experiences on occassion. On one of our visits to one of the aforementioned hotels, we had to call someone to come reclean our rooms because the floor was not clean. So the point I'm trying to make is that problems occur everywhere. I'm sure all of these hotels strive to provide the best service possible to everyone. As for attitudes of workers, these individuals have to deal with hundreds of people wanting them to move mountains to accomodate their needs. I'm sure they do their very best to assist but customers can be RUDE too! If I had to assist these individuals, I would have to bite my tongue. Therefore, possibly appearing to be rude. We personally experienced an episode in the Sultan Feast where a waiter was severally harrassed by a patron. Despite the verbal abuse from the patron, he was very respectful to the customer. Everyone around saw what was going on. I actually commended the waiter for how he handled the situation.

Around 6:30 p.m. I visit the Bombay Restaurant to have dinner, I order Chicken Cutlet Parmigan with pasta, no sauce because I do not eat Sauce, I finished dinner around 7:30 and I hen went back to the casino to play for a few hours, after 2 hours I started to feel nauscious, i then decided to drive back home by 9:30p.m., I arrived my home around 11:45p.m. still feeling very light headed and dizzy, around 12:30 p.m. I tried going to bed to get some sleep but it was impossible, by 1:45 I started throwing up and this continued till 3:30p.m. until I was rushed to the Emergency room of the Saint John's Queens Hospital on Queens Blvd, New york where I was diagnoised that I had FOOD POISONING, I spent all night and next day in the Hospital and discharged late Sunday, to date I am still suffering from my stomach, but the worse experience was when I returned to the TajMahal casino the following Wednesday, October 13, 2004 I went back to eat at the Bombay Restaurant around 2:00p.m.and I bumped into a Full Food inspection conducted by inspectors and this was actuall confirmed by the waiter serving at the time.
