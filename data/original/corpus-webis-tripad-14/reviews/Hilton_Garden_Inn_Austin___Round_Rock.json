In the past, we have stayed here and were very satisfied, however, this stay was very different. There were sugar ants all over the night stands, around the coffee maker and coming out of the walls in the bathroom. There were also fleas that would jump on you around the sofa area. When I brought it to the attention of the staff, they seemed bothered, did not offer any regret, and just said that they have a monthly exterminator that comes each month. (which was obviously not working very well) The first night , the AC was great but when we got back from a game one day, the room would not cool down. Of course, they didn't have any rooms to move us to. The wallpaper on the walls were peeling off the walls, breakfast was way over-priced ($8.95/person) , and the housekeeping employees did not speak English. If you needed something (extra towels, toilet paper, or toiletries) then you needed someone that was bilingual to be able to communicate. Also, they put a lone man (that went to bed by 8 pm) on a floor with, and right in the middle of several baseball teams that were staying at the hotel. The planning of this was not wise because many of the teams came and went at various times and this man expected total silence......ain't gonna happen with high school baseball players after a game.

As with all Garden Inns, you pay for the breakfast unless you are a Gold HHonors or higher. The location is not ideal for the vacationer. I would stay in downtown Austin for that. But if you have business on the north side of Austin, I would certainly recommend this hotel. Free high speed internet access (wired) in the room. Wireless in the lobby.
