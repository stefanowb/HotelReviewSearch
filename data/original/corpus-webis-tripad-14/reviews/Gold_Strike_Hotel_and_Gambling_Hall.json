We split down the road to Whiskey Petes, the Primm, and Buffalo Bills where we heard music, had lots of drinks and road the Monarail to each of those locations.

We had been there before and had a room comp coming to us, which we took advantage of this time out. This was the first time we had ever stayed overnight. After checking in we went to the room. It was passable. Clean but run down. The floor had waves in it and creaked. We then went into the casino. Since the last time we were there, many machines had been replaced. First problem. No tickets. When you want to take your money out of a slot machine you have to wait, sometimes 30 minutes or more for and \"attendant\" to hand pay you. Whether it is $1.00 or $100 you have to wait to get your money. In this day and age that is unacceptable. The machines have to be the tightest in all of Nevada. I played a minimum of 15 machines and my husband almost as many. You can not hit there. Ridiculous! Then we were hungry, so we went to the buffet. What an abomination. The food was horrible. Everything had a funny taste. Needless to say we left most of the meal on the plate. That evening back in our room when we were trying to sleep, there seemed to be furniture movers directly above us. All night long banging and footsteps could be heard in our room. We felt like we were the stars of some horrible Twilight Zone episode. Whatever you do, avoid the Gold Strike.

I am in the market to stay for the least amount of money as possible and don't care about luxury (so not expecting much). The good thing about this hotel is that you'll only get and be offended for a short time cause then you'll just have to laugh at how bad this hotel is. The restaurants are very expensive for this hotel. We were in the cafe and were ignored for 20mins after we were seated. It was no excuse cause there were only about 4 tables that had customers seated. There were 3 employees talking to each other and ignoring the customers. Then to my surprise the chef and kitchen help comes out and joins them for like 10mins. We finally get our order and ask for hot sauce and the waitress said \"well, I have to go all the way to the kitchen for that so is there anything else why I'm in there\". This was were I started laughing and started looking for the hidden camera cause the damn kitchen was less than 15-20 feet from where we were sitting. The food quality is very bad and felt it was better to drive back 11 miles to Primm Nevada to eat. Where the food was great and affordable. Anyways, lets talk more about the Gold Strike. We nicknamed this place \" ----- \" and we laugh when we talk about it. The machines are very tight and the employees outside of the cafe are just as if not more rude than the ones inside. Oh yeah and the buffet they have set up not only has cream of the crap for food like chili spaghetti \" ill let you be the judge on that one\" but all the booths have \"employees only\" signs on them and will not wait on you if you sit there anyway. I would give this hotel an award for being the worst place I've ever stayed and will probably sleep in my car before staying here again. If you read this and stay there knowing this you deserve the royal treatment that you'll receive at Gold Strike. ha ha I hope this helps if your looking for a place to stay.
