The kids were suprised to find a 12\" chocolate Statue of Liberty in the room, too. The kids liked the bathroom (separate shower) and all the extra toiletries provided. They also liked the fact that they could work out alongside Dad in the fitness center. Breakfast was too expensive at the hotel so they never ate there. My husband said the customer service was outstanding when they checked in, but not so great when it came time to check-out.", "title": "Kids Loved This Hotel", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "frozenfamilyof5", "date": "July 10, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3655035}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Choice for Weekend Stay", "text": "We stayed here in June for our anniversary. I mentioned this to a front desk staff person when I called 3 days before arrival to request early check-in. When we got there everyone seemed to know who we were and wish us a happy anniversary. As we got into the cab to leave, the bellhop asked if we had a good time on our anniversary. The room was great, the bed was wonderful, bathroom roomy, great view, etc. The location is secluded, with a park directly across the street, where you can also walk the Esplanade along the Hudson. Wall St., 4 different subway lines, ferries are all within 5 min walk. Don't think you have to stay in mid-town. Stay here, save $ over other 5 star hotels, catch the subway to wherever, and enjoy your NYC stay.
