CLEAN--Top Notch Place, immaculate & incredibly clean (which is very important to me). They have a very large maintenance staff constantly working all day beautifying the property. Beautiful gardens surrounding the property & pools. Gorgeous canopy beds, lounges, rattan furniture around pools and sitting areas (which are plentiful). Clean beach with many tiki huts. Very large property which requires the use of their free golf cart shuttle service.

We enjoyed our stay, I required to for building 1-7, but they only had building 10 available not too bad. This was right next to the lobby. We walked a few times to the pool, not a bad walk, good exercise for my family. We did have a ant issues, after house cleaning came out to spray and clean, we had no issues anymore. We had a fun time, everyone was very nice. The only 2 issue is the price. The Resort is so expensive! The beds are hard as a rock!!!!", "user": "Aatiyah R", "date": "July 12, 2013", "id": 167312000}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nicest people we have met on our travels", "text": "I will be blunt, ANYONE that claims that these people are not attentive should not be taken seriously when reading there reviews.

When we arrived a Bell Boy took our luggage from the van and told us he would take it to the room as soon as it was assigned. As we entered the lobby we were greeted and taken to the check in desk. We were then assigned a 2 bedroom suite in building 1, the closest to the pool. They told us and gave us info about the resort, its restaurants, shops, pools, activities and services. A shuttle then took us to the room where the bell boy was waiting with our luggage to show us around the room. It was a huge room, that was very clean with 2 bedrooms, a mini-kitchen which we hardly used except for the coffee maker (bring coffee and filters), microwave (for heating leftovers since the meals at the restaurants were more than we could eat) and frig (plenty of room for drinks, left overs and bottled water, we bought 2 huge 6 Liter bottles from the deli for less than $5 each which took us through the week, no need to drag some back from Walmart). Some reviewers talked about the hard beds and pillows. Ours were just as comfortable as the ones we have at home and we slept great. Each bedroom had a nice flat screen TV and there was a bigger one in the living room. The furnishings were very nice and comfortable. For other rooms that are further from the pool there is a shuttle that will pick you up every 15 minutes to right where you pick up towels by the pool.", "user": "skadia87", "date": "August 7, 2013", "id": 171150043}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Beautiful resort, bad beach", "text": "Restaurants - We thought the food was excellent and actually cheaper that we pay in the Delaware, Philly, Baltimore, DC area. We always had leftovers too. We ate at every restaurant, some more than once. Havana Moon by the beach was really good with international cuisine. Ate there twice, once outside and also inside. Its an open air restaurant so no ac, but it was really comfortable. On Friday night they had a dance show called Roots that was enjoyable. Tramonto was Italian and so good. Service was excellent. It's indoors on the second floor so its air conditioned with a great view towards the pool. Had entertainment from a really good singer and piano player. Gong was at the other end of the building from Tramonto with a bar between, I missed it, but on 3 different nights at the bar they have Margarita making, Tequila tasting and Wine tasting, about $14-19 for each. Gong had an incredible menu from sushi to any other type of Asian food including Peking Duck. The Balch\u00e9 Pool Bar becomes Frida's Grill for dinner time. We enjoyed eating right by the pool for late lunches and for dinner. They had Cuban drums, salsa dancing and romantic Mexican duets every evening. Del Lago a huge open air place by the lake that serves a breakfast buffet every day. I did it once. Way too much to eat unless you want to gain 10 lbs on vacation. On Thursday night they have a wonderful Mexican Buffett and a 2+ hour Mexican show. After the first breakfast there I went to the Green Break restaurant close to the golf course and a 5 minute walk from the lobby where they have al carte breakfast and lunches. I had eggs and ham, one morning, French toast one morning and pancakes on another. They also had great looking omelets.
