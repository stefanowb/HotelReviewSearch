I was very pleasantly surprised. Our room was small and spartan but clean and comfortable. The bathroom was modern and clean. The food in the restaurant was excellent and the breakfast options were more than satisfactory. And the location was just perfect!

The reception area is nondescript. The elevator is tiny and slow, so be prepared to lug your suitcase up the steps. We were on the top floor and unfortunately the neon windmill sign for the hotel was right outside. The blinds are fairly good at blocking out the blinking neon light but you would be much better off to get a room on the riverfront side of the hotel. We had dinner one night at the hotel and the food and service were excellent. The dining area is along the river which makes for a very pleasant breakfast when the sun is out. One potential issue is getting back in the hotel after a late evening in Cahors. The front entrance is locked after 11pm and we would have been unable to get in had we not had some friends who happened to be in the lobby when we arrived. Also, there was never anyone at the front desk so when you returned to the hotel after walking around Cahors, you had to retrieve your own room key from the reception area. It did make me wonder about the security of our room but we didn't have any problems.", "title": "The inside of hotel a nice surprise", "user": "2pollyanna", "date": "September 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 118505095}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The most pleasant part of the hotel was the patio along the riverfront.

I was offered more secure parking (as I drive a Porsche) but was not concerned to leave the car outside. The room was fairly basic but clean. My two gripes were: (i) the sound insulation up and down the building was poor - I could hear the toilet flushing (and more!) in the room above mine and (ii) the bathroom layout was such that I had to squeeze past the loo to get in and out of the shower.
