We arrive early sunday evening just in time to check in and to enjoy a bottle of wine in the last of the sun on the rear terrace. On arriving we were given a very warm, personal welcome by the owner who personally showed us to our room. We booked quite last minute so the onl room available of the 8 in the building was the smallest, number 4, but this was perfectly adequate for our one night stay. The Bathroom is huge for the size of the room with a brilliant shower. The owner showed us how to use the TV and radio in the room before expaling about benefits such as the DVD library and the moving showing in the sitting room that evening. We dropped our bags, only criticism of the room is no where really to hang anything if you need to for a longer stay. We wondered down to the bar and got our drinks and sat enjoying the sun. The hotel is quite remote but was perfect for us to relax after a busy weekend. We had a wonder to look at the gorgeous church next door and back to our room to shower and change for dinner. The whole hotel and room was spotlessly clean and small touches like the hand made toiletries were appreciated. These are made by the owners wife and can be purchased as well as for use in the hotel. We went down to the restaurant and selected from the amazing menu. Being a sunday evening there were only another few couples dining which was nice. We both ordered steak which was served perefectly. Again nothing we could fault about the meal. We then selected a few dvds from the hotel library which are free of charge to take back to the room with a bottle of wine to enjoy the end of the evening. The bed was so comfortable and a peaceful nights sleep. We enjoyed a monday morning lie in. Breakfast is meant to finish at 10 but the owner did say it was a strict 10am rule and we could order after. We chose to eat in the cosy sitting room compared to the restaurant where we ate the night before. This room is where they were showing the movie the night before and is cosy and homely with an open fire. the breakfast menu was good which is extra while continental is included in the room price. We ordered scrambled egg and eggs benedict which were served by the lovely chef. Again faultless food and we also helped ourselves to the continental breakfast. Over all, everyone from the cehf, overn, waitress and barman were so friendly and welcoming and we are definately planning to return. The cosy decor would make an ideal retreat during the winter.

The only tiny glitches were; on the Friday night we were kept awake by a party until 1.30am in the bar (though that is a peril of staying above a pub) \u2013 in our bathroom you could hear every word spoken in the bar, and even with the bathroom door closed we found it a little bit noisy - it was a hot night, though, so we had to have the window open; and secondly, our room was only half-cleaned when we got back from a day out \u2013 once we asked it was immediately sorted out and apologies were profuse so it was clearly a one-off lapse (they were very busy). But that aside it was all lovely \u2013 great setting, delicious food, friendly staff and very comfy and stylishly decorated rooms. If you are there for several days and want dinner elsewhere for a change, the Riverbarn is a lovely 20-minute walk through the pretty Fonthill Estate and serves delicious AA-rated food in a very homely environment, like eating in someone\u2019s front room!
