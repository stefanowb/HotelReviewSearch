The room was spacious enough; there were 2 Queen size beds, a T.V, Fridge, Microwave a hob (I think) and a coffee machine. The bathroom was a decent enough size and had a bath c/w shower; everything was very clean as well. Our room had been described as having a mountain view; it failed to mention it was actually a view of Highway 140 c/w noise of traffic all night. I\u2019ve attached a photo so you can see what I mean. We were annoyed enough that we had been booked into the wrong hotel, but if we had of intentionally booked this hotel with the hope of a mountain view we would have been deeply disappointed. Our room basically backed onto the highway and it just felt like we were staying in a crappy motel somewhere. The other annoying thing about this place was that there wasn\u2019t even a lift to help get our luggage up the stairs; some of our bags weighed over 25kg so this was really frustrating! We didn\u2019t eat in any of the restaurants so I can\u2019t comment on the food; we did however order a pizza to take back to our room and this was surprisingly nice.

Our family of two adults and two teenagers visited in July '07. It is located just outside the western entrance of the park. We had a river view room with the river right next to our porch. The room was much nicer than we expected. It was clean and nicely decorated. There was a fireplace, jacuzzi, and refrigerator. There was a nice size laundromat and we never had a problem getting a machine. We stayed 3 nights. I had to book two nights through AAA and one through the motel's web site but I emailed the hotel a week or so in advance and we didn't have to change rooms. (We had booked the same type of room so I'm sure that helped). It was only about a 10 or 15 minute beautiful drive to the Valley floor. We got take out from the motel's restaurants two nights because we were too tired to mess with going out. The food was fine - nothing special but so easy and convenient. We had pizza one night and pasta the other. The night in between we ate at the Awhanee. It was good but you definitely go for the experience because it's pricey. I would recommend going to the Awhanee before it gets dark so you can walk out back and enjoy the view.", "title": "So Much Nicer Than We Expected", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "CarTripQueen", "date": "January 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12763069, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The view out our backdoor, away from the Valley crowds, and convenient to Yosmite", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing really negative but I'd say the food was just average to fair"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "I'm glad we ended up at the Yosemite View.
