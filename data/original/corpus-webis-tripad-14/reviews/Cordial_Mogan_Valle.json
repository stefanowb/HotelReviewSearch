Plus side large balcony (we had 4 sun lounges and a table with 6 chairs), 3 large pools plus baby pool with plenty of sunlounges, good breakfast buffe (recommend the omelettes made by the cook to serve), friendly staff and kids liked the activities. Downside is the stairs and lifts and pools could do with being warmed up..although our kids didn't complain. We used the spa which was nice..and my husband had a massage which he rated very highly. We had half pension but swapped some dinners for lunch so we could try some of the waterfront restaurants. The supermarket across the road was great and convenient for drinks and snacks. We did two day trips ..one by boat to Anfi beach and the other by bus (bus no 1) to Amadores beach.
