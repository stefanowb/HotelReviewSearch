My wife and I stay about two years ago and it was excellent nice new rooms wonderful food and a golf course just great (even though quite young). After having a great time we decided to bring my wife's sister and her husband for a weekend away together. It was embarrassing we had pumped this place up so much and it has changed so much since our first stay. The food was over priced and so slow and when finally arrived it was substandard. The heating didn't work it was freezing my wife was forced to sleep in her clothes to keep warm. The golf course has just been let go the fairways and overall condition of the course has really gone downhill since our first visit 2 years ago. The whole resort appears to have lost it's shine and the general upkeep of the place has been neglected. I noticed part of the car park had been cordoned off for repairs 2 years ago and it was still there second time round. From a outsider this place looks like it is going broke. Won't be coming back to this place in a hurry it is an embarrassment to the usual good Novotel name.", "title": "This place looks like it's going broke", "user": "Thehillmans", "date": "April 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 105242759}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Would go there again", "text": "OK.. To be quite honest its is a nice place (maybe because its only 3 years old at the time we stayed there April 2011) First night room service was a disgrace. First they brought my wife the wrong dinner then second time round they brought her the right one but missing the main ingrediant ( the chicken) then they brought the dry tasteless chicken on a plate for my wife to stuff it in her wholemeal roll herself as opposed to making her a completley fresh one.. Very poor service from that point of view.. As far as the rooms were concerned the vanity units had no soap holders so that made washing a bit of a mess. There were no teatowels supplied in the kittchenettes. As well as no dishwashing detergent. The spiders on the balcony didnt make it very comfotrtable to go ouside without worrying that there was goning to be a spider crawling up your back by the time you went back inside. The staff there were quite friendly but i would say the food would be less than complinmentary...

The second time around the service was appaling. The room was fantastic, cleaning staff were great, but as there is not much to do around Creswick, the main place to have your meals is in the Novotel Resturants. The service in the resturants was extreemly slow, we waited for over two hour and the quality of the food was poor once it arrived. Normaly i would not mind paying over $30 for a quality meal, but to wait for two hours and then be given crap, it was not on! Overall, the bad dining experience at the Novotel ruined our stay!
