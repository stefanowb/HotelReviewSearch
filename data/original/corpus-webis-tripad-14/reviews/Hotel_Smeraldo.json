We actually stayed in the hotel Smeralda, which is located on the oposite side of the road. The location of the hotels is very good. Both hotels have access to the lake which is beautiful. Also location is within walking distance of many Sirmione restuarants, shops, the ferry etc. The swimming pool in La Paul is pretty good, modern, clean, a reasonable size and was never too busy. We found the staff to be helpful and polite and the rooms were sufficiently clean and a fair size. We would be happy to stay at this hotel again as we feel it was good value for the money we paid. There was a lot of insects in our balcony area, probably due to a large tree outside, these were cleaned away by the staff everyday though. The airconditioning in our room was a bit loud but very effective. Only gripe was that when then people in the room next door flushed their toilets it was very loud.", "title": "A pleasant Hotel for the money", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "happymeghappy", "date": "July 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5521665, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 The noise of the toilets"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Expect nothing - get even less!", "text": "This hotel advertises 3* accommodation - untrue.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 10, 2006", "id": 5448859}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful stay at the Smeraldo!", "text": "It offers run down reception area,bedrooms,dining room and just about everything else.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lgilman_9", "date": "July 5, 2006", "id": 5428752}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "Food - flies and mosquitoes are everywhere", "title": "great facilities - lovely view", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "talitha", "date": "September 25, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3937466}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "Cleanliness is not a priority.", "title": "Excellent Lake View Room", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Sarah130274", "date": "September 1, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3836640}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "The rooms are the worst I've ever stayed in", "text": "It's a real shame, this could be a really nice hotel, but the rooms have been undermaintained and the staff are far too laid back.
