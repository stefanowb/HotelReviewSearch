Found great restaurant two blocks away at Bayview Lobster Restaurant with prices ranging from $10 to 25 for great seafood selections. We had haddock basket and corn chowder soup that was one our best meals in 3 days with great view of harbor and wonderful service. Camden is a far better place to experience the charm of Maine than Bar Harbor, which was jammed with thousands of tourists coming off two massive cruise ships on a Thursday filling the sidewalks and retail stores. Avoid any days the ships are in. Maine is one of the most friendly vacation regions we ever experienced with the most to do.
