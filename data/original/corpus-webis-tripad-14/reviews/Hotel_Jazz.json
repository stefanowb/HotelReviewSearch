There was some rumble from the metro (we were on 4th floor) but not enough to disturb us. Rooms were clean and well furnished, and staff really friendly and helpful - especially when one of our party was taken ill. From the airport take the Aerobus to the Universitat stop - the hotel is 2 mins away. Shame it rained so much as Barcelona is a beautiful city. Do visit the Gaudi houses - Casa Batllo is stunning, and the roof of La Pedrera is amazing. Sagrada Familia is quite awe inspiring. We also visited Parc Guell - it's easy enough on the Metro (cheap as chips and simple to navigate) - go up to Vallcarca and the park is 600m away. Be warned though - the last half of that is up a steep slope. There are escalators going up most of the way, but you have to come down via the steps/slope. Well worth the visit, although the area around the main entrance was really busy. The old cathedral in the gothic quarter is lovely too - and has it's own geese. We used Bus Turistic - E23 for a 2 day pass and a good way to see the city. The Aquarium was a bit disappointing - not great value for money and apart from the penguins have seen most things either at London or Birmingham aquariums. If you're a student take your NUS card to get discounts on entrance fees. Had nice dinner at MamaCafe on C de Doctor Dou (El Raval) - chilled out atmosphere and good food at reasonable prices. One thing to watch is for no-smoking signs at cafes - we went into one for breakfast and everyone was smoking - some have banned smoking but it is still the norm. Cafes on Las Ramblas are v expensive - approx \u00a36 for a diet coke - but a good place to watch the world go by. Some of the \"pet\" stalls on Las Ramblas are not for the faint hearted - way too many animals packed into small cages. Hold on to your bags - we were all OK but it's easy to see how pickpockets make their money. And keep an eye out for the parakeets flying around the city! Visit the Boqueria market just off Las Ramblas - the fruit and veg in particular is an amazing sight. All in all, a good trip, despite poor weather and illness. Would definitely recommend the Hotel Jazz as a nice hotel in a good position - and the pool is fabulous - a little oasis.", "title": "Fab Hotel", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "JB66", "date": "April 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7379142, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Trendy and fresh decor/furniture - helpful and friendly staff."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed over Easter weekend.

Fabulous location near to all public transport - the very efficient metro only few yards away (very easy to use - purchase T10 ticket for 6.75 Euro in metro station and share between all members of party just by re-inserting into machine on metro or bus), multitude of buses passing in all directions and the heart of the city so close on foot.

The airport bus even goes to and from Placa de Catalunya (outside El Cortes Ingles Department Store)every few minutes and is only 3.75 Euro each way - and is again only a short walk away from the hotel. Otherwise taxi from airport to hotel is approx 25 Euro. City taxis are numerous and inexpensive too. The hotel is most comfortable, great beds and plumbing, and so clean with fast efficient lifts. There is also a free safe in the room. The noise of the busy city can easily be shut out by closing the balcony double glazed doors and if you think the faint rumble of the metro will bother you then request a 7th floor top room to help minimise this. The roof top seating area is pleasant, breakfast offers a good choice to suit everyone and the staff are most helpful.There is also a luggage room if you have a late flight. All in all a great base to explore a fantastically vibrant and diverse city.
