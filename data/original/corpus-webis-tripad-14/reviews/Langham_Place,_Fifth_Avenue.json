Unfortunately we did not have the same good experience. We stayed there for a week and left feeling very let down. We had the classic package that included full american breakfast. On arrival the reception staff told us that they did not have that on their system. I forwarded the email confirming we had breakfast included in the rate and the receptionist said he would send us the breakfast vouchers. What he actually sent me were vouchers for continental breakfast which is of a lower value. I had to call again to set this issue clear and finally get the correct vouchers. Unlike other hotels were they offer the most generous breakfasts at the Setai they are extremely stingy. Full breakfast to them is 2 eggs, 1 sausage, coffee and 1 Juice. For anything else you get charged extra. The free wifi is extremely slow we paid the 15 dollar extra per day. They have all the disney channels apart from Disney Junior, so that they can charge 3.99 or something for 30 minute shows for pre-schoolers. We were never told of the courtesy car they have - they never offered it to us. The room was not being cleaned thoroughly. They change sheets every 3 days. My son had smudged the floor to ceiling mirror in the closet area, those smudges stayed there for 3 days. The doormen would see us coming in with children and bags in arms - would take them quite some time to come and help us. Every night I had to deal with the cigarette smoke from the room next to us. A lot of smoke!!!

At 2h15, the front desk clerk reached me at the bar to tell me my suite was ready. That was a nice touch, but I was expecting my room to be ready when I arrived. Same story for checking out. I asked the front desk the day before my departure for a late checkout. They asked me what time, and when I said 6h00PM, they said it was impossible and the best they could do for me was 2h00PM.

However, when we arrived at the Setai, any concerns were allayed as we were greeted by the very courteous Brett who whisked our cases in from the taxi almost before they hit the pavement. He gave us a tour, yes literally, of our room - a double Queen bedded suite with a hallway, dressing area and magnificent bathroom. The bedroom was a very comfortably large area with amply stocked minibar ie with complimentary soft drinks which was kept well stocked throughout out our stay. The room was very well serviced twice a day, was always very clean, everything neatly arranged or folded, and cookies left each afternoon etc. Nothing was too much trouble. The room looked over 5th Avenue and we were never bothered by other guest noise at night - evening traffic noise was not intrusive. The beds were very comfortable. The bar provided very good food in the evening. I particularly liked the security - there was always someone greeting you at the entrance. The lifts required a card swipe to take you to your floor which made me feel very safe with my children.", "title": "Anniversary Gone Wrong!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "kewiggins2003", "date": "June 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 131913924}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012", "text": "The location I thought was amazing.
