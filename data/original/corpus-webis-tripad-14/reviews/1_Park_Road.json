Philip met us at the station ,which we really appreciated, and pointed out restaurants we might like to try. His suggestions came in very handy. Mary and Philip made us feel very welcome throughout our stay and we particularly enjoyed the variety and quality of the breakfast provided. The cooked breakfast was delicious and the range of fruit dishes was like nothing we were offered anywhere else. Our room was lovely and very well appointed - everything was exactly as described on the website. Mary's offer to drive us to the station on the day we were leaving was a lovely final touch. Other reviewers have mentioned the 'extra mile' Mary and Philip often go to and here are two I was particularly grateful for: on our final morning, Mary took our daughter to see what I believe was a wonderful teddy bear collection - Mary even gave my daughter a knitted scarf for her teddy bear. My daughter was thrilled. Secondly, I left my camera charger in the room and it was posted back ASAP - I am very grateful. I plan to go back to Windermere for my 50th birthday and would definitely stay at 1 Park Road.", "title": "A Fabulous Stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Leonie D", "date": "December 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121812391}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you're looking for a pet- friendly getaway break in Windermere, 1 Park Road is somewhere I'd highly recommend.
