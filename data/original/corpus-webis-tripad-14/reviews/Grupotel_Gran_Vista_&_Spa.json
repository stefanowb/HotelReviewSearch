The hotel is excellent. Loved the large gardens, where you could always get a sunbed. Lots of pine and olive trees for shade if you wanted it. The 2 outdoor pools are great, one standard square pool, but the second pool is a lagoon style, with a waterfall and an island in the middle. Didnt find it a problem at all with majority of German guests - would only be a prob if you had children and wanted them to go to Kids club, as the nannies only seemed to speak German. Food was very good, buffet style. Did get busy, and you then had to queue for certain dishes. Evening entertainment varied, one night Chinese acrobats who were very good, flamenco dancers, a male singer another night. My tip when booking any hotel is always to request a pool view and a high floor, they don't charge any extra, and you then don't run the risk of having a view overlooking a road. Do not change up Traveller's Cheques at hotel reception as they take 10% commission.

Mind, it was slightly better than last year when we dropped off at four hotels in Alcudia before even getting to Picafort. Had a bit of a grumble to Thomson last year as there were other issues but they obviously fail to address them. The kids club is still a no-go for non German kids, and I felt that the quality of the evening meals had dropped slightly (loved the breakfasts though, lots of choice).

The hotel was in fact 95% German but this didn't affect our holiday at all as they were very friendly and polite, also all the staff spoke very good English as well as German and were extremly polite and helpful. We had a view across the pool with the sea in the distance. Our room was very clean with maid service daily. The pools were absolutely amazing, lots of different ones to choose from. The buffet style breakfast and dinner catered for everyone including nut allergy sufferers of which one of our party was. The head chef was brilliant, always on hand to advise what food was ok for the nut sufferer and even went to the extent of making a special desert for them. If you get a chance make sure you make use of the free spa, we didn't have any treatment but used the pool and jacuzzi and ice bath.

The British are very much in a minority here and it felt quite Spanish really so please don't get the impression that this place is tacky because it isn't. There are a few British bars but they are tucked away in side streets and you would have to go out of your way to find them. We transferred to the hotel using ResortHoppa. Their shuttle bus transfer service was excellent and took us to the hotel & picked us up from there on the way back. We had the misfortune to visit Alcudia a few miles round the bay. This is an appallingly dirty, run down resort which only seemed to be full of Chinese restaurants and ghastly British bars( plus the usual footie shirt wearers etc..). The port / marina area was a bit nicer and more cosmopolitan. We got the bus there at 1.35 euros each but a taxi back cost us 12 euros (plus 2 euro tip) however I would have gladly paid 100 euros just to get out of that hell hole!!!!

It is one of the best hotels of this type that I have stayed in while travelling abroad. We collected a hire car at the airport and drove to the hotel - a trip of about 40 minutes and very straightforward. There was a large hotel car park. Reception was very efficient and friendly, with english newspapers for sale and a high standard of english spoken by staff. There were 4 internet stations in the extended reception area which were coin operated (1euro for 15 mins). There were 4 lifts and we never had to wait for one for long. The view from our room was poor, the only downside really, but I heard that other guests had swapped rooms with no problem - we just stayed put! We were looking out over the roof of the dining room. The room was modern, and all had a balcony with a table and reclining chairs. The bathroom was modern and well lit, with toiletries provided and a wall-mounted hairdryer, although if you don't like your hairdryers hot you might want to take your own. The beds were a bit hard but I counteracted that by putting the quilt underneath the bottom sheet - a vast improvement. The TV channels included BBC 1, BBC 2 and ITV - a Godsend as the weather was pretty poor for much of our stay. The grounds were lovely, with one large square pool outside the door and a series of organic pools linked by waterfalls in the centre of tree-shaded lawns. There were always plenty of sun-beds available to put where you wanted. There was also a children's paddling pool. The children's club seemed to be very well run and although there were mainly german guests at the hotel, the staff were tri-lingual and spoke english and spanish too. The health spa (in a seperate building) was fantastic, with an indoor pool (there was also an indoor pool in the hotel), jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, hot room, ice room, plunge pool, relaxation room, different types of shower, and jacuzzi beds. There were also thalassotherapy jets in the pool. All of these facilities were free. The sauna and steam room were only operational in the afternoon when no children were allowed, and the sauna could only be used naked, so not for the shy, although the german guests were obviously more used to being naked in front of others so there was no awkwardness. There were a variety of massages and beauty treatments available too, with prices comparable to those in the UK. I had a salt and oil exfoliation massage and enjoyed every second. Probably the highlight of our stay was the food. There was always a fantastic choice of food, some staples always available such as salads, grilled chicken breast, grilled fish, and chips, but also a large variety of other dishes which changed nightly, with a theme, for example, Mediterranean or Caribbean. Always 2 soups, lots of pates and cheeses, different types of fresh bread, and a large selection of desserts, although these were sometimes a bit \"samey\". Breakfasts were wonderful too, lots to choose from, hot and cold, and the rice pudding was a revelation! There was never a shortage of tables and if you wanted to, in one dining room you could keep the same table for the length of your stay. There were two bars, one on the ground floor where there was nightly entertainment (as another reviewer has said, a bit hit and miss), and a rooftop bar which had a more relaxed atmosphere. There were also plenty of places in public areas to sit and relax in comfortable chairs.
