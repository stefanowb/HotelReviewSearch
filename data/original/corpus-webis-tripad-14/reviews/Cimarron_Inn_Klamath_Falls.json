We were told that they were not ready. After checking with housekeeping we were told it would be 45 minutes or more. We were hungry so we went to the Elmer's restaurant near by. We returned at 6:30 and checked into our rooms. We were given no consideration for the inconvenience and no explanation. At check out the next morning I asked the front desk person if there might be a shortage of housekeepers, no, she replied.I then asked her if it was normal to not have rooms ready at 5:30. She said that it was, and had been that way all summer. Again, no apology's and no explanation. She pretty much just let me know that that's the way it is. So, in conclusion I would have to say that if you want to stay in a nice older property and are not wanting to check in before dinner, this might be your place. However, this area of town has many newer and nicer choices. The attitude more than the inconvenience would keep me from returning to the Cimarron.

The Cimarron Motor Inn was ranked #3 in Klamath Falls at the time I was looking, and the rate of $59 that they had on Expedia was exactly the range I was looking for. I booked it through Expedia, and I must say that it was a truly delightful experience. The property is located on a major thoroughfare through Klamath Falls, and was pretty easy to find. It is surrounded by shopping and restaurants, including Elmer's which offers a 10% discount to people staying at the Cimarron Motor Inn. The desk clerk at check-in was waiting for us, and had all of the proper paperwork in order, and was very efficient and friendly. The room itself was exactly what I expected. The cleanliness was exemplary. Everywhere I looked, everything was fresh and clean. There was a microwave and a refrigerator and an air-conditioning unit that worked very well. The bathroom amenities were nice, and the towels all seemed new. The linens on the bed and the comforter were clean and very nice. My room was on the 2nd floor. I liked the access to the walking/jogging trail immediately behind the motel, and walked about 1.5 miles along it...very pretty at this time of year.", "title": "Thanks Tripadvisor -- this one is a real gem!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "wlntcrkca", "date": "August 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 76876250}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "One of my best stays ever in a chain motel.
