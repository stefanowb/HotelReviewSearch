Large floor to ceiling windows and sliding doors in the bedroom and living area. Marble counter tops and nice wood furniture with comfy cushions. The bed was the best I had ever stayed on at a resort or a hotel. The blackout curtains work great. I was also lucky enough to witness some amazing sunrises while enjoying the jacuzzi on the deck. The deck extended the entire suite and could be accessed from the bedroom and the living area. There were 2 sets of tables an chairs to enjoy. Although the metal frames could use cushions. Little things we noticed that may bother some were the little touches that were rushed over. Paint splatters on windows and bathroom fixtures.
