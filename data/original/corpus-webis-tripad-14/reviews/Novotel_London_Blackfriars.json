One slight gripe - the transparent wall between bedroom and bathroom means that the toilet is exposed to view, which not everyone appreciated. This is an excellent hotel, comfortable, bright, clean, welcoming, efficient, very nice staff. The swimming pool is a big plus. Location could hardly be better - just a few yards from Southwark Tube Station on the Jubilee line means that the West End can be reached very quickly. Also ideal for visiting Greenwich, Cutty Sark etc. Excellent restaurant and fabulous breakfast buffet. By booking online in advance we also got a very good rate.
