Can only reiterate what most of the reviewers said: a wonderful hotel. Staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly; the rooms were large, comfortable, well equipped and clean. The only disadvantages were the steep stairs (not a problem to most) and the distance to the central station (not a problem if you use the nearby trams).", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "bigfozbelper_England", "date": "August 20, 2005", "id": 3791884}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "When there, also make sure to visit La Falote on Roelof Hartstraat which is close to the hotel and was recommended to us by the staff. Excellent food and atmosphere and, if you're lucky, the owner will play the accordian for you whilst sitting on your lap!
