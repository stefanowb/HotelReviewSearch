It has a great view overseeing the lake from the terrace and a real \"backpacker\" feeling to it. We stayed in a private double which were bunk beds but the room was OK and the bathrooms were reasonably clean. The best things about it was the food: We got the 2-course meals and they were really great. Furthermore, beer and wine are super cheap and the staff is very friendly. Definitely recommended if you are looking for a reasonably priced accommodation. Only \"downsides\" were 1.) that it got quite hot in the rooms (but they had a fan) and 2.) that people tend to stay on the terrace till late at night and it can get a bit noisy.", "title": "Fab place, fab views, fab friendly staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "algiesmummy", "date": "August 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117364798}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled solo", "text": "Amazing hostel with a relaxed family friendly feel.

I found the staff to be helpful and very accommodating-and the food, especially the pizzas, were good value and incredibly tasty! Thoroughly recommended. The hostel does tend to attract a younger crowd so bringing ear-plugs if you are a light sleeper is a good idea-but if you join in and have a few drinks with the staff and others you will have a great time!

La Primula was in a good location overlooking the lake. The family room we had was very basic and the attached toilet/shower was miniscule but this was not really a big deal since we were not here to lounge around the 'hotel'. I was surprised to read good reviews about breakfast since ours was extremely spartan to say the least - a cold, small croissant with a (decent) cup of coffee - the atmosphere was enhanced by the mix of company sharing travel stories. Contrary to the information provided on the website NO evening meal was available at the time we stayed. The most helpful and friendly staff member happened to be a young Aussie guy who had returned to work at the hostel for free room and board - he was very welcoming and really seemed to be running the place by himself but without him I found the other permanent members of staff to be less than accommodating. I think the website gives a better impression than the reality!! We have since heard of self catering apartments in Menaggio or across the lake in the gorgeous town of Bellagio which seem to have slightly more expensive but better accommodation.

From Milan you take a train to Varenna, where you catch one of the many ferries across the lake to Menaggio. While Menaggio itself has lovely sights nearby (ie: Villa Carlotta), the excellent ferry system also allows you to hop from Menaggio to Bellagio and Varenna quite easily. The price is right--14 Euros a night for a stay in the dorm. The staff/owners are so friendly and helpful if you need any ideas for what to do. The food is fabulous. A basic breakfast (yogurt, juice, bread) is included in the price AND they make you your own espresso drink to order--what a great way to start the day! Dinner is the real star. For 12 Euros you get wine (or soda or bottled water), pasta, meat (or fish--we there during Lent), and dessert. This was some of the best food we ate during our stay in Italy and that is saying a lot. They even accomodate vegetarians! One night when the chef came out one table began applauding him--of course we all joined in to give him well-deserved credit. Dinner is also a great time to meet some of your fellow travelers.

I hate to say anything negative, as I really had a good time, but the food was not great. My impression from other reviews and the hostel's website is that it is a foody place but I did not enjoy it, apart from the pizza!

The wifi is really expensive which I didnt like. My room was a 4 bed female dorm and I found it fine. One thing I didnt like was the showers. Not sure about the male showers but the female shower room had very little privacy. There are 3 cubicles but no room to change so you have to change outside the cubicles, then the cubicles themselves have semi-transparent doors. The hostel provides dinner each night for a cheaper price (apparently) than most places in Menaggio, and the food is pretty good. Also lots of chances to get to know other travellers.
