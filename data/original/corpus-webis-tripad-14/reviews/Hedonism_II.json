Warped, old & blades are so damaged that they are bent up and gross looking. The pools (tiles, painting etc.) could use some attention as well. Pergolas all need paint and a good pressure wash. Overall the resort could use a good pressure wash, paint, etc..

We don't go for the rooms, although they are adequate for the approximately one and a half waking hours we spend in them each day. We don't go for the food, although I gained 7 pounds in 9 days. We go for the fun, for the absolute best 24/7/365 party on the planet, some of the best staff members you will find anywhere (where else does the staff remember you by name from your last visit and greet you with a big smile and a hug?), even at luxury, 5 star hotels, and for the most amazing group of guests you will ever spend a vacation with. This is not a \"sit by yourself reading a book \"vacation. It is a social event. If you're not sociable and friendly, don't go, but if you are, you will likely make some of the best friends you have in the world. How many other vacations have you gone on where you met many of the same people who were there last year and people with whom you continue to communicate all year? At how many other resorts do guests exchange email addresses and phone numbers when they leave? It truly is all about the people, the party and the fun. These things allow you to overlook whatever blemishes the resort may have. Some specifics: Food at the buffet varied but was generally quite good. The lamb chops, shrimp linguine and pork at Martino's were excellent . Munasan's (Japanese) was also excellent (as always in our opinion) . Top shelf liquor was plentiful and always available at all bars. There was much renovation and work going on while we were there which bodes well for future visits. The Entertainment staff was outstanding as always (in fact, better than ever) and the evening shows were amazing - best we have ever seen at Hedo. Sticky Niki, Winston, Fifty, Michael, Melody and all the EC's, we LOVE you. Scumba, Serena, Pauline, you guys ROCK. Nigel your jerk chicken is to die for! Between the guests you've become friends with and the staff you know from prior trips, it is more like a family reunion than a vacation. Our next trip is already booked (with Denny at DennyP.com - big ups to Denny) for August, 2011 and we can't wait! We're also booked for next April as well.
