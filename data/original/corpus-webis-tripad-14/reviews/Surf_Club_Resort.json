Montauk, unlike the Hamptons, is not as polished which adds to the natural and very dramatic beauty. We love the casual beachy feel of the town and feel like it lends itself to really relaxing. This is our second stay at the Surf Club and given the choice of accommodations in Montauk, this is definitely your best bet by a long shot! To begin, the oceanfront accommodations are great - the view of the ocean past the natural fauna is gorgeous and the sound of the waves is medication for the soul. The townhouses are a mini version of all you need while you are at the beach. We especially liked the little patio facing the ocean to eat our breakfast and lunch. Great to have a small kitchen so you don't have to eat every meal out. Pool is very nice and warm. Love that the resort provides beach towels and chairs. Montauk surf is awesome - and the even though is was very overcast the kids still had a ball playing on the sand. We love that you can walk to town from the resort and we did so everyday. Some great spots to eat in Montauk; loved breakfast at Jodis and dinner at Harvest and who cannot love eating lobster at Dureyeas (sp?) where you BYOB and look out on the water! Anyway, my feeling is that location, convenience, view and cleanliness are the most important considerations when choosing a beach spot, doesnt have to be luxurious as we want to be outside as much as possible.
