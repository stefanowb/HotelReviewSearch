Keep in mind that old Quebec City, as well as being a historic site, is a major tourist town.

The Saint Pierre staff were very friendly and the atmosphere cosy. Prices are reasonable for Quebec City. We had to change rooms for the two night stay. The first room was basic and sufficient for a good night's sleep.

My friend and I stayed in a very lovely, quiet room (#102) with two double beds (Queen) and wonderful hard wood floors. Not only was the room spotless, it had every small touch imaginable, from two luxurious robes, spa tub, extra umbrella, hairdryer, coffee maker, windows that open, to a desk, side chair, and TV! The location in lower town was convenient to fine restaurants (such as Initiale and Toast), shopping, historic sites, and the St. Lawrence River. The staff was exceptional and provided superior service and assistance (in French or English). Did I mention breakfast was included? As Americans, it was helpful to start the day and not have to worry about finding something to eat.

The rooms have exposed brick walls, thin down comforters, whirlpool baths (a nice plus) and are decorated in attractive colors. Breakfast (included with room) is served in a pretty dining room from 7-10 am and you choose from about 10 dishes each morning and they make it to order--things like yogurt and fruit, omlettes, french toast, crepes, and oatmeal. It is really nice and the server was so bright and friendly each morning. The only drawback for us was the construction noise nextdoor as they renovate another old building. They started about 8 am and served as our \"wake-up call.\" This is out of the control of the hotel staff, but hopefully they contruction will be done soon. We loved it! Make sure to have a meal at the diner-stlye Le Buffet De L'antiquaire on Rue St. Paul (4 minute walk from hotel).

The only downside was that everyone must shower about an hour before the breakfast serving time ends (as I did) and there was no hot water left. I adjusted my shower time by an hour the next morning and was fine. We took the tour of the Chateau Frontenac (good tour!) and knew we had made the right choice with where to stay\u2026.those rooms were 3-4 times the price and quite small in comparison.
