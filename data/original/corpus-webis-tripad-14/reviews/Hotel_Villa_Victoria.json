We were in room #110 on the street side. The room was a nice size with a comfortable queen bed and very nice clean bathroom. The storage was addaquite, a closet with a small hanging area, several storage shelves two night stands and a luggage rack. The bathroom had a small wrap around shelve to put toiletries on. There was a second mirror over the desk, a desk chair and two ottomans. The French balcony opened onto a lovely tree lined boulevard. It had double doors that blocked the street noise. The air conditioning actually cooled the room. We have traveled extencively in Europe and this is a real plus for a 3 star Hotel. The room had a hot water pot with tea bags and instant coffee. There was a small refrigerator with 2 complementary bottles of water for your first day. It had room to put several of your own beverages in it. The hotel had adult and other beverages available for a reasonable fee. The Breakfast was a buffet with the traditional french rolls, breakfast pasteries cheese, ham , boiled eggs, cereal, yougart and a basket with oranges and bananas. You had the choice of sitting in a nice dining room or the option of eating in their lovely plant filled garden. They also had 24 hour complementary tea, coffee, and tea cakes in the afternoon. The staff was pleasant and most helpful. The hotel is well located, a 3 minute walk from Avenue Jean Medecin, the location of major department stores. The Old town and outdoor market is a 7 minute walk and Promenade Des Anglais (along the beach) is a 9 minute walk. There were a few cafes available just a block from the hotel. The buses are convenient and reasonable the cost is 1 Euro for one direction and 4 euros for unlimited in one day, but they are crowded.

The staff at the reception was very friendly ( was glad to help us when we wanted to microwave some baby food late in the night).

Once again we booked a long way out to get the best deal we could and it is costing us a lot less than the room tariff at present. We arrived very early from Vienna at 9:00am and were given the option of looking at a room that was already made up over looking the courtyard. It was perfect. The room was beautiful with large double opening doors and shutter windows. The breakfasts were nice. Decent continental breakfast with lots of variety. The hotel staff are lovely and very helpful. They speak English which made things easier for us. I would definitely stay here again. You are only about 10 minutes walk from the beach front and there is a major supermarket nearby.
