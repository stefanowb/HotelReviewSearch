But the next morning at 8.30 they already banged on the door to clean the room... Wonderful. We were so disappointed by best western, that the following hotels from best western we went to, we asked everytime to see the room first, before we decided to book it. When we complainted about these things we had to tell the story to 3 different people. Bad communication.
