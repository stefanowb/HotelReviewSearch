The kids are dropped off at the Miniclub in the morning and they the go off skiing. The GOs help to prepare them for the skiing and the ski instructors from ESF take them out in group lessons. The kids are put in different groups based on their abilities. For lunch, the kids can eat in their own separate restuarant or can join the adults at the main restaruant. The kids continued skiing in the afternoon till about 4:30pm. The adult and kid skiing times are scheduled separately so that the adults can drop off and prick up the kids easily. The kids can stay in the mini club and eat at their own restaurant or join the adults. Every day at 7:45pm to 8:45pm, there is a show for the kids. The GOs organising this were talented and funny, and the kids had a lot of fun. The shows were entertaining for the adults too. The GOs have a lot energy and take care of the kids really well.", "title": "fantastic week", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Helena H", "date": "August 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 171946503}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "(3) Rooms were big and comfortable.", "title": "Fun vacation for everyone!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "DMM33155", "date": "July 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166277479}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "(4) The buffet food was of a high quality and kept changing.", "title": "fantastic for families", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "tamash1", "date": "May 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162237932}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Rhone-Alpes", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 40, "very good": 123, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 247}, "aka": "Club Med Peisey-Vallandry Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.2, "description": "Perched at a height of 1600 metres, the Peisey-Vallandry resort embodies the convivial heart and soul of the mountains of Savoy. Close to dramatic streams and lakes and bordering a forest of larch and spruce, the two chalets of the Club Med Village, combine traditional materials with the refinement of contemporary design. The Club Med Village's location at the entrance to the Vanoise national park makes Peisey-Vallandry the ideal base for a weekly expedition to try out whitewater sports."}
