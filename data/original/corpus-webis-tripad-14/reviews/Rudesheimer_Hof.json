The room was quite large by European standards, with space for 2 chairs and a table. The highlight for us was the really large and sunny en suite/bathroom. The hotel is well situated, one street back from the main street. Although Rudesheim has regular trains travelling through the town, we could hear nothing from our room. Our hosts, Sussi and Wilhelm, couldn't have been more helpful and knowledgeable with tour advice and local history. On our last morning a taxi had been arranged to get us to the station but when it didn't turn up and time was ticking, Wilhelm loaded us and our luggage into his car and made sure we didn't miss the train. Oh, and did I mention the breakfast. Heaps of choice, lovely friendly staff and delicious coffee. We loved the beautiful town of Rudesheim. It was the highlight of our 4 weeks of European travel.

I sat in their covered outdoor terrace with a superb bottle of dry Riesling which went very well with my pasta and a superb, crisp fresh salad with a stunning dressing.

This was my sixth trip to Europe and my party consisted of my wife, 70 Yr old sister and myself. We rented a car and enjoyed exploring Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria. We stayed at the Rudesheimer Hof the nights of 2 and 3 June 2011, and the owner/manager was very accommodating and helpful regarding where to go, what to see and what to do. We greatly enjoyed their breakfast buffet: Coffee and hot chocolate, scrambled eggs, and large selection of deli meats, cheeses, juices, bread, rolls and delicious preserves! In our opinion, we rate this hotel and the owner as being one of the best experiences of our vacation. Hotel is in a great - quiet location, limited free on-site parking, and across the street is a very convenient drug store (they had great prices on bottled water and snacks), and also across the street was a very friendly bank (Rheingauer Volksbank eG, 65366 Geisenheim Street) that gave us the absolute best exchange rate that we experienced during the entire trip (I used their ATM to get 500 Euro and they charged me only 5 Euro total fee (they charge a 2% fee up to a maximum fee of no more than 5 Euro)! I purposely viewed some of the other hotels highlighted on Trip Advisor (one with a higher rating and higher costs) but personally preferred the Rudesheimer Hof to all others that I personally saw. The hotel offered us room 306 for my party of three, which was on the top floor (reachable by elevator) and had two single beds in one room, 1 single bed in an adjacent small room, and cold air conditioning! We had a nice bathroom with private toilet/shower and satisfactory TV with a variety of channels. I had a great visit here and would not hesitate to choose this hotel for a future stay! Dining: We only had breakfast at this hotel which was great, however I have comments regarding a couple of other restaurants located on Rudesheim\u2019s famous Drosselgasse Street: #1) On the first evening we had a relatively expensive meal (approx 20 Euro or $30 US each, excluding drinks) for simple Bratwurst that was severely overcooked, Sauerkraut and Fries (Ref attached photos). This restaurant was in a lovely outdoor \u201cwine\u201d restaurant setting with a Bavarian band. I will attribute the overcooked meals to the fact they were very busy, however for the price paid, and considering the restaurant\u2019s reputation, they should not never have served those overcooked Bratwurst. Our choices were to either send them back (but it took forever to finally get them), walk out (but we would still be hungry) or eat the meal (which we regretfully did). #2) The second night, on the same Drosselgasse Street, we had a delightfully delicious and very inexpensive meal (under 7 Euro for bigger and better Bratwurst, Sauerkraut and Fries) in a little \u201cstep in\u201d fast food type caf\u00e9 that only had two inside tables (each would seat four guests on four stools) and a service counter with another three or four stools. From the main street this Caf\u00e9 will be on your right side as you walk up Drosselgasse Street. There was a local family eating there so that should have been a clue that this was a going to be a great meal. #3) Highly recommend the Villa Weil Ice Cream shop on the main street in Rudesheim. Per my wife who is an ice cream connoisseur, they had the best ice cream of our entire trip! For a total of 8.40 Euros (excluding tip) we enjoyed two dishes of ice cream with toppings and one specialty Spaghetti ice cream plate. In closing regarding restaurants: Typically we have found on our journeys that the very best meals are generally found in the smaller establishments rather than the highly rated and overpriced \u201ctourist type\u201d restaurants.", "title": "Great Hotel, Owner/Manager and Breakfast", "user": "DoDWorldTraveler", "date": "July 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115367316}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "the hotel is quite good, quite basic rooms. we have taken a room with a balcony which was very small and no view. but the restaurant is great, the spargels were delicious", "title": "nothing to write home about but excelant restaurant", "user": "litanir", "date": "June 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 113955345}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great start to a great holiday", "text": "We had a family room which was very clean and roomy enough for 4 adults.

We arrived very late (23:00) and the Hotel Rudesheimer Hof was closed. We thought we were going to have to sleep in the car when my wife noticed a man waving his arms from a window above the parking lot. I recognized him as Wilhelm, the owner. Although we had never met, he knew me by name and had left a key at the front desk for us. Mind you, we never gave credit card info for a deposit. His daughter let us in and showed us to the room they reserved for us on solely a \"handshake\"! Wilhelm saved us from a miserable night, but the great service did not stop there! Sissi, his lovely wife, held the massive breakfast bar open for us past the 10:00 am shut down so we could sleep in after a long day. Then, at dinner, my older son wanted to try \"Blood Sausage\". The wonderful waitress (who spoke pretty good English) discouraged it but brought my son into the kitchen and had the chef prepare a \"mini portion\" of Blood Sausage for my son to try. She didn't have to do that and most wait people would just have let him order it and not even let him try, let alone bring him into the kitchen! Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so kind and helpful there! As for the hotel, Beautiful! Quiet, rustic and traditional. Close to everything Rudesheim, Germany has to offer as well as castles along the Rhine River. If you are driving here, follow the directions on their web site. They are perfect. Just watch out for the one-way street. I made a mistake one time and got, justifiably, a couple of beeps! The included breakfasts are awesome, the dining room is breathtaking and the outdoor dining is comfortable and quaint! We did have dinner there (no, my son did not get the blood sausage but said it was OK) and the meals that each of us had were very delicious! I had a glass of traditional rose wine from the Rhine Valley and, although I am not a wine expert, it was fantastic! All this service and all the friendliness and all the cleanliness and all of the great food were at an extremely fair, if not cheap, price! Wilhelm and Sissi should teach hotel and restaurant owners across the world how to run one to perfection! Would I recommend this hotel? Let's just say, the Hotel Rudesheimer Hof is the best!
