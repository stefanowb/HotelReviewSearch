We arrived in Fort Lauderdale Thursday night for a Saturday sailing. It was great to be there with a few days to explore Fort Lauderdale. We actually flew into Miami (again cheaper) and rented a car for a day to drive up to Fort Lauderdale. This hotel was chosen mostly because we had free Marriott points and they offered free shuttle to the port. I recommend reserving a spot on the shuttle as soon as you check in. We asked for a room facing the parking lot (away from the highway) for quiet. Also we usually ask for a top floor, but with all the cruise passengers leaving at the same time we didn't want to fight for an elevator. There is a Kmart across the street. We went there for wine and bottled water (both are allowed on RCI). 2 bottles of wine per stateroom. And we just slapped a luggage tag on our $4 case of water and wha-lla it showed up in our stateroom. This hotel is fine. The pool area is okay, but small.
