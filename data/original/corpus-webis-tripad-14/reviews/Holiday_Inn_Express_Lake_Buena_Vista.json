Overall, this hotel wasn't a disappointment but we weren't very impressed either. The lobby, room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was comfortable-I especially loved the soft sheets and comforter & that the bedspread was a blue thin blanket that could be easily washed. I was concerned about dust mites as I am allergic to them and unfortunately there must have been a population in the heavy curtains or carpet because my nose closed up fast & my throat hurt. Besides that, the only other negative regarding the room was that our phone did not ring/was broken & we never got our wake up call. The pool was small but nice with a waterslide. There's also a wooden playhouse with sand for the kids nearby. Big plus: the hotel is located close to many restaurants and a hop, skip and jump away from Disney. Big negative: the heavily advertised hot breakfast wasn't so hot. We thought we'd get bacon or sausage. But besides the scrambled eggs, the only hot protein was very little pieces of sausage in a white country gravy. The rest of the buffet was pretty good though--pasties, breads, cereals, milk, yogurt, fruits, biscuits, oj, apple juice and coffee. And they kept it neat and stocked despite the crowded breakfast room. However, I'd stayed at a similar hotel (that advertised a hot breakfast) last year, and their buffet delivered with great hot food. This buffet did not. Overall, it was a nicely priced hotel with some good amenities, but we won' t be staying there nor recommending it to friends.", "title": "Clean Hotel, hot breakfast was just okay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "lktrav21", "date": "April 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "front_desk": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 15207453, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location; cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 Hot breakfast"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with family", "text": "My family and I just came back from spending 2 nights at this hotel.
