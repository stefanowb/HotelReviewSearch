He helped us with EVERYTHING and truly our stay in Rome would have been a catastrophe without his assistance (we encountered some real travel challenges as we arrived in Rome.) The place is immaculate! Room are not huge but always clean. We had a GREAT bathroom and a terrace (if you cannot climb 5 flights of stairs after a day of touring Rome, DON'T ask for the terrace room!) which looked out on the neighborhood rooftops. The intimacy of this beautiful villa is captivating. The food was great! Only drawback was our room was extremely hot. The AC was NOT good (they gave us a fan) but we opened the french doors to the terrace and pulled the bed over to the fresh air where we could watch the beautiful Roman sky.

This was not a problem for us, but it is something to consider for guests with mobility issues. We were very happy with the room, which was clean and full of character. The bathroom looked recently renovated, and while the shower was small for me, it was still sufficient. There is a computer in the lobby for guests, which I always look for when considering a hotel. Paolo, the owner, is a gracious host. He (or others who might be at the front desk) has many suggestions for dining or sightseeing, as well as transport to the airport. I was happy to be able to charge the car service to my room bill, as I would have had to take out more Euros otherwise. I am not a big breakfast person, so I found the offerings sufficient.

The location is certainly excellent, but from there things kind of go downhill. First, they must have brought in an entirely new staff, because these folks -- with the sole exception of the fellow who checked us in (we never saw him again) -- were rather dour, not very eager to help, seemingly preoccupied, and not very helpful. We didn't ask for much, but it always felt as though we were imposing on them. They never seemed to smile or make you feel welcome. They mishandled a restaurant reservation by reserving for the wrong day, and never apologized or offered to rectify it in some way. Perhaps if they payed a little more attention to the guests... They did provide us with two good local restaurant recommendations (one is just around the corner). We spent 20 minutes at breakfast one morning listening to one of the staff loudly pontificating in Italian outside the breakfast room about God knows what without ever offering us a cappuccino. The breakfast was meh; the coffee was not good, and the cappucinos were disappointingly weak (they never offered a second cappuccino, either). The woman who seemed to be mostly in charge of the breakfast room looked as though she wanted to be anyplace else but there (that's pleasant). The croissants were more soggy than anything; definitely not good. The rolls are like mini-sandwhich buns from the supermarket. We've had other basic Italian hotel breakfasts that were considerably better. The breakfast room itself is dark and rather dingy. The rooms themselves are \"ok\"; they're reasonably large and comfortable, but quite plain. Our room also got a lot of noise from motorcycles and other street noise. Normally when I read negative reviews among many positive rating, I wonder whether the reviewer was at fault somehow. I take no pleasure in expressing my disappointment at out experience oat the Canali. This is just an honest description of our experience.

This is a delightful hotel. We stayed here with our three children in the family suite. The room (two adjoining) was great, airconditioned and location near piazza navone was unbeatable. Breakfasts were great. Yet, it was the Staff that really made this place fantastic. They were welcoming, (carried our luggage up the stairs), helpful in arranging cabs, tours and restaurants and and overall wonderful.

When we arrived at the hotel, we were definitely not disappointed! A charming hotel with character! We stayed on the 3rd floor (though we really wanted the room on the 4th floor with a rooftop terrace--unfortunately, it was booked already) and the room was perfect! Wooden floors with a lot of ample space. There were two double beds with a flat screen tv in one area which was near this huge and beautiful windows (though our view was another building which was too close to the hotel and the alley below us), huge closet which was across a dresser table with a small refrigerator beside it , a huge bathroom with a bath tub, hot water, blower, towels, and all those little toiletries. The best part were the wooden beams on the ceiling... Gorgeous! Pros: Best location ever! Very near Piazza Navona literally! Walking distance to a lot of good sites (bring comfortable shoes!) like the Trevi fountain, Spanish steps, pantheon, etc. Great service and very helpful staff who happily helped us or advised us where to find good, authentic, & affordable Italian restaurants. They were also friendly enough to show us some good walking tours which we could do for ourselves. Breakfast was inclusive and they serve some good cappuccino. I love also the fresh breads but my fave would be the cake or desserts. Value for your money. Safe and secured locks on their main doors. Cons: Steep stairs (difficult if you're carrying a lot of luggage).

Since I do not know where else to post a review of tours I will say one thing abaout tours here. We booked a day trip to Pompeii with Context Rome that was spectacular. I highly recommend them.

It was a challenge for our taxi to find the place, we even asked several police and they had no idea. Finally, after locating the hotel on a quaint streel, Stephen, took our luggage up stairs. I had requested a room with a terrace for 3 persons. The climb (6 floors) was worth it. Great way to walk off all the calories consumed while traveling. The front desk was always helpful. Several times my daughter and I went shopping at 6 pm and instead of taking our bags to our room before dinner, we deposited them at the front desk to hold until we returned. I guess we were too lazy to walk the stairs. Great restaurants nearby, easy walk to the Vatican, Spanish Steps. We loved walking and exploring the wonderful small streets nearby. Nice breakfast, typical of european hotels. We did take advantage of their car service on our return trip home. 45 euros and I tipped him an extra 5. We would stay there again.
