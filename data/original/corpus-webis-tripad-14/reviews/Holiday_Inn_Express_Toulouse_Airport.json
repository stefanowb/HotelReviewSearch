The shuttle from the hotel picked us up promptly after being called from prominently displayed phone in airport lobby. The driver did not accept a tip even though it was after 11 pm! The room was streamlined (modern) but had everything we needed, including shower, hairdryer and separate toilet area. The buffet continental breakfast was outstanding. Many types of fruits, juices, breads, and cereals as well as ham and cheeses including camembert, a machine to make coffee specialties such as espresso and cafe au lait. The staff was most helpful.
