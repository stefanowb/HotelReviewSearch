No garage open, couldn't get a line on our cell. We walked from the interstate to the Budget Motel.(We saw the lights from the highway) Clerk at the desk was very helpful, with 2 children, both overtired from the long drive, car broken down & a wife who was far from happy at this point, he really saved us all. He made some calls & arranged for the car to be towed to a local garage, gave us a great room with 2 double beds (the decor seemed a little old, but it was very clean) Their restaurant was closed, but the manager got us somoe sandwiches & snacks for the children. We slept well in a quiet room & enjoyed a wonderful continental breakfast that was served with a smile. Our car was ready at 2 pm & they even gave us a late check-out at no additional charge. We tried the restaurant for their lunch buffet. It's a great all you can eat deal at 6.95.", "user": "nepaman69", "date": "March 19, 2006", "id": 4693569}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not Great, Definitely Not A Value", "text": "All in all, I would stay at this place again.

Second, although the rooms are okay, the whole hotel stinks of smoke (and even in a nonsmoking room it's hard to avoid the pervasive stench). Also, the furniture and mattress in my room were functional, but both looked and felt kind of old. The restaurant is a joke, and very overpriced. For a real meal, try the Dansbury Depot, it's a couple miles away but the food and atmosphere are in a much higher league. Do not, I repeat, do not waste money on the breakfast offering at the restaurant. Finally, I thought it was a little creepy that the hotel is located next to a cemetery.", "user": "hanskel", "date": "November 6, 2005", "id": 4089535}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good motel", "text": "This hotel is perfect located, directly connected to Int. 80 and close by the Poconos.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 14, 2005", "id": 3901326}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just Right", "text": "The name is for sure not what you should suggest.", "user": "islandd", "date": "May 30, 2005", "id": 3510925}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice, but...", "text": "I stayed at the Budget Inn and Suites Hotel (Formerly Super 8) from November 10 thru the 13th.

The bathroom was in good shape and the heat/air controls worked marvelously. Vending machines along with a mini exercise room and video games provide refreshments, exercise and gaming activity. The in-house restaurant J. R. Grill is excellent if you're a steak lover but not so good if seafood or Italian dining is your cup of tea. It's prices are reasonable and the service is quick, fast and in a hurray. The hotel offers a free breakfast buffet during the week that consists of oatmeal, eggs, potatoes, sausage, juices, coffee, bagels, etc.--and is really worth getting up for.

I had booked a non-smoking large double weeks in advance. When we arrived @5 p.m. we got a corner room facing the highway. Note: rooms facing the front can be noisy as the highway is right there as well as a main access road. The corridor where our room was located smelled horrible-very stale and smokey. The when we entered the room the same smell permeated the room. The large double has 3 double beds which is nice but there is no microwave or refrig. Being in a rush to see some sights and have dinner we quickly went out for the evening. On returning the stink wof the room and hallway was overwhelming. I went to the first floor for ice and noticed all the rooms had non-smoking signs. On returning to the second floor I noticed no signs- we were put on a smoking floor with a smoking room that stunk and had dirty, stained carpets. When I went to reception yes I was told it was a smoking room. I was furious as we always book a non-smoking room. We were told there were no other rooms available and all they could do was to send someone up with an \"ozone\" machine to clear the air. Well, after a half hour someone finally showed up with the the machine that turned out to be broken. We were then told that was the only machine he could find and that was the end of that. So at 10:00 p.m. My husband went out to cvs to buy fabreeze, which did help to diminish the musty, stale odor. The next morning we again expressed our displeasure, and were told that room was recently converted to a non-smoking room!
