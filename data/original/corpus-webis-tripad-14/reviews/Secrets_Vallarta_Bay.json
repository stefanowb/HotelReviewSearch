After reading all the reviews I wanted to focus on the great things people seem to miss which is the awesome staff and service. I was traveling by myself and was very conscious of other people and how I was treated especially by the staff. First of all it was on par and above my experience from other AMR resorts. From arrival to departure the service was personable, professional and nothing was ever a problem especially in the preferred tower. Let me give you some examples \u2013 I did receive the $400 in vouchers without the timeshare tour, people did call me by name, room service always was prompt and when I asked for an upgrade to a master suite it was not a problem, easy and not expensive. Raul the Concierge was flawless in his attention to detail and assistance with anything. I had left a very expensive ring in my room when I upgraded at the Maid returned it to me directly. This is way above the call of duty in a hotel. Bravo Secrets.

Our trip didn't start out good with delays and a scary landing, of course Secrets-AM Resorts has nothing to do with that. We arrived extremely late, so all the restaurants where closed and since we hadn't had a meal for hours and hours, we tried room service, but so did the entire bus load of guests who were dumped off at The Now and the Secrets. Needless to say we were sleeping by the time they finally got it to our room and it was cold on top of it. I understand the circumstance though. We did order it another night and it came much quicker and it was warm, not hot. Service, however was good. Morning breakfast at the Secrets the next morning was ala carte and extremely slow. They really seemed clueless, I actually felt bad for them. The food there was only okay and again, not hot. Even the coffee wasn't hot. We checked out the pool and beach area the next day, loved the pool and you certainly can't beat the view of the Sierra Madre. BEAUTIFUL! I wish the vendors weren't on the beach, but they leave you alone if you wish. The bartender, whom I can't remember his name was swamped at the swim up bar, he was doing all he could do to stay above water himself. I wanted to jump back and help him! ;) He was friendly enough, made good drinks and he was the waiter the next few days at the pool. He knew my husband and was very prompt at getting his drinks for him. Plenty of shade if you wish and they had the big floats you could lounge on in the pool as well, that was really nice. Lunch was good right there by the pool at the Oceana, but we think we may have got sick from one of the lunches there. It's hard to say what you ate or where, but we knew we arrived early Sunday Morning and by Tuesday, things weren't right. We're still trying to get back to normal yet. I did bring it to the attention of the hotel as they can't figure anything out if they don't know anything about it. We didn't want anything from the hotel, but just to let them know, so they can figure it out and stop it. We were not the only ones sick by any means. That's why I give this resort a lower overall rating. We enjoyed most of the employees and the view from both lobbies is just gorgeous. I loved the little coffee shop. I'd like to see a little more entertainment in the lobbies. Maybe something a little livelier after dinner on some nights?? We went to one of their shows and left before it was done. It seemed very amateur like, we weren't impressed at all. But, most of us don't go to the resorts for the shows. I along with many of the other guests didn't like the fact that Secrets guests generally pay more that 'adult' only resort, but NOW guests can come over to the Secrets side. And sharing all the restaurants??? I don't know, if you are going to an adult only resort, the restaurants are very limited on the adult only side and you don't necessarily want to be around all the kids on the Now side of the resort. Would I go back? Hmmmmm, beautiful resort, friendly service, but I may try another resort out.

The hotel is shared with now amber which is the family side. The secrets side is for adults, i never saw one kid in our area. when we arrived the lovely staff greeted us with champagne and cold towels. They were prompt n immediatley took our bags to our rooms. The hotel is still fairly new, not even being open for a year yet. It was so nice and clean inside the lobby. We were immediately offered drinks as we waited to get checked in. When i say the staff were all amazing they really were! and obviously if you tip them i dont think you could even get any better service! the rooms were devine, great decor and the seem to be all ocean view. The pool is not that big but they have 3 to choose from. Theres always activities going on at the resort, the entertainment team were so friendly and really tried to get everyone involved in what ever activity or show was going on. For food they have really great choices of restuarants and the buffets for breakfast. Though i wouldnt recommend the buffets. with 24 hour room service and a full stocked free mini bar. you cant ever go hungry or parched. Rooms were cleaned everyday. they changed the sheets but not the blankets. They have a disco downstairs, the dj was really good and took kindly to requests. They also have shisha for those that indulged. The only downside to this resort is that the adults side was mostly couples. And i went with my single ready to mingle girlfriends. Downtown is less then a 10 min cab ride, which usually cost us about 60 pesos about 7 dollars canadian. i recommend going to the board walk and the markets. Nonetheless i had the best time at this resort the staff really are amazing. especially hugo and pablo! any questions you needed answered they were there.

We arrived to Puerto Vallarta as scheduled and once we made it through mexican customs we arrived at the security screening with our carry-ons and went through with no issues, past the sea of people trying to sell time shares and excursions only to realize that we were supposed to have picked up our bags on the belt that was directly behind us when we were standing in the security line, THANKFULLY spanish is my native language, so after asking around to a few of the security and baggage claim people I was able to find someone to help me, but at a price of course he said we could either wait a few hours and get the bags delivered to us after going through security or if I tipped him he could get them right away, we rolled our eyes and tipped him $20 and magically our bags appeared. This incident kind of put a damper on our mood that is until we arrived at Secrets! As soon as we arrived at the gates we were impressed by this gorgeous stone waterfall, once we made it up the hill and stepped out of the van, we were immediately greeted by a few of the bellmen and served a wonderful cold glass of champagne and a cool towel for each of us. we were immediately impressed by the incredible view from the look out point in between the two main towers of Now Amber and Secrets. We then had a seat in the beautiful lobby and relaxed untill they were ready to check us in. As it turns out my 2 friends were staying in the Secrets part and I was in Now amber but I quickly took the upgrade of an extra $300 which is originally $500 but it was my friends birthday and they worked with me to get a better price. I am sure glad I did! As an adults only hotel I did not see any children on the Secrets side which is a huge advantage being a group of young single women we did not want to be bothered by other peoples screaming children. Once I arrive at my room I am absolutely stunned at how beautifully decorated it is and how comfortable I feel there, I had a garden view room but I could still see the ocean from my balcony which was absolutely amazing. The room had all of the modern comforts of home: flat screen tv, fully stocked mini bar, huge shower with the rain shower head, a large jet tub and gorgeous raised sinks, a in room safe, in room wifi, oh and I even had a phone in the small room where the toilet was located lol! We decided to get some food from carnival that night (buffet) since we were to hungry to wait and went back to our rooms to get ready for an evening out. We got ready and headed out to the Malecon which is a beautiful boarkwalk fully of shops restaurants and night clubs, after asking around a bit we were told \"Mandela\" was the place to be so we got in with no cover and hung out there for the rest of the evening, Now I will say I have been to cancun before around the same time of year and the club scene was a whole lot better then puerto vallarta, the nightlife here leaves alot to be desired and we didnt really here much of the music we were hoping to (reggaeton,bachata,salsa) it was more techno and house music that was played and there were not alot of single in puerto vallarta period!!! It seema to be more of a place for couples and families I would NOT suggest going there if you are looking for a party scene. So after trying a few different bars on a few differently nights we completely gave up on the nightlife and switch gears and decided to just relax and enjoy the resort. we enjoyed the pools at the resort especially one with the swim out bar which was our favorite, we even did the swim aerobics whicn was a great work out! and rode on horseback on the beach. We also had a chance to try himitsu and it was by far one of the best japanese restaurants ive ever been to it had gorgeous decor and the sushi was fabulous. we also decided to take a snorkelling tour through our aircanada advisor which was pretty inexpensive $65. The tour started at 9am and once we arrived at the marina we decided to invest in some mosquito spray because it was extremely buggy in the marina. Once we boarded the boat we were greeted by some wonderful crew members. Ive done snorkelling before in hawaii but my friends hadnt before so i kind of knew what to expect except this was much different then my previous experiences in that we were just off the coast of mariyettas island and they stopped the boat near the otherside where it is quite rocky and the current was quite strong so it was a bit scary. but we hopped in anyways, the water is quite cloudy and a bit difficult to see unlike hawaii and within about 10 minutes i felt a sting and didnt know what it was which kind of freaked me out so we headed back to the boat and once we boarded the boat we realised other people had been stung too and they brought out some sort of cortizone cream for us. Then they tell us it was probably a jellyfish and I was thinking wow thanks you couldnt tell us BEFORE we got into the water?? lol but I was ok after a few minutes and in all honesty i probably wouldnt have gotten in the water if i knew there were jellyfish. After that we kayaked around a bit and then boarded the boat, the best part of the tour was when they took us to the other side of mariyettas where there is a beach, it is one of the most beautiful ive ever seen in my life the weather was perfect and the sand was gorgeous. We spent a good hour and a half there and then boarded the boat again where we were greeted with an amazing buffet lunch (try the fresh tuna salad) and the crew entertained us with a great show :) Special thanks to carlos and carlos, juan luis, and the rest of the crew we had a great time! The rest of our trip was spent lounging and relaxing by the pool and enjoying the incredible food and drink oh and if you can definately do the theme nights were amazing the buffets were delicious and the entertainment was great!!! I want to thank everyone at Secrets for making our stay there absolutely incredible they work really hard to make you happy! Thank you HUGO, and PABLO the bellmen that always greeted us and were extremely helpful and friendly throughout our stay. I am extremely happy 5 star experience!!!!!

Even breakfast was served (not buffet, like Sandals) and was delicious. The Market Cafe was actually my favorite, but we also tried Bordeaux, Oceana, and Himatsu as well. Each one was almost empty so service was fast and attentive. My favorite was that they also had room service. If you wanted something not served in the restaurants, or you wanted to just stay in your room, or you wanted food at an odd hour, the room service took 30 minutes and they offered a lot of American foods (hamburger, chicken fingers) that weren't gourmet enough for the restaurants.
