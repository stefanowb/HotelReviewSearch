We happened to stay at the Blue Marlin a few nights before and called and asked if we could get two rooms for the entire week, not a problem. The rooms are spacious extremly clean and the folks working there are friendly and are there to please. I would highly recommend this motel. Its located a block from Duval and on the quite side of town. The beaches are close by (within walking or biking distance),but they have a great pool and poolside.

I talked with him a while as I checked in and he told me some local events I should check out and also told me I could park my bike in a spot where I could see it from my room. The room was very clean and large. It had two queen beds, double sink wet bar and a microwave fridge combo. They even thought to give a pack of microwave popcorn. It only cost them .50 cents to do this but I have been in very expensive hotels that didn't give me diddly! The morning breakfast was a well stocked counter of donuts, danishes, fruit, coffee, and juice. The even let me into the feast a little early since they already had it set up.
