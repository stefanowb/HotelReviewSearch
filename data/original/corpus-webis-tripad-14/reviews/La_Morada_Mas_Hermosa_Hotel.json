We have just returned from the most wonderful holiday in Spain at La Morada Mas Hermosa. As travellers used to something a little different, and away from the main drag, this hotel was perfect. We felt as though we had found the real spain. We stayed in the Suite Vera which was very reasonably priced and had lots of room - just like a little apartment with a lovely sunny balcony and sitting area too. The service was perfect, including delicious breakfasts delivered in baskets that we could take to our balcony, free internet access and my son was made to feel so special (with little chocolate treats left on his bed!) The built up bits of Marbella seem a long way away however the beaches are very close. We recommend Tapas Santiago for great food and a boat ride to Buerto Banus to see the yachts. Go to this hotel if you want to feel comfortable, relaxed and in the heart of a beautiful town.

We could have breakfast in the lounge, courtyard or in our room. We couldn't resist sitting in the warm winter sun having our breakfast on the terrace.
