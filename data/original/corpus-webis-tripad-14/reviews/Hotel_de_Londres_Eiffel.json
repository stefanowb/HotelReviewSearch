Only a minutes walk to the tower, and watching the light show each hour after dark from your own Paris rooftop room is pretty magical. There's something very beautiful about a traditional French rooftop. The staff on the reception desk were very accomodating and helpful in a 'French' manner (there's always that slight feeling of... can't quite decide if it's condescention or disapproval...!), but that's all part of the charm of Paris. It didn't spoil it for us, we were amused by it. The only low point was the 4 of us being \"shooed\" by the kitchen maid from a table for 4 to a tiny table really only big enough for 2, only to have the other table sit empty while we ate.

The breakfast was very poor and had very little choices, I think this is the way it is in most french hotels so it's probably not a particular problem to this one. The ladies who served breakfast spoke nothing but french, so if your french is not too good you might be in a bit of trouble. The reception staff was not particularly helpful to us. I agree with another reviewer who wrote that they cater to USA tourist here so that might have been the problem since we're not Americans. The location is the best thing about this hotel. There are also several restaurants in the area as well as 2 laundrymats and a supermarket just around the corner. They also have free wi-fe internet access which was a plus.

What a fabulous celebration it turned out to be! Upon our arrival at the hotel we found it to be quite charming. Arnaud greeted us warmly and directed us to our 6th floor room with a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. The room was quite small but immaculate. You have to understand that all hotel rooms (except the very expensive ones) are usually small. The mattress on the queen size bed was extremely comfortable. Our bathroom was a nice size and extremely clean. The only downside was the tiny shower. You have to pray that you don\u2019t drop the soap! But what does the size of the room and shower matter \u2013 you are in Paris!! The hotel was in a great location, especially for first time visitors. There were two bus stops very close to the hotel and we found that taking it was so easy. This way you get to see the sights instead of being underground in the subway. Every amenity you could possibly want was within a few blocks. There were grocery stores, bakeries, dry cleaners, wine stores and restaurants all right outside the hotel doors. Rue Cler (the market shopping street) was only a few blocks away. Our favorite little bakery was just up the street on Rue St. Dominique. Every morning my husband and I went there for our caf\u00e9 au lait and croissant. (M-M-M very delicious!) It was very charming and there were a few tables outdoors and inside. The prices were very reasonable. Almost every meal we had in Paris was excellent. We ventured out of the area we stayed in for every meal except the first night when we ate at the Le Fountaine de Mars which was just up the street from the hotel. It was very good and the people were very friendly. They didn\u2019t mind at all that our French was not the best. My husband had a duck with a port wine sauce and I had a delicious salmon with lemon sauce. A few nights later we ate at another terrific Italian place called Casa Bini located in St. Germain. Ask to be seated upstairs where it is a little more romantic. For our 30th Anniversary dinner we decided to go to Le Grand Colbert (the restaurant where \u201cSomething\u2019s Gotta Give\u201d was filmed). It was absolutely beautiful and the food and service were excellent. We can\u2019t wait to go back again. The profiteroles were to die for! On our last night in Paris we ate at another wonderful restaurant located on 73 rue de Seine in St. Germain called City Zen Caf\u00e9. It was a very tiny and cozy place with a spectacular roast duck breast with a plum sauce. I even thought it was delicious and I don\u2019t really enjoy duck. The cr\u00e8me brulee was a let down though. The only meal that we thought was awful was at a restaurant I found in the Access Paris tour book. It was called Relais Due Massif Central and was located near the Bastille. The waiter was rude and it didn\u2019t seem to matter that I had ordered steak because he decided that I had ordered veal and even though I ordered a banana tart he brought me chocolate cake instead. My husband ate the veal and said it was stringy and I thought the beef was very tough.

We stayed there recently and will definitely stay there again when we are in Paris. It was peaceful and quiet. We wondered if anyone else was staying there-they were. It gives on a small narrow street. The nice gentleman at the desk accommodated us with a request we made for a room with the view of the Eiffel Tower. We had a good laugh when we opened the window: we could only see the very top of it! But we didn't mind because we could walk over and see it's lighted spendor in the evening with its blue and white lights twinkling. The room was small but very comfortable:a small desk, a small closet on each side of the bed sufficient for 2 people. We slept in a large and comfortable queen size bed. The bathroom is modern and very clean but quite small. We had a shower stall and I'm glad that I lost 5 lbs before our trip. If you are tall and a little overweight ask for a tub. I would have given the hotel 5 stars but I gave it only 4 because of the size of the bathroom. The hotel is near Rue Cler: a pedestrian street filled with cafes,boutiques and a dry cleaner who will do a large wash for the modest sum of 10 Euros and no shrinkage. Au Bon Marche on Rue Cler is a bistrot that serves very good food at reasonnable prices. The people working there are very nice and friendly. The metro stop for the hotel is Ecole Militaire. If you stop at La Motte Piquet you will have a long walk but that's nice too if you're not too tired.Bon Voyage", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Escargot21", "date": "November 13, 2008", "id": 21827367}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I visited Paris for the first time in September and we pretty much got what we expected at this hotel.
