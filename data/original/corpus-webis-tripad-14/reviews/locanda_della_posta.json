This rests atop a large hill off from which run many small streets. The Locanda is on that main street so you cannot have a better location. The hotel is beautifully done, intimate and comfortable with medium sized rooms and excellent bathrooms tastefully executed. Ask for one with views of the main street. The hotel is not formal or stuffy which is a plus in a small town like the old section of Perugia.

On a minor point, front desk staff did not exude the warm friendliness we are used to encountering in Italian hotels and can best be described as polite and businesslike.

That's the main attraction to Locanda Della Posta. You are right in the old city, steps away from all the action, including the churches and great restaurants of Perugia. We loved walking outside to all this. The hotel itself was good but not great. I have a problem with Trip Advisor in that there is no way you can give a hotel like this 5 circles as compared to the best luxury hotels of Perugia. This is a faded hotel that isn't posh and is a bit rough around the edges. Actually, the only reason I gave it 4 circles and not three circles is for its great location.
