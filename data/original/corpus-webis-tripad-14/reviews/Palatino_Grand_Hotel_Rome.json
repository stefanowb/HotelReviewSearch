I am extremely fussy but would recommend this hotel. Found the hotel overall to be ideally located as it was only a ten minute walk from the Termini train stn and then we spent the weekend walking round central Rome sightseeing. The colosseum is less than five minutes away ! The hotel was very well presented and the rooms a very good size with lovely fluffy white towels in the bathroom and pristine crisp white sheets on the bed. The only down side i found to our room was a very firm mattress, something i am not use to and there was no tea/coffee facilities in the room but there was a mini bar which we used to chill our own drinks. The hotel breakfast was an excellent buffet with a great choice of hot and cold food (scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, cheeses,salmon,fruit,cereal and pastries) Didnt try the hotel restaurant at night as there are lots of choices right outside the hotel (Indian, Chinese and Italian) not to forget a very friendly irish bar at the rear of the hotel.
