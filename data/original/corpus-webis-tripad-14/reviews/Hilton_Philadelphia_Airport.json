I had asked to sit by the window and was cautioned that the area is used by the waitstaff for the bar. Our table had to to reset, since it was missing utensils. After traveling and room problems, all I wanted was to sit, relax, enjoy a cocktail and then order dinner.

He sat down at 8:45 and placed his order. The food was fair. I ordered my steak with no butter/oil or salt or pepper. It came out with a seasoning and had a good amount of fat. I wanted a baked potato but the only 'starch' being offered was mashed potatoes-actually they tasted like they were mashed twice baked potatoes, very heavy on the cheese.

All hotels in Philadelphia downtown were either booked up or running $300 a night. This Hilton was reasonable @ $179. Distance to the city is roughly 25 mins by taxi ($28-$30). The hotel itself is nice but appears dated. It's a little \"darker\" & more stuck in the 90's than your average Hilton. The room itself was spacious enough and relatively up-to-date. Restaurant food was good but expensive. My only complaint with this hotel is that the walls are paper thin. Don't expect to sleep in because the doors start slamming at 6 AM, if not earlier. I was on the 13th floor and away from the elevators. Neither helped with the noise. As a business traveler, that needs to be fixed for a restful night. Maybe ask for an extra blanket and stuff it under the gap of the door. Other than that, the hotel has all the conveniences away from home. Staff was friendly overall.
