It was a fine resort. Clean. The hotel was nice (block#100 is very average, Block #200 & #300 have a view of the garden and some ocean. Block #400 & #500 have a view of the pool) The food was average. The buffet was open from 7-10 am, 12-2pm for luch and 7-9pm for dinner. At 4pm there was some small snack too. Bars are open all day at different locations so you can get drinks all the time. At 12- 2pm luch was also available at the beach. A cook prepared a barbeque hamburger and really really good fries. This was a great change from the buffet since the food there was very repetative. You could also make reservations for dinner at \"the grill\" It was also a barbeque kind of meal. For extra $ you could purchase lobsters and shrimps. I liked that place because, once again, it was a change from the buffet. The entertaiment was good. Not so much during the day but the night shows were good. The staff were friendly. Some bartenders were slow but if you tiped them, they were much faster. There was a 10 sec. walk to the beach. The ocean bottom was rocky, so bring your water shoes. There were spots with sand excellent for snorkling because there was a lots of beautiful fish to look at. Overall we loved our vacations, meet a lot of great people. Some young, some old. The week of our stay there was a lot more older people than younger. We were on a budget. This was a great deal. I would recomend this resort to those who are looking for a nice resort but do not want to spend too much $.", "title": "Great Vacation !", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "awesome_tripCanada", "date": "April 15, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3366251}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005", "text": "TIPS:", "title": "This is posted for Club Amigo-Los Corales as well.", "helpfulness": 26, "user": "shastadaisy1", "date": "April 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3364679}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent deal, total relaxation", "text": "- Bring your own big cup, drinks are served in very small cups.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 13, 2005", "id": 3355688}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "We loved the place", "text": "- Bring pens, t-shirts, hats, soap etc. to give out to staff as tips.

Cluba Amigo is 5 minutes down the beach. We did share the same beach but they had their own facilities as did we. I can't say anything bad about Club Amigo, I did visit the disco one night and there was about 10 people in the whole place. Most nights, guests from Club Amigo would visit the Los Corales disco on the beach.
