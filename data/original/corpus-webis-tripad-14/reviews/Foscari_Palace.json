Nonetheless, this was more expensive than either of those, so I would expect this to be on par. Our first problem was the service, which was at best, cold, and at worst, really frustrating. On a few occassions we asked for advice on how to get somewhere, or whether reservations would be needed, and always we were met with indifference. When we needed an extra pillow, we were treated as if we had asked for the most difficult thing in the world. As others mentioned, the jacuzzi bath did not work, so i expected that, but one night we lost hot water altogether- not even at a time you would expect many to be using it- and again we were treated as if were out of line to inquire when the water may be working again. The bed was uncomfortable, and not because it was a typically firmer european mattress, but rather, it felt just like a very cheap motel mattress. The beds (twins adjoined) would slide across the floor every time you got up or down. My husband and I would wake in the morning with a foot gap between our beds (which was funny but annoying) Finally, the worst part was breakfast. I understand that Italians dont eat hot breakfast like americans, but that wasnt the problem at all- I had come to love having a caprese or other simple breakfast. Here, the hot selections were fine, but the items you would expect to be good in italy were not. I had the worst mozerella here, the meats were very tough, and the breads were subpar. One morning, after giving up on those items, i just had some cereal. After i dumped milk on it and in my coffee, I began to smell something- the milk was completely soured!! Luckily, there was another pitcher of milk out, but my suspicion is that the urn that held the milk was not refrigerated the night before.
