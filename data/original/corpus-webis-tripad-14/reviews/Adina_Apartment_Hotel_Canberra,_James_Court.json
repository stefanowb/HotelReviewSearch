We were on the second floor overlooking the swimming pool. The heat exchange units for the airconditioning were secured flush to the balcony wall and therefore gave any young child a perfect climbing aid to be on a level with the railing and therefore a potentially lethal drop to the pool two stories below. Even adults sitting on the higher of the two units would have cause to be very careful.
