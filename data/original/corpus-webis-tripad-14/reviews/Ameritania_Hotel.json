I am a native New Yorker who now lives in the midwest and have been coming back to the city for business and pleasure for 30+ years. Consequently I have stayed in many hotels around midtown and the Ameritania is by far my favorite. The location is great. The rooms are clean and comfortable. As with any large city hotel there are the occasional problems but the staff is excellent at fixing any problem in a quick and effcient manner. The service is first rate. The staff is friendly, helpful, competant, and knowledgeable. Everyone is great but I especially need to single out Sylvia, Indira, and Erin at the Front Desk and Jeff and Mario of the bellmen. They have always gone the extra mile for me. I've read the critical comments posted on the site and I must say that my experience over the last decade vehemently contradicts any of the little complaints I have read.

The location was where we wanted, just off Times Square which is great. The room was small, again couldn't complain about that. However, what I am mega peeved about is that at check out I wasn't informed of the 4 dollars that I would be charged to my credit card for no reason. We didn't even drink the water in the room. I have emailed several occasions, the main groups website etc etc etc and haven't even got a single response. It's not even the amount of money that's the point, more so the principle of the situation and how many millions of people have they done this too. A tidy profit for them.
