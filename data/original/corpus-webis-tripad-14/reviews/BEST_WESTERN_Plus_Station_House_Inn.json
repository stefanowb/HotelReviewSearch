The room was tiny, with a king bed, two chairs, table, desk, wardrobe all crammed into one tiny room. There was no where to put our cases because of this and there was a person's width of space either side of the bed. The wardrobe was rammed up against the sink which was positioned outside of the bathroom in a small 'alcove'. We were fooled at first regarding the size, due to the huge mirror positioned on the far wall, giving the impression of a double room.
