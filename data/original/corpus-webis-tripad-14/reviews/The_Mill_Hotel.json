It was warm outside and even hotter Inside. The hotel rooms are quite large and the beds comfortable but the ceilings are low and the lack of air con or other ventilation makes for a rather uncomfortable night's sleep. We were on the second floor and could open the window but it did make for more noise and smells from the kitchen chimney vent below! The Windows were frosted glass, so you couldn't see out of them anyway. The breakfast was fine and the staff correct. I found the hotel rather impersonal but probably good enough value for money. Good parking and internet connection. The fridge in the room was also a bonus.
