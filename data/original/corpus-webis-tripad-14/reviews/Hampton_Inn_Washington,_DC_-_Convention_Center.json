There were a large number of what I believe were urban high school students also staying at the hotel.

As annoying and sometimes scary as this sounds, the hotel staff were very responsive (security always arrived immediately). We also saw a group of them outside with police talking to them. The only disappointment I felt was that we experienced the same problems every day.

Luckily it was only for a few days. Chalk one up for not reading the fine print (if there were). I should have assumed due to the location that parking would be scarce, right in Chinatown. We stayed there from June 6-9. The rooms were indeed nice for $239 a night price tag Wed and Thur night. Friday night went down to $139. Beds were queen size, plush with lots of pillows. AIr conditioning was great- I really needed that. Large room, large bathroom with marble counter.The view overlooked Chinatown. The people were friendly, the complimentary breakfast was excellent with hot eggs and sausage. Customer service was good. I called in for toiletries and they promptly brought it up. Location was everything. 2 blocks from the D.C. Chinatown Metro station and Chinatown itself, with lots of shops and restaurants. Go eat at Tony Cheng's Seafood Restaurant, best in D.C. and de-lish. I recommend the salted fish and diced chicken fried rice. Doesn't sound good but just try it! A staple of Cantonese cuisine. We couldn't ask for a better location. Just know that it won't be cheap, but hey this is the northeast and nothing is cheap. All in all, one of the best places you could stay at in D.C.
