Although the building is not spectacular from the outside, the interior appears to be genuine 19th century style, with lots of antique furniture. The location is quiet and relaxing. The room was well equipped for a three star hotel, had a side view of the lake of Geneva including the top of Chillon castle and also of the motorway viaduct (there is only faint emission that does not disturb). The television screen is a bit small. No elevator, so if you have difficulties to climb stairways a ground floor room is recommended. A nice garden with deckchairs. Lovely lounge and terrace. Breakfast buffet good quality. Very friendly, helpful staff and management (owners). There is a private parking lot with limited space, and if the hotel is full, a parking place has to be found in the vicinity (there are a few but not many). The bus stop is a two minute walk downwards (upwards4 minutes, as quite steep).

The one major negative, however, was that the hotel was at the top of a very steep incline, which I know is a common occurrence seeing as how its Switzerland, but nonetheless, at the end of a long day touring the country, the last thing I wanted to do was to take that painful walk uphill and then climb 3 flights of stairs to get to my room! If you're only staying a couple of days, it'll be fine, but I was there for 6! It was quite a workout. However, the view of Lake Geneva from the hotel terrace more than made up for that walk!
