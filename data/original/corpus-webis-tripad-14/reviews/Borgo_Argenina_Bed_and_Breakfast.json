I then made the best decision of my traveling life and rearranged my entire schedule and stayed booked three nights. I am sorry that it wasnt' more. An ideal location for seeing Tuscany and the Chianti. Plus calm beauty of bringing home a few bottles form the nearby vineyards and spending each afternoon on the patio overlooking the fields and vines with a glass of wine and usually some cheese and cold cuts purchase in Gaiole. Elane and her daughter the best consierges with great info on where to eat, wineries and nearby sights. Can't wait to get back in 2012.

Neither of us could have anticipated how wonderful our time would be there. Borgo Argenina is not your typical B&B. Elena Nappa, the owner and hostess, is an artist and has created a very charming, authentic haven. Every detail was decided by her. The paintings on the walls, the furniture, quilts, plates, glasses were all picked for their connection to the area. When we arrived,she greeted us as if we were family. She then brought us up to her beautifully authentic Tuscan kitchen, poured us a glass of wine and gave us \u2019the talk\u2019 we had read so much about. Elena has drawn out a map of the area for all her guests to use, with pictures of the places she recommends visiting. She wants visitors to experience the real Tuscany and if you follow her direction, you will not be disappointed. We drove all through the Chianti region, and also more south through the Crete areas to see frescos in churches, small hamlets, wineries, and unbelievable views. Rolling hills, deep colors, morning mist, evening sunsets took our breath away. Every morning we awoke to open our window and see such brilliance. Down in the breakfast room we were always greeted by the two canine hostesses, Pasqualina and Giuseppina, who are just as much a part of this B&B as Elena. New on the scene is little Liugi, the cat...who cuddles on your lap and drives the two dogs crazy with jealousy! Guest at the Borgo somehow instantly become your friends and soon you are going out to dinner, or visiting a winery with them. Emails are exchanged, invitations are issued, and friendships begin. This is the atmosphere that is the Borgo Argenina. While there, nothing is al la carte. Each day your small room refrigerator is refilled with water and juice, etc., wine is poured, and food abounds. If you are lucky enough to stay there when Elena cooks dinner, this is extra, but so worth it! When we left we continued our journey to the Amalfi Coast, beautiful as it was, it just wasn\u2019t Tuscany. If you have the opportunity to stay at the Borgo Argenina you would surely consider yourselves fortunate.", "title": "Heaven on Earth ...", "user": "Carri B", "date": "October 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 83852235}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Wow, we are back about a week from our wonderful trip to Italy and France and I can say that hands down, Borgo Argenina and our wonderful host Elena, were the highlight of our trip!

Little quirks like one low original doorway, barn door locks on the rooms, a family of barn swallows building a next inside the entry hall and flying in and out, and a wysteria draped arbor with a table looking at the fields just added to the charm. There is no air conditioning or pool but it was cool at night (~low 60's) and warm and dry by day (~80's).

When we reserved, the cancellation policy was clearly spelled out and if we changed our itinerary for some reason, I would not expect a host of a little bed and breakfast like this to refund our money. Elena honored our reservation and discount as she promised. She can seem disorganized at times which I think comes from having a lot going on, and you may need to reconfirm some things with her, but we had no problems. The second common theme was Elena's attitude. As I said, she is passionate about trying to give her guests an authentic experience of a way of life that is dwindling and being homogenized out of existence. She is an energetic person, definitely has opinions, and tries to steer you the best things she believes in, but is more than happy to help you, gives you an artistic & accurate roadmap & describes places not to miss, best eateries, castles, etc..
