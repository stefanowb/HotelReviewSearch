We (my wife and 2 young daughters) like Hampton Inns because they usually provide good value for the money. The Hampton Inn San Marcos lived up to our expectations. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff pleasant and accomodating. Free breakfast typical of the chain (better than most other hotels but not as good as Embassy Suites). We had planned for two nights, and wanted to stay an extra day at the last minute. A quick call to the front desk from the Legoland parking lot made it easy. Location is 10 minutes from Legoland, and 30 minutes to San Diego Zoo. We would stay here again, if we wanted a hotel convenient for both northern and southern San Diego attractions.", "title": "Good hotel for Legoland and San Diego Zoo", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "onshortfinal", "date": "July 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8208799, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 bedding and pillows, very clean bathroom"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007", "text": "Stayed 2 nights late June, 2007.

The bed was especially comfortable, and I really appreciated the nice linens. The breakfast area was kept spotlessly clean, well attended, and the woman who does this deserves accolades. They even offer brown bag breakfast to go for those who have no time to linger in the dining area. My one tiny criticism is that the hot breakfast food that is offered, such as scrambled eggs, is not very tasty, since it appears to be a product that is quickly and easily prepared with minimal kitchen facilities and staff. However, there is such a wide variety of other breakfast food, that this hardly matters except for those people who like a traditional breakfast of eggs and meat.
