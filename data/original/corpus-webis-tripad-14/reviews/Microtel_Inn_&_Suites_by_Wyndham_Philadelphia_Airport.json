Due to a late arrival, I only had time to check-in, drop bags off and dash out. I returned to my room in the early morning hours, exhausted and ready to sleep. There were so many bugs in the room. Some dead, some living. They were on the beds and all flat surfaces. I called the front desk to request another room. The man there said that he couldn't help me. I asked for a refund. Again I was told that he couldn't help me. He went on to say that I'd have to wait for a manager to come in. I went downstairs to talk to him only to find him with his feet propped up on the counter, singing at the top of his lungs. I wondered about his sobriety. When I began to speak to him, he laughed at me and accused me of bringing the bugs in. Really??? He went on to say that his computer showed my room was complimentary so no refund was warranted. Really??? Refund or no refund, I wasn't willing to stay there another minute. Upon calling the next morning, I spoke with a woman who assured me that a refund would be given but I have no resolution as yet. When I say never, I mean never again! My mistake was to have not read the reviews.", "title": "Terrible and dirty", "user": "gonzalea", "date": "August 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 138474879}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel is dirty.
