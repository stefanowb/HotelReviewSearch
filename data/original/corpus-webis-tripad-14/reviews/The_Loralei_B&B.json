We found the property to be very 'homey' and pleasant when away form our own home during the Holiday Season. Robert was an excellent and very helpful host. The B&B was very well maintained and extremely clean. As a highlight each morning, we enjoyed the breakfast. Robert served a very good variety of fresh fruits and baked goods, with new and different items each morning. When you live away from NYC, it is always a treat to get back for good bagels at breakfast and Robert served a fresh assortment each morning. We will certainly consider another visit to the Loralei on a future visit to the NYC area.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 23, 2006", "id": 4372129}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "B&B with gracious host", "text": "My friend and I much enjoyed staying at the Loralei. Robert was an extremely gracious host, with whom we also enjoyed talking at length about all kinds of interesting things. Lovely big room (the Gramercy Suite), with a spacious bathroom. Breakfast was generous and always fresh. The only (very minor) downside was that we tended to be woken up fairly early in the morning because of creaking floors.

The Lorelei met our every need, from the air conditioned rooms, to the charming breakfast, the clean & pleasant bathroom, and relatively easy parking on the streets. We had the suite with the sitting room and that allowed for reading after one of us had gone to bed. Our host could not have been more delightful and we found that with two keys it was very easy to come and go at all hours. This was our first time driving in Brooklyn and we ended up using the car often to get to sights and meet up with our son. Parking is pretty straightforward if you read the signs and we certainly had no problems parking near the Lorelei. And the subway is nearby for when you want to go into Manhattan. But with places like the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and interesting ethnic restaurants Brooklyn is a destination worth visting all in itself.

Prices compared to the mid-range (zillion rooms and bad tripadvisor.com reviews) hotels in central Manhatten, but we stayed in the suite, and had a very spacious, comfortable bedroom (with truly excellent matresses - and I have a bad back so I notice these things), a separate sitting room (fab in the evening for chilling with a bottle of wine), and well-set-up bathroom. It was spotless, comfy without being at all scary and fluffy and our host - you cannot get better. Robert was informative, chatty, and went out of his way to fulfil our slightly bizzare requests for NY info. Plus, he noticed we were pigging all the fruit every morning, and provided heaps more.
