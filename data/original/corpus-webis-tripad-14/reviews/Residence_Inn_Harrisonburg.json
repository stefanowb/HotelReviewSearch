I have been a gold member for years and this property treated us top notch. The property itself is excellent! The purpose of my stay was a overnight stop-over to South Carolina to attend my Grandmothers funeral. A friend of mine accompanied me for driving and moral support. As soon as we arrived at this property for the stop over, Savanna and Elle made us feel welcomed. One of them even came from around the \"check-in\" desk and stood next to us to explain all the amenities of the property. That was a great touch! I then explained to them the purpose of my trip and they were genuinely caring and expressed to me that they would make our stay as comfortable as possible. They even took the time to write a hand written sympathy card to our family and slipped it under our door! Savanna nor Elle were there when we checked out, but I want them to know that their kindness, helpfulness and caring made a HUGE difference in the trip to my Grandmothers funeral in SC. I don't know if they knew what impact they had on me. Thanks Savanna and Elle! Keep doing what you do!
