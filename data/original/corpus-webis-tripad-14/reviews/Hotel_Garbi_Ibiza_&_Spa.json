U will also feel very safe there - all teh corridors have cctv that is on view at reception (we had noticed other hotels on here that were rife with thefts!! - I frequently left money and valuables in the hotel room and not a penny was touched). Bora Bora is about a 3 minute walk down the beach, a further 10 minutes is a stunning beach side retaurant that's all white linen and does gorgeous food and isn't too pricey altho i did find a 2.5k bottle of wine. D'en Bossa is about 20 mins in a taxi from San Antonio but to be honest it's worth it. Also, if you're planning to go to Space it's in D'en Bossa so that saves a taxi anyway. Woudl seriously recommend teh restaurant BamBudah Grove - again, 15 mins in taxi from anywhere as it's kind of in the middle of nowhere but it's really worth seeing. Will defo be back and probably stay at this 4* hotel which absolutely deserves it's 4*'s. Only one thing, we didn't love the food but I guess buffet's are never that great. It was clean and well cooked and at night you woudl usually find at least one really nice thing like a steak or spare ribs - we didn't mind so much because the price difference between room only and half board was so little we figured it was worth it to go half board and eat out as well.
