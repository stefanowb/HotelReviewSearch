The bed and breakfast is located on the side of a gorgeous mountain and just outside your window is a breathtaking view of the snow-capped Alps. You can go hiking for hours and also do some mushroom hunting if you like. The owners/family of the bed and breakfast are the most charming people you meet, full of enriching and intelligent conversation, cheerful songs, bright smiles, and open arms. Our experience at Bella Baita was unforgettable and we have decided to visit again, hopefully very often.

The nature around this Val Grandubione and the seven-bridge hike is just fantastic. So a great place to spend your holiday with 4 kids. Aged 14,13,9,6. A small kitchen for an afternoon break whilst enjoying the view, a nice patio for a glass of wine in the evening under the starts in the sky it is all possible at Bella Baita. The three rooms were nice and clean with spectacular views. The Fenestrelle fortification tour, the 13 lake hike, a cycle ride from Val Chisone and walks around a nice old village are just a few things to do.

The food prepared by Marla and Fabrizio was so good - freshly prepared every evening and always very appetizing. We really enjoyed eating with our hosts whom we felt we got to know well and who gave us excellent advice on places to visit and things to do as well as background information on the local area and region. Our visits to Prali, Usseaux, Sestiere, Pinarolo, all within 40 mins drive time worked out really well. Walking in the local hills and valleys was lovely and so relaxing.

I saw the reviews on Bella Baita and decided to go for it. Our expectations were far exceeded! After the slight shock of driving up all the hair pin bends to reach the rustic mountain house, we were warmly greeted by the perfect hosts Marla and Fabrizio - relaxed, genuine, clearly experts at catering for all the needs of their guests. We slept well every night...a combination of healthy days out in the mountains, our hosts wonderful cooking (beautifully prepared but with no fuss) and the local digestivo. Our room at Bella Baita was fairly basic but waking up to sunrise over the Alps and even a rainbow one morning was compensation enough. Highlights were walking around the quaint village of Usseaux and the day out in Prali with views from the mountain top, reached by the ski lifts. Also the trip to the wine area, where we stumbled across a wine festival and enjoyed tasting the Barolo. Mum commented one day that it was the most beautiful place she'd ever seen and the next day it was even more beautiful! Having enjoyed views ranging from the Whitsunday Islands in Australia to the Scilly Isles, this is high praise! Every day, we got a personalised recommendation from our hosts - over breakfast with freshly baked pastries - suggesting where we might like to go. We enjoyed meeting other guests over dinner and breakfast and received some inspiring cooking lessons.
