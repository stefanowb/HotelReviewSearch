We stayed for 5 nights, occupying two of the 5 rooms. The refurbished property - comprising the house, walled courtyards and gardens, and pool area - was great. The hosts were very helpful and informative about ttd regionally. The immediate surrounds and grounds/orchard outside the walled areas were unkempt. The nearby village - relative to those in the region - is quite ordinary and ok for basics. Other comments would include:- 1. the breakfast starts from 9 am - in this region they pull stumps for siesta at noon till around 4pm, so by the time you've eaten brekkie etc and travelled its 10 to 10.30...just not enough time to get tuned in or get anything achieved etc esp if you are a first timer. 2. the breakfast itself was basic, fixed, and very monotonous...a slice of melon, 2 pieces of fr bread, one croissant and jam per person...every day. 3. No tv, no radio, no kettle/tea. 4. The rooms were spacious and very tastefully and appropriately done but the facilities were a tad on the spartan side. 5. Wi-fi is available but does not reach most rooms (and not the ones we were in of course!). 6. The lighting in the rooms is very subdued ..to the extent that you can just read in bed, but not if sitting on the couch for example. 7. The night time lighting in the carpark area and within some of the walled areas is nil/very poor. Its dark at night esp in rural areas! 8. The hot water delivery and overall water pressure in the shower and basin reduced to a persistent dribble in 'peak' times in one room.", "title": "Good - with areas for improvement", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DebJD", "date": "October 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 21091623}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "mas pomona a piece of \"France Profonde\" from M & S Beck Sydney Australia", "text": "We spent a fantastic few days at Mas Pomona early October in time to experience the autumn ambience of crisp mornings, sunny days and evenings spent by a roaring fireplace in the property's communal dining area/food preparation area.The autumn colours really enhaced the picturesque village of Cheval Blanc and the surrounding areas of the Luberon.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 18, 2008", "id": 20992507}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "David and Marianne were wonderful hosts who were a goldmine of information on places to visit, scenic drives and excellent places to eat.
