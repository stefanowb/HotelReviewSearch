Best of all, the drinks were free for two-hours and, uniquely, were served in an attractive bar by a waitress staff. The breakfast was also free, unlimited, and excellent. The exercise facility was also free and more than adequate. (Parking, however, cost $7) The downside: the \"broadband\" internet, which while also free, was atrocious. As measured by speedtest.net, the up and download speeds were about 0.5 mb/sec (10 mb/sec would be good) and the ping (i.e. response time) was and unbelievably poor 1100 ms (good would be 60 ms). At that level of speed and response, one can barely send and receive emails and surf simple web papers. Trying to do anything else (like access complex web pages), is simply impossible.

The hotel was crowded with some sort of youth baseball tourney, which was the only real downside to our stay. Wait times for elevators was exceedingly long, often because the baseball boys were racing each other in elevators on either corner of the open atrium. Even with the crowds, though, the hotel was quiet at night, and the pool was never so crowded that our kids didn't want to swim. We went to an I-Cubs game and the stadium is an easy (and nice) walk down the river. The free breakfast is really nice, although again because of the crowds the lines were long and the buffet was often out of some items.
