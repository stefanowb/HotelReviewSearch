The hotel was easy to find. Check in was smooth and the 2 bedroom apartment was immaculate. The staff certainly went the extra-mile. There was a rubber ducky in the tub, chocolate truffles at bedtime, milk in the fridge for tea and coffee and an xbox to borrow one evening so my husband and I could enjoy the cocktail bar. Victoria park nearby is great for running and the staff recommended an excellent nearby pub for pizza and ice-cream. The pool was an added bonus for the kids and my husband thought the gym was very well equipped. I have never been moved to write a review before but this place deserves it. We have already made several recommendations to friends planning trips and hope to visit again soon.", "title": "Amazing oasis in the city", "user": "macdonmj", "date": "July 22, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115654886}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "I love this neighborhood.
