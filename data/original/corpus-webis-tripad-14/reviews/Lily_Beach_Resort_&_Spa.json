The resort itself is of a very high standard. Our room was cleaned twice a day. We stayed in a Beach Villa which was fabulous as you get to experience the sand and the sea! It was situated between the beautiful trees and shrubs, with a view of the famously blue water. A must do: The ocean adventure. This is not included as a free excursion and costs $150 per person, but it's well worth it! We snorkeled with Manta Rays and a massive whale shark! An unforgettable experience. The fish are amazing! Tip: Put lots of sunscreen on your back if you enjoy snorkeling - hours facing down in the water can cause a bit of a problem if you are fair skinned. The sunsets... Make sure you go to the Aqua Bar around 5:30 to get your cocktail and watch the sun go down! Overall, this resort is fabulous, and the staff's attention to detail is worth praising. Sena (At the bar) - thanks for my wonderful Pina Coladas! The best I ever had. And to Briam, who attended our Villa, it was 5 star!
