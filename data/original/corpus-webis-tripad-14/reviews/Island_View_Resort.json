The only minor downsides were the beds were hard and you weren't supposed to put any toilet paper down the loo.

This hotel is well laid out with lovely gardens and water features and our room was spacious. However, the bathroom was in need of some refurbishment with the bath being quite degrained. We also had brown water for two days but this was sorted after being reported. I am not a fan of all inclusive hotels and the SIV is a prime example why. The food was very mediocre and apart from the freshly cooked pasta was generally on the cold side. A few trips to Naama Bay were called for to get a decent meal. The service I found to be very slow and can only think that they are trying to minimise the amount of food/drink that is distributed by slowing the service. These guys wouldn't last long in Starbucks !!! As i've stated above, this hotel is wasting it's potential as it requires a good bit of refurbishment and a rehash of the catering regime. This is in no way a 5 star hotel. I stayed in the Hyatt Regency in Sharm last April and that is more like it. On the plus side, the New Year gala evening was quite good and showed that the catering staff could put on a good show when presented with a better standard of raw material.

After having been to other all inclusive hotels in other countries I can say that this is not a 5* hotel. The grounds are fantastic, the rooms are tired and the food is very average. The problem with the food was that it was never really hot. After speaking with the hotel manager several times he agreed that they were trying to remedy this as it was a general complaint from the English. It seems the Russians, of which there were many, never complain about the food and that is all they do all day - eat and drink! A lot of people were very ill with 'the runs'. In fact the pharmacy across the road from the hotel ran out of their remedy for this. The entertainment was very amusing, pity it wasn't meant to be!! The snorkeling was excellent off the jetty which is just off the man made beach of the hotel. It may be handy for the airport (ten minutes away) but at times it felt like we were sleeping on the runway, the noise was so loud from the aircraft. The staff were very pleasant and helpful but very understaffed in the restaurants.
