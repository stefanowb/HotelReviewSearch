I stayed on the second floor. When you exit the elevator the entire 2nd floor hallway smells like it's a smoking floor. But it's not over yet. Once you exit the hallway to enter your room the smell is instantly replaced by an equally strong musky mildew odor. I changed rooms on the second floor and both rooms had the same strong order. So when I would return to the hotel after work and exit the elevator the double tap was too much for me. I had to go to another hotel.", "title": "If it weren't for the smells", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Chase71", "date": "October 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 47916318}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Otherwise, if you stay on the 1st floor, or the 3rd floor is better and the rooms don't smell the hotel is decent.
