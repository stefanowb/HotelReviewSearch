You can access it thru the Westin Hotel across the street . For those that want to drive to Dawn Beach , The Westin has made a right-of-way that is government sanctioned for the public to access the beach. You drive thru the gate between the white fence and the Westin parking garage to the very back (almost to the beach ). There are 9 parking spots there for the public. You just walk around the building 10 meters and you are on Dawn Beach . We walked to Dawn Beach from Princess Heights because the access is so easy , directly across the street, about 500 barefoot steps. We also found that the Westin has brought some wonderful amenities to Princess Heights without having all the added \"guests\" around . ( the Westin has 310 guest rooms ) We hit the Dawn Beach casino everynight and their bar . We also shopped at the Westins Little Switzerland shop and ate at their restaurants , but were always able to retreat to our nice little quiet slice of heaven at Princess Heights . We got all the benefits of using the Westin without actually having to stay there . There is still light construction going on from 8am-5pm in the Dawn Beach area at the Westin and Princess Heights , but it did not bother us .
