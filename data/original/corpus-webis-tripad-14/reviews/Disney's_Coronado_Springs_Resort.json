There are hammocks on the beach (you cannot swim in the water) and yes we diid use the hammocks twice.

I got married last summer and planned a different vacation formy hubby & I but next year, we'll be going on huge family vacation to this resort. The food is fabulous and the environment is so happy and wonderful! The arcade is a HUGE plus for kids and even by the check-in counter where there's a movie playing with crayons and paper for kids to color which is great! The pool is so large and beautifully landscaped! It can be a little difficult to get too with the large lake in the middle of the resort if you're on the other side of the pool area however, the feet paddle boats are fun! There are always enough chairs at the pool, even in the midddle of the summer!! Cell phone reception is not too good but who cares!?!??! You're at DISNEY!!!! Needless to say, I can't wait to return!

Fortunately, there was an employee outside when we drove up who told us not to take our luggage into the lobby. However, we weren't told that we should check it in and have it delivered to our room -- so we ended up having to hike our luggage a good long block or so, because the parking areas at the buildings containing the rooms are not really close to the buildings. Our visit started on the wrong foot when our non-smoking room smelled like an ashtray. After offering to spray the room, they did move us to another which had no odor problems.
