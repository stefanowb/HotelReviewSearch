We had a Golden Junior suite in buidling 8, the great thing about this room we could hear the ocean and left our balcony door open at night. The food was what I would expect, everything was good but found at the staek house the meat to be excellent but the sides were cold. The beach and pool were fantastic.

This is quite a large resort with around 14 buildings or so of hotel rooms. The grounds are absolutely beautifully cared for and the iguanas and coatis are fun to watch when they come out to sun themselves and play. When we checked in, we were offered an upgrade at a discount, but after several minutes of my asking questions about it, they ended up offering it for free which was very appreciated and a nice bonus. It was a room in one of the beach buildings(13). It was on the first floor so it didn't have a view of the beach because of the vegetation buffer between the building and beach, but it was a quick walk down to the beach where we would take our room service coffee and enjoy the early morning view.

We have not been on many vacations, however we are extreme foodies and I plan my vacations around where I want to eat. And usually that\u2019s all I remember about my vacation was my memorable meals. This was our first resort type vacation. We are not people who love to be around crowds. I would rather not go anywhere than go on a cruise. And with those two things being said we were never once disappointed by The Valentin. We were told it was at 97% full and never once did we wait for a meal or feel we could not get a pool chair nor did we feel it was too loud or crowded. We were only staying 4 short days. We decided we didn\u2019t want to overstay if we didn\u2019t like the resort type vacation but we were so sorry when it came time to leave. We didn\u2019t get to try half of the restaurants and were just figuring out how things worked when it was time to go. SO do yourself a favor & go for at least a week. We have already booked next year and I can\u2019t wait. We stayed Jan 5-9 and the weather was the best. We just ended up with a regular room in Bldg 4. We loved it though. I was really hoping for an upgrade when we were there, they never offered, I asked but they didn\u2019t really respond. I\u2019m guessing because it was full. I loved the location of our building, close to everything. Rooms were clean & we noticed no damage, no smell. I never missed the upgraded rooms like I thought I would.
