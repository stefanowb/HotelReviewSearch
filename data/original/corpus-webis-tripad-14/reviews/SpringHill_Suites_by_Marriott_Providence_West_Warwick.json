The hotel was perfect for our family of three. The pull out sofa was comfortable as was our king mattress. The shower was great. Having the internet in the lobby with nearby table and chairs, was a perfect work place for our teen to write a paper for school. Though there was a nice indoor pool, we were too busy to use it. There was 24/7 coffee, tea and hot chocolate which complemented the excellent breakfast in the morning. I highly recommend this hotel and would look forward to staying here again.
