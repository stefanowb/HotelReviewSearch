From the moment we arrived our hosts made us very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. In such an old property, you wouldnt expect the rooms to be identical and they are not in any way; all have indivdual decor schemes and layouts so each visit can be a new experience. Indeed, when booking you can view each room and choose exacly what you want. On arriving in the rooms you cant help be impressed with all the thoughtful touches and little extras to make your stay more comfortable, even ear plugs for those who sleep very lightly. This had actually been a worry for me, having discovered the exact location of the property on the morning we set off- it is right on a crossing of 2 major roads. However, the double glazing installed in the bedrooms almost completely mutes the traffic noise and we slept very well, which set us up for the excellent breakfast. Since the restaurant is so highly regarded, we hoped breakfasr would be special, and it really was, everything cooked to order, beautifully presented and delicious - the smoked haddock in particular gained rave reviews from our party. What else is there to say, the gardens are pleasant, and my favourite spot in the house was the garden sitting room - no TV, no music, just peace and quiet. Overall, quite a delightful couple of days, we will definately visit again.", "title": "Wonderful hotel", "user": "Alexandra B", "date": "July 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167614046}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 2, "very good": 11, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 25}, "aka": "Ternhill Farm House & The Cottage Restaurant Market Drayton, Shropshire", "slim_ranking": 0.111111111111, "description": "A warm welcome awaits you at this Grade II Listed Georgian farmhouse set in an acre of gardens. A wonderful blend of character oak beams & floors with more contemporary luxuries. The individually furnished spacious rooms, named after places of interest in the area, are complemented by innovative fresh food cooked to order by the chef/proprietor.... all in a strict non-smoking environment. All rooms are non-smoking, with en-suite facilities, radio/alarm, flat screen colour TV with Freeview/DVD/CD/MP3 player, hairdryer, tea/coffee making facilities, free WiFi Access, complimentary toiletries and are individually furnished with rich, heavy fabrics, plump duvets and cotton bed-linen. Breakfast is something of a sumptuous affair offering a wide choice of breakfast dishes. The Cottage Restaurant serves a tantalizing, locally sourced A la Carte menu Tuesday to Saturday evenings. Homegrown and local produce figure strongly in the kitchen, where Michael conjures up a range of distinctive dishes with global overtones."}
