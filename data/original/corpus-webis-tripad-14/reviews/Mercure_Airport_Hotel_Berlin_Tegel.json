The staff were very helpful, efficient, welcoming and professional. My husband and sixteen year old son and I shared a room with double bed and fold out couch. It was spacious enough to meet our needs, and beds were comfortable. It is perfectly located for quick access to Tegel airport and the free shuttle is a bonus. The property is close to quick bus access and the staff was very helpful in helping us to use both bus as well as hotel shuttle to meet our sightseeing needs. The breakfast was not included in our rate, which is not too surprising given the excellent rate for such a nice hotel. We did enjoy the lavish breakfast buffet once, but it's a bit much in price and quantity unless you are counting on sustenance to last the day.

The price was right - 47 euros for a room. We ran into a little trouble when we arrived. The free shuttle bus ends at 11pm and we just missed the last one. We could not get any of the taxi drivers to take us because it was such a small fare. However, I called the hotel using the free dedicated phone in the airport terminal and the man on reception sent one within five minutes. Great service. The hotel room was much better than I expected for the money - a decent size, beautiful clean sheets, two twin beds and spotless throughout. All the staff were very helpful and polite. I speak German but they all spoke great English for anyone who doesn't. We didn't stay for breakfast as we were leaving for central Berlin first thing in the morning - only a 15 to 20 minute cab ride away. The checkout was quick, friendly and the receptionist called us a cab at once.
