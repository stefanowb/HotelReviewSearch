I would rate the hotel a solid 4 star, maybe 4.5. Compaired to 5 star in Mexico or the Carribean. When we arrived, we booked a room with a king size bed, but they put us in a room with 2 single beds. We requested a change and were told it would 2 days. It was nothing to stress about, so we went with it. In 2 days, they did move us, but to a room they knew the air conditioning did not work and it stank of cigarette smoke, so we again complained and they moved us to the third room, which was fine. The only real complaint is that they nickel and dime you to death, for an all inclusive except dinner, you pay for everything. Internet use $4 for 1/2 hour, $4 a day for gym use, the list goes on. We guess that this part of the world has not caught up to the rest. The hotel itself is beautiful and the grounds are kept spotless. The beach is cleaned daily and there is a bit of seaweed along the beach, but it is an ocean, not a pool. The staff are exceptional and will help wherever they can and even go a little bit extra if they can. The meals were good, although we found the buffet at dinner and lunch very expensive, so we ordered off the menu most nights we ate at the hotel, we found the price of the a la carte menu very reasonable, especially for a hotel. There are numerous restaurants all along the street just outside the hotel for few dollars cheaper, ask for a discount before sitting down, we usually got 10 - 20% off.
