I had specifically booked this hotel because of its secure underground car parking. We were staying here for 2 nights after a two-week holiday in the south of france. Whilst we took an overnight bag into the hotel all of our other luggage (quite a lot really) had to be left in the car and I did not want to park on the street with all of our suitcase visible in the back. I understood that car park spaces had to be pre-booked and I did this when booking our two rooms - this was several months ago. Upon arrival I was told that the car park was full - that it was first come first served and that anyway, our vehicle (a people carrier) wouldn't fit in there anyway. I was quite put out but the receptionist told us to find a space on the street. She didn't explain that the \"payant\" spaces are free in August so we were confused as it appeared that you could only park for a maximum of 2 hours.", "title": "Very mixed feelings about this hotel - would not stop there again!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "S_G_Taylor", "date": "August 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 138647712}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our rooms were off a courtyard on the ground floor and the courtyard itself was very old fashioned and depressing. 1970s cement and stone paving blocks. It looked more like a prison than a hotel. The rooms were fine - nothing special but clean and tidy. As other reviewers say, the rooms were exceptionally small with nowhere to even put our overnight bag. Also, because it was off a small yard, it was very dark inside the room - rather gloomy I would say. A complimentary small bottle of water was greatly appreciated.

My husband stayed behind with my 82 year old mother and booked a taxi from reception. She seemed puzzled that he would want a taxi but he pointed out that even a 15 minute walk is too much for my mother before she even starts to walk around the palce. She appeared to phone for a taxi and my husband and mother stood in reception and waited for 20 minutes. When they eventually questioned why no taxi had turned up she told them that there was only 1 taxi company in the whole of Versailles (gasp in unbelieving astonishment) and that they did not work on a Sunday. They had spent 20 minutes stood close to her and she hadn't bothered to tell them that she hadn't actually booked them a taxi at all. My husband is a very laid back person but he was furious. Of course there are numerous taxi companies in Versailles and they were working as not only did we see taxis throughout the day, when we got back somebody was being dropped off in front of the hotel in a taxi.

The beds, even thought not large size, are very comfortable and bed linen are of good quality. The breakfast area was immaculate and breakfasts were excellent; fresh fruit, juices, sausages, bacon, eggs, cold choices, bread, pastries and yoghurts. The staff was friendly, professional and attentive, willing to give recommendations for restaurants, trains etc. Parking is an issue as the Hotel garage is very tight. It was not possible for us to park our Touran there. We had to park in a Vinci Parking some blocks away. To our distress we found that the Vinci parking doesn't take foreign credit cards. When calling the service phone number at the parking there was a women answering only speaking French and apparently located in Marseilles informing that we could only pay with coins (an amount above 60 Euro).
