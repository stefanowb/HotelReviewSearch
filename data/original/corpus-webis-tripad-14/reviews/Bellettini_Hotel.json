It's a half block from the San Lorenzo street fair and only a few blocks from the Duomo, and a manageable walk from the train station (even with a very large bag). The staff was very friendly, the breakfast good, and I never had any problem using the free internet connection. There is a lift to the hotel lobby, but my room was on the 2nd floor, which is only accessible by stairs. If you overpack, as I do, this may not be ideal if you're only staying a day or two, but there weren't many stairs and it was well worth it for me since they gave me a very large double room in spite of my being a single. I will definitely make the Belletini my first choice for future trips to Firenze.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "CaravaggioFan", "date": "March 30, 2006", "id": 4781891}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "What a good find.", "text": "I chose this hotel after reading previous reviews and also because it had a great deal on room prices.still not sure what to expect as all views subjective. however it is in a great position for sightseeing,the single room was fine altho a little dark and would probably be noisy in summer with the shutters open.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "ashlea", "date": "January 21, 2006", "id": 4367047}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Big room, small bathroom", "text": "a very good breakfast and pleasant friendly staff.one word of warning -most rooms are up stairs at various levels-altho there is a lift from street level to reception.would certainly stay here again.", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 12, 2005", "id": 4108255}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "Our review of this hotel is hot and cold.
