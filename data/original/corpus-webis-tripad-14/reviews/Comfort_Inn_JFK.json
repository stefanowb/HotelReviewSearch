I was surprised, however, that no one had mentioned that the hotel is in sort of an industrial area, so the two blocks to the subway could be terrifying late at night. Also, there are no restaurants nearby. We got in in the evening, and our choice was to have Chinese takeout or bad pizza delivered. Those are our only complaints, however. The shuttle from the hotel was great, the room was as promised -- good bed, good shower, quiet. Breakfast was good. I guess $175 is a good price for a hotel at the airport in New York, but it does seem a little steep for this hotel. The staff was fairly distant and disinterested, but we didn't really need them for anything, so that was all right.
