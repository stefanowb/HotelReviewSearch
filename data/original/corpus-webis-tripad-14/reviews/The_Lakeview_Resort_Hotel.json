Our rooms were not cleaned properly (they just came in and made the beds - didn't clean garbage, change our flickering bathroom light that we left on purposely, etc). We also had a 'noise complaint' at 9pm, when it is posted EVERYWHERE that quiet time is from 11pm to 7am - and, believe it or not, we were only talking in our room as to what our evening will look like (not even blaring music, running up and down hallways, etc. like some hotels).
