I was more than happily surprised! My husband and I chose to do the afternoon away (again, another \"by the hour\" move that I thought would be a little weird) since we would have to make arrangements for pets, etc to do the overnight. The afternoon was actually perfect for us. I drove up and my Audi was right at home with the Mercedes & Lexus vehicles checking in. Check-in was quick and easy. We got to our unit and my husband and I were really blown away. Thick plush carpeting, along with really nice bathrobes greeted us. We had a Majestic suite and the pool was amazing - perfect size. I don't think we'd do any unit other than a Majestic or Chalet now that we have been spoiled. There is an adult TV station along with a swing in the closet for the adventurous. We were there to just reconnect and spend some quality time together. I brought us some champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and other snacks and we spent a great afternoon swimming in the pool, hot tub, and enjoying the steam room. Everything was VERY CLEAN. I was really worried about that as well. The only complaint I heard was that the towels weren't great and so I brought us some of our own. That was a good move as they don't give you enough towels. Whether you are looking for some fantasy playtime or just simply a place to relax without interruption, this was great. My husband wants to come back once a month just to decompress! We'll probably try another one of the resorts in the future just to see the difference.", "title": "Not cheesy - Very fun & romantic!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "NicoleandKyle", "date": "May 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 65116282}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved It", "text": "Just remember, bring anything that you might want because there are no phones and you will not be leaving once you arrive.

Inside was a very large whirlpool tub (empty and clean) with mirrors on 2 sides, the bed across from it with mirrors above, angled above and at the headboard, also mirrors on the wall, a nice massaging chair, steam room and the bathroom was set separately behind a wall. The toilet is in a separate room. There is a standup shower and overhead heat lamps by the vanity sink. Bathroom amenities were shampoo, conditioner, soap, mouthwash and 2 specially packaged pre-pasted toothbrushes. The main room also had a small table with 2 chairs and a small refrigerator. Fun colored lights around the bed. Be sure to try the accessory in the closet. We paid extra for late check-out so we had plenty of time for relaxation.

We typically stay in the Paradise Swimming Pool Suite however have stayed in other suites occassionally. It is a nice place for the four or five hours of get away deal in the middle of the day however when staying overnight we found the bed to be extremely uncomfortable. Actually I don't think I slept but two hours the bed was so bothersome to my back. As for cleanliness - it was and has continued to be clean and kept up. Interestingly (and we believe probably due to this day and age insurance wise) the pools in the newer rooms are very shallow -only about 3 foot deep - we recall in the older suites them to be much deeper. Anyway putting that aside as it is only one night and a private pool - as we have a pool and hot tub at home we noted the chemical in the hot tub to be very off as it was sudsing up. Lastly the check-in was a hassle this time so much so my husband almost told the kid to cancel our reservations right then and there. Reasoning was I booked it for us (for our 24th anniversary for the night) and placed the charges on our businesd card and forgot about that. When he went to check-in they ask for your credit card and he handed his AMX to them and they said no that's not the right card. He came out to the car and said what card did I place it on and I totally forgot it was on our business card and I said honestly I don't know. He went back in (by then several younger couples had checked in and were on their way to their rooms and here we were still sitting there due to this) and upon going back in told the guy he didn't have a clue what card it was placed on but here was his AMX take care of it with that furthering it with we'd never gone through this type of fiasco and had been staying there now over twenty years. He was ready to tell them cancel it and the kid took his other credit card. We were both ticked - and interestingly got our charges on our Amx and it was put through on the initial card called in - our biz card as opposed to the personal gold card he'd handed to him. Anyway - we have decided at this time not to renew our membership and in light of all are now believing comfortable beds and so forth to be more in order.
