We have three (3) means of public transportation, Caltrain (train), Samtrans (Bus), and BART (Train-subway) to downtown San Francisco. Caltrain station is a 5 minutes walk from the hotel, the bus stops right at the hotel, and the BART station is only a 1.5 mile drive (5 minutes), with $1 a day parking at the station. When you get back to the hotel, you have the choice of all kinds of meals. one block east of the hotel is the \"Restaurant Row\" of San Mateo. There are, at least ,20 different restaurants ranging from Italian, Middleastern, Mexican, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Brazillian, etc. are within the walking distance. The Spa (a Jacuzzi and a sauna) this hotel provides can also help you relax after the long exhausting work day. The hotel also has an exercise room. The very reliable FREE WiFi Internet connection is also a PLUS! This relatively economical hotel provides the convenience of commute to downtown San Francisco, all the amenities that a single business traveler might desire, and the very reasonable price for the area. The hotel is very close to the San Francisco International Airport, also. THEREFORE, I strongly recommend Ramada Limited, San Bruno to solo business travelers to San Francisco.", "title": "Convinient to Commute to Downtown SF via BART with SPA an all amenities.", "user": "Urano2484", "date": "January 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 53684466}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "M.

The hotelstaff was friendly. My room was spacious and clean. You've got a refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker and free WIFI. The tv has many channels. Sleeping was not a problem altough you can hear planes from time by time. I agree the breakfastroom is small and looks shabby and not very clean. But you won't need to have breakfast there. Just take some food to your room, use the in-room coffeemaker and have breakfast in your room. The location is also good, it's in downtown San Bruno with many shops and eateries around. There is a Samtrans busstop nearby with buses to San Francisco. Caltrain is not far away and has trains to San Francisco and San Jose. The BART-station is a bit far away, it's in a shoppingmall. However, the hotel has no free shuttle to/from the airport.
