While the resort is not slopeside, they run a continuous shuttle which makes getting to the slopes easy. The clubhouse has separate indoor and outdoor hottubs and an indoor/outdoor heated pool. There is a movie room, a game room, an exercise room, a steam room and showers. We stayed in the Douglas Building which was newly carpeted and refurnished. The rooms, while not elegant, were certainly roomy and comfortible. I would definitely recommend the Marriott Streamside.", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 17, 2001", "id": 343666}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent", "text": "My wife and I have been staying at the Marriott Streamside since 1993, sometimes with our grown up family and grandaughters.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DavidBLancs", "date": "March 17, 2007", "id": 7179008}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Noise Levels", "text": "The hotel is booked through the Marriott Vacation Club and Evergreen is one of a number of lodges but it is indisputedly the best. The accomodation is luxurious and of a high standard. The kitchen is well equipped. Although the hotel is about 10 minutes car journey to Lionshead the shuttle bus run by the hotel is efficient. There is a supermarket within half a mile and for those without a car the shuttle bus will take you there. Generally the staff are friendly and pleasant but be warned ; we were actually refused assistance with our luggage on checking out last year and I was unable because of injury to carry my luggage. Eventually they found a volunteer to help .", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "MB37", "date": "July 15, 2006", "id": 5468889}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful Condo, Beautiful Place", "text": "We booked for two nights (24-25th June) at the Marriott Streamside Resort in Vail assuming that we would have a restful weekend having travelled many miles on our recent trip to the USA. As it turned out we were allocated a room on the front of a rather dingy building directly facing a major intersection on the very heavily-used I70 highway, which was about 200 feet away; in addition two parallel frontage roads carried more vehicles. The room, while well-equipped, was stiflingly hot and there was no air conditioning, merely a notice to advise you to leave windows and patio door open. The noise levels from the continuous traffic was totally unacceptable and when we asked for a move to somewhere quieter, we were told that the hotel was full. We lodged a complaint with the management, but it was too late to move on that evening (we were offered an alternative at the other Marriott Resort in Vail but that had no kitchen facilities), so after a sleepless night we decided to move on the next day.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 6, 2006", "id": 5433658}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Tired Marriott", "text": "We have stayed at many hotels in the Marriott chain in the past several years and this was by far our worst experience.
