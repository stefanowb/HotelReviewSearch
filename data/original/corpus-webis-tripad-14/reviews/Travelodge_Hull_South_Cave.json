The receptionist was extremely helpful and booked adjacent rooms on the ground floor. The room was of Travelodge standard and was clean and tidy although there was a slight damp smell on occasion. The bathroom was in desperate need of a refurbishment as there was lots of black mould around the bath and tiled area and the flooring was coming away from the wall. Agree with the previous reviewer the television was out of the arc and not even a remote control.
