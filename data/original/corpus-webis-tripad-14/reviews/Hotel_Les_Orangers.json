Upon arrival I was highly dissappointed at the look of the hotel. The staff is very friendly and accomodating, especially when staying up late and having a glass of wine from the hotel bar. The rooms are very small and a bit outdated. The bathrooms seem to be updated compared to the bedroom portion. The TV in my room only went up to channel 9, thus I was unable to access any of the English channels during my stay.

It is a 15 minute walk from the rail station along a main road or a bit longer through the town/old town. Rooms are small but clean and have been recently decorated. Beds are comfortable, but old. Bathrooms are lovely ,with good showers. My wife thought the hairdryer was worse than useless though! The reception staff were really helpful and went out of their way to assist. There is a good pool with sunbeds, a bar and a restaurant. The breakfast was very good with a selection of pastries,bread,meat,cheese,fruit,cereals,yoghurt, tea and coffee. This can be taken in the garden or in the dining room. There is some road noise, but good double glazing and air conditioning allows you to have a quiet night! . There are a large number of restaurants in the old town and port, only a short walk away from the hotel through pretty, narrow cobbled streets which are well worth a look. I would recommend this hotel as being good value for money.
