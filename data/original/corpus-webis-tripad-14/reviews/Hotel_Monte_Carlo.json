The rooms are quite small (and, unfortunately, not very soundproof) but the size of the room - and the rich, warm colours that the entire hotel is decorated in - only adds to the charm of this hotel. The cat motif is everywhere in the hotel (which I loved); it's a shame the cats are no longer in residence. There was always fresh towels and sheets provided, and a pleasant, fresh scent would prevail after the room had been cleaned. The room itself had everything needed during a visit - telephone, heater, flat-screen TV, in-room sink (with shampoo & shower gel provided), and a safe where you could lock your valuables away and not worry about them being stolen. This is, however, a very safe hotel as is the general area around it. The shared facilities were always fairly busy but the shower & toilet was kept extremely clean; I heard housekeeping cleaning them at various points throughout the day.
