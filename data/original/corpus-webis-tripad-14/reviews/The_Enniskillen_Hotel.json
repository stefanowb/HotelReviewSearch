However once inside the hotel is decorated to a very high standard, if a little dark in places. The bedroom is not overly large, even the superior double was quite small, but was very nice and absolutely clean. The bathroom was lovely, with great little touches. There was coffee, tea, water all complimentary in the rooms. Even the hair dyer was of very good quality, not like the one in many other hotels. The bar and restaurant were very inviting and the breakfast was excellent. The cooked selection in particular was really impressive and there was a variety of morning newspapers as all at breakfast. The location is ideal for walking into the town, a short 5min walk will have you at bars, restaurants and shops.", "title": "A surprise!", "user": "Louise C", "date": "May 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159838052}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Having never been to Enniskillen before we had no idea what to expect or where the hotel was.

Central. Cosy. Decent bathroom and shower. The bad - a horrific grey colour throughout the hotel that makes it look very drab and depressing. Screaming and roaring at 4am from some inconsiderate guests that woke many people (I know because a few guests mentioned it at the breakfast). My wife was giving a lecture at a local college the following morning, and was awake for hours because of the noise. She never got back to sleep after it. The receptionist wasn't prepared to apologise for it. She just said that the hotel was powerless to do anything about it. I dunno. Surely a night porter should get involved ? Maybe he was unaware of it ? The breakfast was decent, but the breakfast room very cramped. Overall it was very pricey here for one night.
