We were visiting family in the area. I had read reviews about this hotel and was warned about booking a room online so I called in my reservation. We stayed in the rooms that are attached to the casino. We stayed in room 219, no smoking, king bed. If you are looking for a view this is not the room for you. The only view from this room is of building pipes. The best thing about this room is the bathtub, it is very large. The room does not have a refrigerator and for the price we paid ($159.00) it should have one.", "title": "Good Casino ~ So So room", "user": "Elena74", "date": "March 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 14092008, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great food at their restaurant.", "disliked": "\u2014 You could hear what was going on in the next room, very thin walls.

We had our Mardi Gras Ball this weekend and had family coming in, we all wanted to stay togather somewhere and possibly use a limo service to bring us back to the hotel. We wanted to book at the big \"L\" casino that everyone rants about. I called to reserve and their normal rate is $199 but they booked an act so it was $399 a night, too much for two nights. So we decided on the Isle, only $149 a night. We all booked in the tower. They have recently put in new beds and now use really nice sheets with down comforters, like bigger chains. In addition to the bed we had a sititng area with a sofa and chair with a seperate tv.We really enjoyed the jacuzzi tub, big enough for 2 people. If you can get past the tropical theme with lime green, orange and hot pink it is a great room. The rooms were clean and appears they are doing some updating.It took us a while to check in, they always seemed busy. They were friendly and very helpful though.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "niceguyy80", "date": "February 4, 2008", "id": 13266939}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We usually don't eat at the buffett at the casinos but the breakfast is good.

I said, no I was quoted 139.00 per nite and want to stay here, said well its only 57.00 per nite over there and thats where they put you.

I have been twice in the past two years on business and had to stay at the Inn at the Isle both times bc the tower rooms that are connected to the casino are always full. When checking in, I seemed to be the only female staying there as it was abuzz with men in work coveralls who were drinking beer outside the lobby at 2:30 in the afternoon. Of course, my room wasn't ready yet so I came back at 5 and was told that there were no more nonsmoking rooms even though that is what I had confirmed. It took forever for the lady at the desk to figure out where to put me - especially since she kept ignoring me to answer the phone that kept ringing. Finally, another girl came to help her and they found me a nonsmoking room that was a different bed-type than what I had booked, but that was fine. As a female traveling alone, I was taken aback when one of the girls behind the desk announced my room number to the other one with a total stranger male standing right there. While I was checking in, I noticed two people who called or came by the front desk bc they had no tv remote in their room. Guess what - when I got to my room, no remote. I called as soon as I got in the room and they said they would try to find me one. Of course I never heard from them again. When I called again at 9:30 after dinner, they said they had a remote at the front desk that might work if I wanted to come get it (even though there were 2 employees at the front desk). I said forget it. The rooms are not particulary clean and you can hear EVERYTHING that is said or goes on in the hallway. This is not a place for light sleepers. This hotel is also in an isolated area. If you aren't there to gamble you will be bored. There are no other restaurants, gas stations, anything right around the casino/hotel. The people who work at this place are a joke. If I ever have another business meeting at the Isle, I will stay in the tower hotel or I will just go stay somewhere else.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "katshif", "date": "July 3, 2006", "id": 5421891}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "The Inn across the street from the casino is a great deal, but you know why the minute you step into it.
