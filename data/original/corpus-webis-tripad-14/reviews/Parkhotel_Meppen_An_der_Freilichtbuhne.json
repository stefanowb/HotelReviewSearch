The main building has a comforable and classic feel. The new wing is a little character-less, but has comfortable, if small, rooms with a standard clean bathroom. The rooms open into the garden outside, which would be very nice in the summer but not useful for the German November!", "title": "Very nice value hotel in a quiet picturesque setting", "user": "sankar", "date": "December 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 50782370}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Meppen"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 6, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 6}, "slim_ranking": 0.222222222222}
