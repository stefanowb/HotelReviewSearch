Little kitchenette with microwave an bar fridge, comfy bed with really nice linnen and good pillows. Good sized shower with great water pressure. Lol. No hair dryer and very minimal storage space for longer stays but absolutely would come again. Nice and quiet too. Close to shops. Beautiful view over river and neat back courtyard area and lovely pool ( if it ever gets warm enough to use it) good powerful heater in room and very soft and comfy electric blanket!

We stayed six nights in total on our first visit to Tasmania. We had room 1 on the top floor, which had huge windows overlooking the Derwent River and also Mt Wellington. Due to the cold weather, we mostly had to keep the curtains closed. The bed was very comfortable and was supplied with 'his and hers' electric blanket (each side of the bed was adjustable temperature as required), and it's just as well. Although the rooms had recently been nicely refurbished, the fan heaters had been removed and replaced with oil-type heaters which really only warmed towels before a shower or dried them after showers! These oil heaters were not adequate to heat the rooms, and when we mentioned this to the manager, he said that other guests had said the same thing. Room 1 also had a small kitchenette (toaster, coffee making facilities, fridge, microwave oven and sink). I had booked this motel online and requested the room with the spa, but on arrival was offered Room 1 as an alternative due to the length of our stay because the spa room had no views at all! After seeing other hotels, motels and B&Bs in Hobart when on the ground, I doubt if I would chose to stay at the Waterfront again.", "title": "Quiet area in Hobart suburbs", "user": "Ippy47", "date": "August 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 137604308}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled solo", "text": "I was a single women traveller.

For what ever reason the rooms on the lower ground level don't look inviting,and I felt vunerable there by myself.Thankyou for upgrading me,I would stay there again for my short stay visiting friends.Rooms have been refurbished which goes along way, new carpet, fresh paint,good size LCD TV kitchnette with crockery ect and microwave. I would assume that costs are saved by no frills...No tissues,phone note pads or hair dryers, airconditioning. I did like the sloping open windows. Had to park up the street first night as no carpark was available. For the money I paid it served it's purpose.
