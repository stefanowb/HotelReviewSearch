The conservatory with all its plants and wonderful views would be just the place to sit on a summer evening, so we will have to go back some day. Our bedroom was large and comfortable too.

I've read the two reviews and I think the person who was scared of spiderwebs and limited menus really should stick to Holiday Inns in cities. This is a country house (hence the name) and if you don't like remote, well, what are doing on Mull anyway? It's a beautiful but intoxicatingly dizzy drive (at least late in the day with the sun low) from Tobermory on a winding island road. This corner of Mull is gorgeous hilly moorland. Druimnacroish itself is clean and bright, with a great conservatory dining room, a well-stocked library AND a lounge with well-stocked mini-bar (both proofs to me of a civilized and welcoming inn!); our room was large, comfortable, and very nicely furnished.
