We had a wonderful time. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The Premier Suite is 'huge' but all the rooms are a good size and well equipped with all you require for a short break in Chester. The food at the Inn was delicious. (especially the home made chips)Breakfast was substabtial and enjoyed by all of us. There is a lovely chinese restaurant about 2 doors away its small so you may have to book a table but its well worth it.
