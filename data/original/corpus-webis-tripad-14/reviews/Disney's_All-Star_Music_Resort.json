We selected the All Star Music resort mainly for value as we wanted the in-park experience but didn't want to pay high prices. We were very surprised by our experience. We got to the hotel early (9:00am) and were extremely surprised to find that our room was ready for us! We were given keys and the all-important parking pass. We are Florida residents and with the stroler we find it easier to take our car versus the bus system with the exception of the Magic Kingdom.

Unless you are in a deluxe hotel paying for a view in my opinion is not worth the cost as all value and moderate resorts have outdoor corridors and to leave your curtains open means that people can look in to your room while you are looking out. The preferred room does get you closer to the main building for drinks/food etc, and usually the pool area as well.

We decided to buy a souvenir mug for about $16 since you get free unlimited refills of hot or cold beverages for the duration of your stay -- only at the hotel, though, not at the parks.

The room was adequate, nothing fancy, but clean and efficient. Hanging and drawer space was plenty for the two of us. Temp control was spot on. Bathroom clean, appropriate towels, iron, ironing board, and hair dryer. Sink outside of shower area. Well lit room. Housekeeping did what was expected. Piano and Guitar shaped pools were very nice. Four other areas of this resort with different themes. I am sure they would be louder...we were on an outside room the furthest possible area away virtually no one walked past our area. Did not use room service or use the fitness area. Only went to the parks on one day.

We loved the separate bedroom, kitchen and especially the two bathrooms - for only about $400 more for the week. The rooms were large (bathrooms were tiny though), clean and well appointed. The couch (makes into a bed) and chair (also makes into a bed) were rather hard, but OK. The worst part was the noise. Every time someone in a near-by room flushed their toilet, we could hear it. Maybe being on the top floor would help, our room was on the 1st floor. It was also loud when someone walked by rolling their suitcases - sometimes sounding like an airport. Also might help if you were on the upper levels. All in all, we would do this again, but ask to be upstairs. The family suites are very close to the dining area/ bus pickup. This is a big plus. The weather was cold while we were there so we didn't use the pool, but a lot of kids did. They heat the water to 80 degrees. The staff at the hotel was excellent. Very friendly and knowledgable. The housekeeping was very good the first few days, but there must have been a change of workers because the last few days left something to be desired. I left a note with the tip asking for tissues (ours ran out) and had to call again later to get them. We drank tea each morning, and they left more coffee, but no tea (not a big deal, we just had to go to the dining area to get more). All little things, but we expected more from Disney. We probably won't be back again until we have grandchildren, and by then, who knows how different things will be there?

The food at the quick service was very delicious however I think they need to have more healthy options (not fries with everything!) if you want salad, you have to buy it separately or use a \"snack\" or \"dessert\" option from your meal plan.

As a child I have stayed at the All-Star resorts MANY times. The resorts are very family friendly and oriented. The resorts are large with only having a bus stop at the front so if you stay in a back building, which we did, you have a little bit of a walk. This was not a problem for us but may be for some and this is why these resorts offer preferred buildings that you can pay extra for. Our room was clean and comfortable but compared to the deluxe resorts they were very small and the bed quality is obvious, again for us this was not a big deal. The food options at the food court were plentiful and affordable! If you have a Tables of Wonderland discount card, the discount offers 20% at the food court which was great! The pools were clean as well as the pool furniture. The only negative experience we had was when we were checking out, we waiting over an hour for bell services to get to our room to get our luggage.

My sisters are 10 and 3. We stayed at the All-Stars Sports and Port Orleans Riverside before. We stayed from February 28 through March 8. We enjoyed getting picked up from the airport and taken to our resorts on Disney's Magical Express. I loved the video. It was very informational, yet fun to watch. Upon arrival, my father got us checked in. This was a very easy process because we had already did the online check-in. The outside of the resort was very nice looking. They took care of everything so well. The lobby was not stunning, but it still looked good. There was a big couch facing a TV with Disney Cartoons. The restrooms in Melody Hall were nice. Also, inside Melody Hall was a food court, arcade, and store. Mastero Mickey's, the store, was well stocked. My family went in there at least once a day and still found new stuff to look at. We ate at the Intermission Food Court a lot since we had quick service dining. When you exit the main building and head towards the rooms, the landscape is beautiful. Straight ahead is a guitar-shaped swimming pool. The Calypso Pool is huge. It is also heated. Even though a couple of nights it was chilly, there were still people swimming, and the lifeguards were wearing winter hats and gloves. Our room was in the Jazz Inn section. There was a fountain in the middle. The room was a family suite. It was great for our family. Mom and Dad slept in the bedroom while the kids slept in the living room. I was on the pull-out couch, and my sisters were on the pull-out bench and chair. The room was just re-painted. It had a lot of space and looked nice. The resort was crowded when we were there. A lot of teams who complete at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex stay at the All-Star Resorts. There just happen to be two cheer leading compititions when we were there. The food court had very good food. Notable Games Arcade had a lot of games. I enjoyed setting records at the basketball games. The resort also had a laundry room. The bus wait times were a little long. The bus rides were not very long except for Downtown Disney, which are also extremely crowded because they go to all the All-Star Resorts. The Disney Cast Members were great as always. Even when we needed something extra, they were there right away. The room key scanner ran out of battery at our room.
