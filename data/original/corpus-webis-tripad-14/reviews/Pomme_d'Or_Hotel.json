The bus station is just around the corner from the hotel and within 2 minutes of getting of the bus we were checking in. Very good staff, pleasant and helpful. Our room was on the 3rd floor facing the street, not much of a view but if I had wanted a view I would have paid for it. The rooms were excellent, very clean and comfortable. Windows are double glazed as there was a little bit of noise in the evening but nothing terrible Good supply of tea,coffee etc. Toiletries were provided but there was no body cream, or hair condition. Breakfast was very good, lots of choice and plenty of it. The hotel is probably in one of the best positions for location, walking distance of the shops/bars etc. Liberation Square is the central point for coach trips etc. We decided to have dinner in the hotel on our second night, unfortunately this was a bit of a let down, the buffet starter was excellent - lots of choice and it was delicious, but there were just not enough staff to serve the main course, a couple of times the Chef had to leave the kitchen to get the waiters to serve the food. I also had to complain because my meal was stone cold, also a fellow traveller has a fish allergy and had to return her plate 3 times because they served it with fish - not so good. I would recommend this hotel, and would stay there again but would not have an evening meal there.", "title": "Very good hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "S.S.S.M.L.A", "date": "May 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 160651707}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went for the train ride to St. Aubin Bay, wouldn't do it again. \u00a37.50 per person and they squeeze too many people in.

The breakfasts were superb and very good value and we had dinner on one of our nights stay and that also was superb.
