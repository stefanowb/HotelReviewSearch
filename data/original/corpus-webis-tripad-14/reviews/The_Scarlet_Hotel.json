We ended up extending our stay as we loved it so much. Yes, it's expensive but you get what you pay for ! The rooms and the public areas are beautiful, clean and comfortable. The hotel has a number of quirks - they like \"to challenge convention\" such as no reception desk and no tea/coffee in the room but they will deliver to your room on request. The pool is \"natural\" so has no chlorine but contains plants that naturally keep it clean. For frequent hotel dwellers it may take a little getting used to but you will soon fall under the spell of this place. Dinner in the restaurant was superb and the local Cornish wines were a real surprise. The breakfast menu changed daily and everything was freshly cooked and delicious. The views from the hotel's several balcony areas across the beach and the bay are just stunning and we were lucky to get a couple of amazing sunsets. Every single member of staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgable who's aim was to help you relax and enjoy your stay. If was to find a couple of minor faults, there probably weren't enough exterior sunbeds around the pool area and it seemed a little excessive charging hotel guests\u00a315 to go in the hot tubs.
