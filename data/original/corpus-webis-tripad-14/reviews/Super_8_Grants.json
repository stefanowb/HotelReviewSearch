This time the nearby construction almost made me by pass the area. I'm glad I didn't. The motel had just finished renovating the rooms. Everything was spanky clean. The clerk was polite and helpful. All equipment worked properly. The bed was comfortable. The indoor pool looked inviting. The breakfast was basic but included cereals, mini-muffins, and mini-sweet rolls. (I was spoiled by the fresh waffles served at Michigan Super 8's.) A family on a budget could enjoy a weekend here.

My handicapped wife and I stayed in room #131, a handicapped drive-up, king bed room, on a Wednesday, 23 April, 2008. We booked this room through the Super 8 website for the price of $48.53. The overall appearance of the motel and lobby were fine. A hoped for early check-in was not to be as apparently motel policy is to let no check-in prior to 3:00pm. Check-in went moderately well although the clerk and her trainee were very non-communicative and not very responsive to questions or problems with the room. The room was large but very crowded with a very out-of place overstuffed arm chair and a broken wobbly desk chair. These made it difficult to both sit comfortably and move about the room in what was supposed to be a handicapped room. The room, bathroom and vanity were clean and there were no lingering odors in the room. The bed was comfortable. The shower worked well, water pressure and drainage OK. The room, which had both exterior and interior entry, was semi-quiet and safety precautions were in place. There was a lock on the inside of the bathroom door, something I had never noted in a handicapped room before. Evidence of a pry on this door showed that someone had inadvertently locked themselves in there before. A moderate terrible continental breakfast was offered. The mini-muffins were still frozen and the juice was practically water. Check-out was easy and the billing was accurate. We might, or might not, stay here again but only after giving serious consideration to other motels in the area.", "title": "An Average Stay", "user": "RetiredRidgecrest_CA", "date": "May 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16005920, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Bead comfort; quiet room; close to the Interstate", "disliked": "\u2014 Terrible, terrible breakfast; handicapped room not fuirnished for handicapped people"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007", "text": "We stayed at the Super 8 in Grants, NM on our cross country drive.

The front desk was friendly and we had a smooth check-in. The room was clean and everything worked properly. The bathroom (toilet and tub) was very small. The sink was on the outside, which is a nice feature in hotels. The continental breakfast was good. The con was the wireless internet.
