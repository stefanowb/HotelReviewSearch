I had never stayed in a B and B before, but now I'm spoiled and will go back to The Curry House every time I visit Key West. In addition, we hung around the house in the pool quite a bit--it was sweltering while we were there--and I witnessed the ladies cleaning the rooms constantly.

Make sure you check out on their website which room you want to stay in, each is slightly different with some not as good as others. Our room was a bit small but enough space for just us. The semi-private balcony is a balcony on the back of the house that the room has a private door to but you are only separated from your neighbor by a large plant, so if they were using the balcony at the same time it would not be private. The shower has great pressure. The shampoo and conditioner they give smells like cologne so I suggest bringing your own. The matteress was a little worn out and the pillows weren't great. Overall it was really clean (though they do not change the sheets each night) the pool is small but kept very nice, the breakfast is tastey, the house is very nice, and it is an ideal location.

It exceeded my expectations. The famous Duval Street or the Historic Seaport are three blocks away, close enough to walk and far enough for peace and quiet. I counted twenty popular restaurants within three to four blocks of the Curry House. An inn with nine rooms, each has a small refrigerator and a TV, a window air conditioner and other amenities listed on their web site. A hot breakfast such as scrambled eggs and biscuits with gravy, or French toast or pancakes with sausage, was served daily 8:30 to 9:30AM. The outdoor eating area where breakfast is served is under an awning and overlooks the heated pool. A microwave and an ice chest at the wet bar make it convenient for guests to eat their own food there later in the day. I used it for restaurant meal leftovers.
