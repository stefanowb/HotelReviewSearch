Al Manzil has an excellent location close to the Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Mall.

Walking from Al Manzil through the Palace Old town hotel and Souk and from there to the mall is a very pleasant walk though. Check-in was courteous and swift, towels and welcome drink provided. The Burj view room was on the sixth floor as requested and provided a great view to the building and the adjacent new downtown area. We liked the open bathroom design and had no privacy issues. There was some intermittent smell from the tub but the issue is known and the staff confirmed that they are working on a solution. Pool area is small but nice and surprisingly quiet for the location. Tried only one lunch in the courtyard which was very good. Staff is extremely polite. Highly recommended for visitors interested in downtown and also suitable for business.

They do have WIFI throughout the hotel which is nice. The hotel is literally right across the street from the Dubai mall and the fountains which is nice and the Burj Khalifa building isn't far away either. I haven't tried breakfast but I'm sure it will be nice. (My only issues is that they ask if you will use the minibar in the room, when I said no they told me they would send someone to lock it. Mind you I'm grown and I don't need anyone to come lock up the mini-bar but that's just what the did...while I was using the restroom!!! Some guy is standing in my room while I'm in the restroom having a conversation with me about locking up the mini-bar....really???
