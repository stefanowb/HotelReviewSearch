The beach which is near by, offers tuna fishing, banana boats, jet ski's and parargliding, which we tried and was the highlight of our holiday. On an evening there are a vast amount of restaurants to choose from including, Indian, Italian and Mexican (which I highly recommend) as well as the more traditional, KFC, Burger King and Pizza Hut, which are literally on the hotel's doorstep. Nighlight is fantastic and there is a choice of cocktail bars and karaoke clubs or night clubs and bars offering live music. Although the nighlife is literally only a few minutes walk away, the hotel is set back just enough so you are not kept awake all night!
