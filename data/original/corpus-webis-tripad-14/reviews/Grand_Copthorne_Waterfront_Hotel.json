We were taken upstairs to club lounge for check in, there was no welcome drinks or anything. Staff did not explain the benefits of club privileges or where everything was. This is poor service for club rooms as you pay premium rate. The room it self was nothing exciting just extra corner for the writing desk. The bathroom was shocking and disgusting, it looks like its in middle of renovation. Tiles were falling of the bath tub. We then discovered the room did not have any bath towels or bath robes. Notify club manager and he was very apologetic and seem extremely embarrassed and offered free drinks to compensate.

It's situated on a busy street (Havelock Rd) with the nearest shopping mall (Great World City) 2 large blocks away. This does not sound like much, but you'll still want a (cheap) taxi in wet/humid conditions, in which case you might as well cab it to the Orchard Road shops. It's a reasonably new hotel (9-10 years old) so standard rooms are small, and views not spectacular unless you're on the highest floors. Ask for larger rooms which have a brighter feel (e.g those ending in 04). The hotel backs onto the Singapore river, a very narrow but pleasantly landscaped channel with walkways but again, there's nothing noteworthy within walking distance. The surrounding buildings are mostly hotels of lower (3*) standard with some construction work on one side of the hotel (condominiums rising everywhere); late at night the area just outside the hotel entrance is infested with teens hanging out near the extremely popular 'Zouk' disco, so access to the hotel is by room key in the small hours of the morning; Restaurants are ok (Pontini is one of the better Italian restaurants); the conference floor on level 4 is always buzzing with exhibitors; Coffee shop / pastry counter in lobby; Breakfast buffet has a good selection; Maserati showroom just next door add some panache. More on the rooms: comments: standard rooms are not large; beds good; aircon works (3 fan settings & thermostat); bathroom has all the basics but again quite cramped for a 4* hotel; cleaners do an acceptable job, but could have more attention to detail. I found myself using a bathmat to seal off the rather large gap underneath the door, to stop draughts and to shut out noise (piped music in corridors is audible inside the room at night and can be a little irritating). If you are after a 4* hotel and this is going to be your only stay in Singapore, you should definitely choose a more central location within walking distance of the main attractions.

However, you are aware of building noise here - though you do tend to not notice it after a while.However, the real stars of this hotel are the staff - nothing was too much trouble - every member of staff was helpful and friendly. I can't single out any one person as the quality of service was outstanding throughout.As an extra bit of information, a tour company runs tours from the lobby of the hotel, so you are able to book without any hassle and the tours are reasonably priced.I would definitely stay in this hotel again and recommend it to anyone who wants quality service, and\u00a0 an oasis of calm in bustling Singapore.", "title": "If you want quality service - stay here", "user": "welshsioux", "date": "July 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 34124935}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Well this hotel was picked from reviews that I had seen on trip advisor. No complaints about the condition of the hotel or the very helpful and attentive staff who made us feel a valued customer. Room we had was on the top floor no smoking room and was set away from any other room on the 30th floor. Fantastic views of the city and the river. Main problem that for a 5 star hotel you only qualify for 2 hours free internet access a day (one hour per person). That aside the hotel pool was ok but the breakfast was a little bit cold for cooked items that have been standing for a while and there was no opportunity to get a freshly cooked egg if you wanted it.

Breakfast by the river is a great weay to start your day and the staff are always eager but never pushy. There are more than adequate ways to pamper yourself with a nice sized swimming pool, spa service and numerous restaraunts however the rooms didn't have the feel of a 5 star hotel. There were no tea making facilities (even on the executive floors) and the furniture probably hadn't been retouched since the 1980's. Saying that the bedding was a soft a mid summers breeze anabling me to have a great night's sleep even after a frustrating day looking around the Singapore Expo. Food was also a suprising low point of the hotel. We had our breakfast included but after 5 days it became a little uninteresting. The breakfast was exactly the same everyday.
