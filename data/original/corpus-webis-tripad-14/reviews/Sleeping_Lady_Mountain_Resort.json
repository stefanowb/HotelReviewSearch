The entire resort was occupied by wedding guests and it was nice to be at one location without having to drive for the whole weekend, but not feel claustrophobic at the same time. It had a rustic feel without being shabby. The room my friend and I shared was nice, with more than enough space for the two of us - a/c, coffee, hairdryer and the works (no tv though - which was fine). The dining faciliity provided great food, the bar/grotto was fun, and the pool was great.", "title": "Great location for a wedding", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tvlbug", "date": "September 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5731883}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fabulous place to retreat", "text": "We fell upon this place by accident, but decided upon seeing it that it would be fun to try. I'd recommend it for a relaxing, art-filled retreat with incredible scenery and great food. Highlights are watching the big salmon in beautiful Icicle Creek is still fishable apparently, watching falcons(?) soar over the creek, chipmunks crawl the huge boulders, sitting in the midst of a HUGE organic garden in the morning before breakfast, swimming in the heated rock pool, the hot tub, and hiking the property. I can't imagine how beautiful it must be in winter. We liked it so much we're going back in 2 weeks for the Levenworth (too cheesy to be believed!) concerts.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ch&mi", "date": "August 15, 2006", "id": 5613304}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "\"Gem in the woods!\"", "text": "We celebrated my mother's 75th birthday at the Sleeping Lady recently, there were 13 or us, including 6 children. Sleeping Lady is that rare gem where all age groups and tastes are met with high approval. The kids played in the snow, skiied at a cozy, local ski hill, and played in the game room. But, best of all, there was no television! The adults, all of us food snobs, thouroughly enjoyed the delicious meals that were lovingly prepared.

The Sleeping Lady Resort made it possible for all 24 of us to spend a relaxed, fun Christmas vacation together - definate quality time! Though the gang ranged from age 15 months to 70 years we found plenty to do and an abundance of great food at the Sleeping Lady. The Christmas eve and Christmas dinners were well prepared and presented with excellent service, and they happily prepared special meals for the finicky kid eaters. The Christmas eve program was beautiful, and adults enjoyed getting together at the Grotto for drinks while the kids were able to stay in their cabin and play. Snow was great, sledding and cross-country skiing very fun, all over a great experience. The cabins, however were a bit cramped for a family of five - would recommend that they try adjoining several of the rooms together. We'd definately do it again, was wonderful to be pampered while others did the work.", "title": "Stress-free family reunion", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "washington_wahine", "date": "December 27, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 2945774}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "After the holidays relaxation", "text": "This year will be our fourth annual get-away to Sleeping Lady.
