And in the fall, if we need to be online, it's nice to sit by the fire in the main room. The hiking is terrific ... Offering hikes for all abilities. Please be mindful of deer as you are driving. Speaking of deer, we are always treated to a visit or two by a deer family as we enjoy the views of Luray from our balcony.

This is not a luxury hotel -- no TV or phone, but a comfortable bed with clean sheets. The furniture is worn, but sturdy -- it feels like a mountain retreat should feel -- cozy, comfortable and remote. Reminders are everywhere that you are in a nature area -- a recycling bin in our room, soap dispensers instead of plastic bottles of toiletries, reminders to save your towel and that sheets are not changed daily. Through hikers from the Appalachian trail share the lobby with the regular guests, as they stop to get a good meal and a shower. Special trash cans to keep out the wildlife are everywhere and signs to remind us to \"leave no trace on the trails.\" Anyone who is in this type of atmosphere should \"get\" that its not a spa or a fancy resort. We've stayed in many lodges run by Aramark, including the Grand Canyon, Zion, and Bryce Canyon National Parks out west. Shenandoah is typical of these lodges and measures up nicely to their standards. We love the restaurants at Shenandoah and make sure we have a hearty breakfast before hitting the trails. To save money we bring a cooler and pack lunches for the trail, but we eat at least one dinner in Skyland and one in Big Meadows while we're visiting. Bottom line, do not expect luxury in your accommodations, but instead come prepared to be awed by the natural splendor you will find instead.", "title": "Rustic beauty", "user": "Diane L", "date": "October 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142983580}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you want de luxe elegance, don't come here. But you wouldn't anyhow. This hotel is on Skyline Drive in the Shenandoah national park, and its the oldest hotel in the park, and it shows. The rooms are rustic, a bit dingy. But there was good heating, the bed was comfortable, however the bathroom was a bit mingy. No Internet access in the rooms, phone or TV, only in the lounge and restaurant. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Average food. Fantastic views, especially the sunsets. We saw deer nearby during breakfast. The trees are of course wonderful, glowing colours in the fall, it's a very special place. Summary, if you want more luxury you would do just as well to stay outside the park, it costs $15 to drive in but the pass lasts for a week.
