They can't be stoppin at the same place! I have stopped here seven times now and loved every minute of my stays. maybe it has something to do with attitudes? The staff are always charming and helpful, although I don't think I have ever seen the same person twice. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and clean. I have never had a 'small' room. The bathrooms (I expect a high standard) are lovely, with nice complimentary toiletries and plenty of large, clean towels. Every room has had an iron, coffee making facilities and hairdryer. I usually arrive late and order from room service and the service is quick, 20 mins, and the food is delicious. Tonight I was checked in quickly and charmingly (is that a real word?). My last stay was the night of the wildcat strike by BA and the hotel was packed out. Service was still good, and everyone was apologetic for the delays, room service took a little longer, but no corners were cut. I am tempted to agree with a previous reviewer that the bad reviews could be sour grapes from competitor's.
