It is rated as a 5-star hotel, but the room provided felt more like a 2-star hotel. The location is great and the hotel lobby looks presentable, but once you get to the hotel rooms, it is very disappointing. We were first offered a disabled room (my wife is partially sighted) and I think they thought they were doing us a favour. We had actually booked a Superior room and were informed that this room was a Deluxe. We immediately rejected this room as it smelt of damp & stale smoke. We were then provided with a 'Deluxe' room on the sixth floor which was drab and equally disappointing in its appearance and cleanliness. The carpet was dirty and does not appear to be vaccumed, the sheets and valance looked grubby and all in all the room had a tiredness to it.. The bathroom had no fan, there was mildew and mould over the grouting and wall tiles. The grouting looked as though it had been done by an amateur.
