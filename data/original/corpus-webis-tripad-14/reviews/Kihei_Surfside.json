Generally, this place is good value. But be aware of the realities of value-priced South Kihei lodging. Positives: 1) the view is breathtaking; 2) the complex grounds are superb; 3) the beach and nearby snorkling are great; 4) it's convenient. Consider these issues: 1) each unit is privately owned and in various states of repair due to typical 340+ days rented each year; 2) the atmosphere is family oriented and generally noisy; 3) the units do not have washers/dryers - expect to share the coin operated laundry; 4) the small pool is noisy with screaming kids in the mid AM and before dinner; 5) the elevators are noisy re units adjacent - bells for stops at each floor with metalic squeaks and beeps; 6) at least 25% of nights, your cohort residents will return to their units between 12A and 2A, intoxicated and standing in common areas involved in cell phone conversations with far-away girlfriends and/or business partners. The on-site manager is hands-off and refuses to deal with these early morning antics. Summary: it feels like a value-priced ski resort complex.", "user": "traveler4240", "date": "December 29, 2006", "id": 6511130}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best Value for $$ - Great Condo style hotel", "text": "Stayed at the Surfside during 5 days over Memorial Day weekend.

This place could be about views, too, if you have a unit below the -08s or so. I stayed in a -12 unit and it was fine but I'd have liked a better view for what I paid. The kitchen was very clean and stocked, which is better than other condos I've stayed in. The people are very friendly and down-to-earth. There were small problems with my unit -- coffee maker made lukewarm coffee, leaky showerhead, curtains that didn't open/close easily, broken screen door, not enough blankets -- but these were small things. There's no A/C but the fans and breezes kept us quite cool. The unit included some beach chairs to use, which was REALLY handy. Also parking was close by and easy.

Hawaii can be a bit busy with tourists etc. but the Kihei Surfide relaxes you after a busy day of sightseeing. The large lawn area has the softest grass I've ever walked on and provides you with enough room to find a little corner of paradise all to yourself. The view and sunsets are unbeatable from your own lawnchair. I'd recommend grilling at the large double gas grills provided. It is a great way to mingle and meet people from all over the world. Keep in mind this is a condo and not a hotel so you can use all of the facilities at the property. We rented #107 from a friend in Wisconsin and it was recently remodelled. Being on the first floor is convenient to run in and out for drinks, swimming, grilling, etc. The beach in Wailea is right next door and is great for taking long walks.

We stayed in room 610 (top floor) a 1 bedroom /1.5 bath. What a perfect location! Great view of the ocean, Kihei, West Maui, and Moloka'i and you are right next door to Keawakapu Beach (check out the Mana Kai webcam for partial view of the beach). If you are closer to the ocean, you may also have a view of Lana'i and Molokini. This is a condo location and is by nature like an apartment building. The \"noises\" on the 6th floor were negligible. There are other people staying there and one must expect to hear \"noise\". I recommend not getting a room near the pool or near the elevator (rooms that end in 7 or 8 I think). The units are individually owned and the quality does vary (please include room # in review). Ours was clean and comfortable but not luxurious. We had no complaints. It had all the comforts of home that we needed and more. The office staff is friendly and helpful. The grounds are immaculate and well maintained. We thought that we got a great deal at $165/night compared to what you pay at other places that don't even have the same great location. It is not directly on a sandy beach but on a rocky reef. This makes for excellent snorkeling with a large variety of fish. We saw more fish there than on our dive. We would definately stay at the Surfside again if we returned to Maui.
