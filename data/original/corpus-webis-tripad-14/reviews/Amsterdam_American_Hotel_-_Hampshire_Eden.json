My biggest disappointment is the 1 hour + I spent upon arrival with computer tech supprt trying to get my laptop to work in the room. All to no avail.

There is dial up in the room, but the cable hookup in 429 seems not to work (several lights don't work either) - what century are we in, anyway?? I have wireless hotel room connections in Haiti (!), why not Amsterdam?? When I complained, the front desk put me on to the Internet provider - a bit of a cop out for a 4-star hotel. The cable TV \"bouquet\" is also a bit odd - for the \"American Hotel\" there is no CNN (and very little English news), but lots of US sitcomes with Jennifer Aniston as a (seeming) teenager - what's with that?.

Boom Chicago is also where you sign up for the St. Nicholas canal ride which is a small boat tour of the canals. The hotel is also within walking distance of Mike's Bikes where you can take a city or countryside tour on bikes. We did the countryside tour which was fabulous.
