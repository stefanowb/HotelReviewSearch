Although the hotel is out of the city centre it's a great place to relax and unwind and see the sights in and around Zagreb. We stayed here at the end of a hectic holiday and could have stayed longer. The rooms are very reasonably priced, ours was spacious, nicely decorated with a lovely bathroom and a very comfortable bed. Rates include breakfast which was a decent sized buffet of fresh fruits, bread, cereals or cooked options. Also included is use of the gym and the spa area (which includes a pool, jacuzzi, saunas, relaxation area), you can also have treatments which again are reasonably priced. The room service was such good value that we even ate in our room, it was nicely presented and the service was excellent. The turret bar is revolving and is a nice place to sit at night and watch the lights of Zagreb. The hotel is still new and so the shopping centre isn't fully operational as yet however it houses a coffee bar, bistro and ice cream parlour.
