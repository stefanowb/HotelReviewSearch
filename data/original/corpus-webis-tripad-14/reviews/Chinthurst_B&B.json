Rooms are very well decorated with good quality furniture and furnishings. Breakfast was good. Hosts very friendly and helpful when recommending places to eat in the town. Particularly liked the supply of crisps, chocolates and drinks in the hallway, which you paid for by putting money in the \"Honesty Box\". A nice touch.
