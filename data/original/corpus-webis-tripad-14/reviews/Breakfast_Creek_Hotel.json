He told me in a very brusque tone that I would have to return to the table as the children who btw included a 17, year old, a 16 year old and a 13 old as well as the nine year old, were unsupervised. They were in sight and quietly sitting at the table. As there is no table service I asked how I was to get drinks. The response was \"not my problem, but if you don't return you will be told to leave.\" As I had ordered the drinks I told him I would remain at the bar and collect them before returning to the table. Well this really set him off. Luckily the drinks arrived quite quickly and yet as I gathered them and went back to the table this 'security officer\" was so close as to make carrying the drinks through a somewhat crowded area quite difficult. He was constantly quoting the Liqour act and talkign to me in such a derogatory fashion that I asked to see a manager. He declined to speak to a manager and when back at the table he stood no more than 1 metre away and continued his diatribe whilst staring at me and the minors with me. Upon been asked to move away he said\" As this is a high traffic area I am required under the liqour act to stand here.\"", "user": "Young J", "date": "December 23, 2011", "id": 122013983}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Always A Great Feed", "text": "I again asked to see a manager and was again rebuffed.

We had hear about it from some locals. It was really interesting that you go up to the counter to order, receive a beeper and then retrieve your order when done. You can eat in the spanish garden and have wait staff but you pay a dollar extra. We didn't mind ordering at the counter and the food was worth it. We ate there twice in our week stay and enjoyed it both times. MY husband ordered two different cut of the Wagyu and I stuck with the filet mignon. You get a choice of sauces and sides. The atmosphere was different depending on were you sit. You have your choice of the beer garden, a space with two large TVs that show the Austrailian standards of rugby or football(soccor for Americans) or a small porch near the secret bar that is great for peaple watching. My husband tried the beer that is well know in Austraila and is servered at Breakfast Creek the XXXX on wood.
