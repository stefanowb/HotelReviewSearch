They come right up close and are amazing to watch. We did not see much wildlife other than the elephants and water buffalo but we knew that this was the case when we booked it and so were happy with what we saw.", "title": "So many elephants!", "user": "lightup", "date": "October 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 180322035}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our guide didn't have excellent English but was very friendly and was always able to get his point accross.
