Tarek arranged this for us and was professional, helpful and friendly, he really is a credit to Sunrise and the team.

They were friendly without being pushy. The Asian restaurant is the best and the service is excellent, so book up early to make sure you get in, it gets very busy. We ate breakfast the the Mexican restaurant as it was near our block. The manager 'Hatim' has a fantastic team of Tamer, Ahmed, Mohamed, Ahmed, and Aslam. They were great and did the best to cater for everyone needs, even at busy times. It's disappointing to note the some people must have left their manners at home and guests were often rude to staff.
