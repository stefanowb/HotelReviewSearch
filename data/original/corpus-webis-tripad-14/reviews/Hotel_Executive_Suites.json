One of the flaws of the hotel is that it is out of the way and not close to the airport but they do offer a free shuttle. For those reviewers that are complaining - you have to call the hotel ahead of time when you are in the shuttle bus area and the hotel will send the shuttle to the airport in 30 to 40 min to pick you up.

Housekeeping staff is very polite and tries to stay quiet near rooms with late sleep-ins. We loved the comfort beds so much we bought one for our bedroom after one of our stays. Rates are reasonable.

Knowing it would be unsafe to travel further we quickly got off the nearest exit and found the Radisson at Carteret. Snowing and cold, we entered the lobby to a warm fire and a welcoming front desk. Seasonal decor and a calm inviting atmosphere put me at ease. Check in was a breeze and the rate very reasonable for the area. A window in the room was leaking but we were quickly moved to another room without hesitation. Room was clean and spacious. Complimentary breakfast in the morning was fine, nothing fancy but hey its free. My one and only negative comment is that the smell of deodorizer was overpowering.

Only complaints would be their wifi service doesn't work so well. Weak signal on the 5th floor but worked well in the lobby. The other complaint is that for some reason you can hear doors closing from other rooms throughout the night.
