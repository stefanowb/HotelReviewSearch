Overall stay was pleasant. Positives: Staff were eager to please, lobby and building itself are beautiful ( a mix of French and Indian at the same time). The vegetarian restaurant Tuskers was outstanding and the service from the manager was really second to none- perhaps the best I have ever seen in a restaurant. Rooms are nicely appointed with huge bathrooms and large windows. Location is great for business travelers and its about 10 min for the airport. Pool is great as is the spa. Negatives- the staff is very young probably average age is 25 and it shows. I dont think in 5 days I saw anyone with any \"grey hair\" working in the lobby so I think some issues are simply maturity. Service in the main restaurant is hit or miss and the business center was a disaster. Staff are apologetic but for a business hotel you need results not excuses. Many requests have to be made twice or thrice- this should not happen at $250 a night in India.
