Compared to the Waikiki Marriott where we'd just stayed 2 nights, this property scores higher for relaxation, about the same on views. We'd not asked to be away from the construction since most of it was supposed to be finished by our arrival, but it was still ongoing in the open air lobby & the new serenity pool; however, we never heard any construction noise from our north-facing tower room, day or night -- only heard it when we were in the immediate vicinity during the day. The room was spacious (even tho it was their lowest class room), very clean, no odors or malfunctioning equipment, absolutely no other noises and service was top notch the whole way. Very relaxing way to end a great trip, & we'd stay again in a heartbeat when returning to Maui. Only drawback was not enough food choices at the poolside restaurant/lounge when the regular restaurant is closed, but you get SPECTACULAR sunset views from there. The beds were not the same European style featherbeds we've become accustomed to in other luxury Marriotts, but sleep issues did not occur because we were active every day. The beach for hotel guests is Ulua, located north of the property, and is good for swimming but not snorkeling. You have to use a rental car to find the good snorkel spots or book a tour that picks you up at the hotel. You can also easily access a 1.5 mile jogging/walking path along the shore that's great for exercise in the morning. Did not take advantage of the spa because we were too active with island adventures.
