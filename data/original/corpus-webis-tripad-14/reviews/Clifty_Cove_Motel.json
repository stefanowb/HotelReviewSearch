By A Yahoo! Contributor, 07/26/09We had been driving the costal highway all day from the east, stopped here to check the room rates, 96.05 Canadian dollars per night. Desk clerk, her home is attached to the office, not friendly at all. About 830pm, she tells us everything, including the restaurant closes at 9pm in Peggy's Cove. We rushed back to it and got in just before closing. Showed back up at Clifty Cove at 10:20pm. Lady who runs the motel was hateful, she said she stated earlier that check in time is 10pm, and didn't want to let us look at the room first, the outside does look rather aged. So, we sign up, go to our room, outta there. The outside makes the drab, ancient furniture, and the warped old brown paneling on the wall downright depressing. We went back in under six minutes according to reciepts and asked for a refund. Motel lady was nasty hateful telling us we were quiet the nuisance. We had been polite with her at all times. She snatches a booklet out of her drawer telling me she couldn't give a refund then late admitted she didn't know how. Read her instruction book for the card machine for at least 10 minutes, keys everything in, and tells us a refund is complete. I told her the reciept was another charge, not a refund, she basically told us it was a refund, and she was locking the door. We left, GPS'ed back 15 minutes to Big Lake Lodge @ 5849 Hwy 333 in West Dover Nova Scotia. Clean, overlooks a big beautiful lake, man who owns the place lives there is very pleasant, happy to get up past 11pm and rent us a room for 98.31 in Canadian dollars. Got home, two charges for Clifty Cove on the credit card. So because the lady? at Clifty Cove lies now and said one charge is valid we have to send all the reciepts, Visa finds it interesting as well that we have a reciept the same night for another hotel. Moral of this story, unless you like drab run down hotels, with a hateful desk clerk to match, don't bother stopping at Clifty Cove on your otherwise beautiful drive through Peggy's Cove in Nova Scotia. It was the one and only bad experience we had on the whole two week trip in Nova Scotia, honestly.
