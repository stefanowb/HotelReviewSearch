The staff acknowledged me immediately when I walked through the door. The young men behind the counter were professional and courteous. I was checked in in less than 5 minutes. I went to move my car closer to my room and that is where I found my first complaint about the hotel. The parking is limited and the parking lot itself is very tight. If you can, I would avoid bringing a large SUV to this location.", "title": "A silver lining in Tacoma", "user": "MLSTacoma", "date": "July 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115934376}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The room was well appointed and taking into account where my room was situated, I think that most of the rooms have a decent view. In the evenings I would open my window so I could hear the lapping of the water onto the shore - which lulled me into great sleep ... until the noise of the people fishing on the pier outside my window woke me later. That is obviously not the hotel's fault, but be forewarned that there is an unsavory element to some of the people who fish off of that pier.

I slept on the fold out couch - it was comfortable. I couldn't believe how comfortable it was. The room was big and the windows over looked the water. The windows also opened up and it was wonderful listening to the birds and sea life. Some time out side noise was noisy, do to the pier is right next to hotel where locals fish. Once we closed the windows you could not hear anything. The hotel does not have a pool or gym, but it is right on the water and your can walk or jog the miles of path along the water. Resturants of all prices in walking distances. Stayed on a Friday for 4 nights. Great place for couples to get away, but nothing for kids to do at Inn.
