Apparently, AC was not working in any unit on the 5th floor. We went back to reception and ended up with an excellent room on the 4th floor with an awesome view on St Peter's Basilica.

Receptionist and others workers arenot nice as u can expect, they alway look at u are disturbing them. Breakfast is very low, salty food are few and they do not replace it when needed, some croissant and bread. Minibar was included in my room rate (1 coke, 1 fanta, 1 fruit juice and 4 bottle of water every day) The worst thing is the parking. Do NOT USE IT!!!! let me explain: they do not have their own parking the use another one closed to the hotel (50 meters). IF you drive a big car is a problem, If you dont know exacly when you are going to use your car is a problem. IF you try to take your car at 1230 am - the parking close at 1 am- you can find the parking already closed.... last but not least IF you leave the hotel on sunday remember you have to take out the car before 10 am because the parking close at that time. so you have the room checkout at 12 but the car should leave before you..... crazy! for that kind of service you pay 40 euros a day (if you go direcly there is around 15-20)", "title": "Nice place with some spots", "user": "marco.to", "date": "November 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 49389002}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The building is grand.
