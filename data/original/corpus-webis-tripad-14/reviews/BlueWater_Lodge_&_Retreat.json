It is a lovely log lodge in a gorgeous setting, about a mile off the main road so very quiet. The rooms are done in pine, very nice decor and spotlessly clean. There is no telephone or television in the rooms. We did not arrive at the lodge until 9:30 pm on the second night and the lights were pretty much all out; the outside light came on when we got out the vehicle and Winnifred recognized our voices. We did stay in the common room but only until 10:30 as Gary indicated that was sort of \"quiet hour\". Breakfast was included and everything is homemade, very tasty and filling, Winnifred is a great cook and hostess. We did not eat dinner here as you have to book 24 hours in advance. We drove into Lewisporte the first night and got there shortly after seven and the two restaurants were closed. We ate at KFC which was quite good. The price at the lodge was reasonable considering the hot breakfast. We would definitely stay here again.", "title": "Beautiful spot", "user": "797Bicks", "date": "September 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 177453925}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My parents stayed here while on a driving trip and loved it.

You will encounter: absolute Quietness. Lovely, discreet hosts, very helpful, thanks Gary for getting the luggage. Bright, pretty lodge with light colored woods. Huge, open common areas incl great terrace to sit, loungers.View of lake (heard loons call each other); nice gardens too. Bathroom on the small side but clean and layout is good; great shower. Standard rooms are not very spacious, but okay; I loved being able to have the window open all night. The bed was very cozy. No rugs or carpet, all hardwood. Everything very clean. No Internet, or TV, but magazines and games. Must eat here! Bring own wine. Dinner consisted of three courses, fresh, tasty, healthy. Winifred is a very good cook. Breakfast was an tasty omelet filled with fresh vegetables and cheese, buttered homemade toast, jam, orange juice and coffee or tea- plenty to start into the day. I will definitely make this a stop whenever I am in the Area.", "title": "Quiet, Peaceful, Relaxing", "user": "Halifaxnixe", "date": "July 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167346355}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012", "text": "We hung out overnight waiting out hurricane warnings in the big log and stone central area and in our cozy log rooms.

I didn't bring wine but the gracious hosts supplied me with a couple of glasses of nice savignon blanc to accompany their perfectly done salmon.
