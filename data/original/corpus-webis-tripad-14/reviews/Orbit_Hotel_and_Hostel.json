It certainly is not a hotel or anywhere near that standard. If you are a regular hostel user it will be fine for a short stay. We had a private double room. Overall it was just grubby and a bit smelly. The bed was clean which was the main thing. The shower was not tempting at all as it was so old and smelled of damp but after a 10 hour flight we had to use it. I'm 5ft 8inches and couldn't fit under it. My boyfriend is 6 foot 4 inches and almost had to sit down to get his head under the shower! I was very glad we had our own towels as the ones supplies looked horrible. We were there during the world cup and everyone was happily up early and watched the games in the communal area which was good. Basically just don't expect hotel standards and definitely not what is on the website. It's totally different now, everything is well worn and grubby.

I didn't even need to lock up my stuff in the lockers or my window and door at night or even during the day while nobody's in. The bus is right at the corner of the street. It will bring you everywhere you need to go: Hollywood bd, sunset bv, venice beach, santa monica beach, universal studio, Disneyland. Also, the hostel offer you great deal for all these above. It also offer nights in town, comedy night in the hostel. Free bbq on sunday night. There is everything around it. Farmers market is down Fairfax. It's a nice outside mall (forever 21, Apple...) with fast restauration such as Chipotle etc... You can't cook your own food but there is a cooker that prepare breakfast and dinner every day, prices are between $2 and $5 and it's really good for the price. Internet is $1 for 12 minutes. Be carefull, the connexion is reeeeeeally slow. I met many people from all over the world and I really enjoyed my stay there.

The location on Melrose is perfect to discover the city and if you enjoy shopping there are many stores real close. There are many bus lines around that can take you pretty much everywhere. If you don't know it yet though, expect long bus rides : LA is tough to cover by bus. It can take more than an hour to go to Santa Monica, 45 min to Downtown. Hollywood is close though.
