There was still a lot of snow, lakes were frozen and some of the roads still closed. But that doesn't mean that there isn't anything to do! We stayed here for 3 nights and it was just fantastic. It was really expensive so we initially booked a standard room with no lake view. When we arrived and checked in, we found out that we had been upgraded to a superior room and it was fantastic, huge room, huge bathroom - but still no lake view, but it was May and it did get dark early and we wouldn't have been able to see the lake anyway - so if you are planning a trip there before June, don't bother with the lake view - how much time will you really spend in your room when you are doing the Canadian Rockies anyway? The staff were excellent, always willing to help. We asked for their opinions on a few trips and they would always print out maps for us and tell us the best time to be there and the quickest route back. We ate in the hotel in the bar just once -it was okay. Good food around Lake Louise is hard to find, but other neighbouring hotels do well priced food if you are willing to jump in the car for a 10 minute journey. We didn't do breakfast either, we went to the village (another jump in the car but just for 5 minutes) where there is a cafe/bakery that does good coffee and bagels, sandwiches, muffins and pastries and it is good value for money. I also recommend the guided tours of the lake. There is one by the lake shore every day (check times with reception staff). They are free and very interesting. Also look out for wildlife when you are there, we saw a grizzly! When it was snowing one evening we also had a look around the shops in the hotel (the bookshop is good) and had a drink in the bar overlooking the lake at dusk. The only downside is the cost of the parking. It is expensive to park there - but a tip (if you don't mind a walk) is to park in the National Carpark near the entrance to the hotel (kind of near deer lodge) if you are staying there in the summer so you won't have to get stung $27 a day!
