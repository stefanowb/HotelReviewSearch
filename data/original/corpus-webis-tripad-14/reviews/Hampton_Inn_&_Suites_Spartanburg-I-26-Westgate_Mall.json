It is a very typical Hampton Inn and Suites. They are quite nice and affordable with a nice hot breakfast in the morning. The location of this Hampton Inn is a little tricky to find (a mall separates the hotel from the interstate and there are no signs to direct you) but it is in a nice quiet location away from hightway noise. Lots of restaurants, etc close by to take care of necessities. However,. what sets this apart and prompted this review is the staff. There were 3 separate shifts while we were there and all were extremely helpful and friendly. It may just have been our particular stay but the fact that the helpfullnes extended through 3 staff changes suggests that staff hiring and training at this hotel is excellent.
