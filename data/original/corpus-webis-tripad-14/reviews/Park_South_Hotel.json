The small size meant that there was little storage space and no spot for a coffee maker or a fridge. As a result, you find yourself tripping over your suitcases a lot and constantly going down to the corner deli for coffee or a cold drink. That being said, the majority of NYC hotel rooms are tiny, and you could pay a lot more without getting that much additional space in return.

I called the hotel directly and confirmed my reservation a few days before my stay on October 24, 2005, and they had my reservation no problem. I checked into the hotel at 4:00 PM, check-in went quick and smooth. Went directly to my room on the 6th floor, opened the door and bumped into the bed. It was by far the smallest room I have stayed in New York City. I did find the room very clean, but if my wife was with me, we would have been bumping into each other. The bathroom was very clean, however, had a smell which seemed to be a seweage type smell, but I could not be certain. The bathroom was so small that I had to shut the door to use the shower. Television was a 19 inch, had HBO, but not movies on demand which I like. Bed clock had a alarm which I used with no problem. A continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant is included in the price of the room, it was simple, but good enough, with bagels, toast, hard boiled eggs, cereal, juice and coffee. Quick and easy. I checked out after breakfast with no trouble. While I found the hotel to be convenienct to my business location, nor did I experience any problems with the hotel, I would not stay there again because for the price I paid I expected a larger room than I received.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 20, 2005", "id": 4038432}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic place to stay", "text": "I stayed in Park South with my wife and son during 2nd and 3rd Nov and it was really a fantastic place to stay at.

Probably if you give flght details in advance they do this arrangement. They also upgraded my room to superior double. The room space is very generous for Manhattan and service is excellent. The room was spot lessly clean. We only had the complimentary B/F and it is quite OK.

Then there is no valet and you have to walk blocks back to the hotel which is not fun when weather is bad. Then I was greeted by the receptionist with a \"YES\". Not friendly at all. We then proceeded to our room with no offer of help.I was told I had a good room and arrived to a closet size room with prison like decor.A bathroom so small even for one person. The comforter was stained and smelled. A tv that was pathetic in size. I went to the gym they had in basement a 12'x12' closet with 2 out of the 4 pieces of equipment broken.

Dont miss the good Sushi restaurant, the excellent Italian Wine bar and good jazz at the Jazz Standard, all three are just around the block on 27th. Our room was clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Our standard room was small and did not have the view like the deluxe room they show on their website, but hey it's NYC and we were mainly there at night to sleep. We learned the building was only converted to the hotel about 4 years ago so most everything still has a new (and nice) feel. The room was quiet and we did not hear anyone else above or around us. Our toilet did clog one night but they had someone up to snake the drain in 10 minutes. It was a situation easily resolved. The front desk staff and porter staff were friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast is simple but enough to get you out the door to the day's activity where you can think about a nice lunch. For the price ($200 via Price line) I think this was a good deal.
