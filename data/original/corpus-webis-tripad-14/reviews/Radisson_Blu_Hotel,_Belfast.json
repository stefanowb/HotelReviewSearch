Okay, there\u2019s a glass lift and a small water feature, but apart from that \u2013 nothing. There\u2019s no atmosphere, no buzz that you\u2019re in one of the most exciting cities in the UK. Second \u2013 the food. Or should I say the breakfast. Last stay at a Rad was in Glasgow, and I suggest that the whole management team stay there for a weekend, just to get a gander at the breakfast. A truly memorable experience, the content, quality and massive selection is almost beyond belief. They also have a selection of organic items! They have Norwegian brown cheese, berries of all types, scooping yoghurt, etc. The breakfast at the Belfast Rad was pathetic in comparison. Third, our room \u2013 it was a suite in the tower \u2013 was still not serviced by 4pm, and I had to go to reception to get it done. We\u2019d been out all day, was due at the theatre for 5, we were late, so that cheesed us off no end. Oh, and we arrived at 8pm. No offer to help with bags to the room. Loads of missing items in the room, like milk portions (again, Glasgow Rad offers a delivery of a pint of fresh milk first thing in the morning) and missing items from the minibar (for which I later found out we were charged for).
