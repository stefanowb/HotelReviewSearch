While the slider was a bit tough to open, we thoroughly enjoyed access right to the game room, outdoor pool table, and pool. However, it poured the entire time we were there so we never actually were able to hang out at the pool. The grounds are nice, and I thought the pool area was pretty decent, I only wished I was able to spend an afternoon there. I did drop a few bucks in the game room on some old school games like Pacman, Star Wars, and Donkey Kong. Good times. We also took some drinks out to the pool table after the show and played a few games. Security walked by but never bothered us. We never ate at the hotel but we did use our free drink coupons at the bar. The only issue we felt was the bartender. She was slooooow. We each got one drink and while we sat there we noticed that a bunch of families had some in and wanted drinks and food. Well, for a while, the bartender couldn't even be found. Some of the folks grabbed their own menus. That said, the folks at the front desk were super helpful and extremely nice. Big ups to them. I'd definitely stay at this location again.
