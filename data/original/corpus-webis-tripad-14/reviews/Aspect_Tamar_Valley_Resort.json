The quirky factor is definitely there, however its not everyone's cup of tea. The grounds are nice and well maintained and the neighbourhood does look the part - swiss alpine village - not sure what this is doing in Tasmania. We stayed in an apartment style room which was spacious but cold. Dinner at the restaurant was not great and breakfast disappointing. The resort is quite a drive out of town. Its probably more suitable for conferences/weddings etc rather than for tourists travelling around unless you are into golf or mini-golf!", "title": "Quirkyness can't save it....", "user": "CiaraB", "date": "June 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 16710688, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the setting and some staff were excellent, but not all.", "disliked": "\u2014 food and services"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Only stayed one night but thought the resort was wonderful.

The drive to the resort was very pleasant and the views were spectacular. As you arrive closer to the resort, you notice the other houses nearby which are 'swiss style' in design. When we arrived, check in was quick and easy and we were very surprised by the quality of our room. It was wonderful and it is a shame there are not more photos of the hotel section available for people to view. There is a lovely sweeping staircase which leads up to the top floor of the hotel which is were we stayed. We loved the purple feature walls and the decor was excellent. We dined at the restaurant for tea and it was wonderful. The food and service was fantastic and they even let us take a chocolate mousse back to our room. There are many activities to participate in at the resort, however they are pricey and it is a shame there are hardly any complementary activities for hotel guests. Following a fantastic meal at the hotel we had high hopes for breakfast, but unfortunately it was not what we had expected. If this wasn't included as part of our deal, we would have given this a miss. Probably more suited to families. All in all a fantastic place to stay and staff are very obliging.
