Great location - really close to Nathan Road (main road), shopping, ferry terminals and all amenities. It's also very well known by taxi drivers and the free shuttle service from the Kowloon Airport Express terminal, which is very handy! Staff very friendly and helpful. I found my room plenty spacious enough and spotlessly clean. Beds do have fairly hard mattresses, but I found them very comfortable. Rooms also have air conditioning and temperature control, so all in all, it's easy to make yourself comfortable. I couldn't have asked for any more and thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "FayeW", "date": "January 18, 2007", "id": 6615934}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Great Location, very basic hotel", "text": "We have a young family and travel a lot from Australia. We have been to Hong Kong many times but it was our first at the Kimberley Hotel. Our travel agent had put in two requests to ensure we had inteconnecting rooms and on arrival when I enquired that this was the case, the staff assured me that we had inteconnecting rooms. We then found that the rooms were across the hall and therefore my husband and I had to sleep in separate rooms for the 10 nights. We paid to sleep 3 in each room and the first room only slept 2. So we had to sleep 2 children in one fold out bed, which was not very comfortable.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Perthfamily", "date": "January 7, 2007", "id": 6560620}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "The breakfast was fine and the service ranged from acceptable to poor.
