It was late in the afternoon, but we decided to slip down to the outdoor pool for a quick swim...donned the bathrobes and slippers and went down to the spa level... only to be informed that access to the pool was reserved for paying guests of the spa, and would require an additional EUR 13 per person per day. We were outraged that the hotel, which advertised an outdoor pool, had not informed us of the policy, which apparently only changed as of June 1st.
