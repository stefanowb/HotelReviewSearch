I was very spacious with two bedrooms and two baths with a view of the swiimming pool and bay beyond. Everything was provided. The only negative was that there was only four of everything: four dinner plates, four soup or cereal bowls, four water glasses, four forks, four knives, four teaspoons, etc. and etc. So for two couples plus a two year old we were constantly having to wash dishes or run the dishwasher--an inconvenience to be sure.
