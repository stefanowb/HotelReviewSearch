While the reviews were great and the retreat's website looked very nice, we were not prepared for how TRULY wonderful, beautiful, warm, and accomodating this place would be! The retreat itself is in a great location and is so pretty - it's large and spacious, yet cozy, well-maintianed and decorated. Our suite (The Pearl) was gorgeous and absolutely perfect for our honeymoon - including a comfy king size bed, spacious and unique bath/vanity, sitting area, and large double-head shower, private jacuzzi and sauna - all with incredible views of the mountains, ski area, and the town of Crested Butte below. To top if off, the husband-wife management team was absolutely delightful and professional - they saw to our every need and answered every possible question about things to do in the area. Breakfast was delicious as we ate out on the back deck and enjoyed the views - relaxing to enjoy a movie on the big screen or playing games in one of the entertainment rooms is a treat for a couple or a family. We'll go back again - for anniversary celebrations and any other good excuse we can come up with! :) We highly recommend you book some time here - I can't imagine you wouldn't enjoy it as much as we did.", "title": "Can't say enough WONDERFUL things about this retreat and its staff!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "2ColoradoTravelerz", "date": "May 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 16547679, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Professional and helpful staff, great location, beautiful views, amazing room with incredible amenities", "disliked": "\u2014 Loved everything - can't think of anything"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I spent two nights at the Retreat over Memorial Day Weekend.

I had done a lot of research before selecting our accommodations in Crested Butte, and I was glad to see that the effort had paid off, as the visit to the Retreat was quite nice and a much more personalized experience than if we had stayed at the big Lodge in Crested Butte. We had the Butte family suite and found it (and the entire rest of the Retreat) terrifically well-appointed and comfortable -- and delightfully warm! There was a large room at entry level containing mainly a TV watching area (with a queen sleeper sofa and a twin sleeper lounge chair) and a half-bath and kitchen and dining areas and a closet with laundry facilities (with supplies provided!), and then downstairs was the main bedroom with a queen bed and a twin daybed and full bath (double sinks, toilet, and shower, but no tub); we did not use the private hottub on the outdoor deck. According to property managers Jason and Allison, the entire property was renovated just three years ago, and it showed (though we did discover a (likely new) small water-leak problem in the wall and floor in one corner of the main bedroom in our suite, likely from melting snow making its way behind flashing). We had a chance, too, to peek at all the other suites (except the Honeymoon Suite, which was in use by a couple we never saw ;-) ), and they're even nicer than the pictures on the website suggest. Although the views from our family suite were nice, the views from the suites for couples -- and from the common areas -- were much better. The breakfasts prepared by Allison were classic American fare, not the \"gourmet\" preparations of other luxury B&Bs but quite tasty and filling. We had good dinners (not spectacular, but pretty decent, considering the remote location) \"downtown\" at Maxwell's (a steakhouse) and the East Side Bistro; at a late lunch at the Brick Oven, we found a decent salad bar and an average burger, but the pizza (recommended by another shopkeeper as the best in town) was disappointing in quality (though fortunately not expensive). We really appreciated Jason's and Allison's hospitality throughout the trip, especially their staying a bit late on the evening of our arrival in a snowstorm to make sure we found the place and settled in OK. (I should also note that Jason's advice to me before the trip that I be sure to get a four-wheel-drive vehicle from the rental car company was extremely sound. I sure am glad I listened to him.) If all you're interested in doing is touring, Crested Butte is big enough for only about one or, at most, two full days of activities, but if you're into snow sports, you could easily spend as much time there as your budget permits -- and I can't imagine your finding nicer accommodations than the Retreat.", "title": "Terrific B&B", "user": "afrinl", "date": "January 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23262775, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Well-appointed, comfortable, spacious, and convenient accommodations; good breakfasts, and excellent host/hostess hospitality.", "disliked": "\u2014 A bit hard to find on first arrival at night, but that's a petty thing."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Staying at the Crested Butte retreat was the highlight of our honeymoon.
