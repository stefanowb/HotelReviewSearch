The staff were excellent and very professional, the food was well cooked, piping hot and an excellent range to suit anyone at breakfast and evening meal. My room was generously sized with a small but adequate TV. The room had a bath and shower over and a kettle and tea making facilities. The bed was very comfortable. I was lucky enough to have a sea view and the parking was easy and free. The hotel has an indoor pool. The bar snacks were very nice promptly delivered and reasonably priced.
