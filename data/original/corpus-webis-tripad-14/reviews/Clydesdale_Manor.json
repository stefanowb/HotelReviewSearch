There is no doubt that Clydesdale Manor is a beautiful building. We loved the spacious room and high ceilings and our private balcony. The interior decorating is very tasteful. However, I have to agree with a couple of the other reviews in that there is a definite lack of flexibility. I did not personally mind having to fill in a breakfast menu the day before, and determine what time I wanted to have breakast (4 quarter hourly options between 8 and 9), but this could be a problem if you have an early flight for instance, as the breakfast definitely adds to the price of this accommodation and if you miss out you are paying a lot more than you should. Other reviewers also mentioned the inflexibility of choice for breakfast, as there is only one hot dish. When I realised that I would not be able to eat the following day's offering due to a food allergy, I asked Wayne if he could possibly provide me with an egg. Not fussed about how it was cooked, I just wanted something a little more substantial than cereal. This was met with an immediate refusal as the menus are made up 1 week in advance and they couldn't possibly cater for me. We decided to leave a day early, and I have to say in all fairness there was no problem with having to pay for the room even though it had been booked. Wayne did offer me an alternative (pancakes - they definitely have something against eggs) but this didn't happen until we were seated at the breakfast table the next day. Quite honestly, I could not understand this attitude. I have tried to be as fair as possible with this review, but I feel it is a matter which should be considered when deciding whether to stay here. We choose Bed and Breakfasts because they usually provide some degree of individual attention, but in this case we would have been better off in a hotel.", "title": "Some things are good, some are bad", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "rennyanne", "date": "November 29, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6233105, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Locality and size of room", "disliked": "\u2014 Inability to accommodate special needs"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled on business", "text": "I recently enjoyed 5 evening at Clydesdale Manor and can recommend it to Trip Advisor members without reservation.", "title": "sensational", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "sydneyderick", "date": "October 22, 2006", "detail_rating": {"business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5985142, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 ambience,incredible hospitality, delicious breakfasts", "disliked": "\u2014 absolutley nothing to not like"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Thoroughly Recommended", "text": "The hosts, Wayne and Lynne, are top drawer and are 2 of the most professional and hospitable hosts I have ever encountered.", "helpfulness": 31, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 12, 2006", "id": 4966233}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Delightful Ambience", "text": "My room was known as the Wellington Room and was very generous in size.
