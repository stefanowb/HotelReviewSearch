When the hotel's shuttle was on the way to the airport for a pickup or drop off and they had room, they would let us ride along so we could catch the metro.

Afterall, isn't that exactly what this type of card is perfect for (hypothetically of course, but alas apparently not in the real world) and should it not be honored ANYWHERE visa is accepted, just like the ad says. There was over a thousand dollars available but the clerk was simply refusing to run it. I can not tell you how embarrassing this was in front of my guest and even other hotel guest waiting to check in were treated to a unnecessary display of attempted righteous indignation by the clerk. Shouldn't they indicate this on their information with orbitz or expedia and allow their client to pass in lieu of another place of genuine hospitality?
