I had such fond memories and I guess I should have kept it that way. The hotel still has bits of its former glory that you can see through the slow decay. All the beautiful crown molding is still there and the lobby is as impressive as ever, the rooms are where the age becomes evident. Hilton has done work to the hotel and continues to do so but they are not going to win the battle with out a major overhaul. Our room was a Gold coast suite with 2 rooms, the average nightly cost for this room is $1,100. Amenities in that room include quite a few things we never had, some simple some pretty major; no bolster pillow, no complimentary beverage, no large arm chair with Ottoman, no turndown service at night, and no newspaper. There is a work area in the suites as well, however there are no light bulbs anywhere in the rooms over 60 watts so its hard to read anything. The hotel was also noisy, the doors are heavy and close hard so every time someone came or left we heard doors slamming. The staff used to be very accommodating but now they are all rather aloof with the exceptions of the maids that stand and chat in the hallways, they always said hello. Our suite had a bathroom with decor out of the 80s and shower mold that appears to have started in the 90s it was so thick. There was also a pop spill all down the wall by our mini fridge that was there when we checked in and was not cleaned up during our whole week stay. The bedroom of the suite and the bathroom also had the distinct smell of vomit which made me have to go buy a strong candle to keep in the room. I was so very disappointed, we will not be back to stay in the hotel again.

Btw, our discounted rate was $325 per night! I now know why they do this. When you arrive and chose to leave due to problems you lose all of your money. Their rate of early departures has to be very high given all the problems we experienced. What problems, you may ask? Our bathroom had black mold on the ceiling. The ceiling in the main room was cracked from the ceiling light fixture all the back to the frame of the wall/ceiling. Every time we open or shut the door to our room, plaster fell on our bed. The carpet was GROSS to the point that we asked for another room due to the mold smell. We were refused another room. There were no coffee mugs. I called at 8AM for a mug and it did not arrive til afternoon (the handle was broken). At 8PM I asked for a CLEAN robe to no avail. I called the front desk at midnight to advise that I had yet to receive a clean robe. Boy they were quick! They brought a roll away bed. HUH!? We were in the gym and asked for extra head sets since there were none on the rack. Again, to no avail. They later explained that they no longer provide head sets due to sanitary concerns. Gee, if they applied the same concern toward their hotel rooms they would not have a black mold problem. If you want to eat breakfast via room service be prepared to wait all morning. We placed our breakfast order for early delivery (7AM). When it finally arrived at 8:30 AM nothing on our plates resembled anything we had ordered. Two bagels on a plate and a bowl of fruit...? Huh!? We spoke with the weekend general manager who stated that there was nothing he could do to adjust our bill because we had pre-paid. He gave us four complimentary meal vouchers good for use in their fine dining facility. This was on our last day! What were we going to do with complementary meal vouchers on our last day. They are invalid the day you depart. If you valet your car they tell you to call 15-20 minutes prior to pick up in the event they are busy. They were! We waited 45 minutes and barely caught our flight out of Chicago. For all those folks who rated this hotel a \"5\" , I can only assume you are accustomed to staying at 2 star hotels.
