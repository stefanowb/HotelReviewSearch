We ski in the Berkshires every winter, but this was our first Applegate stay. The entire weekend exceeded our expectations. Our room (7, I think) was beautiful, very clean, and had every amenity. The room had a wooded/garden view - breathtaking in the winter snow and I am sure just as special in the summer. The bathroom, and room for that matter, seemed new - double-headed shower and clawfoot tub in-room. Remote controlled fireplace, comfy loveseat, minibar, dark chocolate, brandy and balcony rounded out the list of amenities. We are very picky and pretty tough to please, and I can't think of a thing that was missing here. We highly recommend the Norman Rockwell museum and Jiminy Peak. (Previously, we have always stayed at the Orchards Hotel in Williamstown. It is lovely, and was once a perfect retreat. It has now fallen into disrepair and is overrun with children.)

Applegate was so warm and cozy. It was our first stay at a bed and breakfast and they made us feel right at home. They have candies and freshly baked cookies around the house and if the weather is right a fire burning in the living room at night. They also have wine and cheese in the living room early in the evening and upon arrival you will find chocolate and brandy waiting for you in your room. Pam was awesome and so helpful in selecting restaurants for dinner. (There are many excellent choices in the area.) We went to Lenox for massages and the Lee outlets aren't too far away. The nearby Lion's Den downstairs at the Red Lion Inn has live music on most nights. This is the place to go if you are just looking for a romantic place to go to get away from it all!!

I opted to stay in the car until we were checked in. Upon entering the Inn, my husband was asked to retrieve me, as the innkeeper wanted to show us around. I came in, and was informed immediately that some guests prefer to take their shoes off upon entering. Len had his on, so we followed his lead. Then the fun began. Upon entering the most expensive suite in this Inn, my eyes went right to the carpet where there was a dark, round large stain. The room was set at 63 degrees, and Len wanted to know if we wanted any heat! The bed was sloppily made. Next, my eyes traveled to the desk, where a very noticeable notice was sitting, encouraging guests to tip the staff AT LEAST $5.00 a day, more if you were thrilled with their housekeeping. We woke up the next morning, went to breakfast, (where hard boiled eggs meant just that, hard), returned to our room, and found the bed was made....that's all. That's housekeeping, for $5.extra dollars a day? The room itself was $250, so perhaps making a bed should be part of that charge.Used glassware was not cleaned, coffee made in a pot with a broken lid was still there (there were no cups or stirrers or powdered cream to go with that little pot of coffee in the morning). If you leave your room at 7:00 a.m. to go downstairs for some coffee, wear your slippers and best flannels, and a bathrobe...it was freezing. And I'm from New England. This review is not to say we did not enjoy Len and Gloria...just that we have stayed in many, many B&B's, and felt pampered, not disappointed at what we were getting for the high end rate at Applegate, in Lee, MA.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "EVEO", "date": "February 26, 2007", "id": 6840778}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Loved our stay at the Applegate Inn.

The inn itself is absolutely amazing, and comes equal place with my other favorite place in the country. I stayed in October, during the gorgeous fall, and their property is ablzae with breathtaking color!But most of all, I was impressed with how warm and genuine Len & Gloria are, how they seem to actually enjoy meeting their guests and ensuring that every comfort is taken care of - you will find out when you settle into your room, and realize that everything you could want has been anticipated and provided. The best bed I have slept in all year (and I have accrued about 50 hotel nights to date in 2006). Based on the websites I thought this would be the best place to stay in this area, but was reluctant to book because Lee semed a bit out of the action.

I have never stayed anywhere - good,bad or indifferent where the bed linen did not have the appearance of having been ironed. The owner later assured me that the bedding had been fresh & that they did infact iron the topsheet ( you would never have guessed) & that the room was cleared out after each guest. This did not really explain the half eaten bag of crisps we later found in a cupboard of the half drunk bottle of water in the fridge.

Applegate has many special touches that truly make it stand out as a top-notch Bed & Breakfast. My room, which was beautifully decorated with a comfortable queen sized bed, had several windows which made it bright and airy. There was a CD player with several classical music CD's (and I enjoyed listening to every one!), a gas fireplace, a luxurious bathrobe, a candle with matches, and a crystal decanter of brandy on the dresser along with fine chocolates. There were also two reading lights over the bed, which is a rare and very thoughtful consideration. Every afternoon at 5, the owners offer wine and cheese in the living room. Most of the guests come to this, which is a great way to meet everyone, discuss where to go for dinner, and get suggestions on what to do in the area. The owners also provide a well-prepared list of restaurants and local attractions, along with maps of the area. Breakfast in the dining room is lively, especially where you have already met your fellow inn guests the afternoon before! There are varied and delicious offerings of both hot and cold food served at the ample breakfast - you won't go away hungry! My favorites were the baked apple, cinnamon raisin stuffed french toast, and the spinach squares. I also noticed that the friendly staff accomodated each and every special request made by a guest.
