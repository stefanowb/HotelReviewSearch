The rooms were ok, bar was deserted at Saterday night! The reason was that most of the guests are businesspeople who stay there during the week; much less over the weekends. Because the hotel is at about a 1 Hour(!!!) walk from the city centre, not many tourists stay there. Overall the breakfast was very good. We payed everything in advance, but when checking out, they couldn't find our payment. It took quite some time to convince them that the payment was made, and only after threatening to deduct it (again!) from our creditcard, we werre to fax them the receipt afterwards. Also, when checking in you are to leave 250 Euro for possible damages or minibar usage.
