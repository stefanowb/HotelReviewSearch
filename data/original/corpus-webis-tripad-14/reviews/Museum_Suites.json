It is also very convenient for the tram stop (very easy to use) if you want to head in to the more touristy areas, and just a few minutes walk to the Van Gogh museum. Although breakfast is not included in the price, Frieda or Annemarie can recommend a nearby cafe, or if you prefer there are grocery shops nearby where you can pick up fruit/yoghurt/pastries to bring back and take advantage of the nespresso machine in the room. We would not hesitate to stay here again.

We chose this small hotel because we like the personal touch. We've stayed in many small inns and hotels around the world, but mother and daugher team Frieda and Annemarie have set a new standard in hospitality for us. Just one example...: I asked Annemarie to make dinner reservations for us at an Indonesian rice table restaurant recommended by a guide book. Annemarie called the restaurant several times, but couldn't get an answer. She didn't give up - she actually walked over to the restaurant (which was several blocks away) to see what was up. At this point, I should mention that Annemarie was heavily pregnant. Alas, as so often happens with guide book recommendations, the restaurant had closed. But all was not lost. Annemarie booked us into another Indonesian place called Blauw, and we had an excellent, memorable meal. We were more than satisfied with all aspects of our stay at the Museum Suites. The hotel is situated in an upscale, vibrant neighbourhood; it is indeed close to the museums and a lovely quiet park, and there are excellent restaurants and shops close by. Our room, the Rembrandt, was very spacious even by North American standards, tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. Can't say enough good things about this small hotel.

We were rewarded by a stunning and bright room facing the garden between Willemsparkweg and Van Breestraat. The room impressed for cleanness, size, style, amenities provided and attention to details (such as artwork, furniture and books inspired to Mondriaan, the artist to whom the room is dedicated). Shortly: an extremely comfortable and very quiet room were we settled magnificently and slept wonderfully. You can get a feeling by looking at the photos attached to this review. The property is located in the elegant Amsterdam's Museum District, within walking distance to e.g. Van Gogh's Museum, Rijksmuseum and Concertgebouw music hall. Furthermore Willemsparkweg is on tram's nr. 2 line which connects you easily to the center of the town (Spui, Dam, Railway station). The district also features a nice variety of restaurants: among them we enjoyed in particular \"Brasserie Kaizer\", the chinese innovative \"Chang-I\" (both located near the Concertgebouw), as well as the stylish \"Spring\" which sits opposite to \"Brasserie de Joffers\" were we had our daily outdoor breakfasts).
