This small hotel was a pretty good find for the price (other hotels were very expensive in Venice, and I think we paid 190 Euros for a quadruple room). Though the property was old, the bathroom was renovated and the beds were comfortable. There was also lots of drawers and closet space for us to unpack our things. The breakfast was simple, and we usually just had fruit, yogurt, coffee, and croissants. Also, the hotel staff were very nice and helpful.
