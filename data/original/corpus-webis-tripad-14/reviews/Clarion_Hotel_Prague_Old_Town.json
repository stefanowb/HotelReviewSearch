We felt the cab driver was trying to cheat us, so we decided to ask the woman behind the desk how much it should cost to get from the train station to the hotel. She told us about 300 krona, which was also about what the cab driver had told us (black cab that had a meter, so we thought it was safe). We paid the amount and thought everything was fine. When we took a cab back to the station to leave, we had a yellow cab (which we had to specially request the hotel to call for us. DO NOT let them tell you to just take their black unmarked car!!!). The yellow cab was 150 krona. It was only then that we realized the girl at the front counter had LIED to us upon our arrival and had cost us money.

We researched and booked this hotel through Expedia 6 months prior to our trip. We selected a superior room and booked our own transport to and from the airport. On arrival were given room 417 which in our opinion was not superior as it was basic and you could barely walk pass the end of the beds. We tried speaking to the receptionist whose attitude was dismissive and very unhelpful. We then experienced problems with the air con and again tried speaking with the same receptionist who thought being sarcastic was good customer care \"what temperature do you want then\". After the console being replaced the temperature in our tiny room still remained the same 24.5c which was not only very uncomfortable during the day but unbearable at night even with the windows open. Although the hotel's location was good for sightseeing, if we had not prepaid we would have found alternative accommodation around the corner which seemed more spacious and reasonable, than our supposed 4 star superior room. On our return we contacted Expedia and in a nutshell agreed with the Hotel stating our room was superior ,see pictures attached and judge for yourself., they look nothing like the rooms shown on the hotel website. Also they did not post our traveller's review about the hotel on their website, just the grades. We were offered \u00a330 compensation and some vouchers for a future break but we will not be booking through Expedia again and they don't seemed bothered about that either .
