We could live with the broken phone, broken clock, no luggage rack to put your suitcase on, refrigerator that didn't cool, the middling linens, the very poor mattress and pillows, and just the general grime of the place, but no sheets was too much. I complained about this enough that they gave us the room next door, which had sheets and more working appliances. From the previous reviews, it really seems that some rooms are better kept than others, but it isn't really all that clean. As this is the type of place I usually stay in, I feel confident in saying I have stayed at better Motel 6 locations, and I really think this place is not worth the money at all. They do have a decent breakfast, so there's that.", "title": "The Best Service by Housekeeping Staff", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Patricia32210", "date": "July 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114973147}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I would not stay here again.
