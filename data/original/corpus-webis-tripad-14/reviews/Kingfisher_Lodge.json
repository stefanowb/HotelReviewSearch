This is a charming B&B in Killarney. The owners were very charming and great hosts. Rooms were very clean, spacious and had a lovely comfortable bed. Nice clean modern bathrooms. Staying here was like being in your own home. There was a good choice for breakfast. Good location in walking distance to the centre of Killarney.

Donal and Ann were lovely, not even blinking when we showed up after 8 p.m. without reservations, and dripping from the rain. There was a 5 minute walk from the quiet neighborhood into the fun & busy town of Killarney. Donal helped us reserve a tour of the Ring of Kerry, including pickup, and Ann took care of several loads of laundry for us, as there was no self-service laundry in town due a recent fire. Take note of the name - the Kingfisher is more like an inn than a small B&B, with less interaction with the other patrons. Our hosts gave us detailed advice on local attractions, restaurant recommendations, and were generally very good tour guides for this fascinating area.", "title": "Wonderful place", "user": "Jamelyn", "date": "September 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 179263492}], "location": {"country": "Ireland", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 26, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 94}, "slim_ranking": 0.166666666667, "description": "A genuine Irish welcome from Donal and Ann Carroll awaits you at our family run LONELY PLANET 2010/2011/2012 RECOMMENDED AND Michelin award winners.
