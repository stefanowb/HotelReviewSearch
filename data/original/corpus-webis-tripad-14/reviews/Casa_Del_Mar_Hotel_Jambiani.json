I loved the rest of the trip, but this topped it off in a spectacular manner. First of all, the wonderful people who own and run Casa Del Mar are so kind and sweet. They made certain that we were comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay. I agree that it was 7 star service as one of the other posters had so perfectly put it. I was ill for part of the time and they often inquired, recommended a doctor and gave me over the counter medicine to ease my symptoms. We also had some money issues and they were so great. We just wired the money from home. We didnt like having to do this, but their kindess and trust meant the world to us weary travelers. No worries. The rooms were spacious and cool with strong showers. The meals were the best I had my entire time in Tanzania. The Seafood Dish was spectacular and the kitchen/ wait staff were wonderful. They really paid attention to detail. All of this and the most beautiful ecru colored beaches and clear aqua water. We walked out into the water a good 300 yards and were stlll pretty much in knee to waist deep water with a clear view of the sand beneath our feet. It was one of the most beautiful beaches I have had the pleasure to visit. I still dream of it. The hand built sail boats were lovely to watch lazily moving their way accross the horizon. I cant wait to return. My friends took advantage of a nice trek into Stonetown and the Spice Tour. They really seemed to enjoy it. I couldnt leave the beach, the water and Casa Del Mar. A slice of Heaven on Earth. Very romantic at night as well, as the moon refects off the light colored sand and gives everything a glow. The water is warm and you can easily take a dip at night. Worth the hour and a half drive from the Airport. There are other little places to stay beachside, but you hardly notice them this time of year. I loved this place!", "title": "WOW!!!
