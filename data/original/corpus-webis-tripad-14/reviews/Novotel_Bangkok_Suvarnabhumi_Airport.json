We have stayed before when we have an early flight or arrive late and have always enjoyed it.It can be expensive, but I have always found it to be a very pleasant experience.This time, we stayed one night before a very early morning flight, arriving mid afternoon.Check in was quick and easy and our room was lovely.The bed was huge and extremely comfortable,the bathroom was large with a good sized bath and separate shower. There were ample toiletries, fruit and water.The gym is excellent and the pool is refreshing and beautiful with plenty of sun lounges, a delightful thai garden area, and giant beachtowels.There is even a swim up bar.I find it hard to believe I'm at an airport motel.There was an OTOP market setting up when we arrived and the stalls were varied and plentiful.We bought a lot of last minute goodies at prices as low as anywhere else and then enjoyed dinner in the buffet restaurant.The food here is excellent and plentiful, as is the service, and we had no complaints.The price for dinner was way less than we'd pay in Australia, so that's a bonus.After a very comfortable night's sleep, the only bad spot- and it's a biggie- was the chaos of the morning shuttles.Nowhere near enough of them operating and of course, someone always wants to come out last and jump in first. It was lucky there were no fisticuffs when many frustrated travellers had been waiting and waiting.This is possibly the most important thing at an airport hotel, and they failed miserably. Even though we woke up early and made sure we had ample time we were let down by the shuttle service.Luckily we were rushed through check in and just made our flight, no shopping time, lot's of running.So, all in all things turned out okay.I've slept on chairs at Suvarnabhumi Airport before and will always prefer the quiet and comfort of this hotel.Hopefully this was just a minor lapse and next time the shuttle service will be on top of things, because we will definitely return.", "title": "I love this hotel,.....but..", "user": "funhunters", "date": "September 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176580705}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed here on our return leg of our trip to the southern hemisphere before departing for Krabi.

Slept well and the morning tea was good. The breakfast buffet was extensive, but too much bacon precooked so a little greasy, same with fried eggs and the sausages were not to my taste. Service was also spotty, one server was excellent the other lousy. I spent all day outside at the pool area, the design very good for short stay hotel. The swim up bar was very good, but they were out of draft beer and the bartenders were more interested in talking about their nights activities and also checking some sales magazine. I went for dinner at Sala Thai, I had a couple of Thai dishes which were acceptable but nothing to write home about.
