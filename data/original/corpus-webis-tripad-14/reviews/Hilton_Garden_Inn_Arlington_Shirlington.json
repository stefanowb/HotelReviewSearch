It must be a very pet friendly area, we saw lots of dogs -all breeds. Some places of business even provided water for pets outside establishments. Parking is free, a definite plus in this area, but it's across the street from hotel (about block's walk) & you are only allowed to park on 4th floor of parking garage, would recommend walking w/someone to & from at night esp. if woman, however we felt it was very safe environment. Check-in is at 3:00pm, we arrived between 5:30-6:00pm & had to wait about 20 min. for our 2 Q room..\"wasn't cleaned yet\" per Musa at front desk. Little disappointed there were no cookies (as we had read about) at front desk esp. since having to wait, didn't bother asking check-in person for any b/c he was working alone & very busy, others also waiting on rooms and we were more interested in getting to room. The lobby area was very nice, clean & had pretty decor, while waiting we decided to look around at other areas in hotel such as dining, conference room, pool, & bath rooms all very nice and clean. The bathroom for women near dining area well stocked w/feminine products in a basket for the taking, this is something that I haven't found in other hotels. They have a pantry near front desk w/snacks that you can purchase & it can be added to your room charges, also a grocery store right across the street from hotel. The indoor pool was small. After getting in our room it looked very nice except dust could be seen in different areas (tables, TV, bed headboards, etc.) to have been \"just cleaned\". Room had a microwave & frig which was nice since we like to keep cold water, soda's & other cold snacks on hand & even \"left-over's\" from eating out, also had large screen TV w/good channel service - a plus for those who don't sleep well away from home & want something other than books. The bed linen was very crisp & clean, however the bed did not sleep well due to needing new mattress. It felt like the mattress had a deep crease right down the middle from head to toe, this caused us to roll right into that area, we were constantly climbing \"uphill\" out of crease on each side trying to find a flat surface...not fun :( if had to do over would have & should have asked for another room, just hate to seem like nagging). Shuttle service was provided free to Pentagon City Metro station (? airport also) for us but expect to provide tips, you can tell by the way driver's leave money showing that they are counting on them, however after pointing that out must say they did show great experience w/driving abilities & were very friendly. Do not expect fast service w/shuttle it ran behind a lot on days we were there & even longer wait time in evenings, if needing to catch a flight would def. recommend leaving extra early. Room service was great in morning/daytime but could have been better in evening hours. We needed clean linen for bathing one night, (we never use room service in any hotel b/c we don't want anyone in our room when we are out & normally exchange our dirty/clean linen from housekeeper before leaving or going out for the day, on this morning we asked housekeeper on our floor for our clean linen but she told us she was out so we decided we could get it that night) it took a considerable amount of time to get it brought up, feel this too was because of decreased evening help which made it understandable. Room had large desk/lamp & great newer type desk chair w/free Wi-Fi & a lot of receptacle's for charging all devices (phone, compt., games, etc.) this (receptacle's) too was more than we usually find in other hotels. The room had a large window which allowed for lots of natural light during day & black out shades for night. The Bathroom was nice but not a lot of places for linen...linen was stored on wall rack inside shower & could get wet if not removed when showering. The lighting was ok for putting on makeup but like most hotels could have been better.The water pressure/shower head was alright & we had all the hot water we needed. The toilet flushed a little sluggish which did cause some concern at times but did fine during stay. The sliding glass closet doors doubled as full length mirrors. Hair dryer hung on bathroom door in pouch & was much better than the usual ones you find attached to the walls in a lot of hotels. The iron & board were nice & worked well also. The room was spacious enough for a large cushion chair & ottoman to relax in. NOW for the HUGE BUT on morning of our check-out date we needed to step out of room to get a couple of washclothes, upon trying to unlock door the dead bolt wouldn't budge in the slightest even tho we could feel it wasn't \"catching inside\" metal part of door handle...as someone who suffers from panic attacks (as well as my sister who was on the trip) & hasn't experienced one in a very long time this was certainly the thing to throw me into one...I called front desk to inform of our situation & asked for a maintenance man to be sent up at once to \"get us out of room\"...housekeeper on other side of door also tried to get door opened but couldn't as she heard us yelling for help...after few minutes (which seemed like hours) called front desk again...finally after waiting for several minutes a man came up & worked on door managing to get it opened & acknowledged it was broken. I realize that for some this may seem silly but ppl that don't suffer panic/anxiety attacks can't imagine what the terror is like...& to think if this would have happened during a fire..it's situations like this that cause the many tragic \"freak accidents\" we all read/hear about...needless to say upon check out we discussed how serious this could have been with the two front desk men agreeing & apologizing for the delay as they informed us that it took a few minutes b/c they don't have a maintenance man on property & \"when something breaks down/tears up we call someone to come out & fix\"...so thankful they didn't tell us this while still locked inside of room. I was given credit back for one night's stay but would not have been put through the trama for all the money spent on the trip!! All of the staff were very friendly & if I am ever in the area again I would probably stay at this hotel but will certainly make sure all things are working properly and will try out bed before bedtime!", "title": "I could give it an 11 out of 10...", "user": "E S", "date": "June 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132979752}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "This is a wonderful property.

We found a roof top deck area, but since it was very warm we didn't spend much time out there. We saw the pool and hot tub. The pool was long and narrow, unlike any pool I'd ever seen. We hadn't brought suits, so I can't say what the water was like. It looked clean. We didn't eat at the hotel, we chose Poets and Busboys which is right next door, great place. What we really enjoyed about the hotel was the shuttle. We called and they picked us up at the airport within 15 minutes. And then they even brought us to our brothers place, because it was within 5 miles of the hotel. The shuttle is FREE, we tipped the driver each time, but this was great since we chose not to rent a car!
