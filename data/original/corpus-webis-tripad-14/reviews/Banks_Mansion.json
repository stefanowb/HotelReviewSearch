The 'Living Room' - the reception area was extremely comfortable with a log fire - most welcome as the weather was not good. Once again the free bar was wonderful. Not just alcohol but being able to get a coffee at any time was great and the canapes that used to appear every eving were very much appreciated. .

Also enjoyed the free decanters of drink - gin, brandy and whiskey. We made it to breakfast 2 of our 3 mornings, very nice but found the girl who made the omelettes/french toast etc a bit stroppy. I think she was just a bit stressed as she had been left alone by her colleagues, but even so she was a bit rude!
