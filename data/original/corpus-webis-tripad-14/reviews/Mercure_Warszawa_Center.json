My overall experience here was quite nice. Room was clean and comfortable, service was not warm but it was professional and efficient. Every day the maid would forget something small when cleaning the room (a glass, no coffee replaced, that kind of thing) but it was always set right if I called reception, and quickly. The fitness room was good and the staff person there helpful. I used the jacuzzi every night after walking a lot each day and it was a pleasure. No pool but I was there for a conference and then walking tours, not swimming. TV selections for English speakers lousy but I wasn't in Warsaw to watch TV. Location is superb for touring Warsaw -- a lot of top sites are within walking distance, with the Ministry of Culture across the street. Hints -- don't use the Hotel Taxi to get to the airport -- mine never showed up even after reception called, then they got me a public cab and it cost 20 pzl less! Also, I would not use the restaurant or bar -- super over-priced with tons of great choices much cheaper within a couple blocks. Food and drink is very inexpensive in Warsaw; go elsewhere. If returning to Warsaw I'd stay here again, though I'd compare rates with the Marriot and probably just take the cheapest.
