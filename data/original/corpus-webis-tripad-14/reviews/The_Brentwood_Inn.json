It was like staying in a small trendy cottage in some ways. Parking is free, and it was great to be able to walk outside your room to the car. The landscaping on the grounds is beautiful-take advantage of the patio with cascading wall of water! Muffins, other breakfast pastries, fresh fruit, coffee, and gourmet teas are included- we ate on the patio as often as possible. Our host even packed breakfast bags for us to take on the plane as we were leaving the next day before breakfast!! We also enjoyed walking through the neighborhood each morning- it is about a 15-20 minute walk to the main street, San Vicente, which has lots of shops and restaurants/cafes. Dutton Books is a great place to stop. Our hosts, who are a young couple, and all the staff were very accommodating and gave us lots of good suggestions about things to do and places to go. The J. Paul Getty Center is only about 10 minutes away, too. There is wireless connection and you can also borrow a computer in the office if you didn't bring one.
