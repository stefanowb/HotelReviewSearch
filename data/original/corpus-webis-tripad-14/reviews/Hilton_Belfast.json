Amazingly friendly and helpful staff, lovely comfortable rooms, mine had a view over the Harland and Wolf shipyards - an amazing piece of Belfasts history.As in all Hiltons a really wonderful breakfast. Well placed for the city centre and CBD. I would also recommend a visit to St Georges Market opposite - a great combination of foodie mecca and street market - my only regret was that I didnt have more room in my suitcase to bring back some smoked salmon and some of the lovely cheeses I saw there.", "title": "Great Hotel - lovely staff who cant do enough for you", "user": "seniledelinquent", "date": "December 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 189107736}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Small niggle for my stay was that the main restaurant was closed for a private function (just before xmas) so choice on the bar menu wasnt great, but the steak and chop we had was good quality and beautifully cooked.
