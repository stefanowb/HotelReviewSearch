Reception was warm and service was excellent throughout my stay. Both the room and bathroom were huge and comfortable. My only room complaint is that the desk and chair were very traditional (no adjustable task chairs) so it was nearly impossible to work on a laptop at the desk - which I found ironic in a hotel in the tech hub of India. Restaurants were good but nothing exceptional. The bar atmosphere was a little too formal for my tastes thus I only went once. If you love to throw away your money, you'll love the attached shopping mall. I found it to be way overpriced. As another reviewer stated - it is a refuge from the congestion of Bangalore.
