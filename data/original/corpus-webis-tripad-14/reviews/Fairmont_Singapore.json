I have spent time in Canada staying at Fairmonts in 2004 and this one in Asia is no different. Neat, spotless, modern rooms with all amenites that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Staff in the whole of the hotel are sweet and nothing is a problem for them. The hotel is above a shopping plaza which includes a supermarket and for those who love shopping, just step out of the foyer and there you go SHOPS..GO GIRLS!!! The hotel is located next to Raffles and you must go to the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling just for the experience. The hotel is just above the MRT which is a cheap way to get around the city, maximum s$1.80 for a one way trip. Orchard road is great for shopping, but I loved Little India, Kampong Glam & China Town. Eating is very cheap especially when you eat where the locals eat. Newton Circus is a must specialising in seafood. The locals are in a league of their own...the nicest, friendliest people on the planet who will help you even if you kind of look lost!!!!", "title": "beautiful, SAFE Singapore", "user": "wendy1461", "date": "February 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 13922530, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, great room, great staff", "disliked": "\u2014 NOTHING"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here on a 4-day family holiday with our baby.
