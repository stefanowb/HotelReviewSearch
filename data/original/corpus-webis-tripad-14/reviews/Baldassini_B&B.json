Its almost exactly in the middle of every spot a tourist will visit in Rome. The area around the b and b is really amazing. Every street is very quaint and picturesque. There are tons of restaurants, wine bars, and gelatarias nearby which were a real highlight for us. Piazza Navona and the Pantheon are about two minutes on either side of the front door. We stayed at the main B&B on Via Copelle. Francesco also runs an apartment down the street which also has a fabulous location. The Red Room can be pretty noisy, as its right on a small yet busy road. If you're a light sleeper you'll prob need ear plugs. This was a minor inconvenience that was totally overshaddowed by everything else.

The B&B was exactly as we expected from the reviews we read and pictures on the website. The room was the largest of any we have stayed in, in Europe. The room was incredibly clean and the owner, Francesco was extremely friendly and helpful whenever we asked for recommendations or directions. Each morning, he prepared breakfast for us and delivered it at a time of our choosing. It was definitely the largest and best breakfast provided by any of the places we stayed. The location of this B&B could not be beat - it was within walking distance to everything that you would want to visit! If you are looking for a place to stay with all the amenities of a large hotel and a front desk that is available 24 hours a day, then you obviously would not choose a B&B but none of that is necessary b/c this place has everything to offer and Francesco is always available by cell phone for any assistance you may need. Lastly, there is a computer with internet access for you to use for free, right outside of your room which is a great bonus!

The room and the B+B were very clean and well-appointed. A couple of big pluses for me were the shower, with great water pressure and plenty of hot water, and the free internet connection available for guests. We enjoyed the feeling of staying in a private residence in the heart of Rome, as well as the perfect location that the Baldassini offered for walking to most of the historic sights. If you look at it's location on a map, it is as centrally located as you can get. We also liked the very good breakfast that was brought to our room every morning at our requested time. Above all, Francesco (the owner) is extremely helpful and friendly, and offers many good dining and sightseeing suggestions that one might not find in a tour book. Even if he isn't in the B+B, he can be reached on his mobile phone, so that is not an issue at all.

The bath in the hall was right next to our room so this was also no problem and was completely ours during our stay so it is not shared with any other quests. We left all of our toiletries in the bath (left it unlocked the entire stay) and honestly didn't even lock our room door half the time.

The only caveat that I would have is that the trade off for such a fantastic location is that there are people walking on the street late at night and it can be noisy.
