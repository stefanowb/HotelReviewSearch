I am depressed to be home! The weather wasn't brill, but I wasn't expecting it to be. Travelled with my mum and my 8yr old daughter and had a super time. The rooms are old - but clean. Food was average, plenty of choice. Hotel itself is a bit tired, could do with a touch up in some places, but the Tunisian people were so so so lovely! They made my holiday. Please be careful if you have teenage daughters though, cos they will fall for the charm of the animation team and not realise it is all a front. I spoke to a lot of them and made some good friends, but they did tell me that they each had about 40 english girlfriends and it was a competition between them. They get the girls to fall in love with them and send them stuff from England, then once the girls have left they wait for the new coach load to arrive. Cheeky sleaze bags! But still, if you can see past that they are all gorgeous very hard working people, their lovely smiling faces made my holiday. The marina its self was very pleasant, have your wits about you though, the shop keepers don't like the word no! The New Years Eve gala meal was absolutely fantastic, a really enjoyable night. They treated myself, my mother and daughter like royalty for the whole week. Please try to ignore the negative comments about this place, some people are just miserable and are born moaners. If you want egg and chips-stay at home .........do you get what i'm trying to say!!! some people are never satisfied.
