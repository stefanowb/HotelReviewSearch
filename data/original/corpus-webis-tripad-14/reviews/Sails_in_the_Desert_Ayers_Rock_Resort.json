From lobby to room, what a delight to walk through its gardens, or to swim in the pool. Loved those magnificent white gums and all natives! And the room you might ask, well that didn't disappoint either. A bottle of bubbly with a card from the manager greeted us. We had a ground floor, which we loved. Gave us easy access to the pool without any lack of privacy. The king size bed had this most amazing mattress topper that hugged you to sleep after a busy day trekking. Bathroom with double vanity was great and stylish with lots of room to move about. The bathtub is a bit high, which could be an issue for some. But plenty of hot water. A nice wardrobe, tea/coffee making little nook with small bar fridge which had a little ice cub compartment big enough to fit a box of ice cream ;-)). Staff was very helpful. Transport was great. A short walk to market centre with restaurants, caf\u00e9s, souvenir shops, ATMs,and a handy convenience store. Take away pizza too. Would we go back?
