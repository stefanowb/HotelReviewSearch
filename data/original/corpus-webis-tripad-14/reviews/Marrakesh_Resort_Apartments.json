The extractor hood in the kitchen was clogged with foul-smelling grease. The matress protector on the large bed was stained and torn. The outlet blades on the AC unit were covered in mould, and the outside walls - onto which the bedroom looked, were filthy with spider webbing, mould and dirt.", "title": "Once bitten ..............", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "nevl", "date": "March 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14378247, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Grubby"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "When we commented on this we were told the apartment could be cleaned for a fee.
