We had our choice between the pyramid or one of the towers. The desk clerk said they liked the west tower best because it was recently renovated. We decided to try it. It was a pretty long walk to the elevator, but we had been sitting all day so were ready to walk some. The room, to our surprise, was very beautiful The bathroom was alot of marble and gold fixtures with a seperate tub and shower. The color scheme was very rich and warm. The window took up practically the whole wall. We could see just a corner of the start of the strip, but we did'nt come to Vegas to look out the window. We decided to try our the casino that evening after walking conveniently over the the Excalibar. We did'nt have much luck. The machines seemed to loosen up on the weekend. I lost $300 the first night. It was hard getting on a BJ table too. They were always full and the only one's with seats were the higher limit.

Our friends had been there before and wanted to return so we booked there to be with them. After reading reviews here on TA I was not sure about the place and was ready for the worst. Well it turned out to be a great trip and the hotel was fine. We arrived on a Monday around 11am line was not terrible waited about 10-15minutes. We were checked in by a pleasant woman. We reserved a standard pyramid room for around $415 for the four nights. The clerked offered us an upgrade to suite for $70 more per night which we declined. Our rooms were together with friends as requested non smoking. (the room did not smell like smoke). It was a standard hotel room clean and comfortable but very far from the inclinator (which was very nauseating to ride for me). My friend has bad knee and requested something closer to elevated so we moved to a tower room (no extra charge ) the next day. The tower room was newer a little brighter (not much) and closer to elevator. We were happy with the move but honestly would not want to pay extra for this room. The only problem I had with the move was we had to wait for bellhop (who had the keys to new room) for around one and half hours. That was result of poor communication between front desk and bellhop desk. I complained to a manager and got a genuine apology. The casino was fun, drink service good, very dark as others have said but not real Smokey. My husband did great in the casino and we got everything on our bill comped. Sat by the pool for a day, quite pool scene but nice( no drink service had to get up and go to bar also no adult only pool opened). Had a great massage and spent afternoon in spa. The spa is nice not the best but nice enough. Sauna, steam room (eucalyptus) and whirlpool. Nice robes and shoes given out. Plenty of drinks and fruit around (try the green tea infused water at desk very good) Did not try any of the restaurants (the steak house was closed) except the regular caf\u00e9 which served good breakfast but service was slow. We ate out of the hotel every night for dinner. Here\u2019s the thing about luxor, it is way at the beginning of strip so if you plan on walking the strip it is not convenient. Last time we were there we stayed at the planet Hollywood (it was the Aladdin back then). It is better to stay central when you plan on doing a lot of walking. I walked everyday and its out of the way. Other then that the hotel was fine for the price.

You can by-pass some of the line by using the \"One-Club Card\" member line, information that we did not have at the time, but will know better in the future. We had a card already. Upon check-in, the clerk was helpful, but not overly friendly. He did upgrade us to a jacuzzi suite, but at a price ($50 per night). He was very considerate, though, in placing us in a room near the inclinator, as I have a bad ankle and was not up to alot of walking. The suite was rather small, but the jacuzzi large and deep, more than big enough for two and was worth the additional money. The room stayed very warm though, even though it was Feb, and the air conditioner made such a racket I had to turn it off several times to get any peace and quiet! We were on the 30th floor (the top), so perhaps the heat rises. We had a beautiful view of the mountain range, but not the strip, which was fine. The bathroom was very large, and I agree with other reviewers, the space could have been better used. The casino is large, but we had no trouble navigating after a few hours. Not the best selection of slots I've ever seen, but we made due. We took in Blue Man Group, an awesome show which I do recommend, and ate at the Luxor Steakhouse, also fabulous and worth the steep prices. In fact, all the food we ate at the Luxor, with the exception of the Pyramid Cafe, was very good, above average I would say, and we LOVED the buffet. The attractions level has some fun things to do, we especially enjoyed the Imax Theater. The location was good for us, as we had shows at NyNy, which is two hotels away, and also wanted to spend some time at Mandalay Bay (next door). I was disappointed in Mandalay Place, only go if you have lots of $$$. Two things that were negative - comp system is bad. After three whole days of gambling and spending in the hotel, we only got one meal comped, not much incentive NOT to take your gambling dollars elsewhere. However, unlike some previous reviews, I had no trouble getting drinks in the casino, although the cocktail waitresses were not especially friendly, they were plentiful and you didn't wait too long for your drink. And lastly, this hotel is PACKED with kids. If you are not a parent and don't enjoy spending alot of time dodging children, then you may not like this hotel. I couldn't for the life of me figure out why SO many children would be at a hotel in Vegas in the middle of the week in the middle of the school year. Unbelievable! Cannot comment on the Spa, as we did not have time to go, but will say the pools are lovely, and even though we didn't swim, we did walk out there and chill for a while, and they are very nicely kept, clean and sparkly, and the veiw from out there is just gorgeous. Overall, this is a nice hotel, very beautiful in design both inside and out, but with some flaws. Do try it once, but we probably wouldn't stay again unless the rate was very, very low, mostly because we only get to Vegas every few years and want to try ALL the hotels.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "TXCtrow", "date": "February 8, 2004", "id": 1638272}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic", "text": "We didn't mind being away from the other hotels and casinos.
