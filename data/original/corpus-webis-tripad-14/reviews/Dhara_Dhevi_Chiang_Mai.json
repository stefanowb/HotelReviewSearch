Foot paths were covered in leaves which hadn't been swept in days and the bathroom at one of the pools wasn't working. However, the serious violation was the very loud noise, akin to the sound of a jack hammer, throughout the property for nearly 6 or 7 hours during one day of our stay. We called the front desk to express our concern but the hotel had already scheduled this procedure to take place. We were very disappointed that the staff didn't at least inform us when we checked in that this would be taking place, as we could have arranged to stay on different days. We expressed our disappointment to the manager after our stay via email; he didn't reply until I contacted the regional office. And we weren't pleased with his response. We have dined at and experienced the spas at several Mandarin Oriental properties worldwide but this was our first experience to stay in the hotel.

Bicycle rental to scoot about and explore the large tranquil complex at own pace. Breakfast buffet is excellent with healthy options. Consulted the ayurvedic specialist before getting Kati Basti and Shirodhara treatments. One of the best spa I have been at. Highly recommended.
