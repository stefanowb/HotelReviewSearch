Each stay was a good experience. Note that Le Meridien is now part of the Starwood hotel chain, so guests with membership in Starwood's Preferred guest program get full benefits. (If you have status be sure to ask about a room upgrade at check-in.) My first stay was before Le Meridien joined Starwood, and I was in a single room. It was moderate size for European standards, with a twin bed. My further stays saw me upgraded to \"business suite\" rooms, which are quite large and have separate sleeping areas. Each of the 3 \"business suites\" was a different layout, but all had very high ceilings (12+ feet) and historical details like heavy mouldings, classic art work, antique-looking furniture, etc.. Bathrooms were all spacious, with large tubs and overhead showers. Some rooms could have done with less furniture, but that's just me. Housekeeping was impeccable. The desk staff and restaurant staff are all comfortable in basic English. Internet access requires you to buy an access card at the front desk, and it's expensive compared to finding an internet cafe. If you need to do a serious amount of work, pay for hotel access. A quick e-mail check would be better at an internet cafe. Note that if you buy 3 hours of internet time at the hotel, it's 3 *continuous* hours - you cannot use one hour today, one tomorrow, etc.. The hotel has a FANTASTIC breakfast buffet, in a restaurant overlooking Red Square. Food covers American/English breakfast style, European meat/cheese, some Asian fish... and you may also order off of the menu. There is a juicing machine on the buffet, so you can have really fresh juice if desired. Breakfast was included in my room rate, so can't quote the price. There are two other restaurants in the hotel, the Atrium and a more formal restaurant. The Atrium is good for a quick bite (soup, sandwich), but check the juice prices before ordering. The cost of the mango juice is more than you'd expect. The formal restaurant had a big variance in quality - first visit was great, second (and last) was dreadful. (But to be fair, they took the inedible food off of the bill.) There are other restaurants in the area which are good for dinner, so explore a bit. (Suggest Cafe des Artistes, which is a short walk away. Expensive but good. Also, there is a \"Coffee Bar\" place nearby which serves good food and pastries at a reasonable price - local business people eat there. Go out hotel entrance, turn right, take first street on the right and the Coffee Bar will be on the left a short way up the road. English menu available.) Note that if you want to visit Red Square which is just the other side of a highway from the hotel, you must take the pedestrian tunnel under the highway. DO NOT TRY TO CROSS THE HIGHWAY ON FOOT!!
