It's located within easy walking distance of many attractions. The hotel itself is average overall and slightly below average for the Radisson chain. The rooms are small, though they aren't much smaller than a typical European hotel room. They are, however, dated, and the mattresses seemed a bit old. The bathroom was nicely decorated, but the shower door didn't seal properly, and much of our shower water spilled out onto the floor. When we told the management about this, they said that they knew about the problem and told us to stuff some towels under the shower door to prevent leakage. Others we traveled with had the same problem in their rooms. The breakfast buffet is not very impressive compared to many hotels, but the food is decent, and there's usually a good amount of it. The bar/cafe area was nice, and the staff were friendly. We booked this hotel as part of a package deal, so I don't know how much we actually paid for the rooms. Overall, our stay here was ok. If you're looking for a hotel in a good location and don't mind a room along the lines of one found in a dated Motel 6, this is reasonable choice.", "user": "Lacunar", "date": "October 10, 2009", "id": 46495765}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Average hotel, not 4-stars", "text": "I selected this hotel because of the included internet connection, which is important to me during a business trip.

I knew exactly where it was, and both for tourists and business people it's a good location in the city. The room at this hotel (608) was big-enough (I don't expect 40sqm but appreciate when I get them), and first idea took me to the standard IBIS hotels I stayed in. Bed was king, but 2 sepparate covers. This makes it uncomfortable at nights, especially when travelling alone. Bathroom was small but clean, but the sink was very small and drain almost stuck. The tub (no shower) was very narrow, i could barely fit when sitting down, and I am a thin person.", "user": "Joink", "date": "August 21, 2009", "id": 38320615}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "A massive disappointment", "text": "Breakfast diversity was OK, but again not up to 4-stars expectations.

I am going to try to write this as nicely as possible. It was really kind of gross. You see the exterior and your like wow... this is gonna be nice, but then you walk inside and you are like oh I am in 1970's Vegas. It was really kind of an eye sore when you walk in. The employees were really ... not nice and kind of short (quick tempered). We were really tired from our trip and then we get to room wanting to shower... oh it was really very icky looking. Kind of grimy. The room had a fishy like odor and the beds were very lumpy as were the pillows. I didn't really want to touch anything, but I did.... kind of had too. There was a lot of noise outside, but only because they were fixing the road (most likely they fixed it by now). The power was knocked out once and no I didn't use a hairdryer. The one good thing was the food in the restaurant of the hotel. It was really good. The hotel was in a really good location. Budapest is so breathtaking.
