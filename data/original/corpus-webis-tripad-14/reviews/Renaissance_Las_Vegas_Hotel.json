Could see it being a great hotel for conventioneers. It can be ghost town when there is no conference going on. Easy drive to strip and monorail station is not too far away. Parking was free (valet and self) Room was spacious and bathroom had a separate shower and tub. Walls are a bit thin as we heard occupants kids next door yelling and wresting. We enjoyed Envy for an afternoon snack and service was good. Calamari and flat bread was good. They had a wine tasting that was complimentary which was nice.

The Envy steak house is perfect for client lunches and dinners as well. I would not recommend for families as the pool is small and in the shade most of the day.

My wife had a convention so it's location was very convienent....right next to the LV conference center. And it was nice that it was not a casino, quiet. We stayed 3 nights. Unfortunately there were many things that were just not right. First of all we arrived at 11:15 a.m.. We did not expect to be able to check in so early. The check in lady was very nice. Timarra I believe. She told us to come back at 3 and see if our room was ready. After that, we stood in line for 20 minues to check our bags at the bell desk. One guy there to check in a long line with many people with many bags. At one point another bellman showed up and asked the lone bellman if he needed help. He declined, much to the disappointment of all of us standing in line that heard the offer. What was he thinking? We finally left our bags and went to the strip to check things out. We came back at 3:15 and stood in another long line to see if our room was ready. A gentleman named Yousef rather curtley and with a bit of arrogance said that our room was not ready yet. When asked when it would be, he told us to check back in awhile. No offer of a call or anything. In other words, stand in another long line to find out for the third time. Went back an hour later to find out that we could have 2 double beds now, but it would be \"about\" 2 hours more for a king siz bed. We took the doubles. Housekeeping is apparently a major issue with this property. They are seriously understaffed, especially for a not so big hotel. First of all the first day maid service hadn't been around by 4 p.m.. I went down the hall and asked the maid when she'd be by to clean our room. She said would clean it next. We left and by 5 it was cleaned. Then for 2 days in a row, she only left one wash cloth, even after having left a note for her to leave two the next day. I tried to call the front desk but the phone between the two beds didn't work! I didn't realize there were 2 phones in the room however. The other one worked. The bathroom floor was never mopped once the whole time. It was pretty obvious if you know what I mean. There was also a huge stain at the foot of one of the beds. They had a refridgerator and that was nice, but the rubber seal around the door was coming off so if you didn't push it back on the door it didn't keep things cool. We found out that one the hard way. We were there for almost 4 days and the 6th floor hallway carpets were never vacuumed once! I know this because I saw the same debris on the floor the last day that I saw on the first day. What's up with that? Then there's the pool. It's a nice small pool. Problem was that it was not clear...it was rather murky. You could see the bottom, but it was a little gamey looking for me to go swimming in. Too bad, since it was 108 and a swim would've been nice. I do have to say the bellman were very nice and very helpful. Most of the rest of the staff were also congenial. They also allowed a late check out time of 1:30 p.m. which was very nice since the convention didn't end until 12:45. Getting a cab to the airport was no problem and that was nice too. All in all, there are too many rooms in Vegas to put up with issues like these. I highly suggest management look into housekeeping staffing levels. They are not keeping up! It's too bad. I really wanted to like this property. Plus we're members of Marriott too.
