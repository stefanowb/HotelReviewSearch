Overall it was pretty clean. The bathroom was a bit clausterphobic but it wasn't anything we couldn't deal with. Breakfast was included in the price and we ate it both days. It was good and enough to get us going for the day. They offer wireless internet. My husband was able to pick it up on his phone. The staff at this hotel was AMAZING! Very friendly, helpful and willing to answer any questions. Our luggage was lost on the way to Rome so we were without it for a day and a half.

Location is within walking distance to every possible place in Rome; the closest being the Trevi fountain. Our room was located on the second floor, with window opening to our street; good air conditioning system when needed, tile floors, very functional bathroom with great shower pressure, hair dryer and ample room for toiletry. They also arrange limo service to the airport for a flat fee; efficient and well priced; better then taking a cab.

We were looking for a reasonably priced and well located hotel in Rome, near the Trevi Fountain. The Fellini Inn fit the bill and the reviews on TA were mostly positive. So, off we went - one thing that was important to me was that the hotel have an elevator since I have RA and can't do many stairs. On the reviews, it is stated that there are \"a couple\" small steps to go up to the elevator.....that is definitely an understatement. When you leave the lobby, you go down 2 stairs....ok, all is good so far. Then you go up 4 large steps to a landing.....I am still doing well with this. Then you go up FIFTEEN large steps to the elevator! At this point I am NOT doing so well. Then the elevator is so small - it is one person and a bag only at one time. Not a problem. After going up and down multiple times, we finally got all our bags to the room. (The desk clerk had told us \"so sorry, it is the bellboy's day off\") The room is miniscule...a large bed and wardrobe and there is literally no where to put your bags. But, it is spotlessly clean so we are good to stay there. Now breakfast is also included in the price - it is in the building next door - maybe 10 steps away. Again, not a problem. However, no matter what time you go......they only have 8 seats on the ground floor level and they are always full. The waitress tells us we will have to go upstairs.....I take a look at the stairs (MANY MANY stairs) and I know it is a no-go for me. This happened each day...we ended up going to a cafe at the bottom of the road - good food but expensive...a couple of pastries, a coffee and a hot tea = 25 euros. On the second day there, we were sleeping in (jet lag) and wake up to lots of noise, loud talking, etc. And no water. A pipe had broken in the road....by the time it was fixed and water pumped up to the roof....then the wait for the water to heat up for showers, it was 1:00pm by the time we could start on our day. But I don't blame the hotel for this - no one can predict a broken pipe. On the day of checkout we go to the desk and \"so sorry the bellboy is not in today\".....at this point, I don't think there even is a bellboy as we have never seen one in the days we are there. So, for a central location and a very clean hotel, the Fellini Inn cannot be beat but with the steps, the miniscule elevator, no bellboy, and no breakfast unless you can hike many steps, we wouldn't stay there again. For anyone with no physical challenges who doesn't mind a tiny room, I would say it is one of the better buys in Rome where all hotels are super expensive.", "title": "Nice hotel but.......", "user": "CindieH", "date": "November 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120754716}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Booked well ahead for 10th Anniversary - got a nice but small room.

I was checked in promptly and given a room on the first floor. While the room was tiny - it was beautifully clean and the bathroom exquisite. Only problem being there really wasn't much room to place my large suitcase and it ended up on the floor at the end of my bed which didn't leave a lot of room to move - minor hassle... It had a safe and fridge - fantastic - would have been great to have a small kettle to make a coffee or tea though. Only fault with the room was I was on the first floor right above the entrance which meant that I heard the door bang every time someone came in or out. Otherwise it was perfect. Didn't have wireless from my room but they kindly gave me a cable to plug into which gave me good internet service. Emanuella was fantastic and helped me book my tours and plan my time in Rome with a walking map on which she highlighted all the sites for me.
