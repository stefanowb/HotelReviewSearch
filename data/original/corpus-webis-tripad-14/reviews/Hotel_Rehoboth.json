We've stayed here now four times and it just gets better and better. Check-in went smoothly, as it always does, and when we got to our room we found a note from management welcoming us back and thanking us for our patronage. Nice touch. (On a prior trip, management graciously surprised us with a bottle of champagne and some chocolates for our anniversary). Judging from their online reservations system, the hotel was pretty booked for this long holiday weekend, but it never seemed crowded or noisy anywhere on the premises. Our room was lovely, an oversized double Queen facing Rehoboth Avenue, with wonderfully comfortable beds, fluffy bathrobes and Aveda products. I really appreciate the fact that management takes their No Smoking and No Pets policy very seriously and I hope they continue to do so. All in all, another relaxing out-of-town escape.
