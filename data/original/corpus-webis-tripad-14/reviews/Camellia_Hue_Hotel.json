The hotel is located on a busy side street within walking distance of the restaurant district, and we were able to easily walk to dinner or lunch each day. The Citadel is about a 20 minute walk through interesting areas. Food at breakfast was great, and offered lots of choice. But the best thing of all was the staff. Everyone was friendly and very helpful, to the degree that one manager walked my husband down the street, stopping at many stores to try and find a box that we could pack some large lanterns in, for transport on the plane.", "user": "JaffaNZ", "date": "January 12, 2011", "id": 92622427}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic smaller hotel - great value", "text": "While I had some bad weather in Hue.

Also there's a club on the 10th floor which does generate rather a lot of noise for the floors near to it. The breakfast wasn't much to write home about as well, being a buffet with the same choices every day, none of which very inspired. And finally, the advertised \"pool\" and \"fully fitted gym\" were really a joke, the pool being more like an oversized bath but and the \"gym\" consisting of 2 machines next to it..", "user": "Tracyja9", "date": "May 12, 2011", "id": 107971822}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Hotel", "text": "All this was more than compensated for by the excellent service, as everywhere in Vietnam the staff was extremely helpful, and went out of their way to resolve any of our issues.

You can easily walk just about anywhere. The rooms are spacious with upgraded bathrooms (andthankfully a hairdryer) and the A/C works great. The breakfast is a dream - just about anything you could want (including yummy chocolate croissants) is up there. I also booked a massage at the spa in the basement (1 our for $13 USD) - came in handy after a long day of sightseeing. The pool is small, but nice and clean - totally refreshing after the heat of central Vietnam. The primary site to see - the Citadel - is either a cab, boat or bus ride away - as you have to cross the river. Be careful fo pick pockets and overzealous salespeople down by the river - they can be relentless.", "user": "Eat1Drink2Travel3", "date": "April 28, 2011", "id": 106027832}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here in June and loved the hotel.
