One banquet host, Meg, may very well be the nicest person I've ever encountered in business travel. She is a true gem in the travel and hotel industry.

They have done an excellent job using nautical themed decor and upholstery to update and improve upon a fairly poorly designed property. There's a distinct sense of bad late 1970's design (read any of the reviews of folks who got interior facing rooms) but our small room was really lovely -- navy and crimson with gold accents and very comfortable beds. Our view included a parking lot, but I'm an optimist, so we all focused more on the impressive Claiborne Pell bridge and river in the distance. The pool is great and the staff managed some rowdy twenty-somethings on a wedding weekend very handily. More young wedding guests made the 2 - 4 am timeframe quite noisy. The walls are THIN.

My other room had view of the Panera across the street but at least was quiet and the bed was adequate.
