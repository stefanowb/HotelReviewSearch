When I arrived late, the front desk person arranged for the restaurant to remain open for a delicious late night dinner and while dining brought the key to a room with a queensize bed that I had requested. The room was as I remembered, only now with vibrant colors, buttery linen, plush towels, sparkling bathrooms and a welcome, relaxing water pressure in the shower. The bed was so comfortable, I immediately fell asleep while watching the new flat screen television. Housekeeping was efficient, replacing a bulb within minutes. Room service is prompt and congenial.The signature bottled water is a charming touch and plentiful upon request. When I forgot my reading glasses at a store around the corner from the hotel, the concierge, Kevin retrieved them while I warmed myself from the February chill in the sumptuous lobby, sipping a brandy, reading one of the many complimentary newspapers and sampling a sweet. Although I did not have reservations for the Oak Room, the lovely,accomodating hostess arranged a table for me where I experienced a not soon forgotten fabulous performance by KT Sullivan and Mark Nadler. How luxurious not to have to leave the hotel for such high calibre entertainment! The location is central to the theater district,shopping and many restaurants. As a woman traveling alone, safety is always important. The front desk staff and doormen always greeted me personally so that I felt more than comfortable. At the last moment, I went to Central Park to take in the spectacular Gates, Cristo and Jeanne Claude's gift to New York City, and spontaneously bought a print which was too big to carry on the plane. The concierge arranged to have it sent to me and it just arrived!Thinking of my stay in New York, while I am reluctant to recommend the Algonquin, since I would like it to remain my special place, I truly feel this unique hotel and it's staff should be appreciated and highly recommended as the jewel that it was and STILL is.
