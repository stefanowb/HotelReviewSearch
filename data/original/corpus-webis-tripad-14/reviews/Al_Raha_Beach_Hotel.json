The bathroom was fantastic with a great shower and an enormous bath which you could lie in and see the sea. The towels were huge and fluffy, bathrobes were supplied along with slippers and flip flops (nice idea) that you could keep.

The lobby and the rooms were overwhelming, in an oriental-classic style, and there is a lush garden. Staff is very friendly. Rooms are extremely large, I had a sea-view room with balcony. There is a coffee-maker in the room, coffee powder and complimentary mineral water is regularly replenished. No ironing board, no slippers. Good flat screen TV with CNN and BBC. Extravagant bathroom with sea-view and all amenities. Bed very comfortable. Breakfast buffet excellent in terms of quality and variety. Some downsides: Service at restaurants including pool side is rather slow, there was noise during the night, it sounded like a kind of drilling machine. The beach is behind a kind of dam that prevents the open sea and circulation of the water, there are no waves, and the underground is somehow swampy. The water temperature was about 40C, but of course the Hotel cannot be blamed. However, the swimming pool was also extremely warm and not really refreshing.
