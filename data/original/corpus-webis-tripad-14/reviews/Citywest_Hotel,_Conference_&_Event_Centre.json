I have to admit I was more than worried about the accommodation after reading the reviews on this site. When we checked in, like others we were told we were staying in the Golf Hotel down the lane, this pleased me somewhat as I reckoned there would be lots of noise etc in the main hotel from the crowds staying over. The reception staff were not at all helpful and were very rude but we were expecting this behavior from the reviews so didn't surprise us!! We got to our room and were impressed at the sheer size and cleanliness of the room & bathroom. We have no complaints what so ever about the room and the beds are soooo comfortable I wanted to take it home!!! The only other downside to the hotel was the que for breakfast in the morning and I would put that down to the sheer volume of people staying over on this particular weekend. We ate in the Lemongrass Restuarant which was top class and very friendly and efficient staff. I would love to stay in this hotel again on a weekend that wasn't so busy because it has alot to offer and the grounds are amazing. We didn't find it particularly cheap by any means but it was sheer convenience for us to stay here.", "title": "Good Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Gemstar7", "date": "October 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10084485, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The beds are fantastic", "disliked": "\u2014 The check in staff"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed here in August with my son who is a wheelchair user and we have travelled and stayed in plenty of hotel to compair. Service and attention from staff was the worst ever experienced. At check in I was never offered porter service so was left struggle up to the 5th floor with my 8yr old son in his wheelchair and a bag that had two days worth of clothes ect in(not a small bag). Walked past two porters who did not notice. Room was big and spacious but air conditioning did not work and the tv was stuck on channel 4. No movies channels in the hotel so my son and I went to bed at 9pm!!!!!! Dinner in the Bistro was a disaster, service bad I had to ask the waiter 3 times for a wine list. My son had a pizza which he did not like so did not eat, when the staff came to clear away the waiter commented on my son not eating his pizza and when I said he did not like it, he never even offered to get him a slice of toast - nothing. Not the service I expect in a 4* hotel. After this we did not eat again in the hotel, we went to Bewleys hotel (about 7mins drive) for breakfast both mornings. On the second night the tv nor the air conditioning was repaired. When on check out I asked for the managers name to write to him the two reception girls had to ask another staff member in the office for his name. I wrote to the manager expressing my dissapointment and as yet have not recieved a reply. Obviously not only do the staff not care about the customer. I will not return and would not recommend. Making a complaint to this hotel falls on deaf ears. I did try to book out after the first night but as there was a GAA game on the same weekend I could not get any decent accommodation.", "title": "Worst service ever", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "tina75", "date": "October 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 10052935}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007", "text": "Stayed here on the first stop on a four night mini tour of east side of Ireland.", "title": "If you know what to expect just about acceptable, but read on..........", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Baggybob", "date": "September 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8738566}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you can get this for a cheapish price and need an overnight stay near to Dublin this is okay - but if you're looking for any more forget it", "title": "Nice", "user": "SkinnyMinnyDublin", "date": "September 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8718698}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "don't stay here", "text": "dont stay here unless you have to. rude staff. unfriendly, unhelpful, could not eat breakfast (like the 80's).", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "maryunhappy", "date": "May 13, 2007", "id": 7596137}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "absolute rubbish, miles from anywhere and bad service", "text": "I stayed here recently with a work conference, there were about 700 of us staying and the hotel could not cope despite calling itself a conference centre.", "user": "Nicks_gal", "date": "January 13, 2008", "id": 12572879}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Going downhill.", "text": "The hotel is quite far from the centre so don't use it if you want to spend a lot of time in the centre as it takes an hour each way to get into the centre (due to horrendous traffic on the route).", "user": "Buckleys", "date": "January 10, 2008", "id": 12507287}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fabulous!", "text": "The conference side of things was actually quite good with very good food and service.", "user": "sharklegs", "date": "January 7, 2008", "id": 12402729}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Reasonable hotel, but impersonal", "text": "However the rooms left an awful lot to be desired.
