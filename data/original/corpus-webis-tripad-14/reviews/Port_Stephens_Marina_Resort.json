Week-end of 3/4 & 5th June , celebrating the start of the whale watching season, with its party atmosphere made our time there very enjoyable as there was so much to do in so little time. We enjoyed the dolphin cruise very much, however I think next time I'd like to go whale-watching. This was a surprise birthday treat for my husband and he thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. We'll definately make a return visit.", "title": "Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "RAP1608", "date": "June 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3550667}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 21, "average": 21, "very good": 13, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "Port Stephens Marina Hotel Nelson Bay", "slim_ranking": 0.8, "description": "Marina Resort is a great place to stay while you explore Port Stephens.
