Rooms are a good size aircon worked well considering the temperature swung from +28c to -2c over three days. Staff were great- we had booked a tour of the Badlands on the net before we left home, however the 'guide' didn't appear at the time we were told - went back into hotel to check if any messages etc - nothing, so we headed off to do our own thing around the city. On our return, we found, the receptionist (unasked) had located our guide - we didn't have a fone number- she said that she didn't like visitors to Calgary being let down, and had told him so, and if we agreed he would collect us the following morning, guess one can't ask for better service than that!! Location is great for getting cabs, and is just around the corner from the 'C' train terminus.
