We just recently came back from South American and the Rio Dolphin Inn was definitely a highlight in terms of places we stayed. John and Nina were very welcoming upon our arrival, offering fresh juices and chocolates. John gave us a tour of the city and amazing tips during our short stay. His knowledge of Rio is a definite bonus and I feel we would have missed a lot if we didn't have his guidance. The cafe he suggests is the best and we even bumped into him and the dogs a few times around town while we were there. The Rio Dolphin Inn offers an alternative from your typical hotel and a welcome change for those of you looking for something different. The house is a true reflection of the laid back, eclectic lifestyle John and Nina live.

Our specialty is giving you the best quality and service with all the help you need to get the most out of your stay in Rio. Our location cannot be beat: we are surrounded by the city's best beaches, restaurants, shops and attractions and the Ipanema subway, just a block away. We offer you the hospitality and warmth of a cozy home with the comforts of a nice hotel, such as AC, ceiling fan, Wifi, cable TV, quality showers, beds and pillows. You can find cheaper places to stay, and you can certainly find more expensive places to stay, but we honestly don't think you will find a better place to fulfill your Rio dreams."}
