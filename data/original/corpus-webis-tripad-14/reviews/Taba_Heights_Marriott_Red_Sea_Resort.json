We arrived at the airport that is basically an ex-military base - one building, one landing strip. Once you get through the passport check (only one man in a cubicle for the whole plane) you wait for your luggage that is taken off the conveyor and left on floor for you to search through. Its cold when you arrive as Taba is much higher above sea level than the resort so make sure you have something warm if arriving at night as most flights seem to arrive at ungodly hours! Flew with XL airways - another word of warning you have to pay for everything on board - \u00a35 just to get a blanket and pillow or as they call it a \"care pack\"! Once on board the coach its about 40 mins to the resort and the guide is friendly and interesting. Hotel looks wonderful from outside and reception the same. When we arrived we were told no sea view rooms come back in the morning! We did go back in the morning but were told there were no sea view (despite the fact that half the hotel was empty - but they eventually showed us one room that had not been cleaned and the whole balconly area was covered in bird droppings and we could just make out the sea through the grounds). Before going to our room that night we were given a box of cold food - sandwiches apple and a juice as too late for dinner - this was probably the best meal we had the whole time there! On arrival at our room they had not activated our room keys so after a trip back and forth to reception we eventually got in. The next day the same happened again so had to go back to get new room keys. They say mobile phones wipe them apparently!! Room was spacious and clean but nothing to get excited over. No tea and coffee making facilities and we were told we had to upgrade to a suite if we wanted that but could order hot water from room service - make sure you take lots of dollar bills for tipping each time. Bathroom and room was ok but it all needs updating to get anywhere near a 5 star rating. Had a small patio area leading onto a grassy area you share with adjoining rooms. Two words of warning on the patio area - firstly they don't tell you they have sprinkler systems in the grass. Left some beach stuff out on patio one evening and the sprinklers sprayed right up to the doors everything was soaking. Also no chance of sitting out on some evenings on the patio as they turn them on while you're sitting out! Secondly don't close the patio door behind you if you want to stop the flies getting in - it actually locks from the inside leaving you with another trip back to reception with no shoes to try to get someone to get you back into the room! They told us any problems use the phone along the corridor and someone will come down. We found a man in the grounds who managed to prise the door open with a leaflet stuffed in the door! Room mini bar was empty and stuff needed to be left in overnight to get anywhere near cool. 3 days into the holiday they turned up to stock the mini bar and we refused as was a bit late by then so they just left all the drinks in a bag on the floor in the room! We found the room really noisy - you can hear everything in the other rooms and outside - we could even hear a man using his electric shaver and people in the toilet!! Onto the pools etc. Lovely pool and beach area. One pool is heated but still not particularly warm. They provide pool towels at least. No one went in the other it was far too cold. Food and restaurant: truly awful. Buffet for breakfast and dinner and its the same over and over. Themed nights but you have to be really cautious. Desserts are always the same - lots and lots of horrible pastries and cakes that taste the same. We tried a whole plate of different ones and couldn't tell the difference from one to the other. Salads etc are all very salty and oily. For breakfast they put hot water and coffee on the tables none of which are hot enough and had probably been sitting all morning so you need to request a fresh lot. Only saving grace is a man cooking eggs to order or omlettes. Although the main dining area is indoor there are birds flying over the tables and sitting above and on the tables when you leave to get drinks etc as they search for crumbs - not very hygenic. Wine is extremely expensive. I also would not recommend this hotel for anyone with children as there are no choices for them at all in the buffet really - only from room service or if you wish to pay extra. There is another restaurant and the other bars do food but all pretty much the same and costs extra. The Italian restaurant is basically in the same place as the buffet just in an adjoining area but you have to pay extra also. Bottled water is provided - you have to pay for it and they do a \"deal\" for 12 bottles for price of 8! The tap water is ok for brushing teeth only. The Grotto restaurant for lunch is also extremely bad. Sandwich wraps etc. They offer themed nights in the Grotto for dinner but I wasn't prepared to give that a go after seeing them going round throwing plates onto cushions on the floor for your \"Bedouin\" evening. Hardly hygenic plates left on cushions all afternoon that have been laying around and that people have been sitting on all day! I dread to think what was stuck to the cushions!", "title": "This hotel should not be rated 5 Star!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Borisko", "date": "March 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7244742, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The pool and beach", "disliked": "\u2014 The food and restaurants"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Despite being extremely careful and sticking to toast in mornings and the odd omlette I was really ill the last day after eating there and had to pay an extra \u00a326 to keep the room for late check out and that is supposed to be \"discounted\"! That said I ended up with salmonella poisoning for which i'm still on antibiotics. Despite paying the room extension fee because of illness the hotel staff knocked 4 times and phoned once to ask when we were going to leave the room! The staff cannot be faulted for their friendliness and willingness to help but sadly this does not compensate for the lack of facilities and decent food which is down to the hotel at the end of the day! 3 out of the 7 days were overcast and cold which ok cannot be helped but the problem is there is absolutely nothing to do on these days in the hotel. We went to the 3 corners area up the road where you can buy stuff in the supermarket - none of which is priced so beware. Although we are not golfers the golf course is not as stated - only 9 of the 18 holes are open and they keep saying \"opening soon\" and apparently have been saying this since October 2 years ago. Evening entertainment is practically non-existent. We ended up just going for drinks and back to the room again! Internet access is \u00a3100 a week so don't bother with that thought! If you want an iron you have to request it from room service again and it is a rusty old ironing board. We were glad we took some of our own snacks and stuff from home as you cannot buy anything on the hotel complex from their shops at all unless you want tacky souvenirs. The airport is basic as you would expect. You are hoarded into a small waiting area of plastic seats and a man standing outside the toilet spraying air freshener constantly as it smells so bad. One small shop there selling drinks/chocolate etc and some bad souvenir shops. We stayed in Sharm last year and have to say it was so much better than this although Taba is a beautiful area for scenery and beach. Taba seems to be just starting out on the tourist route although some of these hotels have been here a while and you would have thought the large hotel chains would have begun to make their hotels the 5 star ratings they seem to think they deserve! We do realise that you are in Egypt after all and the way of living is very different but that doesn't mean that these large hotels should be advertising themselves as 5 star when then clearly are not. That said it is a very dramatic setting with the surrounding mountains etc and great for peace and quiet but peace and quiet is great as long as you have some great facilities to go with it to make the peaceful holiday you went for enjoyable!", "title": "Tranquility and pampering", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "LazydaysNottingham", "date": "March 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7217998, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean, Spacious & friendly", "disliked": "\u2014 lack of evening entertainment"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned from the Marriott at Taba Heights and cannot wait to go again.", "title": "Egyptian Treasure!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "SteveLeicestershire", "date": "March 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7185144, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, staff, value for money, quality of rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Man-made Paradise and served with a smile!", "text": "The staff at the hotel could not do enough to make us comfortable, but at the same time were not invasive.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "French-Franc", "date": "March 12, 2007", "id": 7122362}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The area is very quiet, the main entertainment being the fantastic snorkelling around the many reefs.
