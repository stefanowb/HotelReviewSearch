You instantly feel relaxed upon entering. The rooms are all tastefully and carefully decorated and ever so comfortable. The food is unbelievable, all thoughtfully prepared by the chef/owner. The sauerbraten is the best I've ever had and makes one understand fully why the Culinary Institute has chosen the Bavarian Manor's kitchen as an extern teaching kitchen for Authentic German cuisine. The breakfast is a full breakfast, more to eat than you could ever fit in your stomach and delicious! The staff is warm and friendly and make you feel \"at home.\" They all try and succeed in making you feel as comfortable as possible on your vacation. There's lots to do in the Catskills or it's a great place to stay and just do nothing but relax. There's trails on the property for walking, fishing in the large, very large pond. In the summer, July, the original German Alps Festival is held. It's a fun time with great food. They also do theme weekends, Murder Mystery Dinners, Psychic Fair Dinners. I understand they are open to bus tours and do special things like birthday parties and weddings. All in all it was a wonderful experience and I would HIGHLY recommend this bed and breakfast.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 23, 2002", "id": 701931}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "The room we stayed in was slanted.
