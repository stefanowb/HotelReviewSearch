{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 218, "name": "Hotel Orlanda", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Hotel Orlanda and the Happy Travelers", "text": "Thanks to Tripadvisor, after much research we selected the Hotel Orlanda for a four night stay in Rome. It was a very warm late June 2004 and for starters the Orlanda had excellent air-conditioning in the rooms! Quite a relief after a day on the town. Back to the beginning, You have to look to find the sign that directs you to the hotel. The usual cramped elevator lifts you to the unassuming entrance. In the small tidy lobby, A young, (as was all of the desk staff) very friendly, english fluent desk attendant checked us in, offering maps and orientation. The rooms (we stayed in two as we returned to the hotel at the end of our trip) would qualify as basic, but were very clean and actually good sized. The mattresses could use a slight upgrade, if one had to find something not quite right. It seems like all the money has gone into the bathrooms which had marble floors, plenty of towels, plenty of hot water, hair dryer and were quite large by European standards. Of course, the view out the window was of the adjoining building and was only picturesque in the laundry on the line with kids playing in Italy kinda way. But we're not in Rome to sit in our hotel! So perhaps the Orlanda's true value is its proximity to the Termini. The subway and any bus to anywhere in the city is only three minutes away, As are trains to anywhere in Europe. Close but not too close as you don't really hear the train activity. (of course, you do have the air-conditioning on. Did I mention it is remote controlled? Just like a tv remote). Once you get the hang of the Metro and buses much of Rome is easily at your command. Location, location, location. There are restaurants in the neighborhood of adequate quality and the streets a bit busy for sidewalk dining, although we did anyway, but remember you're only minutes from transportation to anywhere you want to go and the nice person at the desk will tell you how to get there. Also there is gelato right next door, which, it turns out, is important in summer. One other mention, the hotel breakfast was simple, but fine to start your day and the coffee in the automatic dispenser was actually the best I'd had in years! I'm serious. I don't know what the secret is, but that darn machine did a better cup then a U.S. Starbucks or any other pretender. It reminded me just how good it is to be back in Europe.", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 10, 2005", "id": 3542841}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2004", "text": "What a seedy hotel, location and unfriendly staff. Don't stay in this area of Rome (the few streets near Termini station). It is full of litter, gypseys and vagrants. We felt unsafe and the locked gate for this hotel is full of litter even inside the gate. It looked like a third world ghetto. I have been to Rome about 10 times and this is the worst area I have experienced. Stay anywhere else. We asked if we could get the room priced without breakfast since we had an early morning flight (before they served) and the desk clerk laughed hysterically for 2 minutes...we wondered if he was on drugs. The next morning when we left and we checked out, he smelled really bad. The price was 108 Euro but it should have been more like 50 Euro. At the airport the next day, we heard from other people that they had stayed in this area and felt the same way.", "title": "The worst I have ever stayed in!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "AvidTraveler01", "date": "May 21, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3490699}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "We went to Rome from 21 april until 24 april.
