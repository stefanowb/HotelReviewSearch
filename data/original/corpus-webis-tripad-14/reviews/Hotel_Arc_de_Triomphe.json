We booked the hotel due to pricing and location. What a mistake. Some of the front desk people were friendly while others didn\u2019t bother to make eye contact. The hotel is on a small side street close to the Arc de Triomphe. There are restaurants, ATMs, laundry all within a block. However the hotel is sorely lacking in space or amenities. We booked a triple room for three adults. The lobby is quite small and one person works behind the desk. There is a one person elevator or a winding staircase with awful blue carpeting. When the person at the desk saw how many bags we had, she offered to keep some of our luggage downstairs because she was unsure if it would fit. Even though the offer was nice, none of us felt comfortable with that suggestion. One person went up in the elevator with a suitcase while the other stayed in the lobby. The second person sent the rest of the bags while the first person got them off the elevator. When we opened the door, I could not believe how small it was. Not only was it small, but it reeked of smoke. I had been to Paris before so I was a bit shocked. The bathroom was even smaller. There was a queen bed and a single bed, a table and a cabinet with a safe. We had one large suitcase per person and one carry on. We had to stack them on top of one another. The bathroom had no shelving to set anything out. The towels looked like the towels my husband uses to wash our car. I went downstairs to tell the receptionist about the smoke and she said it is a non-smoking hotel, but they can\u2019t do anything if someone in the room smoked. The maid came in and sprayed a bottle of solution in the air (and on us since it was so small) to get rid of the smell. Didn\u2019t help a bit. That night, all you heard was banging, people going up and down the stairs etc. The second morning of our stay, someone was banging on our door. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do because there are no peep holes. Here it was the receptionist asking us for the iron from the day before. Somebody else wanted to use it. I lay back down to hear the fire alarm go off. My husband opened the door and people were leaving their rooms with their hair sticking up. We didn\u2019t know if we should leave or stay. My husband went downstairs to find out what was going on when the receptionist said they burnt toast in the toaster and they cannot shut the alarm off, it had to run for 5 minutes. Just what you want to experience while you are on vacation. There was no offer of a discount or anything for the interruptions. If you can find another hotel, do it. I would not recommend this hotel.", "title": "There has to be something better; fire alarm", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Joni010", "date": "November 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 145105147}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012", "text": "We stayed in this hotel for a week for my training in Paris.
