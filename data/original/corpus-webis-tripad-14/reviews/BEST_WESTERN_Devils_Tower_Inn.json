We were on the first floor, so the lack of an elevator was not an issue; if that would be a problem, be sure to request a room on the ground floor. We did not hear noise from other rooms, but there was noise from outside from some kind of event with music and voices. The breakfast offerings were sparse but acceptable. From our standpoint, we would stay here again for one night.

There is no elevator so if you have a lot of luggage, request a room on the first floor like we did. Also there is a small downtown within walking distance with a sit down restaurant and a pizza place. I also siggest you go a 1/2 mile down the road and up the hill to visit the golf country club.

Ever traveled with children and the mountains of stuff they require, inc. strollers? We checked in and then walked into town for dinner. When we returned to the hotel an hour later, our youngest child was crazy tired and crying, ready to immediately hit the crib. The crib, which was discussed during check-in, was sitting all folded up in the lobby. We had the children, one of whom has to be carried, luggage, and the hotel expected us to carry the crib up ourselves. I asked the front desk to have someone help us with either the crib and / or our luggage. She made a disgusted face and ignored me. I was standing right in front of her and that was her response? I nearly went ballistic, dropping F-bombs, but instead decided to focus my energies elsewhere, like carrying everything up the slippery staircase. The Best Western chain should be both appalled and ashamed that the people who work in their Hulett hotel represent them and represent them so poorly. Would I recommend this hotel? Not a chance.

The microwave burned up popcorn on the popcorn setting. After making one cup of tea the one cup coffeemaker would not turn on again for about five minutes. It took me two hours to make two bottles of tea. The clock kept making this strange morse code like sound totally at random and at different sound levels. ( It sounded like the aliens were trying to communicate or something.) Needless to say we were awakened by it a few times. The thermostat was IMPOSSIBLE to adjust.
