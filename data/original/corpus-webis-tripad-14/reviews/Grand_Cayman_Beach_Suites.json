They have the neatest Beach chairs I have ever seen and I have stayed in about 10 Carribean islands. And chairs were always available right now. Room was super clean and spacious with a fridge and microwave, coffee maker with coffee replaced daily. Pool is very nice with varying levels of depth, you can sit in it and read for example. Staff and service are second to none really. If you are researching the Caymans then you already know how expensive food and drink are but it was still a shock to us.

The headquarters is right on the beach in this hotel. I have been on 50+ dives in my life and never been on nicer dive boats or with a better staff. They are a little more expensive than some dive shops but you walk 30 feet from your room, hop on the boat, your gear has already been loaded, you ride 10 minutes to the site, great overview with sketches from the dive master, and you are underwater. And the deep dives are guided at no extra cost. Compared to many dive situations I have been on where you ride 30-45 minutes on a shuttle, then load the boat, then ride 45 minutes to a dive site, by the time you get home your day is over. If you are trying to save money diving, spend you cash going to the North wall with Redsail. West wall you can almost shore dive.

Our room decor was bad Florida 70's; auqua and hot pink tropical fish shower curtain, cheezy polyester green bed spread with big palm leaf decorations, flat overly-used foam pillows, just bad. And I might add, not large and not especially clean. There were NO TOUCHES of luxury in the room. The gardens were pretty. The pool was fine although they NEVER had clean towels. On two days we waited for 2 hours or more for towels. And the drinks were expensive and watery made with good 'ole Cosco Drink Mix rather than fresh fruits and juices.
