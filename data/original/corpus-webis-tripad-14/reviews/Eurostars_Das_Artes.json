They offer free intenet in the room , but in our room the conextion was at small bedside table with no space only for the table lamp ,so you need to put the computer on that corner of the bed , for us, non sence, because they have small desk. Also if you want to open the mini bar, that is below the desk no body can be seating at the same time, need to stand up and open. For us very uncomfortable.
