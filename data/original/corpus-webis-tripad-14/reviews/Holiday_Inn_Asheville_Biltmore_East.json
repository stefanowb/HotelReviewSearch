We could hear barking several times during the night, not consistent barking but enough to be an annoying. Another point that needs to be addressed is the VERY loud air conditioner. The air conditioner ran almost all night but it never got cold inside the room. The temperatures outside were in the 40's to 50's yet the air conditioner was always running.

Outdoor tables and chairs had tableclothes with lit candles upon our arrival. Rooms were located together and the wine and hors d'oeuvres reception we had pre-arranged was organized to perfection. The staff in the hotel and restaurant went out of their way to give great service. We did eat a couple of dinners in the restaurant because of the excellent service, the delicious food and the ambience, which was truly inviting. The lobby was decorated for the fall season, complete with fire in hearth. There were nice touches of hot coffee/tea and cookies each afternoon in the lobby; and a convenient computer/printer desk. Having a USA Today paper outside the door was welcome. The WiFi rooms are decorated attractively and everyone raved about the bedding. Bathrooms had granite shower/tub and sink. Each room had a microwave and refrigerator. Depending on the room, some of the views were great.
