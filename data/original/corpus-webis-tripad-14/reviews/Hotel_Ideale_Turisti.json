I think he does not have a good grasp of the english language and looks like a drill sargent but when my husband tried to say something in Italian he was nice to him. His wife speaks no English but the employees that work for them speak very good English and were very helpful. The place is very clean. I needed a room on the ground floor for my elderly parents since there is no evevator . We both got rooms on the ground floor which were roomy compared to most of the rooms we stayed in. We loved the red tiled floor and the steps up to the bathroom. We stayed at 6 hotels and this place had the best air conditioning. We did not have to pay extra as someone stated in another review. The location is right outside the gate to the old town. The beakfast was good but yo9u are only offered one cup of coffee.They have a parking lot as well.

Our family of four found the room spacious and clean. To park the car you have to literally SQUEEZE through the front gate (make sure they have it open for your arrival as it's off a busy major street), into a lovely olive treed car park/garden. The folks who run the hotel are pleasant enough but not overly friendly. The 10 minute walk inot the center of Assisi is very pleasant. The hotel advertised air conditioning but when we got there we were informed we would have to pay extra if we required it. Luckily it was a cooler August night so air conditioning was not an issue. A little noisy at night (off the main drag) but I can usually sleep through noise. Breakfasts were quite good. Would I stay again? Maybe. I guess so. If I seem ambivalent it's because the management seemed to regard us as just another set of tourists (which we surely are).

The man at the desk when we checked in spoke no English and didn't even try to understand us when we tried to tell him that the air conditioner didn't work and that the refrigerator was unplugged. These amenities were advertised, and they were never provided. The room was tiny but clean, as was the bathroom. However, the shower was a hand-held device with a curtain to wrap around yourself while standing in the middle of the bathroom floor. We are big people, but I must confess the shower was effective even though the curtain limited our movements, and we each had to dry the entire floor after showering.

It is not in central Assisi bit right on the edge. The town is so small anyway that you can still walk through it to the opposite side in 20 min or less. The location has a beautiful view from the patio of the valley below. We came in late in the evening and we happy to find the staff so helpful with taking our bags up to our room. I think this place is family run. My mother and I shared room 24 which had two twins pushed together to make a king bed and another separate twin bed. The twin was a little soft so we shared the king and were perfectly comfortable. There is a window that looks out on some trees and the small parking area and then we had french doors that opened up to a patio with excellent valley views. The bathroom is small but clean and comfortable. The shower is just a head on the wall with a curtain the goes around that area of the bathroom, so you get the toilet we when you use it. But we certainly didn't mind since that is common in Europe and this hotel was so affordable (70 euros per night). My aunt and cousin shared room 35 which had one bed (can't remember if it was king or queen) and a window that opened up to a spectacular view of Assisi and the valley. Breakfast was a typical light Italian breakfast of pastries, fruit, cappuccino and yogurt. I only wish they put seating out on their patio so we could enjoy the view with our breakfast. Room 24 has a door that connects to a single room. When we arrived we found this door to be unlocked and someone was clearly staying in it. When we mentioned this to the young man at the front counter he immediately came up to lock the connecting door and apologized. June 1st is a holiday in Assisi so there was a concert and big celebration going on in the main piazza and hotel rooms on the piazza were occupied. We were glad to be hear where the noise was not so bad. When I return to Assisi with my husband I hope we can stay here.", "title": "Ideal and Affordable", "user": "Rndthewrld", "date": "July 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 70838564}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed at the Hotel Ideale for only one night during our Italian vacation.
