Our room was always less than a 5 minute walk from any pool or any place on the beach in front of the hotel - that's hard to beat.

We stayed during the very end of the slow season and watched the hotel capacity change from about 30% to about 50% and were told that it would probably go to 100% by 12/19. So while times were supposedly slow we did see towels being placed on poolside chairs early, but not too early.

As the hotel became more crowded we decided to go to the pool earlier than usual one day. Possibly by coincidence the landscape maintenance staff was shaking the dead leaves out the poolside trees. Dozens of blood-sucking insects attacked us. They were smaller than CA size mosquitos but about the size of gnats.

The other hotels, 2 other hotels, that are somewhat comparable would be the Barcelo or Las Brisas...., but they really aren't as new and updated, as Dreams is. The Rooms ...are fantastic. The other reviews i read are true.The beds are fantastic, decent linens,and very comfy...The bathrooms are new, and modern, with great fixtures.The toiet flushes, and the \"rain\" showers are perfect. Rooms are cleaned well.My good friend and i had separate rooms, in the preferred area, well worth it. The mini bar was always stalked with plenty of bottled water, and bottled mineral water, and pop, etc...This resort, if you are looking for a 5 star is the closest you will get in Huatulco, as the Brisas and Barcelo, are showing there \"age\".....People also must remember, AI's are never really 5 star, The Four Seasons, and W, and Fairmont hotels, are 5 star... to North americans, who can afford to stay in them. But for Mexico, this hotel is more than Adequate, for a picky North American Traveller. The food actually was pretty good. We all have such different opinions on what we like, but like i said, this resort is more than adequate, so there is always something for everyone in the buffets, or menus. We both met lots of people, and really everyone at the resort, had good things to say about it.....The Wi- Fi, internet in the rooms, was the only little annoying thing, as it was variable....but then again, in North America, we are used to great wireless....The sand flies at the beach, are the worst in the morning, so best to wait, til the sun is hot, and they disappear. The pools are clean, and refreshing, and the waitresses work hard, and if you tip them, regularly throughout the day, your service gets better. The lobby bar is great, the guys work hard there, and it is a great place to sip a drink with friends, before or after dinner. If you are a traveller that has lots of questions or nervous about booking hotels when traveling to Mexico, pay the extra money for Dreams, it really will be the smart choice, as the other hotels, in the area, are showing there age. I have stayed in other hotels in Huatulco, and this hotel will give you the best value, and will satisfy the most particular, traveler.My friend and i talked to lots of people at the pool each day, and no one had anything really negative to say about it. The weather is hot and sunny, but i think this year, a few more clouds have moved through, as it is an el nino year, so weather everywhere is off. We had perfect weather up until the last 2 days, but the clouds rolled in a bit more, which is weird for Huatulco, but no rain, and the sun would come and go, so nothing really to complain about. Overall dreams to me was a great choice, if you want a low key, quiet vacation. There is not alot to do in Huatulco, compared to other Mexican destinations, but it is ideal to relax, and rest, and get away from crumby cold north american winters.....", "title": "most updated resort in Huatulco...BY FAR!!!!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "scottie", "date": "January 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 53078875}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent the first two weeks of December in the astonishing town of Huatulco in Mexico.

We had (we got married a couple of months earlier but had to wait to be able to afford such a trip) but they had forgotten to prepare our room. We'd expected rose petals, towels made into kissing swans, a fruit bowl and champagne, topped off with a door sash proclaiming our honeymoon status. We got none of this.
