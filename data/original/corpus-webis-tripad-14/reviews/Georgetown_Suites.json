I have been to DC many times and have stayed at much higher star hotels (this was our first value hotel visit in DC), however the value and location make this a great deal. We had a 1bdrm suite in the 30th street bldg. (603). Perfect for families and others. The size of the room was very nice. We were easily able to set up a portable crib in the living room area and have plenty of room for us to relax outside of our separate sleeping area. Bathroom was big with a standard size shower. While the wallpaper and decor was a little dated it did not detract from our stay. Room was clean and nice it had a flat screen tv in living area. Kitchen was nice apt size fridge, stove, oven, coffee and microwave. Parking was very easy for our suv (below hotel) use hotel elevator for access. Breakfast was slightly nicer than what I expected. coffee, cold cereal, juice, breads, pop tarts and cookies.(many great breakfast spots within 3 blocks) We only went 1 day but it was refilled and well stocked. Location is what makes this place really shine \u00bd block off M at the start of Georgetown. I was a bit worried after reading other reviews but would definitely come back again. Please understand that I rated this 5 out of 5 based upon price and star level of the hotel. They treated us nicely, maid service was there daily, parking access key was clearly not disposable and when given a parking key you must initial that you must return the key or there will be a charge. Parking comes with free in and out privileges. Front desk check in area is small and may easily get backed up, but we had no issues. Did not check out the exercise room which they described to me as small or the roof deck. There is a Trader Joe's food store 5 blks away with free parking. Dean and Deluca is only a few blocks away on M.", "title": "Great place perfect for a family", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Philly_Bill", "date": "June 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 32499407}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Outstanding value, very clean, super location, walkable upscale neighborhood with tons of nightlife, shopping, and restaurants.

This was our first trip to Washington and our purpose was leisure and sightseeing. We couldn't have been happier with our hotel selection. We spent a lot of time reseaching options in the $200/night price range, from the Georgetown area to the Convention Center area and everything in between. While we were there, we passed by most of the other hotels that we had considered and found ourselves repeatedly saying to each other how happy we were that we chose the GS. Some Highlights: Location (staying in the Georgetown area added so much to our overall experience - we loved it there), free upgrade from a studio suite to a one bedroom suite (we booked on Quikbook), the suite was very spacious - great bed and nice living area with comfortable furniture (note: we would recommend a one bedroom suite if staying several nights), 2 for 1 dining card given to us at check-in (only a couple restaurants participating but we used it for dinner one night and had a great experience), Circulator bus only 1/2 block from the hotel - we used it a lot, free wireless internet, curtious and helpful front desk staff, Trader Joe's within walking distance, and pretty easy access to the National Mall via bus (note: I'm a runner and loved running each morning along the Potomac River down to the Lincoln Monument and then across the mall. Some less than ideal features: continental breakfast was so-so (kind of what you might expect for a hotel continental breakfast ), fitness center very small with limited equipment and inconvenient access, kitchen cabinets old and worn and very few utensils (we had to ask for addtional silverware which was graciously provided by housekeeping). On the positive side, the kitchen was fully equipped otherwise and served us well for several eat-in meals. One final note - be aware they have two seperate buildings. We stayed at the main building. While we didn't go inside the other building (called the Harbour Bldg), it's location is not nearly as desirable as the main building.", "title": "A Great Choice", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "bmaxwell", "date": "April 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 29024645}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009", "text": "Came to DC for the Cherry Festival and my sister and I wanted to stay at a hotel we would feel safe walking at night. Georgetown Suites was perfect for us. In less than a quarter of a block we were in the middle of M Street with its many restaurants and shops. The lobby could use a sprucing up, but the rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly and courteous. Our room faced the courtyard and it was VERY quiet at night. We took the red eye and the hotel was able to check us in early (about 7 am). It was nice to have a complimentary breakfast available to us. The Circulator bus was very convenient (only 50 cents for seniors) and the Georgetown Connector (between Rosslyn and Dupont Metro stations costs only 25 cents for seniors. We went to a performance at the Kennedy Peforming Arts Ctr and walked via the path by the river (easy walk). Also a plus for us were the two sinks in our bathroom - made it easy for us to get ready in the morning. The negatives: my husband had a hard time trying to leave a mesage because their phone message system wasn't working.
