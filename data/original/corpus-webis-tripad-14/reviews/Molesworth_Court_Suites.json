We got the power going, and turned the upstairs heaters on, which worked for about 10 minutes then turned off. This was apparently due to one of the thermostats being to low. The first morning we had only warm water, the second morning we had boiling water coming out of the cold taps and the toilet! The tv had no reception until we played around with the connections and got it working. Deidre the manager was very helpful and apologetic so no complaints there. Overall it represents good value, but i do think that a property that markets itself as \"4 star luxury\" should ensure that the basics such as heating and hot water are in order.
