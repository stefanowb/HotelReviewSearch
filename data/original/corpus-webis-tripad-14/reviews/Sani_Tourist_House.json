The B&B consists of a single floor in a multi-floor building which you access by taking the very small elevator (room for two or only one with luggage) or the very wide staircase. I used the staircase as much or more than the elevator. It is tucked away in a side area only a half block from a major shopping street so it was quiet but very convenient. The building was part of an old - I can't think of the word- an old important family residence. A palace sort of place. Built in the 1400's. The front door when you enter the building has some of the old hardward on it, with heavy metal cross bar to latch it, etc. The window in our room had wooden shutters rather than curtains and overlooked a narrow alley (no cars, only pedestrians) and also provided a nice view of the old church's bell tower on the other side of this alley.

I get the feeling he doesn't stay at the B&B all day but comes back for the evening. You will make arrangements with him to meet on the night before you leave so that you can pay him. He was a nice guy and told us a bit of the history of Florence. Not pushy, but answered all our questions very fully. Oh, another thing you need to know.
