Zuzabed is located in Calcada do Doque - this is a pedestrianised street - well more a walkway with steep steps. There are a number of restaurants immediately on this street. Getting you luggage into or out of Zuzabed is the only problem - after navigating down do Doque there are 2 sets of stairs leading to the B&B entrance and then you might have another set of narrow and steep stairs to your room. If you have a lot of luggage this can be a problem. Having said that, I would still strongly recommend staying here - we had a terrace room where we shared the balcony and could look out over Lisbon or down at the diners in the street below. The location is fantastic - a short walk down to Rossio rail station or Rossio Square or a short walk up into Chiado with all the restaurants, bars etc. Too many to choose from.
