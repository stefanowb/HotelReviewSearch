Once you have exhausted the local stores (it is a good selection of smallish trendy shops), not sure what else there is to do. It has that artificial feel of something that has been constructed to appear very cool. Major service issue was that the 2-bedded room I had booked through hotel website, and paid for fully in advance, was given away and we were stuck on the third floor within easy earshot of booming music that went on well past midnight. Staff was apologetic and paid for dinner (and town car to the airport, after I asked), but, in my mind, just not good enough. Overbooking is just not cool, and when I lose sleep and can't function properly the next day, there is just no way I can be happy with my stay.

Decent self-service breakfast in the morning if you need to head out, and the location of the hotel so close to so many bars and restaurants really make it a find in a city like Houston. Free WiFi really adds to the whole package - this is an ideal business hotel on the Energy Corridor. Valet service quite steeply priced however.

Had never heard of the hotel or CityCentre which is not anywhere near downtown Houston. Turned out to be a modern, well appointed hotel with some lovely features including crisp, cleanly designed, well maintained, fairly large guestrooms and lovely public spaces. Breakfast is an upscale cold buffet of quality fresh fruit, croissants and other pastries, boxed cereals, yogurt, juice and coffee, all served in a beautiful lobby seating area. Walk to all sorts of restaurant and shops that are right outside the hotel door. Self park in a nearby covered garage is convenient. Only drawbacks - the hotel promised transportation within a 5 mile radius and then seemed to favor business groups over individuals.

Hint: head to level 3 of garage to directly access level 2 (lobby) of the hotel. Encountered housekeeping issues as there were green stains on sheets which had to be changed. The following day we did not receive housekeeping service and by 5:00 had to request service twice. The front desk staff apologized and we were suprised when a bottle of wine arrived with apologies for the inconvenience. The continental breakfast is average and the lounge was suprisingly dirty both mornings we ate there. The furniture in corridor leading to lobby is shabby. Bathroom is very small and cleaning was spotty. On a positive note, the location of hotel is near great restaurants, shopping, spa and movie theatre.

We at brunch on Sunday (food was great) in the resturant and were approached several times by George who i think was another manager. It's seems everytime we turned around some staff member was offering us help and most of the time it was a manager.

Loved the self-park feature and that you're in a covered garage, not having to shell out the bucks for valet. Only downfalls: Agree with the other reviewers noting that the rooms are rather dark. No overhead lighting. The continental breakfast was also lacking for late sleepers so make sure you get there early.
