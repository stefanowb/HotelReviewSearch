I kind of value being able to sleep. Day staff was consistently better, but night staff apparently view their job as a place to hang out with their friends. I forgot to mention that when I checked in, past midnight, the female receptionist had to be summoned from a back hallway bathroom, and was followed a few seconds later by a young man in street clothes who headed straight for the front door and out. I'll leave it to your imagination as to what they were doing while I waited tired and ready for a room. I recommend trying the Holiday Inn directly across the street.
