We had no problems with any of the staff, all were polite and helpful, in fact they mailed us our bathroom bag after we had gotten home to CT free of charge, which I thought was pretty dang hospitable. The immediate location, grounds, seemed very safe and clean, close to the mall, and of course it's on a Metro transfer.

We had read a lot of the reviews and after going back and forth with this hotel and anotehr, decided to stay here for the convenience, BIG MISTAKE. We arrived on 12/22/07 with a written confirmation from the hotel for a \"Dlx King Connect Parlor\" room...when we got there, we were informed by the manager on duty that those types of rooms don't even exist at this hotel. We also told her that we had spoken to one of her staff before coming down, and he said nothing about that type of room not existing and also \"promised\" us a room with a view as the hotel was not full that weekend everyone would get that type of room. We did give the manager the name of the staff that we spoke to, and again, she appologized. She offered us either a regular king room with a \"view\" or a larger king room with a couch, but no \"view.\" We asked about a \"suite\" and were told that they don't give those types of rooms away for the $99 per night price we were paying, as they go for $499 per night. The manager did appologize for the \"inconvenience\" but told us that we had to be willing to compromise. I asked how me chosing between two rooms, both of which were \"lower\" then what I had written confirmation for was a compromise given they were not doign anything to correct the situation, and was not given an answer. We chose the regular king room with a view and proceeded up to our room. The view was of the highway (very noisey). The room was NOT CLEAN at all. In the bathroom, there was hair all over the ceiling as well brown \"stains\" on the ceiling and on the floor. We went back down to the front desk and spoke to the same manager who once again appologized. She did give us coupons for one mornings breakfast. It was agreed that while we went out for a few hours, the staff would move our bags to a king room with a couch. We returned a few hours later and went to our new room, and again, it was NOT CLEAN. Again there was hair all over the bathroom, on the bed, and there were rusty nails coming our of the walls. We called down to the front desk and the same manager said she would call us back a few minutes later, which she did and said they would \"touch up\" our original room and make sure it was clean for us to move back to it. We decided enough was enough and went to stay at the Embassy Suites on 22nd St which was AMAZING. Given nothing that L'enfant Plaza said was true, I made sure to get in writing from them that I would not be charged anything for leaving early, and they gave that to me. In our taxi ride over to the new hotel, our driver was saying how he had heard that L'Enfant Plaza had lost a lot of staff, and was not as \"good\" as it had been in the past. When we returned home on 12.26.07 I called L'Enfant Plaza and asked to talk to the general manager, who I was told was away until 12.30.07. I left a voice mail message for him and have not heard back as of 1.2.08. I did however get a generic email from the hotel saying they joped my stay was pleasant and that I would come back again.

The air conditioner only had one speed that worked (thankfully it was the low setting) but when it ran, there was a constant loud clicking noise and .....it leaked.
