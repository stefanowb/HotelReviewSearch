The rooms were very small but they were clean and had air conditioning, it can be noisy at night with the sounds from people walking up and down the hallways and banging doors. The food on offer for breakfast was limited but fresh, some fruit would be nice though. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and did a lot of research to try and find us an english speaking doctor. The area around the hostel is not the best, there was a police raid two streets away. Overall the hostel was expensive but it was on par price wise with other hostels/ hotels in the area.
