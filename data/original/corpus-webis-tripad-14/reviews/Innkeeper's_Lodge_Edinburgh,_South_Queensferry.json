On a recent visit we spent a couple of nights at the Hawes Inn in pretty South Queensferry for \u00a3130 B&B. The location couldn't be more dramatic, under the Forth Rail Bridge, the room was spacious and clean, free view channels on the TV and the staff were laid back and friendly. Breakfast was a good spread of cereals, yoghurts, pastries, toast and fruit. The Hawes Inn has plenty of parking and its a 10 minute walk from Dalmeny Station where theres 2 or 3 trains an hour into Waverley for under \u00a34 return (about 20 minutes). The pub itself does a well piced menu and serves a good pint of Belhaven.

The Tudor Gothic Dalmeny House and Georgian Hopetoun House are also well worth a visit."}
