She has been updating and painting and making sure the property stays clean and beautiful. We did visit the other properties while there and even ran into Mr. Gordon Stewart at Royal [ another day in paradise] but always glad to return to the Inn. I must say everyone at the Inn from the housekeepers, bartenders servers, office, bellman, management are very friendly and helpful. This was our 6th visit to Sandals our 2nd to the Inn and as usual the Sandals Select guest dinner was really nice with cocktails in the garden and dinner around the pool, Cheryl gave a very heartfelt greeting/speech to welcome us all back \"home\".

This will be a long review, so please be patient. This was also my first visit to Jamaica and I had an idea of what to expect because I had read several TripAdvisor reviews. We had a wonderful experience! The Sandals Inn looks exactly like the pictures. The service, variety of food, accommodations and amenities were great. General Manager, Cheryl Brown, her assistant, Lisa and staff are to be commended for a job well done. They were very attentive to our needs. During our first breakfast, my friend expressed a desire to try curry goat. At dinner, the server presented curry goat, especially prepared just for him! I was impressed. We took full advantage of the amenities at the neighboring resorts, but were glad to return to our home away from home at the end of each day. The staff at the other resorts we not nearly as personable as the Inn\u2019s staff. We experienced a \u201ccouples\u201d massage, rafted down the \u201cMartha Brae\u201d river, took a day trip to Sandals Negril, and even experienced the \u201cau natural\u201d beach where seeing is believing! The tour guide for the Negril tour is Dalton. He is very knowledgeable on historical facts. I highly recommend the Negril tour to first time visitors. It\u2019s very informative and you get to see a beautiful sunset and dive off a cliff for those who are daring. Please ask for Dalton who is located at the Inn. Your wish is his command. The Inn is located right across the street from a public beach. We didn\u2019t experience the beach, but used the beach at the other resorts, as well as our pool. An interesting thing to note is that while you\u2019re on the premises, the Inn looks and feels like a resort with lots and lots of lush gardens, scenery and greenery, but as soon as you go outside of the resort, you immediately experience the \u201clocals\u201d and all they have to offer. They are very persistent and will stop at nothing to get you to look at their merchandise. The Inn is a 10 minute walk from the \u201chip strip\u201d where all the action is including gambling. If you are looking to party all night, the Inn is not the place for you. It\u2019s clientele is a mature, more sophisticated crowd. Partying can be done on the \u201chip strip\u201d and then come home for a good night sleep. One thing to remember and that is to please book all your tours and dinner reservations as soon as you arrive at the resort. Reservations book fast. Okay, that's it.
