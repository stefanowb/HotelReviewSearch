The separate bathroom was also well-sized with fresh towels each day. The bed was large and comfortable and the room was well equipped with TV/DVD, tea, coffee, biscuits etc. There is however no wi-fi. Afternoon tea was one of the better ones we have experienced, lovely light scones, cake and sandwiches, but surprisingly no choice of tea offered other than English breakfast. The restaurant was first class with plenty of choice. Lots of fresh local produce, well presented and cooked. The venison and beef are both recommended. Not quite Michelin standard, but not far off. The vineyard's own wines were delicious and not much more expensive than in their on-site shop. You need to like white wines though. There are other wines available, but we wanted to sample the Three Choirs. Breakfast was also excellent, good quality full English with especially fine bacon.", "title": "Stunning Views, Excellent Room, Great resturant", "user": "Julian L", "date": "March 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 125705833}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Staff were friendly and helpful and the lady who gave the vineyard tour was particularly interesting and good humoured.
