That enabled some nice photos of the gothic tower from a different angle. I am trying to give practical suggestions to fellow travelers through my reviews, therefore I suggest to \u201clook-up\u201d at different times of the day and night to see how the Town-Hall can \u201ctransform\u201d. That tower view was engraved in my memory due to a visit happened many years ago. I was in Brussels to watch a football match of my favorite team AEK Athens against Anderlecht in Constant van de Stock stadium. After the match, at approx. midnight, we drove downtown and we stared at the town-hall tower with background a full-moon and by-passing clouds.

We went to the flower Carpet so were lucky enough to see inside. It is not usually open to the public- but if you get the chance then take it. Beautiful paintings,wall coverings, etc. We got to see the Marriage room- it looks almost medieval. Fantastic surroundings to get married in. We went out on the balcony too. Beautiful views of the whole square. Probably should have spent more time admiring it- but not really possible with a young child. The Square is dominated with wonderful buildings. Well worth a visit- preferably not when it is boiling hot though.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MelissaAye1", "date": "August 26, 2012", "id": 138395778}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "One of the most beautiful town halls in Europe!", "text": "I grabbed a chair and sat in front of the town hall (with a glass of Leffe Blonde) and just looked at the facade for a few hours. There are many statues across the front from local people to royalty in differently attires. The workmanship is incredible and the statues look like real people (not like today's modern art where it looks similar but the artist does not have the skill or talent to make it look real so they call it modern art as a poor excuse for their lack of skill!) There are exhibits sometimes in the museum which are interesting! It is also fun to read the 'banns' about people who want to get married. I see many people walk by and hardly notice the beauty and love that was put into the building. Grab a chair and just look at the details. Even the magnificent statue on the tower.

We could not understand what she was saying, and neither could many other people in the group, judging by the expressions on their faces. Because of this, she didn't hold the group together very well - that's not good! She half-heartedly told the group there were no photographs to be taken. She was largely ignored but she never did anything about it. It's a beautiful building, just a pity we knew as much coming out as we did going in.
