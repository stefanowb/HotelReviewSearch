I really have no complaints whatsoever except to unavailability(charging) of the pool for guests. We stayed one night at the ANA crown plaza & the Hilton is better in every regard except the ANA allows free use of their pool, which is a big plus for young children. The biggest plus of this holel is also its location above the main Osaka train station and several underground train lines, you rarely have to change trains for any of the main attractions. The airport bus stop is just over the road (the ANA 20 mins walk away also uses this stop )although we used the train to the airport. All the staff from the restraunt,cleaners,consiege & reception were very polite & efficient.

The least-expensive menu in the hotel's Japanese restaurant was the equivalent of $600 USD for 3 diners. (And I was the only one who had a glass of wine.) All of the \"new movies\" on the hotel's entertainment system were over a year old. One afternoon, I stopped in the lobby cafe because they were advertising afternoon tea on their billboard.
