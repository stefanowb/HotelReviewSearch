First, booked thru dream 2 travel and was left standing at the airport with NO transport as confirmed(in writing) and no reso at HE. Luckily I had an int'l phone- called HE and was told to show up at Marina Fiesta as HE was overbooked. Was re-imbursed for taxi(4 days later after badgering Lenin every day!).Room was old/ugly/Dinner at Lobster & Co. was excellent and included. I was persistant and demanded to be moved to HE the next day and was... First room was crap, bellman got us an EXCELLENT/ocean view room with big tub! The hotel turned out to be wonderful, all restaurant food and service was top notch and wonderful. Their reso administration is terribly disorganized and yet the property,all staff, view, cleanliness and facilities amply made up for the BS... Jeff the sales guy was reasonable but then got all winey and pissy when I said no for the 5th time. What do you want for $399 all inclusive for 2 unqualified time share crashers??? Quit complaining and recognize that it's 3ed world and cheap! I'd go back but book direct and if you get bumped to Marina Fiesta insist on being able to \"day use all inclusive\" at HE...

My friend and I decided to go to the timeshare presentation on day 2, as we were promised $200 in spa coupons to do so. The presentation was not 1.5 hours as stated to us, it was closer to 2.5 hours which was cutting in to our vacation time. Our sales rep, DC, needs a class in customer service. He told us members do not like to hang out at the pool etc with non-members, which to me makes no sense. If you are a member and love the property why wouldn't you want to spread the word so others would buy? He said the reason we got such a great deal is because the Hacienda Encantada partners with Expedia to get people in for the sales promotion. He also said once you stay as a non-member you can never stay there again, unless ofcourse you buy.

You may want to ask for Miguel at the restaurant for service,he will go out of his way to make your dining experiences even more satisfying.Needless to say,all the staff do the best they can,the english language for some wait staff is not as good as others.

Later we walked around the resort to familiarize ourselves with the additions. They have a small spa that I did not use this time so I cannot comment on it. They also have a small \"temporary\" gym in Phase II. I was later told by sales staff that construction of the 20,000 sq. ft. spa/gym overlooking the ocean will start in 6 months and be completed 18 months later.

They also said they are trying to get a beach area in front of the resort but there has been lots of oppositions to this - I hope to see this materialize in the near future. I was also glad to see a laundry room so we don't have to pack so much clothes. It cost $4 each wash/dry and you bring/buy your own soap/softener. They had a great kid's area in phase II with a water park, playground, wading pool. My neice and nephews ages 4,5 and 7 had a blast!
