There is a IGA and liquor store right accross the road. The service of the apartments is reasonable. House Keeping will clean your bathroom and kitchenette and make your bed if you wish on a daily basis. Towels and linen are only changed after 3 nights but there is a washing machine/dryer. Thanks to the reviews of other travellers we booked a 1 BR apartment. It was functional but very compact and the studio would have been like a box. The airconditioners in the lounge and bedroom are quite noisy. The airconditioner in the lounge is mounted in a very unfortunate spot. In order to get the airflow going you have to shift the sofa away which will then block the door to the bedroom pretty much. The bed is comfortable. The biggest flaw, however, is the bathroom. It is a tiny frosted glass cubicle that stands right in the little lounge/kitchenette area and gives you no privacy. If you are travelling alone and have no visitors, then ok. The sink is tiny with no place to put things apart from opening the mirror cabinet. For anyone who has travelled to Japan: it is small even for japanese standards. This is the reason why we would not stay here again.

What I found at City Tempo was the worst accommodation I have stayed at in my entire global trip. I don't expect perfection by any means. In summary, the room was ok as long as you like large pillows which cause neck ache and a short bed. The neighbour played music all night, everynight. The room was very stuffy and is made worse by the fact the airconditioner was excessively noisy. Having stayed there in summer, it was essential to have the aircondiitoner on which basically meant you cannot sleep. To try and sleep I would turn it off and wake up a couple of hours parched and sweaty. The bathroom was clean but was uber tiny (estimated at 1.5m wide by 2.5 long which includes a shower, toilet and wash stand). The doorman was very lovely but the front of house staff had no hospitality training and came across rude, uncaring and unhelpful. After politely waiting during check in while the hotel front of house was on the phone, once she hung up, I was greeted with a 'Yep' in a abrupt manner.

For a start they advertize themselves as a non-smoking hotel. Page 12 in the information guide provided in all rooms clearly states; Please be advised that ALL of our apartments and all public areas are NON-SMOKING. My first day here I had to close my balcony door because the people next door were smoking. A little later they decided it was party time. The noise was so bad I finished up calling the concierge. The next morning I requested a change of room and after some deliberation I was moved to another floor. The second day here passed uneventfully. On my third night I am woken at 03:30 AM by noise coming from one of the balconys. I initially though it was above me. I put my earplugs in but lo and behold they decided it was time for the partry to really get going! So after listening to the thump, thump, thump penetrating the earplugs, and it is by this time 04:40 AM, I was forced tocall the concierge again. It did indeed come from next door.
