We could not have chosen a better place to stay. The lodge was centrally located in town which made it easy to walk to the nearby restaurants. The park entrance to Zion was only minutes away thus saving us time the next morning by not having to drive too far. Pioneer Lodge\u2019s manager during our stay was Ben Patel. Ben was very friendly & courteous and ensured we were well taken care of. Our hotel room was on the second floor across from the main office. The room appeared to have been recently remodeled with a western them. The view from the front balcony was awesome allowing a nice vantage points for the evening sunset & the morning sunrise against the adjacent foothills. If you are planning a visit to Zion then I highly recommend you consider staying at the Pioneer Lodge for its close proximity to the park, affordable room rates and friendly staff. Thank you Ben Patel for making our brief stay an enjoyable experience. I will definitely stay at Pioneer Lodge for all of my future visits.", "title": "Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay", "user": "seawalker_9000", "date": "March 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154942897}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed two nights to visit the Zion park: For this purpose the location is ideal, very close to the park.

Our reason for staying at Pioneer Lodge, like other reviewers was it's very convenient location for visiting the majestic Zion Nation Park which is close by. The main entrance to the park is just a five minute drive down the road so it is almost on the hotel's doorstep. The hotel is constructed and decorated in a \"frontier/wild west\" theme which was very appealing to this British visitor and fitted in perfectly with the countryside and stunning views all round. The rooms were comfortable if not large, with fridge, tv, excellent bath and shower facilities and easily regulated heating. We stayed for one night during a cold snap so it was essential to be able to turn the heat up, at some hotels this is a far more difficult task than it should be. I also noted that there were spare blankets in the wardrobe. The hotel has a comfortable reception area where you are able to sit by the warming fire and take it easy. In this area is a bank of computers and a coffee bar selling a wide selection of hot and cold beverages. At the time of my stay the hotel restaurant was closed for refurbishment but Anna the very helpful and friendly receptionist was able to recommend us a local place to eat called Oscar's where we had a delicious evening meal. The hotel restaurant is scheduled to re-open during the month of March. Overall I thought this hotel was excellent value for money, ideally located and as a guest I felt that the staff really cared about how our stay was.

We accepted this & returned to our room, only to find a few hours later, when we decided to shower before going to bed, three used bars of soap (2 in the bath & 1 on the basin with a used face cloth). Closer inspection found another used face cloth draped over the shower head. After showering I also noticed long strands of dark hair on the shower walls....both my husband & I have short hair.
