This hotel is only historic if you consider the mid-1980s to be history. Our room had blue plush carpet, a dark blue armchair with 80s fabric and nautical blue and white 1980s curtains, and tan striped wall paper that has seen better days. Oh, and we enjoyed looking at all of these things with the huge magnifying glass that was in the desk (strange) The tile in the bathroom was tan with white, moldy grout and it smelled like mold. Our brown toilet flushed...but barely. Even the turn down service seemed outdated as they left a little white towl on the floor next to each side of the bed.

Hard wood floors with an oversized tub highlighted my room. Another big bonus to this place is the original art throughout and the unique sitting spaces (overstuffed leather chairs, comfy loveseats) sprinkled throughout the common spaces. The staircase goes all the way up to the eighth floor and the design details make each corner a place where interesting visuals abound. The bed was perfect and the AC kept things cool during a very hot weekend. While you're here, you must indulge in one of the best features of the Cincinnatian - the room service.
