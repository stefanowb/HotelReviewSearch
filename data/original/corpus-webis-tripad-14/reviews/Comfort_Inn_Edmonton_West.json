The hotel is really lacking in amenities though; no breakfast- which all Comfort Inns are supposed to offer; no hotub, no public computer, no workout room. Good thing all we did was sleep then head off to the mall.

When we arrived Coleen checked us in. We were disapointed to find out that all they had was a 2nd floor room and the hotel was full no rooms left on the bottom level. Being seniors it was going to be hard to get our things up the stairs, without us asking she offered to assist us and carried up the 2 larger bags. She the told us that if the was something else need to just let her know. She was warm and welcoming. The room was ok, but had not been very well cleaned and it was a tad noisy most of the evening. We called down to complain about the noise but the person working seemed bothered by our call and he didn't do anything. The next day we were checking out the same girl was still at the reception desk she again we very friendly and asked us if we had enjoyed our room and our time at the mall. Even if she didn't really care she sure came across like she did. If we stay there again it will be because of her.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "gadget463", "date": "March 28, 2007", "id": 7237988}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disliked this stay", "text": "The hotel was clean and the rates were reasonable.

We found the staff very friendly and most accomodating. The room we booked was a non-smoking room and it was very clean and fresh. In reading the other reviews I was surprized to see what others were saying. One, can you prove you got the scabies from the hotel? Scabies are transferred from one human being to another not usually from hotels. Scabies are parasites that survive on the flesh and not usually on a bed. Two, the Mall is not that far away from the hotel. Yes, it is probably too far to walk if you are carrying parcels as it is 3 long city blocks. If you look at a map you will see it is only 3 or 4 blocks away. Are you sure you weren't at the Comfort Inn & Suites downtown and thought you were at the one near the mall because I don't recall going through any industrial area to get there from the hotel.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 16, 2004", "id": 2453619}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Hardly Near the West Edmonton Mall", "text": "We enjoyed our stay there so much that we have booked rooms there again for our trip next week. While we were there we never saw any groups of \"teenagers\" standing around the parking lots smoking or not. I felt very safe and secure in the hotel, no less safer than other hotels. There are very few hotels that have fences around the perimeters, besides, fences only keep the honest ones out. Fences cause places for others to hide which, to me, would be scarier than having them out in the open. Besides, teenagers hanging around smoking doesn't automatically make them a threat or harmful. If my trip this time is any different I will be sure to post my findings but if it is comparable to last time you won't here from me.", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 28, 2003", "id": 1427271}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Watch Out", "text": "This hotel advertises itself as within walking distance of the West Edmonton Mall - this was untrue as it was about 2 miles away through a large industrial area.
