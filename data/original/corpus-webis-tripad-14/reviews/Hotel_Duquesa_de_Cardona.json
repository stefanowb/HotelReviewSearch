On arrival at the hotel our room (number 43 following recommendations on this site) was not ready as we had arrived early. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and friendly and arranged for Mario (concierge) to place our bags in storage until our room was ready. The receptionist then asked if we would like to have a coffee at the hotel or if we would like to take a wander. After deciding the latter he then gave us a map and showed us where we could get a coffee locally and also pointed out some of the other sights within close proximity. On return to the hotel we were taken to our room by Mario who carried our bags and when we entered the room found that there were flowers and chocolates waiting (arranged by my husband and the travel agent) and a bottle of wine courtesy of our travel agent. I have since found out that this was very difficult to organise but the hotel did all they could to help. On our first night 2 cards were put through our door; 1 with a Good Night note and a weather forecast for the following day and 1 with a menu for you to select a fragrance for your room the following day! Oh and 2 chocolates as well! They even have a pillow menu by the bed where you can choose your type of pillow. Everything else about the hotel was wonderful, a great selection at breakfast and everything was replenished regularly (contrary to other reviews on this site), rooms were clean and stylishly decorated. The hotel is well positioned for everything in the city if you want to escape the hustle and bustle. Numerous restaurants are well witihin a short walking distance.
