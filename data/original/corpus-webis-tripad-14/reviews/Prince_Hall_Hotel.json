The room was fantastic, the bed and duvet were amazing and the food !! Where do I begin-it was a real treat to try some flavours I had not experienced before. The canapes and Amouse bouche were great and then the 3 course dinner was superb. Not forgetting breakfast of such a high quality with local produce. Even homemade brown and tomato sauce with breakfast !! Only downside was fog/cloud giving poor visibility to what I am sure would of been a spectacular view of Houndtor and the surrounding moors-but that is what you can get if staying on moorland.

Our room had a view of the Moors that was incredibly and the room was large and quite comfortable. We werent planning on taking all our meals at the hotel, but enjoyed the food so much we ended up eathing in the resturant every night. The best thing though was how kind and wonderful the staff are. The locaton and hotel is upscale without being snobbish. Our dogs were welcomed with open arms and we loved having a cup of tea in the bar with our pets. The open space makes it a great location for dogs to roam free and even though our older dog who has arthirtis had no issues walking on the paths. I would recommend Prince Hall has an excellent place for pets, people and relaxing. We look forward to another \"family\" visit to this great hotel.", "title": "A complete gem..
