We were very excited about the trip although it ended up being considerably shorter than we planned. Luckily, I had the chance to confirm our reservations while still in the United States. We were prepared when we arrived; come to find out our reservation had been moved to the Park, due to renovations, which incidently seemed to be the same hotel as the Atlantic, at least that's what the taxi cab driver said. It took two days to finally speak to someone to confirm the reservation and make arrangements for our late arrival. So, we paid for an extra evening in order to assure accomodations in a sold out city. Both the location and the hotel staff were great. The room on the other hand looked like someone had squirted ketchup all over the white fabric walls above the bed, I didn't ask and since the bed was clean and we were only staying two days we slept great- the first night. The second night the ampitheater outside our window (looking out through a tree with the ocean in the distance- WoW) played Gwar till 11:00 PM (it may not have even been them- I certainly wouldn't know).

The location is amazing - very central for the beaches, the Cours Saleya, the Old Town, the Rue Massena, and Avenue Jean Medecin - all are literally minutes from the hotel.
