I think it was room 601, but I'm not sure. The room was perfect for the 2 of us. It had a full kitchenette with stove/fridge/sink/microwave as well as dishes and silverware. There was a livingroom area with a fold out couch and a table with 2 chairs. The bedroom had a very comfortable king bed and big closet with drawers built in. The closet served as a room divider between the living room and bedroom. There was a 19 inch television that was on a swivel in a \"cut-out\" built into the closet so that you can watch it in the living room or turn it to watch tv in the bedroom. I saw no ants and have no complaints about the suite. I never saw the standard room but I recommend the suite for sure. The only complaint i have about the room is that there was no stereo/cd player, but I had travel speakers for the beach so we just hooked that up to the iPod whenever we wanted tunes. The pool is not huge but it was perfectly acceptable. The area is good because you can get supplies at walgreens and Lincoln Rd is down the block.
