The hotel's close to the Taipei 101 skyscraper and there are lots of shops and eateries nearby. Since my wife's superstitious, I was somewhat surprised that she said nothing when our room turned out to be room 1444 (unlucky numbers for Chinese people!). A day later, our Taipei friends told us that the hotel's known to be haunted, especially the 14th floor. Some years ago, when inflight attendants used to stay in the hotel, they all avoided that corner of the hotel, but we had no problems. I believe the hotel was built on a site where Japanese soldiers used to execute Taiwanese during WWII. In any case, our window view was of the Taipei 101 tower, an amazing view. Just across the street, the 101 has a shopping arcade in the lower floors, lots of brand names, and a Page One mega bookstore. Also nearby: the New York New York shopping center, the Japanese Mitsukoshi department store spread out over several buildings, a dozen cinemas, Eslite bookstore (several floors of books), etc. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, as there are plenty of restaurants, Asian and Western nearby. The Mister Donut, a Japanese franchise, was just a few minutes by foot. I should note that the hotel was okay, facilities and service. Check-in and check-out were fast and efficient, but no bell boys came to assist us with our luggage (there were no bell boys to be found, I think). There are two entrances to the hotel: the main, where cars drop off people, and the side entrance, where airport buses stop; maybe the bell boys are only found at the main entrance? I think the hotel was built in the early eighties and it shows. The lobby is luxurious but a few upgrades should be in order.
