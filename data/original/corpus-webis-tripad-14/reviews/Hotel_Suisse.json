Even back then it was a very good hotel that wasn't quite as expensive as some of the others you'll find in Nice. Now...fast forward to 2010. The hotel has undergone quite a number of renovations, however, the fantastic views that you get when staying at this hotel, still remain. Check in was smooth, and although the girl at the front desk spoke perfect English, she allowed me to try my best to get through check in, solely in French. We booked the suite in the hotel (Chambre 42), and it was perfect for our needs. Two separate bedrooms with a large shared bathroom that is accessed in a common area in between the two bedrooms. Both had balaconies, as do almost all the rooms at this hotel. The view is breathtaking. Try and get a room on the 4th or 5th floor, as this is where the best views are found. One night, I lost my BlackBerry on a train coming back from Monaco, and the gentleman at the front desk could not have been more accommodating to me. He looked up my service provider's phone number on his computer at the front desk and even called North America for me, so I could talk to them directly and cancel my service. The cabs they called for showed up right on time and were very fairly priced. As mentioned by other guests, try to avoid the breakfast - there are just too many wonderful places close by that will not be quite as expensive. The only negative in this hotel is the elevator. It is a little tiny box that only two people can squeeze into. If you are claustrophobic, or impatient to wait for the one elevator that the hotel has, you can easily take the stairs and get some exercise. Be warned - this hotel is a 3 star property, and although spotlessly clean, it is basic compared to luxury hotels.
