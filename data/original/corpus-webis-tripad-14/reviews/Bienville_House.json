I walk with a cane, so I found a step-free ramp to the main street, two city blocks to the waterfront, close to the cathedral, street cars and every classy restaurant in the French Quarter....we walked everywhere, every day, with great ease. We did not visit the Jazz joints, but the Hard Rock and House of Blues were visible nearby. We did not know the Music Fest was going on, and a few days later Navy Day /tall ships came to the park...Really great ! The tour buses left the Jax Brewery depot, the paddleboat tour and carriage rides were all very close. Coming and going to the airport, the shuttle seemed to avoid heavy traffic by some quick routes...effortless travel.

Best restaurant we found was Brennan's Bourbon Oyster House, corner of Bourbon and Iberville (I think). There were 12 of us and we all loved it so much we had dinner there twice. Bootleggers had some fantastic blues bands playing - so make sure you check that out. Also went to Mardi Gras World. Shuttle picks you up, go on a tour to see all the floats, how them make them, new floats for next year -- really nice to see.

The first impressions of our room was literally breathtaking. The AC unit was loud in the hallway by the ice machine and the trim in the bathroom was cheaply done, but for a building built in the late 1700's with so much history, that can be overlooked. We also had trouble with the bathtub holding water, the TV kept losing cable signal (all HD stations didn't work at all), and the bathroom flowers and ceiling fan were COVERED with dust. We complained at the front desk and were offered a different room but it was SO much smaller for only the price of the parking for our car taken off and it wasn't worth that much to us. We just didn't turn the fan on and we hid the flowers under the cabinet so we didn't have to look at them. For the price, I would expect a fridge/microwave in the room, and the breakfast was very limited (breads and coffee only). The setting for the hotel was the perfect distance from the hustle and noise of downtown (minus the blare of the steam ship every now and then) but also to be close enough that you don't feel you are missing out.

The hotel is located near the end of Decatur Street closer to the financial district/downtown so it's a bit recessed from the hubbub of the heart of French Quarter but a VERY short walk to hubbub if that's what you want. I wanted a little bit of quiet at night to sleep so I was fine with not being in the middle of the ruckus. Decatur Street also happens to have lots of great bars, shops and restaurants all along it, and if you're a relatively fast walker, you can get to almost anywhere in the French Quarter walking within 20-30 minutes. Our room was very quiet and I was never woken up once, even though we were right across the street from a fire station and our window faced it. I wasn't even sure the firemen ever went out!
