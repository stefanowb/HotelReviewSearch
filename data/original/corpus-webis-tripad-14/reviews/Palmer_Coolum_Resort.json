When we arrived at the room it was very very dated with lots of trees around and a childrens playground just outside the unit.After complaining we were changed to one of the few upgraded units on site, there was a charge of $450 a night for this room .Eventually the extra charge was waivered.We are both in our sixties the place was full of families with very young children On many occasions while having breakfast [extra charge] we observed small kids handling food from the buffet.When I mentioned this to a staff member it was not really accepted as a genuine complaint,The food was very expensive and the drinks were overpriced a glass of wine ranged between $12-$16.This place has a lot of potential but at those prices I felt riped off and definitly there was no luxury.When you go to places like that I can fully understand why people go overseas.We would not have chosen this place if we knew there would be so many families with small children.Most of the staff were very pleasant and did theire job well.And as for Clive Palmers dinosaur on the golfing green enough said.I would not recommend this place unless they looked at there prices", "title": "Overpriced", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "marie b", "date": "January 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 149462161}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We only stayed overnight at the Palmer Coolum in a two bedroom woodland villa. Never knew much about this resort but pleasantly surprised. The room was old but large and everything was in good condition. The whole resort is definitely very family orientated - would not go there for a romantic weekend away. For families - fantastic. There was so much on offer - we were there on school holidays so I do not know what it is like other times. Even though the resort was busy - it never felt crowded. The staff were very helpful and polite. I was also surprised that you could directly access the beach from the resort. If you were energetic you could easily ride a bike there or just a short buggy ride. There were many eating options there for families.

How wrong was i. Under the hyatt umbrella, i was more than happy to pay the price for the service as we felt it was value for money. We stayed between xmas & new year, couldn't wait to leave. Very poor service, over priced for the service provided, the prices for food has gone up by $10 - $20. The shuttle service was poor, we had a 67 year old mum who has had 2 back operations & a 3 year old boy with a disabilty & no shuttle service. Sent letter after 3 days to the gm, but had no reply from him. Indicative of management. From an outsider looking in, it appears the owner has number crunches in charge of the resort, not hospitality people. Understaffed was one of the problems, however, i have not seen it so empty. Staff were lovely, but they can only do as they are told. VERY SAD, WE WILL NOT BE BACK, AFTER 6 YEARS OF VISITING.

As you are shown to your room you are provided with a tour of the resort and its main features. This is a resort in the true sense of the word. We tried a wide variety of the resturants, cafes and bars. All the staff were friendly and the food was supurb. A couples massage in the Spa topped off a great weekend.

The staff still give the same great service, the food is very good (despite the restaurants changing names), the grounds are quiet, peaceful and lovely. The staff will do anything for you and are very friendly. We listened to live music in the Village Square on saturday arvo drinking a vino and again on Saturday night until about 10pm. Everyone in the square appeared to be having a great time. There are many pictures of the famous owner but they aren't that obvious. he also has his vintage car collection (6 cars in total) which we found really great as we wouldn't see such a private collection normally. The Spa is still fantastic and part of the resort fee. We didn't venue to the beach due to the weather. The rooms are in need of a makeover but they are still neat, tidy, clean and the bathrooms are the best anywhere...so large! Overall, I suspect the resort isn't in the best condition due to the recent weather on the sunshine coast (January 2013) but it is still great.
