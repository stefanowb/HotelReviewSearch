Arrived around midnight - girl on the reception spoke no English, but despite that everything went quickly and smoothly. Rooms are nice, quite spacious, interor decoration is simple, but beautiful, with some chinese hints. Where is a noisy street outside, so sleep quality was not the best. Once had to make an international call from the reception and they did not charge me anything for 10 min. conversation - that was nice from their side. Good choice if you arriving Rome late or leaving early.", "title": "Helpful staff", "user": "Lexx_Naxxx", "date": "July 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 115838820}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled solo", "text": "This was not what I was expecting, location was ok to the train station making departure easy but a little bit of a distance from Old Rome but taking the Metro did make it easy for me.", "title": "Debatable", "user": "PinkChampagne87", "date": "April 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 106117789}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lazio", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Rome"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 4, "very good": 4, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 0.602083333333, "description": "Euro Star guest house is a new elegant guest house, located in Rome near main railway station TERMINI.
