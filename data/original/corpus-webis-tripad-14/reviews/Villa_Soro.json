However, San Sebastian in general was not a touristy city with throbbing nightlife, so I think this hotel was perfect. The sitting rooms are comfortable and filled with vintage, elegant furniture and light fixtures. Perfect for their evening happy hour of sherry and charcuterie. The rooms were spacious, filled with light, and the marble bathroom was luxurious (for both bath-havers and shower-takers.) The breakfast is served either outside, or in their beautiful tea room. Like most other bed and breakfasts and hotels in Spain, the breakfast is a combination of local favorites (jamon iberico, manchego, etc.) and continental pastries, breads, and coffee. The staff was very friendly and helpful, providing us with a map of all the sights within walking distance. We loved heading out in the morning and walking along the beach to Old Town. We had a reservation at ARZAK one night, and our hotel was very efficient in getting us a taxi to take us to the restaurant.
