My purpose for my visit was a vacation with my wife , without the children for once , and to kite . Unfortunately i could kite only once , wind was not enough , and the day it was possible it was a tropical storm , wind from the nortwest 27 knots , but this can happen everywhere in the world , so i don't mind . The food is very nice , in the hotel as in town , we had every night a different restaurant for 10days , so enough of those . Restaurants like zarabande , own by locals , is very good for its fish soup and many other plates , adelin for it's pizza's and lobster ( although service is very slow ) , and many more . If interested in prices , don't worry : we had once breakfast for 4 euro for two persons , and evening dinner with bottle of wine costs us always between 20 and 25 euros for the two of us . Life is very cheap around here . Try to change your dollars or euro's in the hotels , and pay in pesos , it is much more easier for everyone and you are sure about the value . One more thing : beware of mosquitos and sand fleas especially in the evening and sure when wind is coming from the south , the can be very nasty , it is a fact that when wind is coming from northern directions there is not a problem and this is most of the time the direction it blows here . We had some rain here , not much , and then you must hide for those creatures !! i was full of them , and sand fleas can jump high , very high !! but no worry , bring some baby oil against the sand fleas ( that's what they learned us here ) and have a nice stay", "title": "our two weeks stay at mawimbi", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "verosven", "date": "December 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 22696259, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 peace and quite", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My boyfriend and I (late 20s/early 30s) just got back from 4 nights at Mawimbi.
