Wonderful hotel in an excellent area. 1 minute walk from monorail station. There are some great little drink stalls 20 yards to the right where you can get a great coconut for 60p. Kuala Lumper is a stunning city - China town is a must visit. Got a 'Rolex' Watch here for 50 ringetts (about 7 pounds) do not spend more than 75. Also an amazing leather briefcase for 65.

I wanted to book a 5* hotel but apparently due to a conference in town there were none available and this was my best bet. The superior room was tiny and not really having a separate bathroom was a bit of a suprise. Having the sink in the middle of the room was a challenge. The hotel was central though which is about the only good thing I could say for it.
