We were assigned a studio that faced the parking lot, but other than that, everything else was great. The property is beautiful and pleasant with lots of palm trees and flowers. Owners have access to a private beach right outside in the common area. It's just a very well-designed, clean, secluded beach area. There is a free shuttle that takes people to the Marriott Golf Club (where Roy's is located) close by and the Marriott Hotel about 2 minutes down the road. The restaurant at the hotel, Azul, is superb. If you request to sit outside, you are steps away from sting rays and small sharks (not sure what they are called) that roam around in a pool. The designs/architectures indoors and outdoors are beautiful and magnificent with huge white columns and lots of greeneries. The most important aspect , of course, is the food. It's excellent and very reasonably priced. Back to discussing the Marriott Ko Olina...The location is great. You are about 5-10 minutes away from Costco, Safeway and Long's Drugs. There is a huge shopping plaza in the same area. You can find lots of restaurants there, too. Yes, it's about 30 minutes away from downtown Honolulu, but it's not so bad. I guess if you prefer staying in a quieter area, it's a better choice. The only downside is the parking - it's like $20 some dollars a day for self parking.", "user": "thc2009", "date": "March 22, 2009", "id": 26640275}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Best Resort On Oahu Hands Down!", "text": "You can't get much better then this resort. From the villas that face the ocean to the service, this resort cannot be beat! We stayed in a gorgeous 1 bedroom villa overlooking one of Ko Olina's 4 lagoons. The villas themselves are probably around 1,000 sq feet for a 1 bedroom and feature a full kitchen with everything you need to make a perfect meal. They also feature a washer and dryer which comes in handy. There's a bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower, then another bathroom with just a sink and oversized bathtub. The villa also has a small reading room with what I call a mini bed. Overall you can't beat these rooms, they have everything you need for your entire stay not to mention all the room you could ask for, and the balcony was a fairly good size featuring a table with two chairs and a lounger. You can't beat eating breakfast in the morning overlooking the ocean and also eating dinner watching the sunset. Talk about a romantic dinner! The resort has their own market which has a starbucks and sells some other food items as well as some grocery items. But your better off going to the Safeway just down the H1 freeway to save some $$$. During our stay we ate at Chuck's SteakHouse which had some pretty tasty steaks cooked to perfection and all meals include their salad bar which was average. Resort also features activities you can take part in from hula lessons and yoga to hawaiian style bowling. They also feature 3 pools and numerous jacuzzi's. And their beaches are great that's all you have to do is go down early and grab your chairs and put your hotel issued towel on them and don't have to worry about anyone taking your spot, it's great! Bottom line, if your looking for a secluded resort outside of Waikiki this is the place! They have it all here for you not to mention to superb service. Everyone from the valet and bellhops to groundscrew were super friendly and if you needed something they would help you. Awesome stay, we'll surely be staying here again in a few years.", "user": "vegaseaglesfan1", "date": "March 17, 2009", "id": 26361710}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best place in Oahu", "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week in late February. I have traveled quite a bit and must say I was very impressed with this resort. The on-line pictures don't do it justice. The grounds were impeccable, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, the rooms were extremely comfortable and clean. We didn't even need the mid-week maid service; in fact, it saved us the hassle of worrying about any valuables left in the room while we were out. This resort is ideal for couples wanting a romantic, quiet vacation. It's also perfect for families with small children. The resort is huge and plenty of space to spread out. We didn't feel crowded at all.", "user": "Faxgirl", "date": "March 15, 2009", "id": 26217409}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Hotel (Rental Car a must)", "text": "We reserved a Queen bed w/ Mountain View. We were pleasantly surprised to find a California King bed, sofa and kitchenette (small fridge, microwave, toaster, dishes for 2, coffee maker & even came with dish soap, sponge and paper towels). The water view would have been much nicer, but the mountain view wasn't bad. It overlooked the golf course and some housing developments at a distance. We save a lot of money by selecting a Mountain View. The marble counter tops in the kitchenette and bathroom were a nice touch. It's a gorgeous property! Guests have access to 4 lagoons for swimming and snorkeling. (You can buy snorkels at the Marketplace or local Wal-mart for cheaper than buying them in advance and packing them ~$29). The pools at this resort were very elaborate w/ waterfalls, a water slide and cabana bar service). Shaved ice was only $3 and cocktails available at the bar. Adult beverages and food is a bit pricey, but worth the splurge on vacation. We took a trip with Safe-way Foods on our first day to purchase breakfast foods, fresh fruit, drinks (including liquor), etc. We actually bought a small blender at Wal-mart to make our own frosty beverages. Much to our surprise, Wal-mart was also the best place for small token souvenirs. We didn't do a Luau because I'm vegetarian and they don't cater to non-meat eaters. Instead, we opted for the luau at the Polynesian Cultural Center.", "user": "wbranch3", "date": "March 13, 2009", "id": 26116307}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Resort - Luxuary Rooms", "text": "This resort is a timeshare property.

Everyone was incredibly friendly! Be sure to attend the activity preview at the beginning of the week and register for free door prize drawings. It gives you a taste of all amenities available during your stay. Fia Fia is a free show on the lawn mid-week. Pool towels are plentiful.

Well we never saw the rest of the island except for the Target, Safeway, and Costco. Is that a good thing? I think so. We have 3 kids and our youngest is 2 so we don't like to drive around too much and lug all their junk around. So we found enough to do here to keep everyone happy for a full week. Fishing off the rocks just outside the lagoon. Snorkeling in the lagoon. Kayaking in the lagoon. Checking out the tide pools in the lagoon. But that is not all. The pools are really nice also. The newer section has a medium level water slide. Warm waters, waterfalls, jacuzzi, sandy bottom pool. There is even a dry sauna and steam room that you can use without signing up for a spa session. That is rare that you have access to those without paying extra for the spa. We did not use the spa itself, but it did look a little small and unimpressive. Restaurants are good enough, but you can't eat in just 2 places for your whole stay. We prepared most our food in the kitchen and on the numerous outdoor grills.

It's now the lagoon pool and has a sand bottom/beach, volleyball and bball & lots more rocks and plants). I'm attaching pool pics & video. On the calmer days the beach was great. We snorkeled and saw lots of cool fish (by the rocks). The lagoon is well protected so it's VERY calm.
