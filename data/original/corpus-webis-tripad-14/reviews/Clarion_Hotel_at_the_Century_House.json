The beds were extremely comfortable; the bath perfect for bubble baths and steamy showers. The complimentary breakfast included everything from french toast or pancakes to sweet rolls, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, corned beef hash, home fries and fresh-made waffles. Charming waitresses poured mugs of hot coffee and goblets of cold water in a pub-style room we didn't want to leave. We exchanged late Christmas presents there, read the New York Times for a couple of hours New Year's morning, and generally made this comfortable inn our home. Taking advantage of the mild weather, we took a winter walk with our grandson on the hotel's nature trail. On New Year's Eve, we joined friends and family for a 40th birthday dinner in an intimate dining room of the Century House restaurant.
