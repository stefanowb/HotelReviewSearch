We were cheated by the misrepresentation and false advertising online. It is not in Sonoma, no where near the wine county. It is literally located to the 101 north fwy near Petaluma in \"sonoma county\". The room was horrible, setting unpleasant, fitness room was terrible, the coffeemaker was not cleaned out and the list goes on. You get free internet only if you use your laptop in the lobby with some code same goes for printing. If you want to be in wine country do not confused with places that say we are in sonoma wine county. The people behind the desk did were not helpful or at least accommodating for giving us misleading information by phone. My favorite is they advertise Starbucks coffee but guess what it's some pot coffee in some dinky gift store. We were about an hour away from sonoma and an hour from Napa. Ice maker also did not work.

The grounds are well landscaped and kept nicely. The room was comfortable with a large bath but there were large red stains on the carpet & desk top. The internet charge of about $10 was annoying. We really enjoyed sitting out on the long common balcony overlooking the pool area but the downside of that was that when smokers came out on the balcony the smoke blew down our way. It was supposed to be a nonsmoking property ? The staff were mostly pleasant but when I called to get directions to the River Rock Casino I was given a phone number to a casino in Canada. I called the front desk back and could never get either directions nor a good phone number for this local attraction. That's when we paid the internet fee. We had vouchers for the continental breakfast but when we entered the restaurant we were told what we couldn't eat unless we paid about $9 each rather than showing us what we could have-- which was cold cereal, yogurt, breads and a bit of fruit. A waiter brings the beverages/coffee.
