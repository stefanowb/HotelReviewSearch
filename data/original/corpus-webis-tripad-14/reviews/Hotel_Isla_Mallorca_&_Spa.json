We insisted the hotel do something about this as the phones had clearly been stolen by someone with a key card to our room. We were then informed that the police were coming which we welcomed as we believed they were trying to help us. As we spoke no English, the manager was translating what the police were saying. We were then told that as we were so upset/ angry that no action was being taken that we were being thrown out of the hotel then and there. We were thrown out of the hotel, and made to feel like criminals, despite the fact that OUR phones had been stolen. We were even forced to pay the bill. Absolutely appalling service.

First I should say that the Hotel is not central and it's situation is back from the Marina area and not easy to make your own way to. We took the EMT Bus from the Airport to Bus Stop 19 on Passeo Mallorca. Cost is 3 Euros each. I would advise that a taxi is used to reach Hotel as it sits high on the hill and the first stage is a climb of 84 steps, not easy with luggage. The taxi took about 5 mins. The Hotel is modern, bright clean and efficient. The staff are pleasant, polite and helpful.Our room was on the first floor, modern, excellent shower and washing facilities. No bath fitted, however since our preference is to shower, that was not a problem. The pool area is OK, but busy. Using the pool later on in the day we found it to be quieter apart from one young man and his family who believed they had the divine right to throw a ball and act like idiots. I would recommend the hotel without any doubt. The walk to Palma Centre is not so far and there is a bus stop for the 24 hour tourist bus a short distance from the Hotel.
