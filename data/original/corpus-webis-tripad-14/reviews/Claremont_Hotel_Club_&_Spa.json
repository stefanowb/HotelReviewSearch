We just came back from the most relaxing stay-cation ever. For $300 dollars, we got a package that came with a beautiful room with a bay view, breakfast for two, access to the club, and free parking. Had dinner at the Paragon, the more casual of the two full service restaurants at the hotel. Played 90 minutes of tennis on the pristine courts. Had a soak in the jacuzzi back in our room. In the morning, I went to a great vinyasa yoga class, took a swim, sat in the spa, then had breakfast in the main restaurant, which also had a stunning view of the bay.

This recent trip made us feel like we were staying at a different Claremont, one where the staff and the facilities were on even--and excellent--footing. The front desk people (and I spoke with them all it seems) could not have been more engaged or caring about our requests. They worked hard to help us find the best room for our family. The manager was personable and quite friendly and accommodating as was the concierge. This friendly and professional manner extended to the fitness room staff who greeted us by name on day 2 (!) and I was greeted warmly by every staff member (well, maybe not the valet guys) when I was walking around the hotel.

Many of the other rooms are very small and have no bay views. Our problems were all with the front desk and support staff. They began with check-in, which we first attempted at 2:30 pm; we were told that our room was not ready yet, but that was understandable because check-in time was 4 pm. It was raining so we had to wait in the lobby. The front desk associates were having problems with the computers and were admittedly chagrinned, but even so they were curt, unfriendly and not in the least bit helpful. Even though use of the spa facilities had been included at an extra charge of $25 and we could have been given access to them during that time, we were not. I also wanted to make a reservation at the hotel's Meritage Restaurant, but the they told me that only the concierge could do that and (he)she was not at (his)her station, so I had to check back every 15 minutes until she finally appeared at her desk one hour later. We checked our baggage while we waited for our room, but when we finally got our room the bell clerk was not at his station and so we couldn't get our luggage; nor could a clerk be found to take our room number and deliver our bags when he finally returned. On the good side, the lobby gardens and spa are still very grand. The Meritage Restaurant cuisine is quite excellent (and expensive) but you can order small plates at about 1/2 price of a full meal.

The manager helped us out by arranging it so that we could all be in adjacent rooms - much appreciated. The amenities (ie. pool, gym, etc) are also part of what appears to be a club membership for locals living in the area. We thought that might create too large a crowd to use anything but that was not the case. I have read some reviews stating that some were annoyed by having to pay for club access and parking - that would also annoy me. We purchased a package through living social and the club access and parking were included so it was not an issue for us. The club is like a typical \"tennis club\" with several tennis courts and two large lap pools. We were able to use everything we desired with little or no wait. We were also worried about some reviews stating that the rooms were dated and in need of renovation. We disagree.

We requested a Bay view, which we received, but there were some real problems with the room. To beign with, there were dead flies in the bathroom. The bathroom blinds were filthy, there was no facial soap, and we had a half-empty bottle of lotion that was clearly left from the previous guests. To top it off, we were left with only one roll of toilet paper, which ran out the morning of our departure. We were left to use tissue. Housekeeping did not seem to be on their job in that particular room. I called and left a message for Mr. Primm, but have yet to receive a call back. I was incredibly disappointed. Like I stated, I fell in love with the hotel and had plans to return in early May, but am now having second thoughts.
