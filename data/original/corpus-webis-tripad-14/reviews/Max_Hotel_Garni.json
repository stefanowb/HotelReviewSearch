One was larger than the other (get 20). The rooms were very clean (a nice change from the last hotel I stayed), and the bathrooms were extraordinarily spotless. I wish I could have taken the shower home with me, because it is nicer than the ones I have at home! They were nice and big for European standards. In the bathrooms were cool little first aid kits mounted on the wall with emergency supplies for the bathroom. Nice touch, I thought.
