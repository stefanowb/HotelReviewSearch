Absolutely nice rooms (and big, very big!) I gave it 4 stars as apposed to 5, because after reading all the wonderful reviews; the picture in my head up front was slightly different. It felt a bit \"old fashioned\", but that could have been because we were a bit out of season and the other guests seemed a bit older then we are (and the decoration is also not very modern) But anyway.
