We were in room 322 and although it didn't have a view of the ocean, it was very spacious with 2 bedrooms, a large living room and balcony. The facility is immaculate. I have never seen so many staff cleaning all day long. The food was very good, too. There was a lot of variety and local delicacies on the menu. All of the food was made from scratch. The pineapple and papaya melted in your mouth. As others have said, this is a relaxed small resort with only 33 units. There were only 7 units occupied when we were there. It is exactly what we wanted because we wanted to be near the locals and to experience the culture in the Dominican Republic. There was a list of activities to do each day through the hotel. Our 13 year old boy played beach volleyball with other young resort guests and Alex, the activities director, virtually every day. The daily list included things like Spanish class, aerobics, beach volleyball, surfing lessons, bingo, and boogie boarding lessons. We also paid to do the jeep safari to 27 falls. We had a blast because we learned a lot about the culture and history of the DR but we also got to climb the last 7 falls. The other paid activity that we did was scuba diving. We went with Dive Cabarete. The owners, Jane and Chris, are amazing. They made sure my 20 year old daughter and 13 year old were confident and prepared for the ocean dive in Sosua Bay. We went down to 40 feet and saw all kinds of fabulous fish and marine life. Our youngest said it was the coolest thing he has ever done in his life. He wants to get his complete PADI certification now. I would recommend this facility if you want to get a feel for the wonderful culture and beauty of the Dominican Republic. I should mention, the beach is rough in front of the hotel but Cabarete has a very nice beach and Sosua is crystal clear and very calm.

The food when you think of all inclusive you might be under the impression of buffet style food that will become mundane over you stay, but to your suprise Ocean Manor offers a diverse menu over 3 square a day with cooks who take the time out to prepare each meal. Along with the restaurant on the resort it wait staff is at your service to see that you needs are met, they are local residents who can speak good English enough so that you can convey what you want. Endless drinks speaks for itself. The view of the ocean from the rooms is priceless and the nearby pools are an awesome place to bake in the sun and relax. Im young so my only gripe is that it seems that Ocean Manor caters to more families and the older crowd which is fine, so if your young just be mindful of that as well as its not chica friendly! Its location is a a few minutes away from the City of Caberete which is good in a sense that it quiet and away from the nightlife, and its just a 15 minute cab ride away from Sosua and a half hour from Puerto Plata.

It is smaller than the huge resorts that you find in places like Playa del Carmen or Jamaica so if manicured lawns, artificial fountains and swimming pools with slides leading into them is what you're looking for, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a smaller, quieter atmosphere that is appropriate for adults and families, then this is the place. There are two pools and a small beach. We are in our late 30's and early 40's and were at home with the younger families and older guests. The place is small enough that you can strike up acquaintances easily if desired and large enough that you don't have to! The staff is really why I am writing this review - my first ever. They went above and beyond to be sure that every need was met. From the wait staff to reception to bartenders to the activities director, everyone was kind, considerate and top notch. There is only one restaurant, but a fairly large menu. If you get tired of the food, it is only a 2 minute drive to downtown Cabarete which has a fabulous beach and many restaurants. The rooms were a good size and very clean. There is an air-conditioned lounge near reception with free wi-fi, computers you can use also for free and there is a telephone that guests can use that is also free! Everyone kept their calls to 5-10 minutes so it was never a problem gaining access (and calls are free to other countries too!).
