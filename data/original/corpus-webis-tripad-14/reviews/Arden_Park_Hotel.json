I agree with some of the other reviews that the outside of this hotel is not very attractive--it's basically a bland, brown building--but the inside is fine. The lobby is fairly small but has a nice fireplace and some chairs for resting in. The desk staff was pleasant and our check-in was fast and smooth. Our room was larger than many double rooms I have stayed in, which was nice--it felt like we had a bit more room to spread out. The room was very clean; the decor felt slightly dated (kind of beige-ish, although there were a few paintings that brightened it up a bit) but it was fine. The bathroom was a nice size and the tub was huge! (In fact, that would be my one caution--if you have trouble stepping up into a deep tub, you might ask when you make your reservation if all of the rooms have these. I could see it being a problem for some people.)", "title": "Nice hotel; fine for our needs", "user": "nykaren24", "date": "October 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 47545516}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The beds were comfortable although the pillows were a bit overly firm for our taste.

The hotel is a fair distance from the main downtown shopping part of Stratford and the other theaters--I'd say a good 20 minute walk.

When he did return, everyone was still in the pool and he gave a 10min warning, and of course 10 min later when he returned and everyone was still in the pool he did not get \"snippy\" he merely said in 5min he would lock the doors as it was now 10:30pm and the sign on the door clearly stated 10pm. this guest pulled the manager aside and chastized him in front of the rest of the hotel guests about him being told it was open until 11 even though it stated on the door 10pm as u enter the pool area.

Caught at the last minute and wanting to see some theatre over a couple of days, this was one of the few hotels or Inns that were not sold out. Now we know why. The room was dark and dreary in spite of blazing sunshine outside due to the inordinately small window and the black-out drapes bleed through the light at dawn. The bathroom was very clean and the beds were comfortable. Those were the only positives I can think of. The dining room hostess informed us that the kitchen could not keep up with dinner orders (this on a thursday night) when we wanted to dine and so we went and had a wonderful meal at Pazzo much further down the street. They definitely could keep up. The front desk staff were a prize-winning study in indifference both at check-in and check-out. All this would be fine if the rate we had paid reflected this, however the rate paid was nearly twice as much as what one would expect to pay for what was received. Avoid if possible.

On top of that, we usually stop in the restaurant downstairs after an evening play for a lovely cup of cocoa and a dessert to discuss the play we just saw. However, at 9:30pm we were greeted with the apology that the \"kitchen closed at 9pm\". We ended up with watered down from a MIX hot chocolate and a sour taste metaphorically and literally left in our mouths as we walked out. Customer service is now non-existent at a once lovely hotel. I do not know what has changed, but we were not the only family to take note of this. We can honestly say that we were completely and utterly dismayed and disappointed with our stay.
