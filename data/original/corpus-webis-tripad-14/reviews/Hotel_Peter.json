The balcony offered wonderful vistas across the lake to the mountains. Breakfast provided a rich selection of bread, rolls, cereal, fruit and cold meats \u2013 and even scrambled eggs if we wished. The evening meal was varied, attractive and well-cooked; our only reservation being that, with elderly appetites, we could not always do justice to the four courses. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who went out of their was to assist when we had particular requests. Perhaps, though, our most striking commendation is in terms I cannot recall ever before using of a hotel. This is clearly a happy place, where the friendly staff and proprietors are obviously happy in their work, and do all that they can to ensure that guests are equally happy during their stay.", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 6, 2005", "id": 3639813}], "location": {"country": "Austria", "region": "Upper Austria", "continent": "Europe", "city": "St. Wolfgang"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 4, "very good": 15, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 42}, "aka": "Peter Hotel St Wolfgang", "slim_ranking": 0.307692307692}
