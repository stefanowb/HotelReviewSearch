The beds where infested with bedbugs and when I requested a new room the hotel staff simply told me to sleep in the lobby. The food there is beyond appetizing and the staff is totally ill-mannered. Not to mention the 70's theme of the hotel. I recommend this hotel to no one in their right mind.

This, however, was 15 years ago. My brother and I wanted to do something for New Year's Eve this year that required no airline tickets to get there. He came up with the idea of going to Kutsher's that New Year's Eve weekend, and reliving the memories from our childhood. We booked 2 rooms for four of us (my brother, his gf, me, and my bf). It cost us $130 a night for each room. This included meals, not tips or drinks. We also needed to make a $200 deposit for the two rooms. But the total price didn't sound too shabby, since meals were included. We also wanted to go skiing and there were mountains nearby. My mother kept warning me that the place would disappoint us, and we shouldn't go there. Of course, being children, we need to do it anyway and hopefully prove our parents wrong. About 2 days before, I went online to get directions there, and I came upon reviews on tripadvisor.com. OMG! I'd say that EVERY single review had MANY negative things to say. This made me nervous and I expressed it to the ones I was going with. However, at that point, we couldn't get our deposit back, because it was over the 72 hour threshold you need to cancel by. Ok, so how bad could it be? Well, my brother informed me that he switched rooms 3 times, before I got there! The heat wasn't working in the first room. The second room's door locks seemed shady, so he didn't feel comfortable, and then finally got an upgrade to the third room. I was given the upgrade to my room as well. Let me just say that when I looked at this \"upgraded\" room, I couldn't even imagine what a nonupgraded room would look like! It didn't look like it was cleaned, the ambiance of the room was from the 1970's, the shower had mildew everywhere, there was brown gunk coming out of the faucet when turned on, the cover to the heater was off....I could go on and on. I felt like I was in a shelter for my vacation. Then we excitedly left the room to get something to eat in the dining room. I don't know what they killed or what kind of cheap crap was served, but it was disgusting. Juice was included, and when we received our juice, it came in cups the size of shot glasses. The entertainment that night was a comedian, and he was terrible. Even better, the main reason why we went upstate in New York was for skiing and it was so warm that NO mountains had any snow! NONE! What were we gonna do for 3 days with no skiing? Needless to say, the next morning, skipping breakfast, we left, went to a diner, and had to make last minute plans for the rest of the New Year's Eve weekend, including New Year's Eve. My brother ended up getting us a refund of everything except the cost of dinner per person, which was $30. How in the world they came up with $30, I will never have any idea. It wasn't even worth a few dollars. AND! What's really interesting is that there were apparently 900 people staying there that weekend. I'd like to know what they saw that we didn't. I certainly didn't remember Kutsher's like this as a teenager. At that time, I wanted to keep going back there year after year, until my mother couldn't take the fact that it was so boring there, so we stopped going. After that experience, my mind has definitely changed.
