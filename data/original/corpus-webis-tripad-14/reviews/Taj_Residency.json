It is probably the best hotel available in Aurangabad and the Ellora and Ajanta caves are spectacular and not to be missed. Taj needs to do something to improve things at this hotel. The hotel is staffed primarily be trainees who are furnished by Taj's hotel academy located right next door. We found that no staff members were able to answer simple questions without consulting with senior staff. On one occasion, when I first called \"Operator\" and then the front desk to ask a question, no one answered after 20 rings at each extension. The service in the restaurant was sub-standard and the \"barbecue\" was overpriced for what it was. In fact, in addition to the fixed price barbecue cost, we were charged 450 rupees for a small Perrier. I questioned this charge and was told that it was \"correct.\" I also mentioned this charge to a manager at the time of checkout and was kept waiting more than 10 minutes while he disappeared to check on it and never returned. Our room had been renovated but was still not much better than motel standard. The hotel has a nice pool and the grounds are attractive but a major upgrade is needed. On the positive side, although we had to check out at 8 AM in order to leave for the Ajanta caves, the hotel provided us with a room at no additional charge when we returned in order to shower and change before we left for the airport in the evening.", "title": "Trainee Hotel", "user": "DCRE", "date": "March 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 59950542}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "We stay in Taj for 3 nights.
