Try this!", "text": "It is such a magical location - it is basically a series of little islands in the middle of a river. Three old mills are linked together with little bridges and you are completely surrounded by water. You can't see any other properties so you really feel like you are million miles from anywhere. The guest rooms are in one of the mills - one on each floor. We had the top floor room which was built in the roof space, so the windows were quite small. The first or second floor rooms would be the pick of the bunch, though ours was beautiful. The owners live in the main house on another island and that is where you have breakfast on bad weather days (enjoyed outside on good days). There are boats for rowing, fishing lines to catch fish and lots of ducks to feed plus a very spoilt and friendly fat cat.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "beav", "date": "June 25, 2005", "id": 3611393}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007", "text": "This place just has to be seen to be believed. The mills (moulins) were in use from the 1600's until 1964. The owners live in one building and the 3 guest rooms are in another. Our room was on the second floor (accessibility alert! narrow steep staircase and no elevator), was extremely spacious and beautifully decorated and had a very modern bathroom. Since you're right over the river, if you open the windows there's the sound of water splashing by to lull you to sleep. Foot bridges connect the moulins to islands in the middle of the river and to the other bank. There are paths to stroll on and endless places to just stop and enjoy the beautiful pastoral scene. Breakfast was delicious (fresh raspberries from their vines. yum!). The owners have lived all over the world, speak perfect English, and are delightful to talk to.
