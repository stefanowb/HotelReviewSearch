This is my second stay here (the first was back in June 2005). The rooms we stayed in have tiled floors, two single beds, and a small bathroom with toilet, basin, and a shower over the bath. Fittings, beds etc are old and plain but are clean and perfectly acceptable for the low cost of the hotel. There is a relatively large balcony with the most fantastic view. Two computers downstairs allow relatively unimpeded free computer access. Breakfast is included (cold boiled eggs, meats, cheeses, fruit, cereals, juice, coffee and tea). A couple of the staff can be very difficult, a complaint I had on both trips. The young woman at the front counter told us explicitly no rooms were available when we attempted to lengthen our stay. I booked a room through the hotel's own website and had her print out the confirmation for me, which I have to say i enjoyed! However the staff all speak excellent English, and this woman's male colleagues were unfailingly helpful and polite. The hotel is a short (less than ten minute) and easy stroll into town, but the location of Gagou is so much nicer than staying in town. One word of warning - it is fantastic to hire scooters here to explore the rest of the island, but you do need a motorbike licence now to do so. We made do with a small car but these are quite a lot more expensive (up to 80 euros versus 25 euros for a scooter).", "title": "AMAZING LOCATION - THIS HOTEL IS ALL YOU NEED", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "seewhatsoutthere", "date": "November 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 87937691}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "After I booked this hotel, I learned the ferry schedule.

The lobby is very nice, but this is not a designer hotel. The rooms were quite ordinary, not as shown on the website. That said, the best thing about the hotel is its position right at a small beach. Every room has a seaview and a balcony. Very relaxing. As noted in other reviews, it is an easy 15 minute walk to Samos town. Overall, I made an excellent choice for being in that area. I paid 60 euros a night for a small double room - fine for me traveling alone. The staff was professional, friendly, and helpful at all times. The bed was quite good and the pillows were perfect. The cons, however: weak wifi in the room, low pressure shower, water never got really hot, no safe in the room (safe deposit boxes at reception, though). The buffet breakfast was average for Greek properties.

Very romantic and nice music. On the downsite: the food. A small variety at dinner, there was just three different dishes and everything was cold all the time. The food was in my opinion always leftovers from the night before. Some spaghetti and grind meet or something like that. The hotel has no swimming pool so I thought sunbeds on the beach could be free, but they weren't. There is no cleanig service on Sundays and we had a flood on our balcony from the room in the higher level, because the maids didn't empty bootles of water from AC.
