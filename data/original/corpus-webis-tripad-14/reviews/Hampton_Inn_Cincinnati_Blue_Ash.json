We asked for fans or some other way of ventilating the rooms - nothing. We were offered some kind of scented spray to mask the smell, but smell is only part of the concern. Allergies are a bigger part so it was an anxious night of worrying who might get sick. We were stuck with a smelly room and we didn't sleep well. Closer inspection showed mold growing in a few places (see pictures) - namely in the vents on the air conditioner, around the shower and on the bathroom ceiling.
