The entire hotel was modern and the view from the room was gorgeous. The staff members were accomodating and when I asked them where I could get a piece of traditional dominican birthday cake (because it was my birthday) they had the kitchen make me one..since there was no nearby bakery. The breakfast buffet was good but overpriced and yes the pool was small but so what...it was always empty. There weren't any worthy restaurants close to the hotel....but if you don't mind walking then you'll have a few options including a grocery store and a small strip mall. You can also take a short cab ride to el conde. But don't bother going into the so called mall next door (malecon) because it's just a bunch of ATM's. And last but not least try and eat at El Conuco which is a cheap cab ride or a long walk. The food was authentic and the staff was great. They even put on a show during dinner. If you are heading out to any of the bars/clubs make sure you get an early start because everything is over by 1am...even on the weekends.", "title": "Nice Hotel...good location...but nothing to rave about", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "SAKY10", "date": "November 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10701429, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location"}}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 22, "average": 54, "very good": 119, "terrible": 15, "excellent": 200}, "aka": "Hilton Santo Domingo Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.154929577465, "description": "The Hilton Santo Domingo is located on the southern side of the city, 31 kilometers (35 minutes) away from the Las Americas International Airport and 110 kilometers (120 minutes) away from La Romana International Airport.
