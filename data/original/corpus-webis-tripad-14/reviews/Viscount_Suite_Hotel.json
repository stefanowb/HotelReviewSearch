We were very surprised at the size of the room- we were greeted by a large sitting room, a hallway with a bar sink, followed by a king sized bedroom. The rate of $99 included a hot buffet breakfast. We encountered few deals like this in our U.S. travels. Staff were helpful with instructions about driving directions and polite at the desk. The rooms were very clean. During our stay, an interstate high school football tournament was occurring and the desk wisely placed our room in a wing where there was no noise.
