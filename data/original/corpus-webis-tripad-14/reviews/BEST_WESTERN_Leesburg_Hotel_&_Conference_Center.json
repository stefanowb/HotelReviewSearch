We were placed in #102 and the spotlight shone through our curtain all night , plus we were next to the exit door which was very noisy.

Our room was not recently renovated, but fine for a chain hotel. Nice sitting area and couch. A desk and chair and a very comfy bed. Bathroom was clean and had basic toiletries. This hotel \"wins\" on the extras. Hot popcorn, coffee and cookies available in the lobby each afternoon and great full breakfast (included) each morning. There were at least four different wedding parties and guests staying there while we visited. Seems to be very popular with the wedding crowd. All in all a quiet, clean, comfy location to stay.

The reception area is very clean indeed. The pool is very well maintained and has a lifeguard on duty - a pleasant change from pools without supervision. The breakfast bar had a large range of choices which were alwasy filled up promptly. The breakfast area is large and always clean and tidy. We visited the Frank Lloyd Wright home and George Washington's plantation - it's a great base from which to visit. We also got the train from Springfield Franconia into Washington. There are so many restaurants in the area it was easy to find a good place to eat. We also went to the Movies at Potomac Mills Mall. I would highly recommend this hotel.
