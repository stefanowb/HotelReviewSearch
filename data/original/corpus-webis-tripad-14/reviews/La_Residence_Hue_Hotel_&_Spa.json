Our dinner at the hotel restaurant was equally disappointing. The vegetables were not crisp and our food was just average. The kitchen was unwilling to meet our requests that deviated at all from the menu. A lunch we ordered at the pool took forever to arrive (the kitchen is very slow in turing out food during the afternoon) and our sandwiches had undercooked and uncrisp bacon in them.

It is such a grand art deco colonial building & is a holiday within a holiday. It is quite a large complex so it was easy to relax with friends peacefully. I enjoyed swimming in the pool, having a drink in the bar, playing pool at the pool table. The breakfast buffet was very good. The service was excellent. They had taxis on standby & an ATM machine is next door. The post office is just down the road. You will need to catch a taxi to the town centre but I didn't care as I was completely smitten with this place. The only criticism I have is that the Tour Desk Operator was a little 'brusque' & upset me however the lovely staff did their best to appease me. The laundry is done with much TLC. I had a fantastic time here & hope to return one day. Highly recommended & worth the extra $!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dancingpiglit", "date": "June 19, 2008", "id": 17047693}], "location": {"country": "Vietnam", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Hue"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 32, "very good": 181, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 694}, "aka": "La Residence Hue Hotel Hue", "slim_ranking": 0.0377358490566, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}}
