It is about maybe 10 or so mins away from Gatlinburg which makes it great. It is close enough but you can avoid all the crazyness that can be closer to the towns. It is very clean and maintained.

I don't know, but I prefer to feel like I am in the woods if I'm going to go to a campground. The bathrooms and showers are also very clean. Loved it!
