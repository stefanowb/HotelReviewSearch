My room was on the 3rd floor of the main building and definitely felt dated. It was a tight room that felt worn. The TV remote almost worked some of the time and most annoying was a bathroom sink with separate hot & cold faucets. These are still very common in the UK but have no place in a decent hotel.

Lovely toiletries and fluffy bathrobes. My only real complaint was the fact that when I walked into the room, it was freezing cold. There were two radiators, neither of which would turn on (I suspect they are centrally controlled). I rang Reception and was promptly provided with a portable electric heater, which helped a bit. The man who brought it also came equipped with a screwdriver - I think this was more of a \"Prop\" to show he'd tried to fix the \"problem\" but I am confident pressing the central control switch would have done the job! If so, it's a bit off leaving rooms without heat when it's sub zero temperatures outside. Just something to be aware of if you stay during winter. I took room service breakfast, which was very nice and delivered on time. Overall, the stay was good but they should ensure rooms are warmed before guests' arrival. Also, the usual problem of extremely thin walls. One of my colleagues was unfortunately subjected to rather loud and inconsiderate bedroom activity from the room above, whilst I could hear \"toilet\" activity (the lesser of two evils in my opinion!)
