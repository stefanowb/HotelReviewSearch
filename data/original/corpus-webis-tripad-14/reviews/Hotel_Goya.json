Apart from the emailed rate being quoted as 65euro for a double, the web page subsequently stating 55euro (the hotel honoured the web rate) everything else was fine and certainly good value for money.The location is great, right near the Catedral and within a short walk of plenty of restaurants and bars. The room was modern and clean albeit a touch small. Bathroom was clean with a good powerful shower. Overall very good value if you want a no frills, clean room right in the centre of this lovely city", "user": "Markysharky", "date": "February 20, 2009", "id": 24867271}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Unpleasant experience!", "text": "Single room was tiny; hallways smelled of cigarette smoke; walls were extremely thin & all the noise from the halls came into the room; Internet only in the lobby, not in the rooms; very loud construction on the 4th floor every day from before 9 a.m. until the evening.

As we were short on time we stayed, then it gets interesting: we were given a room that wasn't cleaned, in fact it had someone else's belongings in it. We were eventually given another room. The odd front desk guy kept my passport, I had to ask for it - no one else has ever done this. When we tried to leave for a visit in the town, the front was locked as the front desk guy had gone inside the hotel. Being locked inside a building is definitely a bad safety problem. The walls are paper thin, and in the middle of the night, a strong sewer odor permeated the floor, from somewhere in the the building. We had the windows open, because the air conditioning didn't work, making the sewer smell even worse. There are so many lovely reasonably priced placed to stay all over Spain - avoid this one, it was the only bad one during a great two week trip from the south to north of Spain.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 4, 2007", "id": 10577185}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Quick summary:", "title": "do not stay in this place", "user": "bos78", "date": "September 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "business": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 10019146, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 staff"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Hidden cancellation policy", "text": "1.The room was tiny, claustophobic, dull, noisy, with no privacy", "user": "bamarn", "date": "September 25, 2007", "id": 10000406}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "2.We encountered disgraceful lies and sneakiness", "title": "Lacking a lot for the price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "epnewyork", "date": "April 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7485999, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 room, service"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "3.The only good thing I can say is that the toilet was clean.", "title": "Perfect location, beautiful hostal", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jasminian", "date": "March 31, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7260971, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 cleanliness & spaciousness", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "more like a hotel than a hostal!", "text": "We stayed at the hostal goya for the bank holiday in October and it was packed!!", "user": "banusboy", "date": "November 1, 2006", "id": 6036537}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "loved it!", "text": "The hostal has been reformed and its just like staying in a hotel but without the breakfast, the quality is that good!
