Lots of shopping for last minute items in the area and lots of restaurants to eat at. Flight was not until late the next day so was able to return and take shuttle to airport.

We were very pleased to receive the HP. Stayed at a HP one time before near Baltimore's airport and that was a great experience. Plenty of free parking for our rental car. Very stylish lobby area and there were free green apples and newspapers for the taking. The room was extremely clean and everything was in order. Wished we could have taken advantage of the exercise room but time prohibited though it looked just fine. One in our party made it down to the continental breakfast and was pleased with his choices. There was a nice area to eat in as well as an outdoor area. Great location near the airport but we heard no sounds whatsoever. Also, Interestate 95 was extremely close.
