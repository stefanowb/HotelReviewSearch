I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past three years as it is close to my company's Corp offices in midtown manhattan. However, this was the first time I have stayed more than one night. Check In was fine but the hotel is having some construction around it and my room was adjacent to some major noises. I requested a move which I had to defend requesting for several minutes before the front desk moved me to a higher floor. The second room had a poorrly performing,old and crusty air conditioner vent that was wheezily keeping about 25 % of the room cool. While the room was comfortable and clean, my sleep was not pleasant due to the room's warmness over two July nights. Because of the tone received after my first room chnage request, i chose go tough it out since i knew id be out of the room most of the daystime.The room also had a residual cigarette smoke smell evn after being cleaned. Despite the hotels proximity for my business, I don't plan to stay there again. I didn't feel that feel that any effort was made to perk me as a longtime SPG member and was surprised by the initial pushback to the room change request.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Farmerica", "date": "July 8, 2011", "id": 115168750}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is my first review here on Tripadvisor and I have had hundreds of very successful stays at hotels all around the world.
