From the start when we arrived, we were looked after and treated like VIP's. Well located right next to the water front and views of table mountain to die for. Nobu restaurant is a must if you are into sushi! The best we have had (besides in Japan, but how can anyone compete?) My wife said she had the oysters and that these were the best she had ever had. Breakfast in the morning was superb and coming down and being greeted by the staff and making you feel extra special just made the whole trip a top stay! Our room was superb and so where those of our managers. Everyone raved about how great the hotel was and kept on asking us why we left South Africa to move to Sweden. So a good place to stay. Vista lounge with high tea in the afternoon was also a every day must. The only complaint? They ran out of brandy, which sure, with 13 people drinking the same brandy could maybe be expected that they would run low, but I did not expect this from a hotel of this standard to actually run out, but generally all round it was excellent and maybe we were drinking too much as we were enjoying ourselves too much?", "title": "The name says it all!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Eric R", "date": "March 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126407068}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We went to the Only and Only in Cape Town, and it is must.

Only remark about the rooms is the rather complex way to operate the TV but hey, that's just detail. We had breakfast daily at Rueben's, and it was sumpteous and of excellent quality, with friendly service at all times. Wonderful pool and pool area, although it tends to get a bit overcrowded, with the usual mess of left/dropprd towels , though staff tries hard to clean-up after guests. Wonderful gym ... one of the best hotel gyms I have ever come accross anywhere. We did not use the Spa.
