The complex itself is very clean, and the food was good no tummy upsets which was a relief. The menu was repetitive so we did have to eat out which added expense to our all inclusive break, but this was a personal choice. The staff were very friendly but could speak limited english, but they made us feel extremely welcome and without them the holiday would have been a bit of a drag. The entertainment was quite poor and noise was limited after 10.30, in the evening and not a lot to keep the children busy during the day. I would not recommend this venue as a lively family hotel, which we would of liked. We did make the most of what we had, and overall we did have an enjoyable time. The apartments are of good size, but when I did book, I did not realise that I would have to sleep on a sofa bed for two weeks, having a back complaint this was not good, I advise that you do check this out. The complex is quite remote and you do have to get taxis or the bus to town and the larger beaches, which also adds expense to your holiday, there is one shop and bar close by. I would visit cyprus again, just not this holiday village.", "title": "Could of been better", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Dereck7", "date": "June 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7869642, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Sofa Bed"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Family of four - May 07", "title": "What a great hotel!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "DKVM", "date": "June 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7774954, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Booked a late deal to Cyprus and found this wonderful hotel on Sunshine.co.uk.
