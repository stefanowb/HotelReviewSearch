We felt as though we had found the secret to a wonderful, comfortable, and friendly stay in Paris. This hotel has a first class location just over a block from the Pont Neuf on Rue Dauphine, within easy walking distance to the Louvre, Saint Chappelle, Notre Dame and, in the other direction, the main shopping district of St. Germain du Pres and the Luxembourg Gardens. The nearby Metro stop is convenient, just one stop away from Musee d'Orsay (though the Musee d'Orsay also is an easy 10-15 minute walk) and, best of all, is on the main line for the train to Versailles (we went twice). On a sunny day, we walked all the way up to the end of the Champs Elysee and the Arc de Triomphe but it was a bit of a hike. Our rooms, which were the smaller, less expensive rooms on the front side facing the street, were clean, comfortable, cozy and quiet with pristine baths, plenty of hot water and fluffy towels. Each room had a working desk, a sofa or easy chair and a tv with BBC and CNN as the English channels. The front desk is incredibly helpful, particularly with dinner reservations and tips on where to go and we found the service to be first rate -- from the front desk to the breakfast room, housekeeping and the bar. The breakfast is just wonderful and while it seemed expensive given the fall of the dollar, it really is a great value for the price (eggs, oatmeal, fresh fruit, croissants, pastries, etc.). Good coffee and hot chocolate too. There are a number of terrific restaurants within easy walking distance - we especially liked Les Bouquinistes which is a Guy Savoy restaurant 2 blocks away toward the Seine and a cafe called Cafe Atlas about 2 blocks in the other direction. The hotel has a jazz concert in the bar every afternoon and there is internet access from a computer in the bar and another computer off a nook toward the back.

The are by the hotel is busy and if you leave your windows open at night it will be noisy but all the rooms have 2 sets of double panes on the doors and when closed you hear nothing. We enjoyed opening our windows during the day to hear everything below. The hotel staff are just A+. We arrived late at night and were greeted outside by several employees helping us to get to our rooms. Everyone who worked here was extremely polite and helpful. Thank god they all spoke english. The rooms are good size by Paris standards. Bathrooms are very nice. Our rate included breakfast which was awesome. Fresh squeezed juices, pastries, cereal, yogurts, fresh cut up fruit, eggs, bacon sausage, potatoes, veggies etc. Wonderful breakfast each morning. We also had a free boat ride on the Seine. The boats leave from Pont Neuf which is 5 minutes from the hotel. This was a wonderful cruise. We went early evening as it was cooler and less busy. The hotel provided us at a minimal charge, tickets to the Louve. We were able to walk right to the front to get in, this saved at least an hour or more in line. Thank god as it was very hot the day we went. Each morning we would stop at the front desk. Tell them where we were heading and they would draw on our maps the best routes, give us ideas for lunch, tips on the area etc. I really can't say enough about them. In the end I came down to 3 hotels to choose from. Relais Christine, Hotel Luxembourg Parc and d'Aubusson. We went to see the other 2 hotels as I was curious. Relais Christine is just around the corner. 30 seconds from d'Aubusson. This hotel is also beautiful. Gorgeous courtyard. The advantage to staying here is that it may be a little less busy as it is on a side street. We needed multiple rooms and the difference in price added up so that is why we didn't go here. Luxembourg Parc looked very nice but the location would not have been good for us. It is right by the Luxembourg gardens which are beautiful and worth a visit but it would take a good 15 minutes just to get to the Seine. The area also gets quite at night. After a long day sightseeing you don't want to have to walk back that far to your hotel. We loved d'Aubusson and would definitely return.

The location could not be beat. We were within a short walk of most museums and tourist locations and the Metro was only two blocks away. The only thing that left a bit of a bad taste with me was that the hotel charged us a 20% premium over the actual cost of a 4 day Museum Pass when we purchased them at the front desk. They didn't tell us when we purchased them...and I didn't ask. It was only Euro 20 so it was not a big deal but it was my last dealing with the hotel as I noted the price upon check out.

I much prefer the 6th district (and it little boutiques, cafes, bistros and art galleries) to any others. The hotel is not deep in the 6th though- it is close to the river so you can walk to the Louvre, Notre dame and all the bridges and go the rightbank. On the south side of it you can wallk to St Germiane cafes, theaters etc.", "title": "Old world charm with modern conveniences", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "annecw_10", "date": "July 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115447627}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "My wife, 14 year old son and I spent three generally pleasant evenings in the Hotel D\u2019Aubusson in June, 2011.
