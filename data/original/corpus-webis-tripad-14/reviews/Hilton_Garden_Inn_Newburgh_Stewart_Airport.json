The location is convenient--there are plenty of restaurants in the area, there is a mall nearby and a Wal-Mart, too. Orange County Choppers is next door, and I walked over there several evenings for dinner and looked at all of the amazing bikes. The hotel staff was very helpful. There was a problem with the fan on the heating unit in my room. The maintenance mechanic fixed it quickly. What really impressed me was the next day he saw me in the lobby, recognized me, and asked if everything was satisfactory. All of the staff were helpful like that. Edith in housekeeping was very thoughtful. There is plenty of free coffee, tea bags, and hot water. The breakfast looked nice, but I never tried it because I thought it was a little pricey.", "title": "Convenient Location, helpful staff", "user": "SEMOTraveler074", "date": "March 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 155543594}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Just a warning to those who are sensitive to cigarette smoke: there are some smoking rooms on the ground floor of the hotel, near the laundry room. I wanted a room close to a side door, because I have a lot of things to load into my car everyday that I need for my work. Cigarette smoke doesn't bother me, and it was worth putting up with the smell to have a room close to a side door. But if you're bothered by cigarette smoke, be sure to reserve a room far away from the laundry room. Oh, and if you're planning to do laundry during your stay ... there is not a vending machine with those little boxes of detergent and fabric softener, so you'll have to buy soap from the nearby Wal-Mart.", "title": "Filthy Room: Urine Soaked Floor", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cintioh", "date": "March 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 154296303}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Overall, this is a nice hotel for a long stay, with a small refrigerator and microwave in the room.
