What a great choice! I called the hotel directly to book the rooms and from check-in to check-out it was perfect - not a single complaint. I booked two rooms for our group, one on the top level and one on the 3rd level. Both were very well appointed, the top floor room had a gas fireplace, the other room had a nice balcony, both with mountain views. While the resort and Vail in general are going through an extensive construction period - we were able to have a perfectly wonderful weekend - no problems, no noise, we didn't get lost in the hallways (honestly it kind of reminded me of a treasure hunt - where is the room?) Just having the opportunity to get away, wake up in a beautiful hotel room to a light dusting of snow and fresh mountain air was simply the best. The restaurant at the Cascade has an extensive wine list, and the food was ok - very meat intensive. If you like German food - you must try Pepi's in Vail.

Resort is currently undergoing extensive renovations and this coloured my experience in some areas. Check in was no problem but finding the room was a huge challenge. Following the directions I was given, I found myself at a dead end with a door marked \"Authorized People Only\". As it turned out, that was the only way to access the Terrace Wing and an employee walked us through the construction area to access our rooms. Room nice and big with safe, robes and comfy king sized bed. (The entire property is non-smoking so that was a plus.) Has a spa treatment at the Aria spa. Kate was great and the sitting area was fairly comfortable with tea and water available. Robes provided were very worn out and tired looking and for the prices, I expected better quality. Had lunch at Chaps Grill and Steakhouse everyday. Because there were 50 people at this meeting, they only offered a very unimaginative buffet with much of the same food every day and a soup/sandwich combo. (Would not allow anyone to order a la carte.) Colleague order room service for supper and said while the burger was good, the fries were inedible - tasted as though the oil used to fry was rancid. No response to her complaints. Has an early flight (6 am) so spoke with concierge on the previous morning to arrange for a cab at 4:45 am, the time he recommended to make the flight in \u201cplenty of time\u201d. Checked twice that all was in order. Despite assurances no taxi had, in fact, been ordered and at 4:55am a resort employee rushed us to the airport where we arrived at 5:30 am, just as the gate closed and we were told we had missed the flight. One of the gate agents actually turned off the lights and left but the second one relented and let us through. I followed up with the resort upon my return home and was told that there had been a mix up and they apologised. Hmmmm. Another problem at check out was that the computers were down, making it impossible to confirm that the correct charges had been made. I was faxed a bill that morning but it was wrong. The room had been previously paid for (non-refundable) and yet they charged my credit card, meant for incidentals, the entire amount a second time. Took quite some time and a few phone calls to straighten that out. Overall, an adequate experience. Construction meant no gift shop open, no ATM available, few inside routes available to get from one area to another without going out side. I stayed just as the season was about to get underway so perhaps the staff needs a bit more experience to make a stay there more pleasant.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Rite", "date": "November 26, 2007", "id": 11074710}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed at the Vail Cascade for our honeymoon last December. It could not have been more perfect! The room was beautiful, the staff was exceptionally attentive, and every detail seemed perfect. We loved the fact that the resort has its own ski lift, so we didn't waste any time getting to the slopes in the morning.

The room is definitely nice - comfortable beds, nice linens, and good decor. The Aria club connected to the hotel is extremely nice. It has basketball & racquetball courts and an outstanding weight room. I was surprised that there was no additional charge. The mountainside pool was great and there were several quaint hot tubs to choose from. There is a pleasant bike path that leads up to Lionshead. It's not a short walk, but pretty easy. I didn't go to the Fireside bar but it looks like a great place to go for an apres ski drink in winter. I did have the breakfast buffet at Chaps restaurant - might have been one of the best omelettes I've ever had. All in all, I'd highly recommend this hotel. I'd say it would be even nicer during ski season as it has lift access (have to ride lift down at end of the day though as you can't really ski-out). The only minor complaint I have is the low toilet and the full size mirror on the inside of the bathroom door.
