The hotel interior has been beautifully maintained and the walls of the hotel foyer has wonderful old photos telling stories of tourists and holiday makers in the early 1900's. The resort as it stands today is heaps bigger and different to the original building and the manicured gardens and lawn area is excellent for children to play.
