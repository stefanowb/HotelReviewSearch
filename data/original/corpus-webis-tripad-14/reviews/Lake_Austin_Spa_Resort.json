The location is beautiful, and the spa treatments are great. I am in the hospitality industry, so I can be very picky when it comes to hotel rooms, hotel service, etc. I can honestly say that the service here was top notch, and the rooms and spa were well maintained and spotlessly clean. We had a garden room which had two queen beds, lovely terracotta tile floors and a two sink bathroom with plenty of room for all of the toiletries and makeup that two women could bring with them. The food was also great. Some have commented that the portions are small, and this is true if you compare them to the supersize plates that we in the US are used to.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "AKMCT", "date": "May 30, 2006", "id": 5235514}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not worth the price", "text": "We spoke to a number of people who had been to Canyon Ranch, and many preferred Lake Austin for its more personalized attention.

The grounds, the spa. Some of what wasn't so great, bad attitude by kitchen staff when you ordered room service, a fireplace in my room that didn't work properly, waiting over an hour to get an iron & ironing board, very small portions of food. I have been to a lot of spas. I thought it was too overpriced for what it was. The cottage rooms were kind of quaint but not what I would expect out of a place that is supposed to be a luxury resort. Also you can't sleep in here. My cottage was across from the main building, so you hear the delivery people & employees slamming car doors early in the morning. Go to Rancho Valencia in Rancho Santa Fe, California instead, now there's a high class resort, where you have privacy.", "title": "Lake Austin Spa Resort is great Destination Spa", "helpfulness": 25, "user": "dhemmert", "date": "January 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4366992}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What a great place...great people too.", "text": "My husband and I recently stayed at Lake Austin Spa and had a wonderful time.

I read the reviews on this site before I went, so I was a bit apprehensive about making the trip. However, I am happy that I did not take the reviews too much to heart. I really had a great time. Lake Austin is like a cozy home away from home. The resort is not large, so you do not feel as if you would get lost in the crowd. The size was just right for me. The accomodations were comfortable, the setting was serene, the food and spa treatments were excellent. I felt as if I was the only person that mattered at any time.
