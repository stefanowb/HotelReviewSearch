The hotel grounds & lobby are beautifully maintained, but our room left ALOT to be desired! We stayed in the low-rise buildings that either faced the canals or pool area. I cannot comment on the main building's guest rooms, only the room we were in. The furnishings are quite dated, but that would be ok had it not been for the poor condition of the room. The chairs had many stains on them, the airconditioner vent had what appeared to be mold in side. In fact we both woke up coughing every morning & not until the last day did we notice the dirt in the vents.The shower's rubber pads to prevent slipping were worn out or in some spots non existent. We paid $329 per night for that room & we certainly did not get our money's worth. We spent relatively little time at the hotel since the purpose of this trip was visiting relatives so we never bothered to complain. On Saturday the maid did not clean the room until after 4. This hotel caters to cruise lines so I knew that there were many check outs on Saturdays so I didn't complain. If you are going to use the facilities, which we did not, perhaps you can overlook the state of the guest room because the hotel is beautiful, the pool area gorgeous, the proximity to water sports are great, with a marina on the grounds.", "title": "Beautiful hotel with outdated guest rooms", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "gayler104", "date": "January 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148540423}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The Hyatt Pier 66 is a real hidden gem.

I found a great package deal on line, Jet Blue and Pier 66. We usually stay in small boutique hotels but the deal was so good we gave the Hyatt a try. Not sure what to expect we remained open minded. Our flight from Boston arrived late so we called the hotel to let them know we would be late. They told us we already had a room and not to hurry. After stopping at Southport Raw Bar (open late, good shrimp and oysters at a great price) we were greeted with a smile at check in. The woman asked us if we were hungry and told us about food options since the restaurants at the hotel were all closed. Already having a warm feeling we thanked her and told her we ate on the way. Our room was big with a beautiful wrap around deck and a spectacular view. OMG we melted into those ever so comfy beds. Richardo at the Lounge was such a pleasure to deal with, funny and entertaining and the best Mojitos . All the associates made us feel at home, with the exception of one. He was not even rude but curt. The grounds at the 66 are beautiful and the pool area is so relaxing. Given the size of the property it is surprising, it must be the layout. I do wish that the parents of children were asked to follow the pool rules. Constant screaming and running is not acceptable. The pool attendant was livid when they stated throwing towels into the pool. The staff at Orchids Pool Bar are a lot of fun and the coffee was not bad. We had a meal at Grill 66 it was quite good. This trip we choose not to rent a car so we spent some time at Pelican Landing waiting for the Water Taxi. The food at Pelican is tasty and the Water Taxi is pretty much on schedule. Grab a drink for the ride, they encourage libations. I think the Water Taxi is a must try, for around twenty bucks a day you can go all day, come back to the 66 and go out again at night. The Water Taxi is such an asset to Ft. Lauderdale. We also used the Sun Trolly, its 50 cents a ride or 2 dollars all day. Not always reliable but sometimes you get lucky and it does add to the fact that Ft. Lauderdale is the best city for getting around without having to cab everywhere. Walking is another good option. There is so much to see. We were a bit disappointed with breakfast. We love to enjoy a leisurely relaxing meal at breakfast, sipping coffee while we plan our day. Mariners was a bit like Grand Central Station, maybe the cruse crowd. Leaving the property for breakfast was not what we wanted. The Lounge would a great place to sip coffee and have the breakfast we had hoped for. Starting our day with a cozy breakfast is most important to us. Both my husband and I had a great Christmas and it had a lot to do with picking 66. Thank you all at Hyatt and have the best New Year. P.S.

This room faced the A1A highway and cruise ship port, and had considerable noise with the balcony door ajar, and a noticeable smell of yacht fuel when ships arrived or departed, depending on the wind. Visiting a room facing north/ northeast, with a partial view over the ocean was significantly quieter and more pleasant, but it was too short a stay to warrant a room change. The dinner at the lobby bar (main restaurant) was fairly poor and greasy and the service was slow. Many restaurants are less than a mile away west on the A1A. the pool was nice, with a 25 yard section for lap swimming though the water a bit warm for a serious workout. For real swimmers, visit the nearby Swimming Hall of Fame Olympic-sized pools. Bought room via TravelZoo so particularly good value, but I could see staying here again even on a regular rate.

I went to the lobby for a glass of water and I listened to see if the front desk was informing new comers of the absence of running water. Not a word. In fact I hear one of the desk clerks flippantly telling another how people expected him to do something about it. Now the yacht club is a bit of a hike - no offer to take us in one of the golf carts they have on the property. I noticed a guy using the waterfall in the pool to wash his hair. Other than offering to bring us water, there was nothing provided for the major inconvenience of the hotel guests. I thought a complimentary breakfast or even a discount was in order. Regarding the room. It was clean and ordinary. It was advertised as a marina view. I guess you can call a yacht parked outside your room as such. To me it was just a big obstruction of the view !
