This location is extremely convenient for us, whether we fly or drive. There are great shopping & dining options close by. The rooms are very comfortable, especially the one bedroom suite, which is really a nice, small apartment. Service at this facility is just over the top--we will be back again soon.

We chose this hotel based on the great tripadvisor reviews. We have 2 kids so every time I check in to a hotel, the first thing I do is check for safety and cleanliness of the hotel room. After pulling back the sheets to make sure they were clean before putting the kids down for a nap, I saw multiple hairs, not lint, but what looked like pubic hairs! I was absolutely disgusted! Hotel staff did come fairly quickly and change our sheets. But after she left, I noticed that on the floor where she had put the dirty sheets the hairs from the sheets and now toenail clippings were present! Gross! My husband asked the front desk if they would come vacuum and mop our floors while we were at dinner where the front desk attendant asked \"can it wait till tomorrow?\" who wants their children to walk and/ or crawl around a strangers pubic hairs/toenail clippings?! While we were gone they did vacuum the carpet area but we noticed on the bathroom floor one of the same pubic hairs was still there in the doorway so we knew they did not mop the floors. We gave them the opportunity to fix the problem and they were unsuccessful at doing so. The housekeeping also didn't leave the same number of towels they took from the room. We were left having to use our bathroom towels for dish towels for a place to dry our dishes.", "user": "Justin9a7", "date": "September 3, 2012", "id": 139273787}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We can tell that the hotel does try to be nice as it has a nice pool area, movie theater room, breakfast and serves dinner tues-thurs but the poor housekeeping stands out.
