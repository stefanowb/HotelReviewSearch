The staff has to be the best trained staff in Jamaica, from the first visit you are welcomed warmly by the doorman and the front desk staff call you by name as soon as you identify yourself. Being Jamaican I have to admit that I would shrug off indifferent service since my experience has been that hotel staff in Jamaica have no idea how to treat guests but the Spanish Court management should make extra income training hotel staff in Jamaica. When I visit I\u2019m greeted by name the instant I arrive at the hotel and sometimes I\u2019m surprised by a staff member calling my name when I don\u2019t recognize that particular person. The rooms are very modern, the breakfast buffet is wonderful especially for a vegetarian and the pepper pot soup with garlic bread is divine. The poolside bar on the 2nd floor is out of this world, while you\u2019re there it is difficult to believe that you\u2019re in the heart of Kingston and my favorite bartender Simone makes the best rum punch ever.
