We messed them around at short notice and had to cut our stay from three to two days (see our Hell Bay Hotel review for the reason why!). So I fully expected to still have to pay the full amount because they didn't manage to re-let the room, but was delighted when they waived payment for the third night. Looe itself was a revelation - great to see a small town so \"alive\" with acitvity. And the hotel, just on the edge of the town, is the perfect peaceful antidote. But be warned, stay here and you will never want to stay again in the second and third rate corporate hotels which fall so far behind gems like this. And if you are reasonably fit don't miss walking along the Cornwall Coast Path towards Polperro. It's a beautiful walk with an excellent tea room half way and can be easily completed in a day.", "title": "Great stay in Looe", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Blackstone", "date": "July 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8101349, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the owners", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "If there is one thing that you will remember about your stay in this lovely little hotel, it will be Ella.
