Make sure to follow the directions exactly or you'll end up driving out the other side of town by mistake, or going up the wrong hill and having no way to turn around! The driveway is sort of long and narrow, but there's room enough for everyone to park, as long as you're considerate about it.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "GSAriyel", "date": "September 24, 2006", "id": 5832272}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best ever!", "text": "John, the host was very helpful in providing dining recommendations and a fold out map of the town.
