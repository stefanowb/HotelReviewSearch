Not an awful lot to see and do around the hotel, quite shabby, dusty and smelly in places. Not really a pleasant place to have a stroll after your meal! Twice we got a taxi to Yasmine Hammamet which was a lot nicer in many ways and only about \u00a35.00 even though it was as good 20 minute ride. No seatbelts though and they drive like lunatics, i was terrified! Most restaurants we went to for lunch or dinner had the same menu, it did get tedious.
