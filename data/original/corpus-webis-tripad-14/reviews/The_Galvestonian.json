It is a very nice property with a good pool and a great, clean beach that does not require crossing Seawall. Our one bedroom condo (306) had two large balconies over looking the gulf. It was nicely furnished and very clean. The appliances were old school but served the purpose. The only negative we experienced was from the staff. They were consistently non attentive and seemed to be bothered when you spoke to them. Luckily,we didn't have to much occasion to deal with them. For the price and location this is better then any of the Seawall hotels we have stayed in (San Luis, Hilton, & Holiday Inn).

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. In the past, we had our own place on the west end for a while or would rent down that way. We decided to stay on the east end of the island because we'd heard that it had some good areas for collecting glass and peppermint shrimp (our primary purpose.) I called the Galvestonian to reserve a small one bedroom for the weekend of 7/17-19. They were nice enough to warn me in advance that some construction was going on. I imagine a some people would be upset about the construction, but we barely noticed it at all. There was no noticable noise...just an extremely courteous worker sharing an elevator every so often. I called the day that we were leaving to confirm our reservations (as I always do) and they couldn't find them. When I looked at the confirmation email, it turned out that I'd been confirmed for the weekend PRIOR to the one we were planning on coming down. I never noticed the simple mistake. I explained over the phone that I had never intended to come that weekend...hadn't noticed the incorrect date on the email...and so on. They fixed everything right away. Granted, they did make a mistake, but they also did NOT charge me for a stay I had not used but mistakenly confirmed and they provided a room for the correct dates at the agreed upon price. I was very happy with the remedy. The lobby and grounds of the hotel are lovely. The beach is great...one of the widest on the island....although the water is the same everywhere (they can't fix that!). Our unit was nice and comfortable and well stocked.

This was our first visit to the Galvestonian and we WILL be returning. Our family stayed two nights in unit 809, which is a small one bedroom. The unit was clean and comfortable, and we felt very safe during our stay. The staff was courteous and the lobby was very pretty. Our favorite thing about the Galvestonian was the fact that it is directly on the beach, saving us from dodging traffic while crossing Seawall Blvd as we've done many times before. Our unit had a rocker glider, which was nice when our baby wanted to be rocked. We also enjoyed having the kitchen available for simple breakfasts, etc. The ONLY problem we encountered was that our sleeper sofa was broken. The pool/deck area is beautiful, and the view from the balcony at any unit is unbeatable. We will definitely be staying at the Galvestonian again in the future, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing place to stay while in Galveston. Yes, it is a mile off the beaten path, but WELL worth it for the relaxing atmosphere and convenience to the beach. (FYI - no lifeguard at the pool or the beach, so watch your children!)
