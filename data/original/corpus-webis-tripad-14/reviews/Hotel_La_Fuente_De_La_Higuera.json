What sets Hotel La Fuente De La Higuera apart to me is the service and attention to detail provided by Pom and Christina and their staff. Prior to our trip, we received several emails from the team ensuring our needs were met and once we arrived, we were greeted by Javier and offered a lovely glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. A quick tour around the property ended with the invitation to enter our room (#4) and it was all we expected - classic, understated and privileged. The two very short days we spent included a delicious lunch and dinner (the seafood salad was incredible!!!), some down time by the comfortable pool and a driving tour of the white villages as recommended by the very lovely Gina. In all our experiences, staff were gracious and helpful without being intrusive. Our departure was a treat as we had a chance to visit with Christina and chat about our stay, and when I sent a followup email upon our return home to provide some forgotten feedback, her response was immediate and welcoming. I highly recommend a stay at La Fuente. Magical memories will be made here.", "title": "Its the little things that make this place so special", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mmccormi", "date": "August 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 171785990}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "Had a very relaxing time at this wonderful farmhouse outside ronda.
