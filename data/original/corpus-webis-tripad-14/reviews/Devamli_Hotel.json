As stated in numerous other reviews the staff are what make this place , we found that if you have time for them they will certainly respond and enhance your whole Icmeler experience .

It is centrally located within I\u00e7meler. It is basic but clean. It suffers from the limitations of a building constructed some years ago with small rooms and on a landlocked site, which precludes much development. The erstwhile quiet road fronting the hotel has become very busy over the years, and the rooms have single glazing. The hotel is located on three floors over the \u2018Love Boat\u2019 restaurant and \u2018Sports Inn\u2019 bar. Hotel guests currently receive a 10% \u2018loyalty-card-type\u2019 kickback on purchases in the restaurant and bar, redeemable against further meals and drinks.

Those at the front are quite noisy. Although a lot of the music from bars etc. stops at midnight, there can be music, singing and animated conversations in the main street at the front of the hotel until about 3 am, and the real traffic begins at about 6 am with council roadsweepers and dustcarts with lifting and compaction equipment operating, and a procession of brewery drays etc. In between, there can be drunken couples having rows, coaches delivering new guests at all hours, and taxis disgorging passengers with doors wide open and radios blaring. Twin-bedded rooms have beds with soft edges, but the double beds have hard edges which, given the smallness of the rooms, can lead to barked shins etc. The showers are about 29\u201d square, with a 13\u00bd\u201c step, so a bit restricting for some, but adequate and with plenty hot water. Rooms have safes (fee payable) and fridge mini-bars, and TVs. The room TV is a heavy, cubic object with a 14\u201d screen, with poor reception and a lot of \u2018snow\u2019. The only English-language programme available was the BBC World News, which goes on and on about places in which few people have any interest, presented by people with squeaky voices and often poor English pronunciation. The most useful bit would probably be the rolling news banner across the bottom of the screen; but as the BBC World News logo covers about 40% of the bottom of the screen, by the time you\u2019ve realised you are interested in an item, most of it has disappeared from view. If you don\u2019t like BBC World News, next best may be \u2018Euro News\u2019 \u2013 in Turkish!", "title": "Nice hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Natalie1206", "date": "September 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 178943948}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The sun lounge affords a facility to bronze.
