Clean. Staff anxious to serve. Excellent level of English by most staff. About ten minutes from the airport terminal, this means it is not in the most desirable part of Dubai, rather the older part of town. There is a metro stop about 100 yards from the hotel. Bellmen can hail a taxi but this may take a few minutes depending on time of day. Rooms are good sized and well furnished, sound proofing is good, air conditioning excellent. Breakfast buffet is typical European and extensive. This appears to be primarily a business hotel although some airline crews are observed here.

I booked an executive room as we were in Dubai for a week as part of our honeymoon and the hotel and staff were incredibly helpful and kind. My wife travelled in from Germany while I travelled in from Afghanistan. She arrived early in the morning and when she arrived at the hotel they had our room ready for occupation and allowed her to wait for me in our room without any additional charge. Not only was this a very nice gesture on their part but the room was so incredibly presented. My wife had to take photos as she was worried that she might disturb it before I arrived. The executive room came with additional benefits such access to the executive lounge where we were able to have breakfast in a very nice and quiet environment, complimentary afternoon tea and later complimentary happy hour. Two hours of each! Access to coffee and tea as well as bottled water and soft drinks all day till 11:00 pm each day. Happy hour also came with your choice of alcohol.

The food in the Restaurants is excellent with a very good selection available, the only criticism is that like most Hotels, the cost in the restaurants was a little expensive. Hotel offers a Shuttle service that will take you to the Souk and Shopping Malls. The only negative that I have is that the Pool was very small and there was limited area available to sit or lay down, but, when the outside temperature was 46 degrees, it was a most welcome relief.

We stayed for four nights in the executive level [5] in two executive rooms that slept 6. We arrived around 1145am and the hotel staff were excellent and within 20 minutes were in our rooms. The rooms were spacious and had all the facilities of a 5 star hotel. They even provide an ironing board and iron...which helped us. We had an excellent service from the staff and can say they were 10/10. The breakfast was international with chefs making fresh omelettes etc., to order. The choice and range of breakfast was huge. Air conditioned throughout the hotel and very secure and safe. With the children I can honestly recommend this hotel to all visitors and families. The location of the hotel is around 10/15 minutes to Diera mall shopping centre., Dubai mall around 20 min by taxi and wild wadi about 20 min by taxi....there is a nice shopping area walking distance from the hotel.
