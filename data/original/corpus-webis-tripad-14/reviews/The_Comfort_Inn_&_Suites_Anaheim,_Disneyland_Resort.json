We stayed at this property for five nights. Ideally, we'd have preferred a property closer to Disneyland. However, for $63.20 plus taxes per night, and the fact that we had a rental car, we felt this worked out well. We had a room on the 5th floor facing the freeway. Freeway noise was never a problem. The room was larger than expected. It appeared the carpets and mattresses were recently replaced or in the process of being replaced. The air conditioning unit was one of the better we've had to deal with because we could actually set a comfortable temperature. No complaints about the housekeeping: our room was cleaned and the bathroom necessities (i.e., towels, soap, and shampoo) were replenished daily. There were also a mini refrigerator and microwave in the room, which came in handy. The Continental breakfast offered make-your-own waffles; a variety of cereals, breads, and fruits; and coffee, tea, milk, and orange and guava juices.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Donna I", "date": "June 20, 2006", "id": 5363678}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "not child friendly", "text": "Disneyland is located about a mile left and on the side of Katella opposite of the property.

The bath area well stocked with clean towels, bath & hair sundries, hair dryer, and 4 cup coffee pot. Although we did not take advantage of it, the hotel offers a free (and rather substantial) continental breakfast in the morning. The only two downsides I came across were MINOR at best. First, the night clerk (we checked in at 3 a.m.) was very less than friendly. The second being the 11 a.m. check-out time. We requested, and were granted, an hour extra for checking out. During this additional hour the hotel maid knocked on the door wanting to know when would be leaving.
