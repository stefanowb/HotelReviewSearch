Towels were a little thin, but if that was my biggest complaint at $50 a night, I've got it pretty good. :-) I usually use my Verizon modem, but did hook up to their wifi without a password and it was fast and easy.

The bathroom door wouldn't even close and there were holes in the wall where someone punched it. We told the management and they said oh we are so sorry that is not our standards. That is not true, this is a dive and I have never stayed in such a dirty filthy hotel room. I was so worried we were going to catch something we couldn't get rid of.
