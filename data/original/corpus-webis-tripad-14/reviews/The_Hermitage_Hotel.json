We thought it seemed expensive when we booked, especially as we had to pay up front but they have the monopoly so can charge what they like. We booked the package including dinner as the prospect of dining with the views of Mt Cook was so tempting. Check-in was fine, if a little perfunctionary and we found our own way to the room. We had not booked a mountain view so our room was down a long corridor somewhere in the middle of the building. It was raining very heavily when we arrived and part of the car park was flooded and unuseable. The rooms are very average and certainly not luxurious! Not the hotels fault but the weather had still not improved by dinner so we got no views. If the food had been better this would not have been quite such a disappointment but it was a very average meal, again not worth the cost. We enjoyed the museum which we found very informative. We slept well and awoke to sunshine and enjoyed a super walk with fabulous views of Mt Cook and all the surrounding mountains. We skipped breakfast but enjoyed a cup of coffee on the terrace before departing. We achieved our objective of getting to see Mt Cook in all it's glory, something a brief in/out journey might not have achieved but the Hermitage really needs to do better!", "title": "Not Good Value", "user": "disleksik", "date": "February 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 152193248}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The rooms and view were quite lovely but the food leaves something to be desired.

We only had time for one night and decided to treat ourselves to a room on level 2 with a spectacular view of Mt Cook. It was however disappointing to have to keep the sliding door to the balcony closed as some sort of air conditioning unit directly below and in front of the balcony came on around 2pm and stayed on until the evening. We were unable to sit on the balcony to enjoy the view and the sounds of nature with the constant humming sound emanating from the a/c unit. For the standard of the hotel and the price, I would have expected these units to be placed at the rear of the building. Consequently we were unable to leave door open for fresh air. Room well appointed and comfortable, bathroom practical but too small for 2 and the corner of the vanity is dangerously placed to walk into as you enter or leave the bathroom. We enjoyed the views and the location but found the hotel over-priced in terms of the amenities and the facilities. Bar was understaffed and when I asked to have a taste of the 2 merlots available in order to decide which bottle to buy, I had to convince them to indulge me in my request", "title": "great location", "user": "Erika S", "date": "February 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 152114492}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My overall stay in this hotel was excellent, the staff were patient, accommodating and helpful.

Now onto the hotel itself, remember those dreadful hotels of the 70's? \u00a0They remain at the Hermitage. \u00a0For what it is, this place is overpriced by a factor of about three. \u00a0The hallways are dingy (see photo), the paint is flaking off the balconies, our room had no real closet with a door (see photo), the iron and hair dryer were placed on the floor in the door-less closet space, the room smelled of old vacuum cleaner bags, the safe was too high for any non-mutant to see into it, and the sink and toilet were arranged with insufficient space between them (about a foot between them). The staff were poorly trained. Yes they were very nice, but upon check-in, they forgot to take my credit card info and called me back to get that, this seems basic. \u00a0The next morning when I asked about other breakfast options, the lady at the desk incorrectly told me that the only other options were in Twizel (45 minutes away). \u00a0That seemed like a deceptive ploy to get us to eat at the hotel as there was a decent place (Mountaineer cafe) about a 5 minutes walk away. \u00a0At night we had dinner at the Panorama restaurant, despite the \"reservations essential\" comment, the place was about 20% full. \u00a0Food was heavy and an overly-complicated mix assembled in a pretty fashion on the plate. \u00a0I laughed out loud at the combination of items on the plate. \u00a0If you can avoid this place, do so.", "user": "le_nomade", "date": "February 11, 2013", "id": 151926393}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We booked a \"standard\" room at this hotel for $235/night which turned out to be in the old section of the hotel without a view of Mt. Cook and surprise! no air conditioning. The sliding glass door (no screen) opened onto a balcony shared with all the other rooms on that floor so leaving it open was not an option. We did sleep with the windows open (no screens). We were offered a fan but decided to ask for either another room or a refund for our second night. They wanted us to pay more for a room with air conditioning, which we did not want to do since we thought our room was already overpriced. Food was quite expensive too. Continental breakfast was $19 pp, full breakfast $29 pp and dinner $59 pp. There was one other restaurant in the \"village\" which apparently had to fight hard to be allowed there. The Hermitage has mostly a captive audience and seems to cater primarily to tour groups. Thank goodness they let us check out after only one night since my allergies were going crazy sleeping without air conditioning. We cannot recommend this hotel even though the views of Mt. Cook are spectacular. If you want to walk the Hooker ValleyTrack, drive in to Mt.
