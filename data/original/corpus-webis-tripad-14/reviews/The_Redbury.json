Located at the famous intersection of Hollywood and Vine, The Redbury is a boutique hotel that offers very spacious studio apartment-like rooms complete with seating area and laundry machines. All rooms are equipped with full kitchens as well...and yes, that bar counter doubles as a dance stage complete with polished chrome stripper pole. Expect to pay $37/night for valet parking. If you are planning on clubbing/partying while you stay the hotel is within walking distance of Katsuya (owned by the same entertainment group) Sayers Club (same entertainment group, again), Geisha House, The Piano Bar, Edun, and Drais. It's also around the corner from the Pantages Theater. This is a small boutique hotel with big big rooms, but the guest to staff ratio is large and there never seems to be more than 2 people at the lobby desk, and 2 attendants at the valet kiosk...it's more than enough though. I didn't eat at Cleo, the hotel restaurant, but I did order room service for breakfast and thought it was all adequately delicious.", "title": "Gorgeous Rooms...and a stripper pole!", "user": "Michael R", "date": "September 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 140295279}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent two nights at the Redbury recently and found it a great place to stay.

(I am a regular guest at the #1 hotel in the nation located in Chicago -- was initially The Elysian which is now the Chicago Waldorf Astoria, so I know the best hotels!) The Redbury is in a great location to see the hip Hollywood area of L.A. The spacious bedrooms are suites with interiors that are decorated in a very cool, retro-inspired, chic bohemian Hollywood-glam style. I like & have used (the off premise complimentary for hotel guests) 24Hr. Fitness facility just a half mile from the hotel. Also, The Cleo restaurant is a trendy restaurant with excellent tapas style cuisine. But, what I like best about this place is the great staff -- from the valets to the night manager. They are so very accommodating & truly care about their guests. The only negative thing is if you are not a music lover than I would not stay there unless you would like to pay extra for a room away from the music lounge courtyard. Because most rooms face their balcony overlooking an outdoor lounge area that have live bands entertaining at least 3 nights/wk. So, if you are looking for a quiet or relaxing place then this lively cool boutique may not be for you.

Good value rooms too. The staff were fantastic, very helpful! Positioned in a great location, and the restuarant Cleo in the hotel is suppose to be the hotest restuarant in the area at the moment run by an Aussie chef, and we enjoyed a lovely meal one night! It was incredible accommodation! BUT! sadly it is positioned next to a music club and when we were there they had something playing Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. The worst night was Saturday the music didn't finish until 5.30am and thats when we finally fell asleep - however when we mentioned this to staff they ensured we were looked after to make up for it! Also, because the floors were wood, we found that our upstairs neighbours were heavy footed and from 4am some mornings could hear them stomping about!

The decor was quirky and well done with a real homely feel. All this within a short stroll to all the Hollywood has to offer.

We went out for the night and when we came back we headed to the second floor to check out Cleo's before closing. The bouncer wouldn't let these three girls in because they were closing up, but when we flashed our room key they let us right through. It made us feel very VIP. Then we headed up to the bar for some shots and the bartender was cute and laughing it up with us. We were basically the last people out of there.

An experience in itself and a nice respite from the impersonal style the big chains offer. The location is good too, easy access to main Hollywood attractions, bars, restaurants. Even public transport is close for those who might be traveling without a car. On the other hand, you should be aware that Redbury is first and foremost a night club. With the exception of Sundays and possibly Mondays, the place comes alive after 9 pm and the music is banging loud till 2 am. The majority of rooms have balconies facing the courtyard where the club scene is developing. Forget getting to bed early, We didn't mind since we were either out or went to bed really late but we did appreciate the Sunday when all was quiet for a change. We also can agree with many reviewers here that the staff is nice and willing to help out but we had an impression that the club visitors had a priority. I'd recommend the hotel for a short stay due to the location and quality of the premises but for a longer stay I'd choose something quieter. Also, the hotel is rather pricey. As elsewhere in Hollywood, the rooms seem a tad overpriced. No pool in this hotel so perhaps they should either consider adding one or rethink the pricing policy. But what is really a bit on the outrageous side is the 37 dollar overnight valet parking.
