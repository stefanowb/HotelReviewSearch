We stayed at 3 different resorts and I must say that Anatara Veli was my favorite because of the AMAZING views. It seemed everywhere you turned was another opportunity to take a great picture. We were also able to visit their sister island, Anatara Dhigu. We noticed that Anatara Veli was definitively more quiet as no children are allowed to stay there. All of the Maldivian islands seem to cater everything toward honeymooners, since there were only king beds in each room. (you could request extra cots if needed). The breakfast buffet was delicious and the staff made you feel really welcome. We apparently arrived at the perfect time (mid January) since it was shortly after the holiday rush period. The entire time on Anatara Veli, it felt like we were the only ones on the island.....so peaceful!", "title": "Ridiculously scenic!", "user": "Lisa G", "date": "January 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150629196}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I returned from spending almost a week in a gorgeous over-water bungalow on Veli Island and it is indeed like a tropical fantasy. The resort has a nice variety of restaurants, as spa, and a little gym, and it is easy to get over to Dhigu to enjoy the spa and restaurants there. While you are in the middle of now-where, the food was without exception outstanding (though expensive) and the staff was utterly amazing. They were kind, attentive, personable, and made us feel special every day. My husband spent alot of time scuba diving and speaks very highly of the diving company and dive masters located on Dhigu. In all, we had a fantastic time and definitely would recommend Veli to couples wanting a calm, romantic, get-away. We spent a few days in Dubai on the way home, which made of a very \"varied\" trip.

The entire experience is perfect for honeymooners, although any couple seeking a quiet, high-end vacation will be very pleased. We stayed in the over-water bungalows and loved it. The shower is open and over the coral reef so your morning shampoo includes watching the fish! Our deck looked out to the ocean and each night we would sit outside with a glass of wine and watch the shooting stars. What an experience!

The beauty of the resort here is that there are 3 islands in which you can hop to via boat that only takes 2 minutes. so you can eat, drink, swim on any of the islands no matter which one you are staying on. We were fortunate to stay on Veli because the other islands were more family orientated. The staff also seemed a little bit more enthusiastic on Veli. This place can be reviewed over and over again, but you truly must see it, to believe it all. Our favorite part of the trip was being able to snorkel right off our over-water bungalow. The snorkel gear is rented for free at the water sports shop and you get to keep it your entire stay. We stayed for 7 nights and couldnt have asked for a better week.

On arrival we were very impressed with the wonderful welcome we received and with the stunning situation of the resort and adjoining islands which also belonged to the group. The bungalows on stilts were beautifully appointed. They were spacious, well equipped with toiletries, slippers, robes, umbrellas in the event of showers, life jackets, coffee machine, safe, minibar/fridge and to be perfectly honest, nothing was lacking to ensure a perfect stay. Everyone had a personal sundeck, and steps into the lagoon. There was a pontoon running every five minutes to take guests from island to island within the Anantara facility. Gifts of quality Chocolates were given on several occasions. Apart from the natural beauty of this area the other most commendable aspect of this resort was the wonderfully obliging staff who were welcoming, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile to please. I cannot commend these young people more highly if I tried. They worked tirelessly to ensure that our holiday was as perfect as possible and updated us daily to ensure we were aware of what was on offer. There were several types of restaurants to choose from with themed evenings. Not all were up to scratch. We observed at the beginning of our holiday the breakfast buffet was more than adequate with an abundance of everything. A few days down the line, the choice of fruits were limited and less fresh. The pork bacon was only offered twice, then it became chicken or beef bacon. But having said that. there was still a vast array of foods to suit every palate, and if you went hungry it was your own fault. Again the breakfast staff were the most courteous, cheerful, smiling, happy, pleasing, communicative young people. The downside - unfortunately some areas of the resort have become a little tired and in need of upgrading.
