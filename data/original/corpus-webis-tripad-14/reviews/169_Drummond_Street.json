It's #1 for a reason. We stayed in large front room which was clean and spacious as past guest advised. It also had benefit of balcony over front of house which is a sun trap in the mornings. Ian is a great host, dry sense of humour, very welcoming and helpful. Ok bed is not made - not a problem and if it is stay elsewhere. Breakfast is help yourself & put dishes in dishwasher, but plenty of choice. Simply not pretentious but everything we needed and a great location.
