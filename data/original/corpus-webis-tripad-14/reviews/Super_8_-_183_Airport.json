I had a king room with a small sitting area. It's pretty modern and clean with minimal signs of wear and tear. There was a robe in the room and a pillow menu! Not expected at a Super 8. Fridge, microwave, coffee maker, safe, iron and board, free bottle of water and a couple of free snacks. The A/C worked great, and there was a ceiling fan. Close to the highway, but I didn't think the road noise was bad. The breakfast was the typical continental hotel/motel fare but did include two hot items - scrambled eggs and some sausage biscuits. Nice flatscreen TV. There was a DVD player in the room and DVDs to check out at the front desk.

My room was outstanding; whisper quiet, and I mean whisper quiet. NO sounds from adjacent rooms or the hallway! Those who may have read my other reviews know that my absolute top complaint about hotels is the constant door-slamming noise from the hallway. There was literally not a sound once I got inside my room. Being on the bed was like floating and there were great pillows and a laptop tray like those found in Hampton Inns and other much higher priced hotels. The bathroom was super high-end with a furniture-like vanity with a granite top, and the other materials were great. The towels were thicker than ours at home are and there was even a scale! I've never seen a scale in a hotel before. One slight maintenance issue with my room (308) was that the shower head was a bit loose and that caused most of the water to drop straight down instead of shooting out of the nozzle. I held it tight and then it worked, but other than that (and, I could have / should have mentioned it) it was a great bathroom. The huge flatscreen TV had every channel I would ever want and the reception and picture and remote all were great. The wireless internet was super fast and flawless. There was a great looking little swimming pool in the back but I didn't use it.", "title": "Above and Beyond!", "user": "MrsMahana", "date": "April 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159239139}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "This is a super deluxe Super 8----wonderful beds with 3 thick pillows per bed, a bathrobe in closet, iron and ironing board, excellent breakfast with Super 8 cinnamon rolls, Texas waffles, cereals, apples, juices, STARBUCKS Coffee machine, tea and more.
