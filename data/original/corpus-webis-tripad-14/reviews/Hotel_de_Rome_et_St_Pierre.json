I was looking for somewhere cheap and close to Saint Charles station to sleep only. The hotel is a ten min walk from the main train station just off the main La Canebiere street. The walk from the station was fine and well lit, as was the area where the hotel is located. I felt safe during the walk at 11.30pm. The hotel room was a little larger than average but the bathroom was a bit tired looking. The windows were open and there was a lot of noise from the street. When I shut the windows, I heard nearly nothing from the street as it had secondary glazing. The website states the rooms were renovated two years ago. I don't think this was the case as the decor looked quite old. However, this place was perfect for the night and in a good location and I would stay here again at the price I paid.", "title": "Fine For The Night", "user": "ymous", "date": "May 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 30019940}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "OK, but in Scary Part of Marseille", "text": "Easy walk from St. Charles train station in Marseille. It was in a bad part of Marseille. If you go to the hotel, STAY THERE. I was pick pocketed even being careful - stick your wallet IN your pants! The reception desk is one flight up, so don't take too much luggage! The staff was very nice. The room was small with two twin beds. There was a 13\" TV, which was fine. The bathroom had a sink and a shower (that was small!) The toilet was in a separate closet, and there are plumbing issues at the hotel - you have to flush 5 or 6 times... The air conditioning was fine, but you'd better be tall to be able to turn it on! The view out the window was scary and looked into an alley.

We then spend a sleepless night in this hotel as music from a disco across the way blared on until 2am. The room itself was okay, but nothing to write home about (reminded me of a Motel 6).
