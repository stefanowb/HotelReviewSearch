One reason we selected the Marriott was because of its strict non-smoking policy. If you are sensitive to, or simply hate smoke, beware that this could be a problem for you. The Marriott should really look into a method of creating a small palapa area for smokers, and leaving most of the palapa area as smoke free. I suspect that they can\u2019t outrightly declare one area of the beach sand as smoke-free because it is probably publicly owned. However, perhaps they could do it a different way---If someone wants to reserve a palapa, or sit on a Marriott-owned chair, or obtain a Marriott-owned beach towel, then the hotel guests would need to abide by the smoking and non-smoking rules that the Marriott would create if they want to sit on a Marriott-owned chair.", "title": "Great honeymoon experience on an awesome island", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sam0sa", "date": "October 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143995191}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The concierge desk seemed to be staffed by salespeople for a particular tour operator, and provided no assistance for us.", "title": "Lot of room for improving", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "48gatti", "date": "October 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 143752701}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013", "text": "We just returned back tonight after an amazing week at this hotel!

The lobby cafe had breakfast sandwiches fruit pastries sandwiches salads and gelato - very reasonably priced too. As an elite member, we received a discount card to use at the restaurants.

The hotel staff was very welcoming and always had a smile on their face and greeted us with a big hello.

They catered to all our needs. We stayed at the adult pool which seems to cater to couples. The beach was great, too...definitely go jet skiing. Daily breakfast hotel was great; a great start to the day. Lunch by the pool was great. Kudos to Miro who treated us like royalty. The gym was well appointed and the staff was very attentive. The Marriot is very interested in signing you up for Marriott Vacation Club, so be prepared for the sales pitch.", "title": "Exceptional Service, Exceptional Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "GigiNYC", "date": "September 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176242339}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013", "text": "We liked this Marriott.
