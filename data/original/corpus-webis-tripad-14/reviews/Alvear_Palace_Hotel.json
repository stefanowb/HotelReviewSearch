My only grievance is really not about the hotel itself but that fact that we were surrounding by so many annoying tourists (with obnoxious service me first attitudes) during this busy season.

Yes if I got a deal on the price (we were paying US$500+ a night due to the New Year's holiday). Would I eat at the hotel? No. Found many other places outside of the hotel more to my liking.
