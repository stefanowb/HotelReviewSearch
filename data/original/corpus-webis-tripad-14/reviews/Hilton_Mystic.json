We're going to Playa Del Carmen, June 2010 for our delayed honeymoon! Anyway, we got here and checked in with Kimberly at the front desk, she said to me, those roses are beautiful, I thanked her and told her we had just got married. She congratulated us and said another couple was staying here that had got married the previous year and stayed here on their wedding night. We went up to our room, which was very spacious and comfortable, then we had a knock at our door and we had only been in there 5 minutes. My husband went to the door and they upgraded our room to a jacuzzi suite. We called Kimberly and thanked her, we thought that was so nice. 10 minutes later there was another knock at our door in the new room and they sent chocolate covered strawberries and 2 free drink cards for the bar downstairs. So later on we went down to the bar and it was very cozy. They had classic rock playing and a fireplace going. The lighting was very suttle and the chairs were so comfy. The food was great, gave huge portions. We had a great time staying at this hotel and found the service to be exceptional. Also, the location is great for the Aquarium and shops...right across the street.

But after making requests, I was still led down the path of so many others who wrote reviews. If you are not in the front of the hotel, it seems, you will walk down miles of twisting and turning carpeted hallways. If you have bags, or children, this will not do. I called the front desk, and they changed us to the front of the hotel. Much better. Except for the children running and screaming to and from the pool constantly, and playing tag with the bell carts at all hours. Location is indeed, directly across from the Aquarium, if you decide to waste your money on that. Scratched tanks, and chaos like a free day of miniature golf in Pigeon Forge !! But DO NOT miss Peking China restaurant (also across the street). Very reasonable and very divine !! If you have more days, you MUST order a \"Mystic Pizza\" delivered to your room. DEEEElish. As different as New York pizza is, to Dominos !
