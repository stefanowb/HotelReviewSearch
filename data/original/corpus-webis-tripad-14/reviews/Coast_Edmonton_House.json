Check in was very prompt as I am a Coast rewards member so everything was ready for me upon arrival. My room was on the 18th floor with a nice view of the city. The rooms are all suites with separate bedrooms. They also include kitchens which is very handy for fixing a quick breakfast while I am getting ready for the day. There are two flat screen TVs in the room and plenty of closet space. I required more hangers, however, so I called down and some were sent up fairly quickly. The living room has a sofa/hide-a-bed. There is also a large balcony.The room was clean and quiet and the bathroom very adequate. The room was too warm though and so we had our balcony door open much of the time for cooling.", "title": "An excellent property in Edmonton, Alberta", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Gemgirlbarbara", "date": "February 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153146672}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled solo", "text": "I found the room clean and more than served my needs.

I came here for some down time, to get caught up on work things and to relax. The rooms, upon appearances are great, nothing super fancy, but a suite hotel...full kitchen, full bathroom, living room with a small dining area, separate bedroom, balcony, 2 small blocks away from a Tim Hortons...big bonus. On the down side, the heat in my room didn't work for 2 days, it was cold, also the cover on the ac unit in the bedroom wasn't there, letting in more cold air, and I had to sleep in the living room on the pull out bed (we all know how fun those are), causing me to throw my back out. The heat is partially fixed, the thermostat doesn't work , so the maintenance guy had to set the heat on the actually base board heater (old school, yes)...so it is now set at one temperature. The internet here is horrible, it took 3 minutes for this \"write a review\" page to load...yes I timed it...3 minutes is a long time in the internet world...it's been like this for the past 3 days. Since my back hurts, due to sleeping on the sofa bed, due to no heat and too cold in the bedroom, i've been laying here for a day and a half, with crappy internet and bored out of my mind. Customer service is meh....when I called to report heat in the evening, the lady was not that pleasant...the housekeeping staff are great , very friendly and helpful. I check out tomorrow, I would like to be the type of person that demands to be comped for this somehow, but I won't...I'll just write this review and hope that the next person in this room has a better time than me.", "title": "Fine stay at Coast Edmonton House Hotel", "user": "M_and_N_s_Adventures", "date": "February 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 152547967}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Although hotel was dated and could use some work in the bathrooms and kitchens (in suites), it was clean and staff were friendly.

Read previous reviews, some good some not so good, before travelling to Edmonton. Was booked in the hotel for a one day conference. Was pleasantly surprised by the room. It was a one bedroom suite with king size bed. The suite is equipped with a full kitchen and dining area. It has a large and comfortable living space with a balcony, We were on the 23rd floor facing the river so had a pretty good view. The suite was clean and fresh smelling. Bathroom was quite clean( no evidence of mold as mentioned in previous review), There is a pool in the hotel, although I didn't have time to try out. There is a good restaurant off the lobby called Rutherfords, Only had a chance to have breakfast so can't comment on the rest of the menu but looks quite nice.

So if you don't mind stepping through wet asphalt or being asked (as I was) to jump from one dry area to another you are off to a good start. The hotel also accepts large corporate groups (union meetings when I was there) so there was floor parties lasting until midnight which would then escalate to full blown fist fighting by 2am. We were fortunate enough to have ring side seats (adjacent rooms) to the \"ultimate fighting\" where we experienced yelling and fighting next door to wall punches and finally the screen door being detached and tossed around the adjacent balcony. I really wish I had taken pictures. As way of compensation the management offered one of four nights no charge but not two nights, which was the actual no. of nights we didn't sleep due to the floor \"activity\". I have to say that security was terrific and immediately responded by standing outside our door to speak to the police on a two way radio (on a speaker phone) for three hours! Yes, apparently this is a common hotel occurrence to which the police no longer respond. If I hadn't been a speaker at the conference I was attending at the Hotel McDonald I wouldn't have been so upset by all the \"activity\" (ok...who am I kidding...I would have still been upset). This is just another reminder to me to stay at the conference hotel instead of trying to save a few bucks for a suite. My next conference is in Hawaii and I've already cancelled that budget hotel.
