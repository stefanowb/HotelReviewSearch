I cared for baby while daughter was working. What could have been a disaster - baby suddenly became ill with virus and very cranky, resulting in my needing to stay inside room most of time -- turned out to be a good stay for me because of the hotel's amenities and staff. The staff was most curteous and helpful -- maids made up the room almost as soon as I asked them to, while I took sick baby out of room for brief time; maids supplied extra towels and sugar and cream immediately when asked; desk clerk rapidly gave contact/address information on emergency medical clinic; there was an adequate selection of channels on TV for me to enjoy while confined to room; pool area was delightful for a break with baby sleeping in stroller -- plenty of comfortable lounges, clean pool, choice of shade/sun seating was adequate. WARNING: we had been under impression hotel was within walking distance of aquarium and all the restaurants, but it would be a long, long walk (and I'm a walker), some of which would be without sidewalks and near busy highways and a freeway. And the hotel's restaurant and lounge were closed during lunch time, so I had no place to eat a real meal while confined to the hotel with sick baby. ONE BIG BONUS: plenty of hot Starbuck's coffee in urns in lobby each morning, and they remained there through mid-morning. I found the room and bath comfortable, clean, and quiet and the lobby area is very pleasant, but the friendly and accommodating staff was what made our stay pleasant.", "title": "Hilton price with a CHEAP MOTEL EXPERIENCE", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "baboocrew", "date": "August 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 8429225, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 staff", "disliked": "\u2014 noise, small rooms"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Hotel- Exceeded Expectations!", "text": "Got a great rate on Priceline...read some negative reviews but knew that the hotel had been recently renovated.
