The hosts are exceptionally lovely people who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The rooms are kept immaculately clean and are very comfortable as is the rest of the house. There is large selection of breakfasts which suited both of us (my daughter is a very picky eater). The hosts were full of local knowledge and made some great recommendations on where to go. Things to do nearby: Longs horse-riding, Ventry beach, Brandon boat hire, http://www.marinetours.ie/, Conor Pass, Slea Head drive, Blasket Island tour, aquarium, seal sanctuary. Eating out: we enjoyed The Blue Zone and An Canteen.
