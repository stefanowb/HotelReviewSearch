Staff friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, they helped us Brits make the most of our stay with tips and hints on places to visit.. In fact every place we visited in Tennessee we were met by friendly and helpful people.

One person staying with us was looking forward to this, and it was a huge disappointment to him. No response from Brothers' Cove. Also, as to their new \"gated community\". What a joke. We checked in and the gates were broken. The young lady checking us in indicated that they were broken most of the time. The reason became apparent on the last night we were there as we decided to venture out and didn't return until 9 pm or so and the office was closed and our access code did not work and there was no emergency number. We were only able to get in because we sneaked in when someone left. This took about an hour, and a good chunk of time out of our vacation, and again, no response to our e-mail to Brother's Cove. I guess you can figure out why the gates are always broken because frustrated paid visitors have to force their way through the gates, possibly? Still, would enjoy staying there, but am extremely disappointed that they don't seem to care and did not respond to my e-mail.", "title": "They obviously don't care", "user": "chelmat", "date": "August 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8376191, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 cabin was absolutely beautiful", "disliked": "\u2014 they did not respond to my concerns"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007", "text": "Brother's Cove was the best place we have ever stayed in the Smoky Mountains. We wanted to stay away from the strip in Gatlinburg. This resort is seven miles from Pigeon Forge. We booked Brown Bear Lodge. This was a 3 bedroom chalet. We had three adults and three children. We could not believe that this chalet actually lived up the pictures on the internet, as isn't the case a lot of the time. Our place was brand new and obviously professionaly decorated. There was a fireplace on the deck next to the hot tub.We had our 1, 6 and 9 year old girls with us. They had a ball. The view was spectacular. We had 4 rockers and a swing. We spent most of the time on the deck. The only downfall to Brother's Cove was the drive to our chalet. The last mile was a little scary, GO SLOW! The resort pool was awesome. I think it was a salt water pool.

I probably wouldn't have left the cabin had it not been for my husband. It was beautiful. The cabin was very clean (the hot tub was spotless.) The TV in the game room had a remote that didn't work, but we didn't watch that TV anyway. Although there were other cabins around, we always felt very secluded. There was not internet access in our cabin (which I would have liked, but oh well it was kind of nice not having it.) The location is great because it is close to Pigeon Forge, but far enough away that we didn't have any of the noise or anything. The views are great. If you want to sleep in then bring a eye cover sleep mask with you, there are a lot of windows in the cabin and not all of the higher ones have curtains, so it was kind of hard to sleep in.

I called the office about the leak and the maintenance man came out a fixed it (it still leaked but not as much). When I told the lady in the office that my sister had been bitten by a spider she laughed and said that we were in the woods. I think that she needs to attend some customer contact classes. I was always told that the customer is always right. We asked twice on the phone and once in the office to talk to the manager but he was never available.

It poured rain our first full day on the property, so we stayed indoors and enjoyed the amenities of the cabin. The big screen TV, hot tub and pool table helped make our stay very enjoyable.
