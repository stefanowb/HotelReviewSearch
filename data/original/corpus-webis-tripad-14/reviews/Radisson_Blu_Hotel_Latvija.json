Stayed in standard room, but book a superior one and you will be rewarded with a great views of the Old Riga and beautiful orthodox cathedral located in a park just over the street. Try some beer or cocktail in Skyline restaurant/bar located on the 26th floor and you will definitely enjoy your drink while viewing all the beauty of Latvian capital, especially in the evening or during the \"Staro Riga\" festival, what can be translated as Riga Shines, which take place every year around mid-November!

It is part of their spa which is run by a another company and if you wish to use the pool and gym, it is around 20 euros for the privilege.
