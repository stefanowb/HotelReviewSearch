First class spa with first class staff, products, fitness area and pool. No need to travel out west or Chicago seeking the ultimate spa treatments or therapies. I highly recommend the 90 minute massage, 2 hour hydrating body wrap with vichy shower, and a facial! Top off your day spa experience with an overnight at the Conrad. In-room dining had limited food options but the bed was amazing with fluffly pillows, comforters and cool 400 count sheets. They do need cd players in the room. I could have had a room on a higher floor. I was on the 14th floor with a limited city view. I brought my own dvd's and watched movies, ordered room-service and drank wine during my escape. Breakfast in-room was delicious and fast the next morning. Valet parking was great and the bell man helped me manuever out onto the busy street and on my way the next morning. Also note, the hotel is right across the street from the mall and in close proximity to many restuarants.

The room was clean and terrifically decorated and equipped; the marble bathroom was \u201cdie for\u201d but after an engineer came up to fix our television, every time the occupants of the next room slammed their heavy room door, the TV flicked off. At 10:00 p.m. we retired for the evening. Around 11:40 PM, I was awakened by the loud party next to our room. Their door would open, someone would shriek like a banshee, music would boom out, and lots of loud voices and laughter could be heard. I\u2019d fall back to sleep. Then, another guest would show up, same thing. The coup de grace was when a loud male voice announced (in a non-smoking hotel -- 17th Floor that is) that he needed a lighter to light his cigarette. I stumbled to the phone and called the front desk (Conrad Services). The obsequious voice at the other end said he would send Security, which he did. The Security man talked to the twenty-something young woman who registered the room; she had 8 or more people partying with her as guests. As soon as Security left, same thing. My husband woke up and went to the phone and complained. Security came up again; told the party next to us to be quiet. As soon as he would leave, the noise would start again. After the second visit from Security, the music next door was no longer audible, but the talking and laughing and shouting got all the louder. My husband swears he also heard noise coming from another party a couple of rooms to the left of our room. For all we know, there could have been people moving between the parties in the two rooms. There was an outer security door in the hallway, separating our room and the room to the right (containing most of the party noise) from the rest of the guest rooms on our west end of the 17th floor. One of the partygoers decided to shut that security door (which needed a guest room pass card or a key to open), so we were essentially locked in with this going on next to our room. Each time Security came up, the security man would unlock that security door and prop it back open, and 5 or 10 minutes later, one of the partyers would shut it again. One of the guests came out, shouting, \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Give me your elevator pass card.\u201d My husband called the front desk again. He said the noise was intolerable. More people arrived looking for the party; my husband, standing at the door\u2019s peephole in his undershorts, saw two of them. A thirtyish man in a black suit, holding the necks of two bottles of champagne in one hand, was loudly looking for the party. On the fourth call, the man at Conrad Security assures us that the party was being moved to the 2nd floor (Why they did not do this to begin with is a mystery). As the party left, my husband counted ten people walking out, one carrying a chest-size cooler and another one a boom box. The front desk was checking their room inventory because he said there was no guarantee that there wouldn\u2019t be loud noise when these people returned to their room. My husband hung up. So, at about 1:15 A.M., as we were getting ready to pack up and possibly check out and drive 76 miles home, the phone rang. It was the front desk. We were told that a bellman was coming right up to move us to a different room, on a different floor. Of course, the bellman could not reach our room because the partygoers had shut that security door again on their way out. Do you know what it is like to repack your belongings to go to a different room in the middle of the night? For this nightmare, our stay was free of charge, and we were given two breakfast vouchers worth twenty dollars for the Capital Grille. And, mind you, a breakfast including two eggs over easy cost fourteen dollars, and a 3-egg omelet was $12 or $13. For a top hotel like the Conrad, a reputation for incomparable customer service is the most important asset. We were grateful to be \u201ccomped\u201d for the room instead of being charged, but why did it take 4 calls and more than 90 minutes to reach a solution to this party noise problem? To sum up, a four- or five-star hotel doesn\u2019t mean you are not going to be put in a room next to folks with total lack of manners and respect for others. I think a Motel 6 or Red Roof Inn would have been better. At least, I could have called the Police. P.S.
