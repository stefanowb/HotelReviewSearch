Not much to do if it rains so bring a good book just in case. GO's were very nice my children loved Pepe (the animation director) his daily outfit surpirses kept them laughing. Thanks to Jossie in reception who did everything to ensure our stay was enjoyable. Dealing with a party of nine is not always easy. Also to Brian, the girls wanted to say goodbye (ended up saying goodbye to your brother Kevin thinking it was you) Have a great time in Montreal and good luck with Cirque du Soleil thanks for the daily water aerobics classes they made us feel better about over eating. Circus guys were very patient, my brother loved the trapeze and juggling lessons.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 14, 2006", "id": 4974116}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "All in all a good trip.", "title": "Fabulous.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "squirrel33", "date": "April 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4964724}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Spring Break!", "text": "It is exactly one month since our trip and I am actually feeling a little guilty that I have taken so long to say thanks to the staff and management of the resort for their professionalism and energy (I assume that they read these reports).", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "John V", "date": "April 11, 2006", "id": 4964318}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Punta Cana Review", "text": "My wife, ten year old daughter, and fourteen year old son make a point of trying to escape Ottawa, Canada each winter for warmer climes, and this year was no exception.
