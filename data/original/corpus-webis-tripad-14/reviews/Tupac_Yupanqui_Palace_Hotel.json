This is a charming little hotel with a great location - just about a block away from the main square. The rooms are clean and bright, with comfortable beds. The hotel is arranged around a courtyard which is set up with tables and chairs to enjoy the sun. The people at the front desk were very helpful when we asked for directions. We were also happy with the hotel laundry service. If you tend to go to bed early, be sure to request a room that is not over the main doors to the hotel. These are closed after 10 or 11pm every night and are noisy to open when people come back to the hotel late at night. The only criticism I had was with the floor in the room. Although it was swept daily, it really needed to be mopped. I would absolutely stay here again.", "title": "Nice hotel", "user": "Kirkland_Traveller", "date": "July 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8073622, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great location in the heart of Cusco, free internet in the lobby", "disliked": "\u2014 Floors in the room needed to be mopped"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009", "text": "Stayed here for a total of 5 nites during our superb Gap Adventures trip in Peru in January 2009.", "title": "Lovely hotel in the centre of Cusco", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RoryMc", "date": "February 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 24412574, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good value for money, lovely staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Rooms were basic enough"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008", "text": "Ok, this place isnt 5 star luxury, but for the price we paid as part of the trip, it was very good value for money.
