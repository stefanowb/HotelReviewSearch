It has been under the Millennium umbrella for some years now and the quality has noticeably slipped. There is still a nice art-deco lobby with an air of seeming luxury but that disappears quickly when you ascend to the rooms. At check-in, we requested an upgrade to a corner room and were told that, if we waited until later in the afternoon, that could be arranged. In fact, it was not, although we were assigned one of the larger rooms (3601). The room had lost any sense of style that it had when the hotel was new. It was minimally (but haphazardly) decorated. The platform bed remained, but the quality of the linens had diminished to the level of a Motel 6. The sheets were no longer pressed and the foam pillows were flat as pancakes and hard as rocks. When we requested feather pillows, we were told that the hotel no longer carried them since \"most of the guests were allergic\" to them. The glass shower doors in the bathroom had been removed and replaced by standard-issue curtains. When we requested a late checkout, we were informed that we would be allotted an extra 30 minutes until 12:30, but that an hourly charge would apply after that. This indicated to me that the room was not, in fact, needed, but late checkout was viewed as a revenue enhancement mechanism for the hotel. We have been regular guests at the Millennium UN Plaza, which recently renovated one of its two towers. We have not stayed there since the renovation, but it was apparent to us that, even before the renovation, that hotel was vastly superior to its sister \"Broadway\" hotel (e.g. feather pillows, pressed sheets, friendly upgrades, and late checkouts).
