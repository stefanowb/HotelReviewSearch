We arrived at 2 PM (check-in is at 3 PM) and were informed that our room was not yet ready but that we would be contacted via phone when it was. Based on that information, we expected to wait, at most, 30 minutes. We were left waiting until 3:20 PM. We noticed that other people trying to check-in were having problems, as well, so we went to the front desk to see about our room status. The person we spoke to told us that there were limited numbers of deck rooms, and that housekeeping had not had enough time to finish cleaning any of them, because guests had been checking out late. We couldn't believe that their excuse was that guests had been checking out late. Obviously they need stricter rules on guest check-out times. Regardless, after being offered 2 free drinks at their bar by the manager (which we accepted indifferently), they found a room for us. After settling in, we noticed stains everywhere: yellow ones in the blue carpet under the bed and black ones all along the curtains. The bathrobes had seen better days, but they were appreciated. It took us a while to realize that the master switch needs to be on for any electrical switch or outlet to work in the room. The shower is nothing special considering what you'd expect at that price level. The deck was great, though a little awkward since you could totally see/hear your neighbors when they were out on their decks. You could see down to the pool from the deck, and it seemed like it was hosting a Spring Break party or something since there was hardly any free space in or out of the pool, but we had heard that the hotel is lively on the weekends. Needless to say, it discouraged us from going down to enjoy the pool ourselves. We called, twice, for utensils to cut/eat the cake we had brought and never received them. We were awoken at least twice by extremely raucous guests in the hallways, each instance lasting at least 15 minutes. We had reservations at Trace for brunch the next morning but decided to cancel and check-out early as our experience was so thoroughly spoiled, we couldn't stand to stay another minute.

A special thank you to concierge, Tony ,for helping me set up a surprise for my husband and especially for going out of your way to accommodate my wish for sparkling cider. We dropped our car off with Justin in valet and he was nice enough to help us with our luggage as well. Check-in with John at the front desk was very pleasant. He answered every question we had and he put us in an awesome room overlooking the lake. Everything was clean, comfy, and we thought the \"minibar/snack area\" in the room was the coolest thing! We both had a nice laugh at the pre-packaged pleasure kit. Very smart idea. The pool area was full of very entertaining and intoxicated young people, the bar was great-our only complaint is the shallowness of the pool. After enjoying a nice dip we headed downstairs for dinner. Our experience at Trace was top notch. Gabi, the hostess, let us sit where we pleased and upon hearing we were spending a special weekend brought us over some champagne. Mary waited our table and she was very friendly, engaging us in conversation and helping us choose the perfect meal. We had grilled octopus, wild game, and K1 strip. The secret to the food here is everything on the dish must be eaten together to fully enjoy the experience. The flavors were, as my husband put it, \"an orgasm in your mouth.\" Kudos to the chef-they have a true gift for taste.
