The host, Pierre, is wonderful: warm, helpful, friendly, ready to make a phone call for you or check on a reservation. There are 4 rooms here: all open on to the main sitting/kitchen area, and there's also a small patio/sitting area. I saw two of the rooms, and the only difference might be whether they face the street or, like mine, the common garden/pool area behind. The location is not in the center of the old city -- hence, less noise and bustle, but also some travel plan. The walk was about 15 minutes, but there is a tram 2 minutes away that goes right to the train station, and also goes on the edge of the old city at the bottom of the hill. Either way, it's easy to get in, easy to get around. Les 4 Etoiles was spotlessly clean, the fixtures modern, the breakfast fine. But the real reason to stay here is Pierre.", "title": "Great B&B near old city", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Genings", "date": "July 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167191288}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My partner and I stayed at Les 4 Etoiles for 4 nights in July 2013.
