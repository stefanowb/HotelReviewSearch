Our room was the Leopard room which had leopard upholstery, leopard dresser and so on. Every room is painted in very rich jewel tone colors and masks adorn the walls. The leopard room is the only room with a shower stall (spacious by European standards). The room was quite large and had a nice sized closet. The bed was comfortable and the window opened out to a great view. The photos on their web site are accurate. The pool is a good size and accessible to the sun all day. In summer, this would be a great reason to stay here for a week! The breakfast was amazing! The offerings included salmon, several hard and soft cheeses, homemade bread, yogurts, cereals, salads, hams/prosciutto, sliced strawberries, kiwi, other fruits, whole pears, tangerines, bananas, a huge selection of preserves and nut butters and the like, espresso, and to top it off \u2013 three or four tarts and a tiramisu. On your table are fresh croissants. There were other choices too. The owners are helpful with dinner reservations and genuinely interested in your travels. It\u2019s about 8 km from Urbino and you must travel a \u201crustic\u201d road (gravel with some ruts and potholes) but it is easily managed by standard car. It was great to be able to use the Villa as a base and drive from there.

The decor was just stunning, quirky and fun. Our room was huge and very comfortable. The views from the villa are magnificent. The attention to detail is very impressive - in the decor and also very welcome touches such as lovely bath products, slippers, and chocolate easter eggs in our room. Laurette and Thierry were wonderful and attentitive hosts, offering information on the surrounding area and Urbino itself. The breakfast laid on was amazing, with smoked salmon, homemade bread and cakes and even sparkling wine - my boyfriend (who is hard to impress) was like a kid in a candy store. Overall the hotel was a destination in itself!
