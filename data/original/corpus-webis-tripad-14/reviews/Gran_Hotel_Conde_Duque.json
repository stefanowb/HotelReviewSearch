Its set in a lovely quiet area, round the corner from El Corte Ingles shopping centre, its set slightly out of the hustle and bustle but its a gentle 15 minute walk to the Palace, cafes and bars all the way there so its no big deal. The staff were really helpful, they recommended the most gorgeous restaurant I have ever been to (been all around the world). La Casa Benigna - lovely lovely lovely! All the rooms were a decent size, very clean and good air conditioning! try and get a room facing the park area. The breakfasts were delicious lots of choice.

The plaza in front of the hotel is a nice and peaceful spot (well, at least on a Sunday), and the metro station is only one block and a half away. Breakfast is not as good as other reviewers have commented; in fact, I would not recommend it. I agree with other opinions about the lack of noise insulation: you can hear everything happening on the room next door! Aside from this, the hotel is cute, rooms and bathroom are adequate and comfortable (and I got a back room), and as I said, personal service is honestly kind and unusually warm.
