We stayed at the Hilton Vienna on Am Stadtpark. We found it to be an excellent hotel. The beds were very comfortable. We found an excellent rate on the Hilton website that also included the excellent buffet breakfast. You could even get fresh made waffles for breakfast. The location was good as well. Very close to the CAT from the airport. The underground was right across the street. The hotel was very clean. The rooms were a good size as was the bathroom. Lots of hot water. It is very easy to find when exiting the CAT station. When exiting just turn right then turn right at the corner. Go one block and turn right, the road looks like it is under construction. The Hilton is about 1.5 blocks down the road on the left.
