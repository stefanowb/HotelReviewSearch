Sidi Bou Said is a quaint, quiet, quintessential Tunisian town. However, Hotel Sidi Bou Fares was not what we expected. Rustic, traditional bedding (read that: straw mattresses), hobbit-sized room with a even smaller, b-a-r-e-l-y functional bathroom squeezed out of the square room space. Friendly host/owner/desk manager - but not truly fluent in English. We heard the heavy rain pounding the block ceiling all night and left for elsewhere the next day. Then, we discovered that Hotel Sidi Bou Fares was also overpriced, by 50%. Also, the credit card was hammered as if the price was in US$ instead of TD - another 30% rip! Take a peek, chat with the host, but stay at Carthage property.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "dmeade", "date": "March 9, 2006", "id": 4596504}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "The 24-hour desk staff are multi-lingual, and ever-helpful with matters of finding taxis and restaurants. Breakfast is quite nice, outside in the patio sunshine or shade, usually with one of the local cats for company -- not begging, just being amiable. Sometime there are a couple of pet tortoises sunning as well. Walk around the corner for superb hilltop views over the city at sunrise and sunset. It is near the President's palace, so there is a bit of security to negotiate if you drive out over the top of the hill -- usually just a wave. You have to run the gauntlet of the tourist market when you walk down the hill; there is an art gallery worth visiting on the way down on the right, just before the street goes from cobbled to asphalt.

The room itself was tiny but the bed comfortable and bathroom clean, which for me is very important; star rating does not mean much if the bathroom isn't clean. Staff did not seem to understand much in English but happy to express themselves in body language if needed!
