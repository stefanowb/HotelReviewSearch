Room, staff etc etc excellent - location on Noord (residential side of Amsterdam). I'd recommend purchasing 12E breakfast voucher night before (costs 16E otherwise). Complimentary hotel bus takes you to free 1 min. ferry crossing to Centraal Station every 15 mins. Be warned though that many airline staff stay at this hotel and regard it as their own! We had a very nasty and rude encounter with one such American female whilst waiting our turn to return to the hotel from city centre. We reported this incident to the hotel security but heard nothing further. I'd definitely use the hotel again however ...", "title": "Comfortable Amsterdam hotel but ...", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "rosetaylor", "date": "October 20, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4040668}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2004", "text": "This hotel was perfectly clean and well equipped, by European standards, with all the amenities that you would come to expect from a large chain of hotels, and has one of the lowest prices in Amsterdam at \u20ac89. The staff are polite, conscientious and multi-lingual. As the hotel has been built in the Noord, which has more space for development, the rooms are of a decent size and there are elevators unlike many hotels in the main part of the City. The only drawback is the location of the Hotel. It is not in the main body of Amsterdam but is located in the Noord, across the river. This means that from (Amsterdam) Centraal Rail Station you have to take the passenger ferry, located immediately outside (Centraal) on the river side, which is free of charge and goes 24hrs a day, every 6 minutes during the day. This ferry takes around 1 minute to cross and then it is a simple 10 minute walk straight along the road to the hotel. Basically, upon leaving the hotel you will arrive at Centraal, about 14 minutes later. Alternatively, you can take a bus (Numbers 34, 35, 91, 92, 94, 171, 172, 174) which stop in the road outside the hotel and take about 10 minutes from Centraal. Or you can take a taxi \u2013 though, most are unsure as to where the hotel is \u2013 at \u20ac15 for a 5 minute journey. The airport is a 15 minute train ride from Centraal \u2013 at around \u20ac4.", "title": "Good value, although a little out of the centre", "helpfulness": 83, "user": "goonermadness", "date": "September 1, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 2506634}], "location": {"country": "The Netherlands", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Amsterdam"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 24, "very good": 81, "terrible": 8, "excellent": 52}, "aka": "Nh Galaxy Hotel Amsterdam", "slim_ranking": 0.264705882353, "description": "The four-star NH Galaxy hotel in Amsterdam boasts 290 newly renovated rooms, all with modern facilities and air-conditioning.
