We took our 2 children 4 years and 20 months. This site is suitable for all. We stayed with eurocamp, who were excellent. The sunlight caravan we had was just a year old and in fantastic condition, it had everything we needed. The staff were very good and the manager seemed to have everything under control. The campsite is large but nothing is too far away. The on site facilities were great, very clean and well staffed. For many grocery items the on site shop is reasonable, in fact something were cheaper than the local supermarket (carrefour) in torroella, but shop around on days out and you can pick up a varied selection of food and drink. We hired a car (which for us was essential) from goldcar, watch out for the high fuel price charged at pick up, that said we could not have got the car cheaper anywhere else, just be prepared at your pick up point.", "title": "A great holiday, enjoyed by all.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Wilsonfly", "date": "July 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 115626641}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We used the car to get out and about and can recommend : Pals, Girona, Figueres, Palamos and l'estartit.

These 2 tents are side by side and perfect for 2 families travelling together (as we were). Firstly the tents - these are unique to Eurocamp and more about them can be found on Eurocamp's site. Excellent tents. Lots of living space, well equipped, comfortable beds. They even come with a heater for chilly May nights. The tents stood up to some pretty heavy rain and we all stayed warm and dry. Bring additional blankets if you're travelling early or late season. Duvets and sheets can be provided but you may find you need something extra. There is no cafetiere but there is a filter coffee pot which is a good 2nd best. Other than that the kitchen is well stocked with everything you need. Our kids loved the Eurocamp kids club and my daughter and her friend age 4 learned to ride a pedal bike (on 2 wheels - no stabilisers) in 3 lessons with Niek who was amazing with them. It was quiet and we were allowed to borrow the bikes for additional practice which was very useful. All the eurocamp staff we met here were very helpful.
