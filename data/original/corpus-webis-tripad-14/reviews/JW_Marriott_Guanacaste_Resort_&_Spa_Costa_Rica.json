{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 1062, "name": "JW Marriott Guanacaste Resort & Spa Costa Rica", "reviews": [{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Beautiful spot; poor food; could be anywhere", "text": "The facility is a very pretty, spread-out resort complex of the kind that abounds in, say, Cancun or Puerta Vallarta. Apart from the local employees, the facility is completely disconnected from Costa Rica and even from its immediate surroundings. (And due to still-unrepaired hurricane damage from years ago, the unpaved road to the hotel is many miles of bumps and dust.) This hotel could be anywhere. It is decorated in Spanish hacienda style - even though these were never built in Costa Rica. During our stay, the hotel allowed vendors to sell wares from tables in the open-air lobby area -- not a problem, except that they were specializing in (supposedly) baby alpaca scarves from Peru. One would think a Marriott in Costa Rica would help support Costa Rican crafts people. The rooms are spacious and very well maintained. Top quality bedding, towels, etc. Great air conditioning. But, the main attractions of a resort of this kind were lacking: the food was bland and unconscionably expensive; the sandy beach is pretty and nice, but it is rough and rocky if you enter the water (although the sunset is beautiful); and service was sketchy (enjoying our $12 basic cocktails at the lobby bar, we watched a customer at another table try to order three different drinks listed on the bar's own drink menu only to be told they were not available!). Bottom line: if you want this kind of experience, there is no reason to go to Costa Rica to get it, and you will do better for this kind of experience elsewhere. It is truly a shame that Marriott sort of dropped a resort onto this beautiful spot without any apparent regard for its Costa Rican locale. I felt slightly ashamed about the whole thing.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "hcajones", "date": "February 24, 2011", "id": 97894205}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Wonderful rooms, food, beach, pool...everything!
