Flat sceen tv doesn't have adjustment for High Def vs. normal, so much distortion (fat heads!). ONE packet of coffee and ONE packet of decaf provided and then coffee pot didn't work (I discovered it was the outlet luckily, so moved it and got my one little cup of caffeine -- which is all you're going to get out of them for free). Had to get expensive coffee in lobby. Last day my hubbie grabbed a cup for me and paid (before 6:00 a.m.) service. Luke warm, so when we hit the road asked for a little \"warm up\" and the girl poured about 1\" of hot coffee on top. I guess that's all they could part with for a guest. Parking is $21 (norm, I guess), you PAY for internet. Front desk had ATTITUDE, more than once. Remodeled rooms were CRAMPED. ok, nice bedding and ok mattress. Bathroom pretty, but one outlet (see coffee pot) didn't work.

From the valet, to the front desk, even the room service, the entire staff was friendly and willing to go out of there way to help with whatever was needed. We where pleasantly suprised at how nice our room was, as well as the quietness. This was the first hotel I had stayed in where I actually fell at home and got a good nights rest. The bathroom was beautiful (LOVED the showerhead!), and the room service was prompt and tasty. The only thing really that was not perfect was the quality of the TV.

It was a big inconvenience, because I ended up having to meet friends for breakfast with literally 2 minutes to spare. i mentioned this to the check out desk, not for any special treatment, but just to let them know there was a mix-up. Cindy, the director of guest services was wonderful! She offered compensation which more than made up for the getting late to breakfast. She was very apologetic and welcoming.
