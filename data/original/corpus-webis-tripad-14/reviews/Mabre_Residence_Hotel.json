Bathroom was great...large with a tub and separate shower. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the porter who delivered our luggage. Very good breakfast included in the price. The only issue we had was the transport to the airport which the hotel arranged for us. The hotel quoted us one amount which was reasonable, but upon dropping us off at the airport, the driver demanded more money. Unfortunately I didn't have much time to argue and had to pay.
