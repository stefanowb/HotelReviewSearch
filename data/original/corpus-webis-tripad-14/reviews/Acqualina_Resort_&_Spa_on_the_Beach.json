Unlike any massage I have ever had. But, the facial, for $150 was vey disjointed and poorly given. There were a lot of stops between next steps and my face felt like Ralph Macchio in the Karate Kid - wax on the product and then wax off. Not very relaxing and my skin didn't look like I just had a facial. Lastly, I had a \"time saver\" manicire and pedicure for a combined $150.
