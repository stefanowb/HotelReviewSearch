The garage was used as some sort of storage area for their junk and could barely fit the car in it as there was old fridges, washing machines and obsurd amounts of boxes of old tea pots and other crockery from floor to ceiling. There was no freezer in the room so we had no where to put our ice and other frozen goods which we had bought with us and the bar staff seemed hugely put out by us asking for a couple of bowls of ice from them when ours had all melted! And we had specifically asked for a late check out (which was agreed upon via email previously) but the male owner rang us at 9.55am to \"remind\" us we had to be out soon and when I explained that we had a late check out he was rather abrubt about it on the phone! All in all very unimpressed with the Benvenue they couldnt have made us feel less welcome which I find somewhat amusing as we seemed to be the only people staying in the complex that whole weekend....
