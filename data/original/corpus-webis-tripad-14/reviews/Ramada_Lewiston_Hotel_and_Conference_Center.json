But as far as the negatives go.... well that's another story. As a note: I did not have just one room as an example but was with a good size party so had the opportunity to see 4 other rooms and everyone had the same complaints! The hotel was obviously run down with stains on tiles on the ceiling, big rust stains in the bathroom, missing bits and holes, and worn bits on the furniture and fixtures. The cleanliness was questionable when I found a CD between the bed and dresser and there were blood stains on the comforter that were even obvious to my son. Yikes! I was going to make tea in the coffee pot provided but had to scrape a layer of dust off the top and clean it myself before attempting. Unfortunately, when I actually looked inside the machine itself, it was so disgusting with built-up residue and who knows what, I gave up and put it back on the shelf. The whole room seemed dirty with obvious dust, mysterious hairs throughout the bathroom and sink area, dirty smudges on various things that I wouldn't touch or allow my son to go near. The showers were horrible! As soon as you heard the shower go on in the room beside you, suddenly your shower went freezing, and after turning the knob to full hot it became dueling showers that would alternate between scalding and freezing. I figured I would get up earlier the next day to avoid fighting over hot water with my neighbor, but still had the same problem with alternating freezing and scalding water. The riff raff seemed uncontrollable making loud noises and yelling while running between rooms at 1am--these were \"adults\" mind you. And even though it was a non-smoking facility, people were able to leave side doors to the hotel open and stand in the doorways smoking and letting it waft inside. There were empty beer cans and bottles around the indoor pool area, and the hot tub was so littered with empties my son attempted to step around them without causing an avalanche, but I stopped him from even getting in, since it looked so questionable. The buffet is cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for, with a multitude of frozen or \"instant\" food heated up for you.
