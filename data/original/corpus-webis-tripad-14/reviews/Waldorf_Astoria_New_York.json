A couple of observations: (1) the facility is older; but it is very well maintained. But I admit that I wanted to stay here just to experience this hotel; for example, the lobby area is of a style that just isn\u2019t replicated anymore. (2) Evidently, the site hosts a lot of meetings and other functions. So after coming back to the hotel after work, the lobby was very crowded. (Suggestion: if you can, enter through the Lexington Ave entry. It is usually the Park Ave side of the building that is crowded.) Fortunately, security staff manning their post is very obvious. (3) The service extended to me was very good. Example: I arrived at the hotel at 5:30am after a \u201cred-eye\u201d flight. Unfortunately, all the rooms were full, and no one had check out yet. The clerk made a specific attempt to get me a larger, corner room (he noted that I would be staying for a week), and asked house keeping to expedite the cleaning of that room when it became available. For my part, I went to the office, and my room was ready for me by lunch time. I did have the option to stay at another (newer) hotel, but all in all, I would say that it was worth staying at least once, for the experience of it all. pchnmain", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "pchnmain", "date": "February 24, 2005", "id": 3228978}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Very grand but doesn't deserve the reputation", "text": "We (two adults, two children) stayed for six nights at the Waldorf.

No one greeted us upon arrival (so that means no doorman or bell service.) The place is a maze from the start. No signs to where exactly is the front desk. Beautiful inside, high ceilings, big sparkling Christmas tree, marble tables with nice flower arrangements, etc. Used the self check in machine because there was an extremely long check-in line (3pm). To find out that our room was not ready and that we had to wait in the long line. 30 minutes later, got keys to our Park View room and their was no bell person available to bring our luggage to the room. So we brought it up ourselves. The place is the most confusing place ever (it was built in the shape of like 4 H's put together and they had lots of rooms). Also no upgrade was available even though we were Hilton silver members. After 30 minutes of being lost on the 12th floor we finally find our room. Oh and the views of the park were excellent (NOT!). We were on the 12th floor and could not even see the park. Also it was not views of central park it was views of their own little park that they developed themselves. So basically the only thing that we had good views of was the room on the other side of the H. The bathroom was made out of marble (old) but nice, no jets in tub and small tub. No special soap or shampoo... these were ones that you may find at let's say comfort inn. Beds were great and very comfortable. No plasma TV = junky comfort inn style television. the internet costs like $20 a hour. You have to request turn down service. On the plus side Hilton\u2026 being a silver member sent us a bottle of wine and chocolates which was designed like art (almost too good to eat.) The room was nice but needed a paint job and for those that work their it was room 1278(also the ceiling looked like it was going to fall). My advice if this place is $300 a night it's worth the additional $200 to stay at trump (that\u2019s how bad it was). Read my trump review. Self check out was easy\u2026that was great because I just wanted to check out and get back to trump. Again no service with luggage, etc. Oh I just noticed they charged me an additional $2...

The next night we switched to a normal room which was a corner room overlooking Park Avenue. This room seemed very updated, was very large, had high ceilings and very comfortable. Our parents were also on the trip and I found their room to be a bit dark and also a little outdated and smaller so I think the rooms really vary. I would recommend asking for a corner room. The bathrooms are nice, GREAT water pressure. The actual location of the hotel is great because you are within walking distance of Times Square and Broadway but enough removed to not be in the middle of the chaos.
