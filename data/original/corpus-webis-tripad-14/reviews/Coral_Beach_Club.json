First you have a small grocery store literally next door to buy some food and snacks. The prices are not \"cheap\" but they are certainly affordable and we found buying eggs and toast there was much less expensive than eating out. Second you are next to one of the best restaurants on the Island- Big Fish- trendy seafood with a great crowd and priced lower than I am used to in CT. We ate there twice and absolutely loved each meal. Also, if you did need a car, CBC would happliy arrange this for you. Third Mr Busbys beach bar is on the property. $1.00 beers from 11-4...can you ask for anything more?? Also they offer full american breakfast for $8.00 or lunch from $5-10.

Everything that they told us was absolutely on target, and in fact, the location is beyond words! You are right on the beach (and I do mean ON THE BEACH!), and have this wonderful view of the sea and St. Barths on the horizon. We really like the Dawn Beach area (Dutch side of the island) because it's serene and picturesque, and although we're not prudes, we're just not into that whole 'clothing optional' thing going on on the French side of the island (especially Orient Bay). Dawn Beach is more family oriented. I agree about the Beachview over the Beachfront in that the Beachview does offer more privacy. The villa we stayed in was beyond our expectations: very spacious, fabulously appointed, gourmet kitchen and, of course, that VIEW! Having your own private pool just steps from your door was really terrific! And being only 15-20 minutes from Philipsburg, Marigot and Grande Case for shopping and restaurants makes this place the best spot on the island in our opinion.

We decided not to stay at a beachfront because it wasn't as private, everyone could just look in and watch you, so we opted for the beachview which was elevated and super private. We stood in Villa Oyster. I would have to say that the villas are probably nicer then what you see in the pictures. From the minute we walked in we were blown away. It was spotless clean, everything you needed was at your fingertips, they even had a welcome basket of fruit, chocolates, cookies, and wine. The pool was outstanding 7 of us fit perfectly in it with room to swim and move around. The patio is gigantic and could probably fit more than 20 people on it if you were having a party. All the bedrooms have there own bathrooms which are huge with huge showers and are just unbelievable, to the glass sinks with sand and rocks and seashells in them, to the tiled showers and everything else that goes along with it. The beds are king sized with temperpedic mattresses and are so comfortable every room has flat screen tvs with satellite reception, tons of channels. Huge closets, the master bedroom closet is like another bedroom. There is also a washer and dryer so thats a plus as well. The kitchen is absolutely gorgeous with viking appliances and white quartz countertops, but every villa is different so each one might vary. The whole living area dining room, living room, and kitchen are all open to one another and decorated and furnished perfectly, it creates a good flow for living especially since the wall to the patio and pool completely opens because they are glass doors that open the whole wall. You also get roof top access so you get even better views then what you get on your patio, but the patio views are gorgeous too. Everything in the villa is of the highest quality and I can't say enough great things about it. After our vacation was over we decided we will definitely be coming back to the coral beach club. We're gonna make it our yearly place to go, my parents are even contemplating on buying one of the villas because we loved it so much, instead of renting one every year. Also the staff there is perfect, Brooke the villa director and Anju the head of everything are great and will do anything to make your stay great. We needed a car to rent to see the island, we called anju, and an hour later the car was out on our driveway ready to go. The place was just outstanding and the people running it are equally that. We didn't want to leave it was heart breaking! We did feel safe, there is 24 hr security and they are right there. We were the only people at the time staying at beachview villas, and the security guard was right there all the time, we got back one nite around 3:30am and he was up waiting for us to get back and made sure we got back safely. If you decide to walk off the premises and go to say the westin or walk in general, I would recommend only doing it during the day, it probably wouldn't be safe to do it at night. We were told that it could get a little dangerous if we wonder after hours. But that goes for anywhere it can happen, you just never know. Anyhow, if you decide to stay there and speak to either Anju or Brooke, tell them that Mark Straten and family say hi and we highly recommended this place and they couldn't have made our stay any better, and I assure you, you won't be disappointed and you'll have a great time!
