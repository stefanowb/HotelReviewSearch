My double room on the 3rd floor was clean, quiet and comfortable. The hotel is very close to I95 but I hardly noticed the noise. The staff was friendly, informative and very helpful in providing local information. I think the hotel is over a year old so everything looked clean and new. I did have a slight problem with the first room I was in and the situation was fixed immediately. The in room refrigerator and microwave were fantastic and the complimentary 24 hr tea, coffee, fruit and hot chocolate was a nice touch. The hotel was clean, and the complimentary breakfast was good and very helpful. There are other options nearby. Free in room WiFi, business center and small fitness center were great too.
