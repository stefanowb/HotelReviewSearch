Food: adequate, plentiful, way overcooked all the time. The Chef ruined perfectly good cuts of beef, pork, fish by preping and cooking EVERYTHING hours in advance. All the fruits were great and breakfast was the best quality...Staff very attentive/ Buy you own booze at the Gas station down the road and mix em' up in your room. My room requests were not honored and I was given the worst room out of 180! After persistance and a bit of nagging Alejandro I was moved the second day to a PRIMO room. Robert the Dive Hefe was a challenge to work with as his Compressor was not working as it should( for about a year now and a new one is \"on the way\" from Turkey...) The Dive master had 18pp per boat so you better not have a problem or require too much assistance. I was paired with a large group who were quite uptight and difficult so the fun aspect was missing. Should have demanded to switch boats immediately! Experienced divers could fend for themselves/ rookies suffered. Alot of spearfishing takes place as it's not a protected preserve so corals, micro stuff were wonderful but nothing bigger than 7\" could be found. Period. Harp on your Master to take you to the outer dive sights/Do your research and request specific dives. The beaches were clean, raked each day and the overall experience was a \"you get what you pay for\" trip.", "title": "An excellent bargain priced vacation", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Becked1", "date": "June 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7976617}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at Fantasy Island June 9-16. Even with some of the bad reviews, we hoped for the best. I have to say, it was above our expectations. We did have a problem when we arrived at the airport. There was no Fantasy Island vehicle there to pick us up. There was one other couple on our flight. We waited outside the airport for 1-\u00bd hours before my husband and the other guy threatened to have a taxi take us. The guy at the airport was on the phone yelling at the resort (in English, a show, we think, for out benefit) telling them to get us a ride. The \u201cguys\u201d didn\u2019t buy it and said we would just split a taxi ride. He got us a van taxi that was at the airport to take us to the resort. What we think was happening was they were trying to \u201chold\u201d us at the airport until the next flight into Roatan came in around 12:30. We didn\u2019t think that was cool. When we arrived at the resort, they tried to give us a room in the D\u2019s (the dive rooms) After reading many reviews, I had requested a room in the 100\u2019s (the newer building) with a king size bed and an extra bed for our son. They said they never got the information from the Fantasy Island Resort booking office. (The 1 800 number on the website) I was disappointed to hear that, but they said they would get us a room as we had requested so we went to eat lunch. Our room was huge!! Very nice, very clean, very nice bathroom. The bathroom was all marble. We did have a problem a couple times with our toilet. Each time we told the front desk, they had someone go take a look and fix it. The shower was fine. We ALWAYS had good water pressure, no matter what time of day. Our cleaning lady was wonderful. Didn\u2019t speak English, but we figured out how to say what we needed to. I had taken a bag of starbursts with us for the plane and had some left. I told her to take some whenever she wanted. (Note to travelers: DO NOT leave your candy/snacks out or you will get ants. We ended up putting our snacks in the fridge. We had a mini fridge in the room with purified water in a pitcher. I packed us woolite and a clothesline and pins and managed to hang that up by the closet. I would wash our swimsuits out nightly, hang them up and they\u2019d be dry by the morning. We really lucked out and had 2 other families there that had kids the same age as our son!! It was great. I think they lived in the ocean diving/snorkeling and the swimming pool after that! They loved the bar staff. Even though we weren\u2019t on an all-inclusive plan, they would make the kids nada colodas and let them sit at the pool bar. The snorkeling was awesome. I would be able to tag along on some of the dives and snorkel while my 2 guys were diving. My husband and son LOVED the diving. They said the walls were amazing. We did the snorkel with the dolphins at Anthony\u2019s Key while we were there. That was an experience of a lifetime. There were about 10 snorkelers and 4 dolphins in the lagoon. The trainer started us our with the dolphin encounter with the entire group, then some of us went snorkeling. They kept biting our fins. It was cool and well worth the money. On our last day there, we decided to rent a car and tour the island. The gift shop on the resort didn\u2019t have any shirts I wanted, so my husband said we could go find one!! We rented a small Kia for the whole day and it cost us $35 total. Well worth the money also!! We drove all around the island into the West End. There was a lot of shopping options there and I did find a shirt! (The same shop is at the Roatan airport when you\u2019re leaving, after customs and in the waiting room) The one thing we were surprised about was the West End was trashy. It smelled like road kill and there was trash all along the beach, and waterfront. Which is kind of disturbing since it is a Marine Park. There were a lot of options for eating, although we did not eat there. We had hoped to stop at Rick\u2019s American Caf\u00e9 on the way back to the resort, but he was closed until 5pm. We decided to drive past our resort in the evening on our way back from getting gas and found \u201cThe View\u201d wow what an awesome place. We did say that if we do go back to Fantasy Island, we would go out to eat a couple nights while we\u2019re there since the food is kind of bland and not a whole lot of variety. The ice cream was great. We had hoped for a crab night after reading several reviews, but it didn\u2019t happen. We also never got \u201cThe best coconut ice cream\u201d. We were bummed about that too!! We did have experience with the sand flies, sand fleas or no see-ums. I packed deep woods off, cutter wipes, and we also bought cactus juice on the resort. Luckily we packed Cortizone cream. We used that nightly when we saw any bites pop up. I don\u2019t know how we would have coped if we didn\u2019t have it. We really didn\u2019t start itching until the day after we got back\u2026some show up a day later. After staying at a Beaches in Jamaica and an Iberostar in Mexico, we\u2019d have to say that the buffets are on par with what is offered there and although the other resorts do seem to have a bigger selection. When you look at the fact that 3 of us were able to stay for seven nights on a full dive package, that would have been one of us at a Beaches, the food and accommodations were more than acceptable.", "title": "The price is right!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ColoradoSunnydaze", "date": "June 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7958998, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The dive facility, and hammocks", "disliked": "\u2014 Bathroom & not being able to open the windows to hear the Ocean"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Decent place, but not sure I'd go back", "text": "We just got back from Fantasy Island Beach Resort. The diving is awsome. Our dive master, Daren and boat captain Moses were nothing short of fantastic. We had 2 large rooms. The first room was totally remodeled and very nice, but it had no view. The second room was, as my daughter put it, substandard. It had a new floor that was unfinished, new furniture and a 40-50 year old bathroom, no screens on the windows and we got a few bugs and lizards because the windows and doors are in need of weather striping. Thank God I packed a can of raid! The second room did have a very nice view. Both rooms had working air conditioners and mini fridges. The daily maid service was very good and we had plenty of clean towels. The food was adquate. Very bland, but lots of it, lacking in varity, really good ice cream. Drinks are very reasonable and down right cheap during happy hour. The activity desk was very helpful and friendly. The 2 evening shows we saw were very good. We were caught off guard when they passed the hat after the show. Next time we went we made sure to have some small bills for the performers. A couple of things I was disapointed about was that the outside cafe was closed, there was no beach service and all activities off site had an additional fee for transportation that is not shown on the web site or in any of their other pamplets and the transpotation fees are to be paid in cash. No ATM on site and the cab fares are pretty high. I did try and get extra cash (for tiping and transportation fees) a couple of times at the bank, but the power was out. The hotel would give you cash on a credit card, with a 12% Fee. Forget Gio's resturant and head for The View. All in all we enjoyed our stay.
