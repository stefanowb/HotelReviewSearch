It is an old coaching house and all of the rooms are individually decorated but include all the old painted beams that were in the building in the 1300s. The entrance is through an arched gateway, where the hotel limo service (very cheap) will drop you off. You will go through a fantastic courtyard to get to your room (it would be fantastic in summer, but as it snowed when we were there we weren't complaining!) All the staff were incredibly friendly and willing to help, and also had a good knowledge of English. Very clean with loads of pillows and extra bedding if so required. Our room was on the second floor and you walked straight into the bedroom that was very lush - all royal blue and crisp white. You then went down 3 steps to an enormous living area that had a full 3 seater settee, dining table, television and what looked like a massive wardrobe. On opening the wardrobe it actually contained a small 'kitchenette', complete with fridge (with drinks etc), sink, grill and small hob. Our bathroom was an experience in itself. As you walked in you thought it was the same height as a normal room, but on looking up the ceiling was about 20 foot above you. It was decorated in plain white but the the exposed beams travelling up the walls to a massive open skylight in the ceiling gave it an amazing feeling of space. Absolutely fantastic! I would highly recommend the Iron Gate to anyone travelling to Prague.", "title": "Romantic,historical and brilliantly positioned!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Something-Different!", "date": "July 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8065078, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Positioning, standard of accommodation", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic!", "text": "Stayed for 2 nights and the hotel was clean and location ideal.

Because it was so much cheaper in January we were able to book the Royal Suite which had original painted beams, large bathroom although they could have made more use of the room in here and put a bigger bath in (thats if your staying in the Royal Suite), huge wardrobe, seating area with sofa, dining table and a quirky cabinet which when opened lit up and turned into a small kitchenette with sink, kettle, coffee maker and a fridge. Breakfast was ok with a lot to choose from but if you like your English tea be sure to bring your own teabags to breakfast as they only provide Earl Grey or herbal teas! They did have a restaurant in the hotel but we didnt try it as it was actually a curry house so hardly catered for everyone's taste! I would say that was the only downside but as you probably wouldnt spend much time in the hotel it didnt matter. Staff were polite and helpful. Our hotel was in a great location and once you stepped out into the cobbled back streets you were only a 5 minute walk from the main square. Our room overlooked a main street but it was very quiet although I suspect you notice noise more in the summer. The air con wasnt great in the room but we didnt really need it. The streets are fairly narrow so you can see across the road into the building opposite, again be warned if going in the summer when you might find a lot of crowds flocking for hen/stag parties!
