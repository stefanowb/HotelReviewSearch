We arrived by bus and stressed from our travel. The lady hotel owner immediately put us to ease and we had a relaxing lunch in the restaurant. Our room was delightful and pleasantly furnished. Surrounding areas are gardens and fields. Too cool to try out the pool. It appeared busy during our stay but we still got individual attention from everyone. We were able to hire their bikes. The American Cemetery is a walk away as is the beach. We had a lovely breakfast each morning. The location is best suited to those who have a car. We felt like we had a five star experience staying here.", "title": "Excellent family hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "aussie53", "date": "October 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 10073787, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Spacious rooms and quietness and loved the theme", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled with family", "text": "This is a truly wonderful hotel. The hostess is a very nice lady and helped me figure out how to shift my rental car into reverse. The room was impeccable. We were still jetlagged from arriving the day before and nto sleeping for 30 hours, so we planned to sleep in the first morning. at about 9:00 am there was a ring on the phone and it was the front desk wondering if we would be coming down for breakfast. It turns out they order bread and pastries specifically for you, and they were quite good. Lunch at the restuarant was also quite good, and was one of the few places around. It was rather cool during the time we were there so we did not have an opportunity to try the pool. It was very quiet, we only saw two older American couples while there. There was a small field directly behind our room with sheep grazing. This is an ideal base to explore all the D-Day sites, you could easily walk down the road to the American Cemetery. I loved this place, I can't wait to go back, and would recommend it to anyone.", "title": "Outstanding hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "optiksguy", "date": "March 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7178953, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly and helpful staff, proximity to WWII sites", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Normandy", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 9, "very good": 20, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 20}, "aka": "Domaine De l Hostreiere", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
