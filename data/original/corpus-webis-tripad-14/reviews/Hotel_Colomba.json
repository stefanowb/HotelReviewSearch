We had asked for a quiet room and we had one -- we walked through what appeared to be family quarters to get to it on the third floor of the building. The room was the largest we had in a 2 1/2 week trip and the bathroom actually had a shower door! The rest of the trip we were wiping the floor after our showers. The staff was as helpful as other reviewers have all said. We didn't think the walk from the train station was as short as others claim, but they happily called a cab for us the day we left and it was worth the 10E to not trail through the crowded sidewalks with our luggage in the heat of the day. The room was very clean and the breakfast was good. We really enjoyed the variety of fresh fruit each morning. We loved the SKY TV (lots of English channels) and the free internet.
