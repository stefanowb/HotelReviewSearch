They have to rate as good as any place we have stayed anywhere, this also includes overseas as well. It offers perfect location, but most importantly all the necessary facilities are provided along with a spacious layout, comfortable beds and relaxing living area. All this combined presents a lodging that can only be described as up market. Surprisingly the cost is very reasonable for what you get. We can highly recommend Chapel Apartments for a stay in Dunedin.

Not sure why other reviewers have complained about it being cold? We were there in freezing weather and the heat pump worked a treat, the bathroom floors are heated, and the beds have electric balnkets. Highly recommend this place. The only tiny niggle is the lack of window view to the outside, hard to know what to wear in the morning by appraising a sliver of sky.

The location of the Chapel Apartments were what drew us to book, and I confess to usually taking a large handful of salt when viewing photos of any accommodation posted online, but the photos on Jon's own website are totally accurate.
