The meal, which was steak that I had at the Hotel was one of the best meals I had in a long time.

Staff was absolutely incredible. Accomodated our every request...with a smile! Let my 2 yr. old and myself check in at 9 am while my husband tended to his commitments. Even drove us to the local mall in the courtesy van and picked us up when we were through. Very clean, quiet hotel with wonderful beds and linens. Complimentary computer/ business station for using internet and printing documents. Nice pool area with lockers etc. Bar was nice as was restaurant. Marriott is doing somthing very right, especially at this Southfield hotel. The staff is what makes the big difference. They seem happy to assist and are courteous and go out of their way to make their guests happy.
