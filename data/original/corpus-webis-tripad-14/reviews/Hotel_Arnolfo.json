I would echo the last few reviews, the room is basic and in massive need of refurb. The bathroom was tired and the grime around the shower was deep enough to grow spuds in it. The state of the place may be due to the cleaning lady, who looked about 90. Breakfast was included in the rate, but this might be the worst breakfast in Italy. Soggy croissants, juie from a push button machine, cheese slices you could put in a window frame, and the coffee was undrinkable. Did you think it was impossible to have a bad coffee in Italy?
