Change dollars to pesos here in the states, else the best exchange rate typically is at the hotel. If you go out in town for anything, pay in pesos. If you pay in dollars, the locals love to short change you in pesos. I'd been shorted a few times with change received in pesos.

We had an ocean-view room which was great EXCEPT for the giant hideous concrete sound bar thing they built on the pool that obscures some of the ocean-view.

One large pool with two smaller pools on either side of it, one of those smaller pools having a swim-up bar. And this is NOT an adults-only resort. There were a ton of kids running around.

This was our first trip to Mexico but we are very well travelled on a global basis. The location is great right on a fantastic beach with a perfect ocean, clear, blue and warm. The room was great, 9th floor, good size, perfect view. The hotel was at 55% occupancy for the first four days which is where it needed to stay to maintain great service, the last three days were up to 95% occupancy and the hotel was too small for the volume of people. There are three restaurants and a buffet restaurant. The wok and Italian are excellent, the steak house and buffet are poor. There is no where to have a chilled drink outdoors in the evening,big problem so I recommended they move the steak house up stairs and create a cool bar area outside though they will need to do something about the wind. The staff are generally good but some have an attitude especially in the wok restaurant. The pools loose the sun at 16.00 hrs, not good. For the past three days the hotel ran out of towels, no body went out of their way to sort this basic service,poor!. The entertainment needs review. The team work very hard day and night but the schedule lacks quality and excitement, again the wind is an issue.

We were very surprised to see that the Beach Palace continues to provide an even better experience than before with the addition of the water slide and new shopping stores. The true standout however is the low turnover they have in staff. It is amazingly comforting to see some of the staff from our previous visit whose service continues to outshine other luxury properties. It all starts with a young man named Jose Luis who greets us at the valet stand. He remembered me and my family from last year by our last name. He is very attentive and always makes sure you don't have to wait long for a taxi. By the poolside there is no one more helpful than Luz Yanet Sanchez, who is as attentive as is possible. If you are down by the breach there is a young man named Elias who really stood out for his attention to detail and making sure we didn't burn in the hot sun. Isabel Sepulvedra is another standout who makes you feel you selected the right hotel in the way she ensures her guests are being attended to. In the sports bar making sure the right games are on TV and attending to our party is Senior Victor, who always makes sure we are enjoying our vacation. There was a young man named Alfonso in the sports bar who also made sure our family felt welcomed each and everytime we visited the sports bar. In Restaurant Tequila, Carlos Abraham remembers what we drink every morning and we always like to have our table in his area. The master of the grill however is Gabriella, who mans both the omelette station and the pancake grill at the same time. She always cooks the breakfast just right.

Was with 18 additional friends and family over Thanksgiving Week and was very disappointed in the Beach Palace. Was told that we would have beach front rooms and when we got there had none available. The people who book our tours and spa messed up on times and such several times. I literally felt like I spent 1/4 of my vacation sitting at the tour place fixing their mistakes. Our wait in the Italian Restaurant was 45 minutes before we even received our appetizer. The steak house was completely out of steak and baked potatoes by 6:30pm however the waiters and chef was very apologetic and tried to accommodate us and our needs. This was due to improper ordering of food by the powers to be. Guest of ours had called down to front desk because their faucet was broken and never had anyone come to fix it as well as other guest of ours called down for pillows and such and never received them. We wanted to go scuba diving and had discussed this with tour people who were only willing to have us use aqua world so we could obtain our scuba certificate to go and since aqua world only offers them 1 day a week we were unable to go only to find out that the Moon Palace offers scuba lessons everyday but yet we were not referred to them to get our lessons. My personal opinion is due to the tour people would not make commission off of us going to the Moon Palace and receiving our lessons there. The spa there was wonderful with an employee there by the name of Elizabeth I believe who took extra great care of her guest who was helping us in and out of the sauna and steam room. The sports bar had great bartenders Erik and Zacharias that made us feel at home. Isaha/Isreal gave an incredible massage. Wilbur and Angel at the pool bar was amazing and always kept us happy. When we went to xplor there was a huge discrepancy with us coming back on a bus where they had us not on any list and since we are pretty experienced travelers we made sure that we held the company accountable to get us back to our hotel. Cancun's public transportation is incredible and have always felt safe. I agree great for families with younger children not for couples or even teenagers. we went out to Moon Palace for the day and our teenagers had way more fun out there they said and once again we received the impeccable service and food we have always know the Palace Resorts to give at the Moon Palace that day.
