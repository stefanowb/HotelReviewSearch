We stayed in a Villa which are oceanfront, there are 2 seperate villas with about 25 rooms in each, our agent did state that there would be a jacuzzi in each but that was incorrect there were a couple of jacuzzis in the villa area but however our rooms didn't have them. We had asked for adjoining rooms or side by side and when we arrived they had us in 2 different buildings, so please request that again at check in, if that applies to you. The rooms were quite adequate with a spectacular ocean view. We were ground floor so I can imagine the further up you would get the view probably got better and better. Also there is a pool outside of the villas that is specifically for the guests in the villas, it was never crowded and quite nice.
