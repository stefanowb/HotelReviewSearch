Traveled in August with my family of 4. Booked a 2 room condo on the second floor of the Banyan building. Was worried about the lack of air conditioning, as another reviewer mentioned, this place was built to use those trade winds. If you opened the vents and windows up, winds whipped through that unit. The unit was huge, jacuzzi bathtub was a bonus. Had a full kitchen with appliances, pots, dishes, washer and dryer in the hallway, two full bathrooms and a TV in each bedroom and the living room. The Banyan pool was great, had a fun \"natural\" feel with a waterfall, rocks and plants growing all around. Lawai beach is directly across the small road and has amazing snorkeling. Went almost every morning, before heading out for our days activities. Ate on the lanai for breakfast and dinner, watching the sun rise and set. The hotel is set up so many of their rooms have an ocean view. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Kids enjoyed the movie rentals and the mini golf. Internet access was sketchy, but you're in Hawaii - unplug. Hotel is easy to get to and short drives to most sites from Wiamea Canyon to Kapaa. This condo was so comfortable and kid friendly, it really made our vacation, too bad their website doesn't do it justice.", "title": "Wonderful condo, amazing snorkeling", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "micdenton", "date": "October 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20884033, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Close to beach with great snorkeling", "disliked": "\u2014 Spotty internet service"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My new husband and i were fortunate to receive a vacation package to The Lawaii Beach Resort as a wedding gift.

All we had to get were the groceries. The condo was also very large and so comfortable. No AC, which would not be needed as the wonderful fans with the continuous ocean breezes kept us comfortable. The staff was extremely pleasant.and helpful. Snorkeling is great. Lots of wonderful places to see, tons of great activities, and lots of great restaurants.

Check-in was super easy, the resort is in excellent condition and the rooms are spacious and very large. They have a big screen TVs(although we did not even turn it on), lots of cooking utensils, nice clean large bathrooms and a staff so friendly I felt like I was family(the good kind). The active construction near the resort is completed so you cannot hear it however the dust barrier is still up. We stayed in the Coral building which has a parking garage behind it which is convenient because we could drive up to our floor. We did have an ocean view but it was because we were on the 3rd floor. I do not think the 1st and 2nd floors have an ocean view although I am not sure. Our 1 bed room condo could have easily accommodated 4 \u2013 2 on the sleeper sofa and 2 in the bedroom(there were only 2 of us). If you want an unobstructed view of the Ocean get a room in the Banyan or Alli building and at least on the 2nd floor or higher. The workout facility was nice, free wireless in 2 public areas it would have been nice to have wireless in the rooms even if we had to pay for it, the room internet access is via Ethernet cable. In the morning depending on how late you want o sleep the Coral building can be a little noisey, about 930am is when people start getting up and the noise bounces off the parking structure. Usually we had the windows open which is probably why we could hear the noise \u2013 equally loud were the waves from across the street so we can\u2019t complain.", "user": "Mike-5472", "date": "March 26, 2009", "id": 26842916}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Exceeded Expectations - Almost", "text": "If you are looking for the \u201ctouristy\u201d Hawaiian experience I would not recommend a condo, we have been to Hawaii many times and sometimes we feel like going to a hotel and being pampered(Hyatt); on other occasions I want a little more privacy, more space and the ability to cook my own food(breakfast, lunch or dinner).

We were traveling with my parents and another couple. We arrived at 1PM and were told that our room was not ready. We were able to check our belongings with the bell staff and ventured out for some shopping. The resort is very centrally located being within a few miles of all of the major restaurants (Roy's, Tidepools, etc). We returned at 4 PM and were able to check in. My parents arrived a bit later and they realized upon check-in that we were given the wrong room as we were supposed to have two bathrooms in our unit (they had booked the unit through our timeshare). Our original room was not too impressive - in building 1 (I believe...it's a bit fuzzy now) on the first floor with a walkout to the pool. It was dark with a very small living room. Bathroom was small and claustrophobic. The whole place was tiny and dark....I wanted to go back to our other resort when I walked in. The 2nd bedroom has a perfect set-up for kids as it is two twin beds; however, not as ideal for two couples sharing a room. My parents went to speak to the front desk and they were incredibly unhelpful about the mix-up - letting them know that they had no other rooms and we were going to have to deal with it until the next day. The other couple traveling with us had received a gorgeous unit in the middle building - it was an owners unit they had been upgraded to.
