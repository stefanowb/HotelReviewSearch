I chose this hotel because of previous reviews. I realize that I tend to be a picky person when it comes to hotels, but I would still rate this hotel as \"just OK\". The outside looks decent enough, aside from all the weeds everywhere. When we were checking in the desk clerk somehow felt that he needed to let us know that he was called in on his day off and wasn't happy about it. The lobby, hallways, and rooms are average. The things that turned me off were the pillow cases with holes in them, the bottom sheet that barely held on, and worst of all the blanket was actually a foam rubber blanket (dark harvest gold color). I did not even want to touch it. Maybe it used to be a Veluxe blanket and lost all its fuzz or something, I'ver never seen anything like it before. The towels in the bathroom were very thin, and the cleanliness was just so-so. We didn't bother with breakfast and just ate at the Denny's next door. All in all there is not a big selection of hotels in Benson, but I'm glad we only had to stay the one night.", "title": "Just OK", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Ivy61", "date": "April 6, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3340376}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2002", "text": "This is an above-average Days Inn property.

The lobby was very nice, but when we got to our room, it was dirty. There were dead bugs on the bathroom floor and it looked as if the mirror and surfaces had not been washed in quite some time. The carpet obviously had not been vacuumed. There were water bottles, etc., in there from the prior occupants. When I mentioned this to the desk clerk, I was told their housekeeping staff had quit and so he didn't know the condition of the rooms.
