It is a bit unexpected to find a hotel of this type in such a remote location. The hotel offers a great lakeside view from the modern, clean and well equipped rooms. The atrium lobby is quite impressive with its glass evelevators and water works. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Besides the spa facilities, the top floor restaurant with splendid views offers organic food of the hightest quality. The breakfast buffet is absolutely outstanding and it was too bad I could not enjoy for longer due to the nature of a business trip.", "title": "Great hotel!", "user": "redwrangler8", "date": "August 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37017331}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I would consider this hotel a must go and if it was not such a long trip from where I currently live I would definitely take my wife there for a nice get away weekend.", "title": "Relaxed, easy-going, great facilities and helpful staff.", "user": "Independent66", "date": "June 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 31368429}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Zeulenroda"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 10, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 14}, "aka": "Bio-Seehotel Zeulenroda Germany", "slim_ranking": 0.5}
