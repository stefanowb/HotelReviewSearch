This hotel is a great place if you are a solo traveller, travelling with a partner or friends or with a family. There is a really nice terrace on the top floor which operates an 'honesty bar' -a cold beer here was a welcome relief after walking the hot dusty streets of Stone Town! The breakfasts here are also very good. Every morning we were offered a fresh selection of fruit, bread, eggs and juice, which is taken on the terrace. The location of the hotel is fantastic- within a few minutes walk from Forodhani night market, and in a nice part of the Hurumzi area. Reserving a room was easy- we sent an email to the hotel and then paid a small deposit using paypal. The hotel also has free wifi, which you can access either from your room or the terrace.", "title": "Friendly gem in the heart of Stone Town", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MJ_1984", "date": "February 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 98140081}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "One of the main highlights though of this place were the friendly staff who worked here, and the owner Lisenka.

Room rates include a nice breakfast of eggs, breads, and fruits, juice and coffee. The breakfast room is at the top of the hotel and has a great view of the city. Booking was easy via email. There is no restaurant at the hotel but there are restaurants within easy walking distance. We particularly enjoyed buying food from the vendors at Forodhani Gardens each evening.
