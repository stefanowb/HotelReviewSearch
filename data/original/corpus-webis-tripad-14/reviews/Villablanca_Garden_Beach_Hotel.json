The pool and gardens are very nice and it's located right across the street from the beach just south of town. It's a 30 minute -or-so walk into town. From villablanca we went into town and also to Chankanaab Park for snorkeling. I spent hours snorkeling on the beach just across from the hotel.

Bought a package through Papa Hogs. I upgraded to the superior room as I wasn't sure if there would be two or three people at the time of booking. I live in mainland Mexico for two months during the year and the States for the rest so I know what to expect, and love, when booking in Mexico. Check in was fast. People at the desk had little personality and DIDN'T SPEAK SPANISH! which was a bit suprising but we got the upstairs room as I had requested. When moving luggage to our room the bell boy gently removed a snake that was sleeping on the cart that was to hold our luggage. The room was large and had a limited view of the ocean. It was clean, well equipped and more than I had anticipated. There is high speed wireless internet that works when it feels like it. Papa Hogs let us use theirs since we were staying with them and could easily pick up the signal from our room. The hotel has limited services like room service. It is available during hours that you really don't need it and they charge 15% more than if you went to the restaurant to get it yourself. Room was clean, no bugs (amazing for Mexico), with full size fridge to keep things in so there will be no bugs. Iguanas outside to enjoy from the beautiful gardens, dive hooks outside the room to dry your equipment, phone, and air conditioning that worked minimally (remember it's August) so I had to leave it on (which I don't like to do) during the day in order to have the room cool enough to sleep in at night. The hotel is set back enough from the street so that you don't get TOO much noise except from the bar across the street and that wasn't nightly. It was a bit far from town $5 taxi each way every time you want to eat. We ate mostly at the bar next to Papa Hogs (they serve PH's food) as it was convenient. The restaurant at VB is outstanding. Only ate there at night, I think the other restaurant serves during the day. Nothing interesting on the menu.
