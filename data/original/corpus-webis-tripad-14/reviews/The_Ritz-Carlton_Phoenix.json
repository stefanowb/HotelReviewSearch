We had an executive suite which had plenty of room for us (2 adults, 2 young children). The room was clean and had decent fixtures (tv's were dated). We also had club privlages, even though we were not on the club floor. The service was excellent during our stay. Everybody was friendly and professional. The hotel is in a central Phoenix location and access to main roads is a breeze. The hotel was clean, except for the pool area which had cigarette butts all around it (hard to criticize the hotel and not the disgusting, thoughtless cigarette smokers). The pool was odd in that it was so small. You would think they would expand it ? The misters were nice, when they were on. One note on the club level - it was mediocre compared to other Ritz club levels in terms of presentation and decor (not bad, just not the best).", "title": "Nice Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "aristophanesny", "date": "August 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8516521}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Location!", "text": "This Ritz is well located on Camelback in Phoenix. for what tht's worth, Camelback is an endless array of shopping malls.
