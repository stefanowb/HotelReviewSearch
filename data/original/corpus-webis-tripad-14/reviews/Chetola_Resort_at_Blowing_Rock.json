Last summer we rented through Blowing Rock Resort Rentals, which I would never recommend to anyone. We checked in on a Sunday evening at 9pm and the unit hadn't been cleaned. Visibly soiled towels in bathrooms, no clean bedding, not a roll of toilet tissue. This for a condo unit we were paying $300+/night for. A cleaning company did come the next day at 1:30 in the afternoon. We requested less than one nights rental be refunded ($250.00) but Blowing Rock Resort Rentals refused and to this day have not compensated us to any degree.
