When we began staying here, we were pleased with the service and amenities and satisfied with the concierge lounge. Over the years, all of this has declined, especially the lounge. This is a premium amenity, and in every other hotel it is treated as such. At this Marriott, it is treated as a way to dispose of left over food from the hotel restaurant. The food was obviously old, in one case we were served cups of moldy fruit, and seemed like it had been stuck in a microwave and thrown in a warming tray. One night \"hors d'ouerves\" consisted of floppy, lukewarm fried foods that had been served the day before at a banquet. I brought my sister up for drinks from the honor bar one night while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive for dinner, and the evening concierge (who in general was quite nice and fawned over my daughter) commented loudly to another group that it was inappropriate to bring guests in who were not staying on the concierge floor and they really needed to do something about that. I am fine with this, however I don't understand why this couldn't have been said to me, privately rather than passive-aggressively gossiped to other people. I have been a patron for many years and would expect at least that much courtesy. There was a smell of backed up sewage on the top two floors for several hours one night. Aside from the lounge, a pizza we ordered from room service was completely inedible, (cold and hard as a rock) and twice a maid came while I was in the room, said she would come back later, and never came back. We visited the pool twice, and both times had to go to the front desk and ask for towels, then wait 45 minutes for someone to bring them. Internet access isn't free, common to the high end chains but ridiculous when you get it for free at most McDonalds. In the positive category: The staff in general is very polite, the view from the concierge lounge is beautiful, the pool area is nice and warm. However, I could go down the street to the Hampton and get the same service, free breakfast, free wi-fi, and comparable amenities for a fraction of the price. The only thing that keeps me at the Marriott at this point is my huge surplus of rewards points.", "title": "This hotel has gone downhill", "user": "emiller4060", "date": "March 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154115223}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed 3 nights for a conference.

If you want a view, ask for it--my second-floor room overlooked a wall and rooftop. The lobby staff were extremely friendly and helpful, as was the bartender (but drinks were very expensive).
