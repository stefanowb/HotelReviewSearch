The room lacked a coffee maker, but had the coffee accessories, there were large black hairs in the tub and the TV was very dated. However we did order room service since we got to the hotel late and the food was suprisingly good. We order a Mac and cheese for my son and when they viewed the order they sent up a beverage free of charge for my son since we hadn't ordered one. The next morning we went to the bfast buffet which was included in our room rate and was surprised by the selection. There was hot food as well as fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt with various toppings and decent coffee. Parking was outrageous of course, but it is at all downtown hotels. Overall the room was a bit dissapointing, but the staff/ service was great.", "user": "trippinmama", "date": "August 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 76220635}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We had a great stay at the Doubletree. The location was perfect... close to Magnificent Mile, close to Navy Pier, not too far from Millenium Park either. We were on the 6th floor, and had no problems with waiting long for elevators at all. Rooms are spacious, plenty of room for our family. Pool was fun... a little cold... but felt great given the hot weather! It was a good size pool. We enjoyed watching the Navy Pier fireworks from the pool deck Wednesday eveningn. We felt we got a great price for our 4 nights there. Although everyone was friendly the bellhops were by far the friendliest people there... all of them were so friendly and helpful. We saw them throughout our stay and they alway greeted us and asked the kids how their days were - such great service. One noticed my son's socce shirt and had a nice conversation with him about soccer and the World Cup. My son thought that was so cool that a \"grown up\" would want to talk to him about that!!!

The location can't be beat if you're looking to be near the magnificent mile or Navy Pier. We were traveling in a group with family and young kids, and got a great price on our two rooms, although parking fees are very pricey (as is typical in a big city) which kind of cancels out that good feeling. :) The hotel lobby is very trendy and nice looking, and everyone at the front desk and concierge desks were very friendly. Our kids had a blast swimming in the fifth floor rooftop pool... and sitting on the window seat overlooking the city and all the action happening twenty floors below! Overall, we had a good experience. There were some quirks that are worth mentioning/knowing, which prevented me from giving this hotel a higher rating. First, the hotel does not pre-block rooms, so when we checked in, even though both rooms were reserved under the same name and credit card, we were not able to get rooms next to one another or even on the same floor without giving up our \"view\" of the lake and settling for one handicapped room next to the elevator and ice machine. Kind of a bummer considering it was a special birthday trip. Second, the elevators are very busy and it takes a while to catch one... so we felt the higher up you are staying in the hotel, the better. I felt really bad for the people on the lower floors who were trying to make it to the Lobby. People on floors five, six, and seven almost always had to wait for another car because the elevator was already full. Third, housekeeping knocked on our door at 8:45 AM to see if we \"needed anything.\" It just so happened that we were traveling with children and were awake... and housekeeping had not left any coffee packets in the room (the other room we rented had no coffee maker at all) so we took them up on it, but if we had been on a trip where I'd wanted to sleep in, I'd have been pretty upset. I double checked with the housekeeper to make sure she hadn't mistaken our room for some other room that had actually called them, and she said \"no.\" I've worked in a hotel before, and honestly, my impression was that she was just fishing for extra tips. We also never got the extra towels we requested with our reservation, but I'm betting that was due to the last minute room change assignment made at the front desk.", "title": "Great Location, Nice Hotel, but a few quirks...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CentralCoastTravelr", "date": "August 5, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 73913710}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Attended a conference here and was pleased with the location.
