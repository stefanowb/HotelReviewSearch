Being used to nice hotels, I imagined a five star hotel to offer me basic standards such as a good breakfast, here the breakfast was tastless, the orange juice was water with sirup ( in a country where orange come cheap), the all-inclusive deal is aweful, when you order a bellini, it comes with water. The room was basic, and you had to keep the window open ( which means no light in the room when closed) to havel light. Bath products were cheap, service was not good at all, there was a lack of staff ( same people at the bar and in the restaurant). The beach was good though, large and clean, as well as the swimming pool, but dont expect anything on this side of Creta, even though the East ( Elounda, Aghios Nikolaos) is much nicer and the St Nicolas Bay hotel really deserves its 5star rating.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Samuel-D", "date": "August 22, 2004", "id": 2481304}], "location": {"country": "Greece", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 13, "average": 16, "very good": 31, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 27}, "aka": "Mythos Palace Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Mythos Palace Resort & Spa is located in Kavros Georgioupolis Chania Crete, built in a extent of 30000 m2, from which the 20000 m2 are gardens and communal spaces.
