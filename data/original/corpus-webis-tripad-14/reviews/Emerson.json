We had a great time. The Inn and rooms are beautifully decorated. Everything is clean and immaculate. Our room was the Regal Suite, complete with fireplace, flat screen TV, DVD, ipod dock, sitting area and deck. The bath was great. Whirlpool jazuzzi, jetted showers. The spa was quiet and peaceful. Treatments were expertly performed. I will definately return in the future. Perfect for a weekend away from the kiddies. Please do not confuse this with the \"Lodge\". The Emerson is an adult only Inn, The \"lodge\" some posters are referring to is a separate hotel, unrelated to The Emerson. I only can comment on the Inn, and it was wonderful in every way.

Great spa and gym and really lovely staff. I know of no other place within a 2 hour drive of NYC that could give you the same experience. The economy must not be easy on them, and as a result their prices were slashed from 2008 to 2009 - we even got a free third night.

We checked out the room (a \"suite\") and it was the most beautiful room I'd ever stayed in. The bathroom was larger than a London hotel: sunken jacuzzi bathtub, marble, separate shower with 4 water sources. The room was huge and beautiful with a couch and electric fire place. We spent a lot of time in the spa center. If you are staying in the hotel, you can go there and enjoy the hottub, saunas (wet and dry), yoga room (sin classes), workout room, and beautiful sitting area with tea and fresh fruit all day long for free. There were free bikes and we went bike riding around the area.

Though we initially had a difficult time deciding where to go, with so many options just a short drive from Manhattan, we were very happy with our choice of the Emerson. As we wanted to get the best value for our money, we chose the \"Ladies of Luxury\" package and a Royal suite at the Inn. This was the perfect all inclusive package for us, and it had everything we wanted and even some things we didn't even know we wanted as far as the treatments were concerned. (I was dubious about the full body sugar scrub but was thrilled with the results!) We had some reservations before arrival that there were going to be a lot of restrictions because of our package, but the Emerson just kept saying, \"Yes\" to every request. Alcoholic beverages are not included in the package, but that's about it. We had our choice of the full menu at every meal, all gratuities were included, and the food was terrific, especially dinner at the Phoenix. I should mention that we went mid-week, when the Inn was at low occupancy. We received serious VIP treatment, but something tells me that all the guests receive the same regardless of when they visit. To sum it up, all of the staff we encountered were extremely hospitable and efficient, the spa treatments were divine, and the facilities and accomodations were lovely, comfortable, and well maintained.
