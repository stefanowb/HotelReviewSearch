For our family, it was no big deal. The hotel does provide shampoo, body wash, lotion, toothpaste, toothbrush, razor and shaving cream. There is bottled water in the bathroom, by the coffee maker and in the mini-fridge. Our refrigerator was stocked each day. One hint that might be helpful. When you settle into your room, go to the pool area and get your beach towels for the next day. If you wait until the morning, you won't be able to \"save\" a good spot.

The resort itself was absolutely beautiful...very clean and an amazing beach. We had booked a total of 6 rooms between the 12 of us and our family has age ranges of 74 years old to 8 years old. We had three main problems with this resort. 1.) The food was not very good....not much American food and what they did have was pretty poor, especially at the specialty restaraunts. You can tell that they are trying to please the Americans, however there is still an overwhelming European and Asian flair to the cuisine.The Market Grill did have steaks, burgers, and hot dogs but the buns were too hard to chew. Again I have to say that the specialty restaraunts were a HUGE disappointment (even compared to 3 star hotels I've been to in Cancun!) Problem 2.) The rooms were clean and spacious, however having 6 different rooms, we all experienced a variety of problems such as phones, tv's & air conditioning not working in all of our rooms throughout the week...my nephew actually had to move to 3 different rooms, each one every other day due to a different problem (including the ceiling falling into the bathroom in their first room.) As far as our own room, we too expereinced an unusual problem. We were told upon arrival that our room would be ready in an hour...three hours later we were finally taken to it and the bellhop opened the door using my husband's key, to find a room of four undressed people who were drinking and smoking. They said they had not even checked out yet, and here we were standing there with our keys that had beed coded to that room. They did vacate the room immediately, but the maids still needed to get it cleaned so they put us in a temporary room which was hot and reeked of cigarette smoke. (We came to find out later that there is no such thing as no smoking rooms even though that is what we booked through Apple Vacations) We ended up in a totally different room which was fine in most part. My parents who are in their 70's were moved to a third floor room (all stairs) when their A/C went out on the 6th day. They tried to tell us that the A/C was out in the entire complex, but we knew better becasue some of our rooms were at 67 degrees at the time while theirs' was 90! Be careful to double check everything they tell you! Unfortunately, we did experience one day of electrical problems where the power was on and off throughout the day and the rooms got very hot and humid. On our 5 th day, there was no running water all day so you could not flush the toilets or take showers...I felt very sorry for a bridal party who had no water all day for their 3 O'clock wedding on the beach! Problem 3.) Inconsistincy was a another huge problem. You never got the same drink twice anywhere...even if it was made by the same person ten minutes later....this was true of everything from the food we ordered to the answers we got relating to any questions we had.......we finally ended up just laughing about it becasue it was soooo ridiculous! All in all, I must say that they do try to please you...the servers and activity staff for the kids were all very friendly and attentive. I especially recommend Geronimo for activity questions, Carlos for good waitor service, and Natalie at the concierge desk.....all of them will do their best to help you. I always like to end on a positive note, so for those of you who are American...I was impressed by their attempt to celebrate the 4th Of July by having (a poor attempt, but none the less, an attempt) at a Bar-B-Q and fireworks!

The weather, for the most part was cooperative, although we did encounter some heavy showers at times but then again, it was their rainy season. We both felt the hotel grounds were beautiful and immaculate. The specialty restaurants were reminiscent of New York and South Beach. There was \"new age\" music everywhere with aromatic incence to soothe your mood everywhere you went, pool and beach included. We opted for the \"Royal Service\" with an ocean view room. Our room wasn't yet ready when we arrived but when it was; we were disappointed and immediately requested a change. Our terrace faced a palm tree that, while beatiful, overwhelmingly covered the partial view to the beach and it felt more like a garden view than an ocean view. We were told that the hotel was 100% booked by the reception staff, however, the rest of the hotel staff said they were 50-75% booked, so we felt we were getting the run around especially since we noticed most ocean view rooms seemed unoccupied. When we finally got our new room it was close to 6 in the evening. By then we were so tired all we had time for was dinner. The specialty restaurants were very nicely decorated and the service was excellent. Gabi Beach, Vento and The Market Grill are a must. The food was superb. We tipped most of time just because we felt we got great service but not that we had to. The staff was friendly and smiled all the time. Suggestions: book your lunch and dinner reservations when you first check in along with your beach palapas as they get assigned to no-shows daily and then you're out of luck. Don't depend on the butlers as they never came through. The beach beds were awesome and the so were the drinks. It was top shelf all the way. Entertainment was good as was room service.
