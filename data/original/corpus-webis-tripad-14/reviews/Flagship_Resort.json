The room was clean, bathroom was clean, and the service was above excellent, they wanted to come in on both days and change the sheets and clean the room, they called several times to do this, that I had to say I'll call them back when I leave the room. We were on the 25 floor and the veiw was breathtaking at night and at sunrise. I was really scared to stay here after hearing the terrible reviews, but to my surprise it was nothing like what I read. I also never had a problem coming up and downstairs the elevator was always open on the lobby floor to take me right to the suite. I had no problem getting a cab to take me to any of the casinos...its not far at all, and on a nice day you could walk. I would definitely stay there again. Try it for yourself, don't go by what these horrible reveiws say. they were also really nice about checking out later than 11:00am.

Well, it seems (since I didn't ask when booking) that the regular rooms don't look anything like those on the timeshare presentation. Yes, with this package the room we got was equipped with living/dining room area and kitchenette with appliances/untensils, but it was quite old in look/style. The room could use new everything, especially carpet - which is what really caused the room to look bad. The carpet had stains and the balcony door wasn't secure - not that anyone could climb to the 30th floor to get us.

We decided on the Flagship because it was $210/night while other hotels were more than $400/night. The staff were very nice. We were on the 27th floor with a great view of the beach and other hotels in the distance. We had a 1 bedroom suite with a pull out couch, kitchenette and balcony. The decor seemed to be 1980ish, but it was clean and served our purpose. We checked out the pool and there were activities posted there, but we didn't partake in any. Like I said we were there just to sleep. We did have dinner in the restaurant. The food was not that great but the windows overlooked the beach. The hotel is not within walking distance to any casinos so we took a cab that was waiting outside. They do offer a free shuttle to the Sands, but we didn't want to be on a schedule. The surrounding area is not that nice. All in all it's not bad for the price even if you have to take a cab to the casinos.

Normally, we book well in advance and get a decent rate at the Sheraton Convention Center, but being it was only a few days before, the Sheraton and all the other better hotels were $300-$400 for one night. We decided to try the Flagship for $159 for the night. Well . . . we got what we paid for. It was off the boardwalk. When we got there at first it looked like a hotel for the homeless, with people hanging out all over the place and we both did not feel all that safe. Check in was fine, and the room was clean. It had an efficiency set up (which we did not need). Anyway, we were on the 18th floor which had a nice view. We went to a show at the Taj then gambled and got back to the room at about 2 AM. Well, we got absolutely NO SLEEP. The pipes in the ceiling over the tub banged ALL NIGHT LONG! At 9 AM we rushed, took a shower and ran out. I went to the counter to check out and told the desk about the banging pipes and the response was, \"we'll have to have maintenance look at that.\" Not an apology nothing!

I stayed with two of my girlfriends, so as females we were nervous about the surrounding neighborhood. We were PLEASANTLY surprised. The room was adorable, cute little terrace, the view was GORGEOUS! I would recommend this hotel to people who are just staying a night, who are content with a \"decent\" room, and who want a nice place to hang your coat at a VERY inexpensive rate. We were offered $75 off our price if we took the timeshare tour. This is my only negative, bc we were up at 10 and they hadn't spoken to us for about a half hour when we decided to screw it and go back upstairs. BUT, we were told the timeshare and the hotel are two separate entities, so if you want to save the money, be prepared to spend upwards of an hour and a half there. Other than that, this was not the scary ghetto I had imagined as described by previous writers.

The restaurant on the 7th floor was fine, with a fantastic view of the boardwalk and ocean. Lunch was decent, exactly what you'd expect (and a good bloody mary to boot). The location is no worse than any other hotel in Atlantic City...and better than many. The neighborhood looks like it has been revitalized, with some expensive duplexes sprouting all around the hotel. The room was big. Strange odor which we assumed was some kind of cleaning agent, but otherwise no complaints. Just don't dirty the dishes--$50 fee if you don't clean them! I reserve the right to complain if for some inexplicable reason we don't get our security deposit back.

With the balcony door slightly open, I could hear the sound of the surf hitting the jetty below. The neighborhood is in the process of a facelift and when completed will be quite charming. There are many rundown blocks between the Flagship and the casinos and we did not walk in these areas. The Flagship shuttle to the Sands proved convenient and dependable and we used it several times. The jitney stops a half block away and was also a convenient alternative. Our room was large and of modern decor. The only problem we encountered was a practically clogged toilet on arrival.
