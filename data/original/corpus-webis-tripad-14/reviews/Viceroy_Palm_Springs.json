The Viceroy came first and impressed us with its laid-back style and friendly service. Maybe it was a little too laid-back - sometimes it felt like they were playing at running a hotel and had got a bit bored with the game - when we arrived they'd run out of tea for example - how can a hotel in the middle of town run out of TEA? The decor looks quite good but it all feels a bit cheaply done and doesn't quite hang together. The website does them no favours because it makes you expect so much more. There are great little touches though.. like gallons of free sunblock around the pool, lovely toiletries, heaps of fluffy clean towels. The staff is generally delightful and the price is quite good value for what you get. I would go again if times were tight If not I'd splash out on a villa at the (much maligned) Parker - which was a genuinely hip, totally relaxed and truly luxurious experience.

The Viceroy succeeds at everything it intends to be, but it is not the Hyatt or the Marriott; you will not find endless acres of landscaped grounds, a golf course, or 5 restaurants.
