Well located for skiing opposite a drag lift that connects to the central chair lift, it is truly a ski out hotel. Our suite of rooms was warm, cosy, clean, and very comfortable. The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly sorting out restaurants, skiing lessons, ski passes, and taxis for us. They even helped us negotiate special meals for our impossibly fussy daughter. The breakfast buffet had everything we could possibly need. Best of all though was the wonderful Spa facilities that really helped sooth the aches and pains of a hard days skiing. Soothing and relaxing. The whole design hotel was an oasis of calm and tranquility. If you are going to Obertauern this is definitely THE hotel to stay in.", "title": "Fabulous Hotel", "user": "BillNoble", "date": "January 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 91554296}], "location": {"country": "Austria", "region": "Austrian Alps", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Obertauern"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 2, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 4}, "slim_ranking": 0.238095238095, "description": "Manggei, Obertauern\u2019s first Design Hotel, impresses you with its simplicity and naturalness. Breakfast \u201conly\u201d allows you freedom to plan your day without other meal commitments. Design is interpreted in Manggei in various ways: the natural materials from the region, the modern and yet alpine architecture that blends harmoniously with the surrounding rock faces, the flexible room arrangement allowing a variety of combinations and the refreshingly clean lines of the interior design. These are just some of the features which will make for a very special holiday experience."}
