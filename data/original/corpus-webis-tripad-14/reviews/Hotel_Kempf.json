It is in the wonderful city of Colmar, France. The town of Colmar is right out of a story book and should not be missed. The Hotel Kempf @ 1 avenue de la R\u00e9publique - 68000 Colmar is no way a two star, it is a run down Hotel the makes a NYC subway bathroom look clean. If I was back in Collage backpacking around then maybe this run down place with ripped rags for towels would do. But as a 30 something traveler I would much rather have the room that is clean and without bugs. So for my opinion stay away from the Hotel Kempf", "title": "WHAT A DUMP", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Kidney20A", "date": "October 29, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 2794126}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Alsace", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 0}, "aka": "Kempf Hotel Colmar", "slim_ranking": 0.833333333333}
