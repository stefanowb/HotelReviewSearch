Booking through the hotel directly, our room was $100 a night, breakfast included. The staff were always effcient and friendly, especially when we checked in at 1 in the morning. Looking at the floor plan, it appeared as if our room (328) was one of the largest rooms on the floor....not quite a suite, but definitely larger than a standard room, with almost its own seating/work area and entrance way. The room its self was nicely furnished and very comfortable. It faced over a pedestrian street at the rear of the hotel (which was never nosiy) where there were restaurants, cafes, shops, and a Rema 1000 grocery store which was perfect for stocking up on food. The heated floor and heated towel rack in the large bathroom were great touches, as was the Bj\u00f6rn Borg soap provided (which smelled very nice!).", "title": "A wonderful hotel.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Kosmonaute", "date": "February 19, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6813815, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything.", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing."}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006", "text": "The breakfast buffet was excellent....lots of choices and very fresh.

The room we had was very small, dimly lit---hard to read. The pant press didn't work, and hadn't for a while according to the front desk. The breakfast room includede in the rate, had dirty dishes on most tables, and the lady looking after it kept going outside to smoke! The location wasn't that good, didn't appear to have any restaurants in the area. We moved the next day to the SAS Radisson Norge. Got a large bright room, excellent breakfast, FOR THE SAME PRICE as the Augustin. The location is on a pedestrian mall, 5 minutes from the harbour and 10 minutes walk to the train station.
