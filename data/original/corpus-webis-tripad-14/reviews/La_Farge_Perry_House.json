Nothing prepared us for the beauty of the house, the quality of the rooms and the superb level of service. Everything about this establishment is excellent, and the innkeeper, Midge Knerr, is a superb host. As a former chef with many years experience Midge provided convivial and sumptuous breakfasts that surpassed many we have experienced in 5 star hotels around the world. At La Farge Perry the attention to detail is outstanding, and the bathrooms benefit from fresh towels and Molton Brown toiletries every day. We stayed initially for three days and then moved on. However, our next B & B was nowhere near the standard of La Perry so we sacrificed our prepayment there and moved back to La Perry again for another two nights. I travel the world regularly on business staying in four and five star hotels, but can wholeheartedly endorse La Farge Perry House as one of the finest and most enjoyable places I have ever stayed in.", "title": "We will be repeat customers!", "user": "ljardin39", "date": "July 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114985098}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My boyfriend and I wanted to get away for a long weekend and have always heard wonderful things about Newport.

She always stays there when she is working in Newport, and had suggested that I would love it, and i do. While there is no B&B in Newport that it is inexpensive, the LaFarge Perry House is a tremendous value for the charge. Innkeeper Midge is a gracious and talented hostess, plying us at breakfast with hot coffee and teas, banana pancakes, eggs benedict, scones, beautiful fresh fruit salad, or, other special requests. She even had soy milk on hand for my daughter's cereal. Each room that I or my sister has stayed in have been special and well appointed. This weekend was especially hot, and the air conditioning kept us as cool as we wanted (and my husband likes it cold!). This special place is walking distance to restaurants, shopping and wharf, and just a short distance to Cliff Walk and the Mansions.
