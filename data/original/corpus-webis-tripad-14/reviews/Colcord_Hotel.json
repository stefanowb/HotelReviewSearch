We enjoyed a nice dinner in the hotel restaurant. The waitress recommended the pork and it was excellent, as was our appetizer. Cocktails were well done and very reasonable. We came back to the bar after the ballgame and enjoyed it immensely. The staff were very personable. It wasn't busy so they had time to chat a bit. It is clearly a great hotel for business travelers. The bed was very comfy too. The only annoyance which, sadly, really detracted from the Colcord's image was the failure to pick up room service trays that littered the hallway on our floor - and I don't mean just one or two trays!. Trays were by the elevator and practically outside every room on the floor - when we checked in around 2:30pm (the maids were still cleaning) , again at midnight and still there the next morning.
