Access to the zona requires passing a check-point. The vegetation is beautiful, lush green tropical and even contains some remarkable animals such as \"oso hormiguero\", I saw one cross the road. The road leading to the hotel is extremely steep and cobbled, have never seen something the like anywhere else. Once you pass the modest appearing entrance of the hotel, the lobby and the sight of the bay is overwhelming. The buildings are carved into the steep slope, including four swimming pools and a lovely and well groomed garden. We received a large room with full view of the bay (although it is not the open ocean, it is instantly relaxing) with a well sized balcony. Stylishly furnished and utilities including large flat screen TV and an ironing board, all working well, almost. Some drawbacks in order to be objective were: coffee not complimentary, but the (only one) sachet of powder cost about EUR 3, no ashtray on balcony, no slippers. The first night, only one glass, one cup, and three (not four) cushions, as if room were prepared for single and not double occupancy. That was corrected immediately after complaint. One morning, there was no warm water, but defect repaired within hours. To the delights: The two king size beds were very comfortable, housekeeping excellent. All staff without exception were very friendly and attentive. The food, specially the breakfast with eggs made to order was excellent, the restaurant down at the seaside is very romantic and a real gem, at times there is live music there, e.g. mariachis. The beach is private and very pleasant as the waves are quite moderate. The bay is also ideal for water sports, available directly at the small beach, e.g. aquamoto. What may not attract everyone is the absence of entertainment such as bars, discos, etc., but there is plenty of that in nearby Acapulco (about 100 peso for a taxi). If you are smoker, there are quite a lot of places where smoking is permitted, including the lobby bar and the terraces of the restaurants. To conclude, I would look forward to return to the place just for laying back and relaxing and enjoying.", "title": "Secluded location in a bay almost of its own", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "February 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 54946217}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for one week in December 2009. From the moment we arrived at the entrance the bell hop just grabbed our bags without even asking if we would like help. This hotel is always nickel and dimeing it. The location is down the side of the mountain on a very steep winding rought road, so you are totaly captive. You can not walk because of the steepness. They have their own taxi drivers (which were good), but charge $20. to get out. When you take a taxi back to the hotel it is much cheaper. They charge $4.00 for a small bottle of water so we bought water and fruit at Costco. When we tried to bring it in they said, \"you can't bring that in and you can't put it in our fridge.\" My husband told them he wanted to speak to the manager and he would not use their fridge. I am diabetic and need snacks etc. They finally agreed. They have you captive and want you to have to buy at their high prices. In the restaurant the American breakfast is $15., twice the cost of the Mexican breakfast. All of tourists are Mexican. On check out, they accused us of taking a chocolate bar from the fridge or maybe water they said. We never use anything from the fridge. The cleaning staff was nice though. You could get internet in the room for a price and a long cord stretched across the bed to the table in the middle of the room. We ordered a hamburger by room service one evening and clearly asked for it to be well done. They brought it all pink inside. We did not use the pools or beach so can not comment on that.

I don't know where to start let start with check in process we arrived to the hotel around 10:30am and go to check in with the reception we booked Camino Real Club Room which suppose to be private check in , complimentary drink for pre dinner and much more service which is come with the room type that we paid extra on the hotel website so we got none of those service at all we only had breakfast included -- Receptionist said come back at 3:00pm no explanation or give us any more information about the room except if you want the room now we have the suite room available but you have to pay USD 200 + 17 % per night on top of what we already paid for we decided not to take it because we paid more already for club room anyway we wait for almost 5 hours in the heat around 35 degrees with no air condition at all except in your own room we had lunch and back at 3:00pm the same reception said another 10 minutes it will be ready so we so tired and want to have a shower and rest in the end we entered our room at 3:25pm. We emailed the hotel before to book the spa treatment on the first day we arrive and we got confirmation back to our email so by the time we waiting for our room I went to the spa to let them know that we are here but still waiting for the room the first thing spa reception told us we got no booking I said impossible because I got an email from them they were little shocked then we were even more unhappy in the end the spa gave us 10 % discount which was ok but still didn't have time time that we booked -- massage itself was ok but the therapist can't speak English at all so no conversation from start to finish. Room is good size massive with all marble tiles but look very tiring especially in the bathroom see dust everywhere -- they got big LCD TV which we were very pleased to see we turn it on right the way ** none of the TV channel was in English ** all in Spanish which was even more worst for 3 days in our room or even in the bar no English -- lucky that they have internet so we can see the news but you pay for it ---only one good thing from the room is the view of the bay. All staff doesn't seem to be happy or helpful at all so it was a bad choice for us by chossing this hotel we read from trip advisor many times before we book it anyway we only go once only never go back to Acapulco again.. Food & Beverage was above average except first morning we had breakfast as our package was included so I ordered poached egg on toast after we finished one of the waitress gave us the bill for poached egg about USD 10 and we asked why because we had full buffet breakfast included she said poached egg not included only omelette and fired egg was included which is ridiculous we traveled all over the world never happened before so I said to them I will be happy to pay 50 % because I have not been told at all for extra charge in the end they don't want to charge because we were not been told. Another main problem is American Express Travel which is located in the hotel we emailed them regarding our transfer from the pier to hotel & hotel to airport so we paid very top price for it and when we saw the car we were shocked they charged us USD 90 from pier to hotel (normal car will cost around USD 55) even worst from hotel to Airport because the using Airport shuttle mini van to pick us up I asked how much they will cost if you book it direct they said about USD 20 per car but American Express Travel charge us USD 60 many more problems I can't explain enough anyway glad that we went but more glad that we leave. Everyone in the hotel and restaurant they helping you and serving you expecting TIP we gave them everytime but if you don't they won't be very happy to serve you next time. We feel like we are staying in somewhere not right for us next time we must book international brand hotels only because you know what you can expect. In Acapulco only have 2 international brand hotels which is Hyatt Regency in the city centre very very old hotel and run down area and Fairmont Acapulco Princess which is way out of town but close to the airport that's why we chose Camino Real Acapulco WRONG CHOICE another thing for this hotel it is located in the complex sharing the same entrance with some residential villa and the way to get into hotel is about 1500 metres from the main road and impossible to walk very very steep about 45 degrees angle you have to take taxi to get to main road.. Overall only view is good.

The food did not meet our expectations, but we do vacation to eat. We could not satisty our desire for Mexican food, being that Acapulco is the hot vacation spot for the mexican people which seem to prefer international cuisine and pasta. The view was fabulous! O.K. for the not so good, the coffee cup in the room was ringed with coffee, the blanket was stained with large spots, they charge 45 pesos daily for coffee to make in the room, (you can bring your own as well as other snacks, mondelo beer and so forth, but they do not allow it-so hide it.. Wal-mart and a grocery store on the way everythings in spanish of course). Although, the workout facilty was a little tired, with some equipment not working, the massage was great.
