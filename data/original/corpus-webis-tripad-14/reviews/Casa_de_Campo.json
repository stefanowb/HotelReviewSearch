Very peaceful and perfect. It's huge though. That's why each room comes with a golf cart. The beach was a ten minute golf cart ride but it was a beautiful drive. This resort is a golf lovers paradise. It has four golf courses, one of which is private. The teeth of the dog course was not open yet when we were there but we took a walk there and it's right on the ocean and quite beautiful. The spa was thoroughly enjoyable. Go with the inclusive plan because you can easily spend $300 for two for dinner. Breakfast and lunch would be very expensive too. The pools are small but they were never even close to being crowded. There is a nice swim up bar at the pool. I did not make it to the riding stables but I heard other guests raving about it. Despite the fact that the resort was completely sold out, I never felt over crowded. In fact, most of the the time I wondered where everyone was. Take the time to go,to altos de Chavon. You could drive your cart but it's easy to get lost there even though you get a map. Ask the front desk to arrange transportation and they are very good about it. That's what we ended up doing. There is really only one restaurant open for breakfast but it was very good and not crowded at all. The pancake station was the best. All kinds of homemade marmalades for toppings. My personal favorite was the pineapple. Don't be afraid or scared off by the size of this place. We found that we could be at the bar and have fun dancing and yet the next night go to a very quiet place. There is a disco at Altos de Chavon that is open quite late. Fly into la romana. It's ten minutes from the resort. In fact, the resort owns the airport. Casa de campo can arrange for transportation ahead of time. I wish I could have spent a few more days here. Try the Ron punch....made with Ron rum...the only thing I did not like was that if you drink out of the stocked fridge you pay extra. Also if you want a beach front place, this isn't it but the short golf cart drive to the beach is not bad and the beach is beautiful.
