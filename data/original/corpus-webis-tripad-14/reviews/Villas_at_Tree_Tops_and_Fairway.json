This place was old, run down and dirty! It was a complete waste of money. We had a 2 bedroom with a loft unit that looked as if it had not been cleaned in a month. Dust was all over the lamps, the glass table needed a good wipe down. The downstairs smelled like number two, upon arrival we found the bed in the master bedroom was half made, we also found there were dirty washcloths and towels left in the master bathroom. To say this place needs updating is an understatement, it needs a hand grenade through the front door! You name it: gross, the tile, the carpet, the couches and chairs you didn't even want to sit on them, all just nasty and weathered. The kitchen counter tops and cabinets as well as the cabinets in the bathrooms were crusty and falling apart. Nothing worked, the dishwasher was from 1975 it looked as if an animal was living in it, so we could not even stomach eating with the provided utensils and plates, we had to get plastic. The maintenance guy came to look at the dishwasher, he kinda shrugged and left. The guest toilet was clogged, the balcony had holes in the siding (I saw a squirrel run into one of the holes). I don't know how the people at the check in can look you in the eye and take your money.

It was dark, and we knew we were in the right vicinity, but could not find The Villas at Tree Tops. We drove back and forth on Route 209, wondering if we missed a sign. We saw signs for Fernwood, so I suggested that we stop there, as they would probably know where to direct us. We did not know at the time that Fernwood was associated with The Villas at Tree Tops. My husband parked in a very poorly lit parking lot, while my son and I waited in the car for what we thought would only be a few minutes. After about \u00bd hour, my husband came back out, and said that this was the place where we were supposed to check in! There were no signs to indicate that what so ever! Upon check-in, my husband was given a \u201cGuide to Activities and Special Events\u201d. In the center page of the guide was a map of \u201cThe Villas at Tree Tops and Fairway\u201d. The girl who had waited on him at the main desk had highlighted in blue the route we should take from the Fernwood Hotel and Resort parking lot, to Unit 6003 B. She had not only highlighted the route, but she also wrote in pen the room number 6003 B in a box on the map. She also gave him a small manila envelope with two keys inside. (Those plastic credit card-like keys.)We followed the highlighted route on the map as directed to 6003 B. As we drove to our unit, we noticed a lot of garbage bags lying in front of the units. This certainly did not look very inviting. We arrived at 6003. There was a garbage bag thrown in front of this unit too. We parked, and carried some small items up to the door with us. We removed the key from the envelope, slid it through the \u201clock\u201d, and it did not work. We tried it again. We tried the second key. It did not work. It was then that we noticed in the dark that the number on the manila envelope that was hand-written was not 6003, but 6033. As we went back to our car, we noticed that 6033 was just across the street. Should we go across and try the key in that door? Well, why not? We did, and the key worked. Before taking anything into the unit, the first thing we did was make a call to the front desk and explain what had occurred. They told us to stay there at 6033. We asked if it would be okay because we had signed for room 6003 B, and if someone was eventually given that room and caused any problems or damages, we did not want to be responsible for it. They assured us that it was okay. So we went out to the car, parked it in front of 6033, and brought all of our luggage and food inside. We unpacked everything\u2014hung clothes in the closet, put food in the cupboards and refrigerator, put our toiletry items in the bathroom, and got ready for bed. We weren\u2019t very happy with the condition of the unit---the carpets were stained, the upholstery on the furniture was stained and ripped, even the curtains were stained, the shower was moldy and gross, the kitchen cupboard doors were crooked, there was even a large can of RAID prominently placed in one of the kitchen cupboards!

Going by all of the reviews they could all use some updating. We choose the Fairway Villas, the pictures looked nice, however the reviews were iffy. When we got there we were thankful that it wasn't as bad as some people made it sound. The place was clean, the kitchen had all the essentials, full washer and dryer. The layout is cute. When you walk in there is a powder room to the side, you can then go up apprx. 6 steps or down. Going up brings you to the living room, dining room, kitchen. Living room was small but cute with a fireplace, dining room was roomy and so was the kitchen. From this level you than can go up to the 2nd floor were there is a bedroom with its own bath. They say it is a queen size bed, but it seemed like a full. The bathroom was clean and a standard size. If you went down stairs instead of up you come to a Master bedroom suite with sitting area and T.V. and the bathroom has a world pool tub. There is also a balcony off of this bedroom as well as off of the living room. The community has some activities for the kids and family, but nothing real exciting. We really only went to relax so we didn't go out of our way to look for activities. You need to drive everywhere, however they do have a shuttle. We never used the shuttle so I can't really comment any further on it. They had a couple of pools, the nicest one is at the Fernwood hotel. We didn't use any of them so I can't really comment on that either. There are 3 restaurants at the Fernwood hotel. The Pub which had the most variety to choose from and the food was good, the diner which was good for breakfast and a more expensive fancier restaurant, which I can not remember the name of. I personally thought the food was good and had no problems. prices were average. The staff was friendly and helpful. The first day there we got in at night, the bulb for the outside light to our room was out, but I called the next day and maintance was there in 10 min. to replace it.

The rest of the villa was okay..just the bathrooom was pretty bad at first. Pools were overcrowded, not enough chairs, towel bins were falling apart but the worst part of all was the whirlpool at the main building was dirty!! I mean you saw dirt on the side of the walls and in the bubbles. Once we saw that were out and never getting back in that whirlpool again. Water was dirty too. We couldn't get in the door to jump in the shower. That's just nasty. The only good thing I can say is the staff was very nice. The place needs to be renovated and updated.
