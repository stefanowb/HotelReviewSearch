The lobby is absolutely breathtaking. The hotel was a lot larger than we were expecting, which didn't really bother us at all. We stayed in the tower part of the hotel and our room was really nice. It was a little confusing finding our way to the pool, but it was decently sized for a roof-top pool and we enjoyed our time there. There are tennis-courts on the roof that guests could use too, which was a neat find. The staff was very friendly (especially the ladies at the front desk). We did not eat in the restaurant, but we did order room service. It was delivered in 25 minutes, as promised, and was decent - the fruit cup had a definite pickle-taste which was a little unexpected, but that was probably the worst part of our stay, which is a pretty great thing.

Room service was good but in the five days I stayed, one day got skipped. The Tavern Bar next to the hotel is a good place to relax at night and on a couple of times it had a piano player.

We settled for two rooms with 2 double beds. It didn't take us long to realize that the thermostat in our room didn't work. We were freezing and all we could do was turn it off and then back on later. The toilet rocked back and forth when you sat on it, not just the seat, the whole toilet. You could tell that it had been like that for awhile since the grout around the bottom on the floor was all coming lose. It felt like it was going to tip over. We reported it so I hope it was fixed before they put someone else in there. We called the next morning and asked to be moved and they tried to get us to just stay there while they sent maintenance. I asked if there were any king bed rooms available and when they said yes I told them we wanted to change rooms. They sent a bellman up to help, which was nice. Our relatives moved also since there was another king size room available. The worst part of the stay was that the entire hotel was freezing all the time. It was 100 degrees outside but it was better than being in the lobby. I don't know how the people who work there can stand it. Service for breakfast was awful. They only had one women on duty who even tried to take care of anyone. The hostess out front kept wandering off, and the people who were supposed to be getting coffee and water would just walk through the room and out the other side. The only server in the room was trying to take care of about 40 people, and seating others when the hostess was no where to be found.

The rooms are very nice, as is typical with a Renaissance, but I can't say enough about how beautiful the spa is. Many times the auctual facility does not measure up to the photos on line. Not the case in this instance -- it is lovely! The service at the spa is good but not great. The reason I say that is that when we arrived, they did not have our reservation listed in their computer. The receptionist immediately panicked, made a big fuss and went to get the manager. The manager quickly took charge and handled the situation very professionally, even giving us a 10% discount for the mix-up.

The lobby is spectacular and the check-in service was great. I was a little hesitant to stay here because the only pictures I had seen were of the lobby, but the room did not disappoint. In fact, it was probably the largest hotel room I've ever stayed in at this price point. We had a two queen bed room on the third floor which had ample space on all sides of the bed as well as a seating area with a queen anne style chair and ottoman and a desk. The bathroom was HUGE and beautiful with a soaker tub and separate shower. We had the breakfast buffet one morning in the Trellis Room which was delicious. We also went to the Joe Cain Cafe and got delicious adult beverages that we brought up to the beautiful roof top terrace. Very nice space up there. On our final night, we stopped in at the Royal Street Tavern for drinks. We loved the atmosphere and service so much we ended up staying for dinner. There was a fabulous pianist and saxophone player and the food was superb. You have to try the creme cheese dip! We also visited the spa once for an hour long massage. My mom was very happy with hers, mine was okay, but a little rough. However, the Quiet Room totally made up for the massage itself. It's a dim lit room with a floor to ceiling fire pit...you have to see this thing! There's also a large hot tub in there, but we didn't get in.
