Its not quite an easy experience as others as it was not that easy to find (new area so satnav hard to programme) and the parking is not great, there are a very small number of spaces in underground secure park which are likely to be full, so you are left with on street which was ok but not ideal. Again for a stopover not having a restaurant can be a hassle but there is a Macdonalds 5 mins walk away, and also a shopping centre with restaurants and a playground (Docks 67) which would be worth seeking out with an evening to kill.", "title": "nice stopover", "user": "twoplusonetravel", "date": "September 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 139684528}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Stayed here en-route south. Good sized room with a pull across screen on a track for privacy. This is great for families as kids can be in one half and you in another. There is a microwave and a mini-bar sized fridge, ut equipment is limited to two small wine glasses and mugs. Consumables i.e. tea and coffee are very basic with 1 tea bag and two coffee and one small bottle of Evian - not enough for one adult, never mind any more. Just across the park area is a Carrefore mini supermarket and that is well stocked with things to eat after microwaving and they are quite god. Reception will give you disposable plates and cutlery. The bathroom was well equipped with both bath and shower. Our \u00a389 rate included breakfast and the quality was good even if the range is limited. They do breakfast boxes for kids, full of sugar to keep them hyper for the rest of the day! They contained coco pops, capri sun orange drink, croissant, and a fruit puree pouch. The adult breakfast was good overall and worth eating. They show traffic lights of the busiest times and we just got there at 7.45 and it was fine, no crowd and empty tables.
