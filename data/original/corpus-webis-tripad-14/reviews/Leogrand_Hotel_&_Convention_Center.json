Right in the heart of the city, really friendly and helpful staff who all seem to speak good English, and an excellent room with lots of space and all necessary facilities. No coffee making facilities but we woiuldn't expect that in most European hotels. The bathroom is quite small, but perfectly adequate and all immaculately clean, modern equipment. Everything seems to be run efficiently and nothing is too much trouble, The breakfast is very good quality with a wide range of cereals, fruit, bread and hot items (although sugared carrors and mixed veg were not something we were tempted by), and all accompanied by delightful harp music played live by a very talented young girl. Effective air-conditioning, free wi-fi and a room safe that fitted my netbook computer comfortably were all very welcome extras, and the mini-bar prices were reasonable (although helped by the exchange rate). A great place to stay, although 2 or 3 nights is probably enough to take in most of the sights of the city.", "title": "Couldn't have asked for more", "user": "Steve-G23", "date": "July 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 71233859}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I have spent in Leogrand 10 days in a row.
