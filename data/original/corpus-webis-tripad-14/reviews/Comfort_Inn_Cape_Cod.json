My son loved the pool - the hot tub was closed for renovations till the end of the month but the pool was so warm it didn't matter. They had a a lifeguard on duty. Lots of renovation going on. Most rooms near me were being ripped apart. My room was not recently redone - basic and slightly shabby with tiny bathroom but totally doable especially because I used my Choice Points for all 3 nights. If you have more than a few people perhaps ask for room 202 with the adjoining room so you can open up to two big rooms. You might also ask if a renovated room is available when booking. I had a fridge and microwave which was nice. TV has nintendo you can rent by the hour. They have about 4 or 5 arcade games. Breakfast daily but no hot items - bagels, toast, muffins, etc. Hotel is on a very busy road. Had a hard time turning left towards town. Be extremely careful in the rotary - its very dangerous. Went on high speed ferry to Martha's Vineyard for the day. Highly recommend even though it was pricey - didn't feel the waves at all. Tons of tacky strip malls and even a mall on way to town. Very quaint and tranquil closer to the beach areas. Bring quarters for parking meters. We went on the harbor cruise - it was nice. Whale watch ships are farther away - none nearby. Cute priate mini golf place in S. Yarthmouth with an Christmas Tree shop and discount Cape Cod T-Shirt and Sweatshirt store before the golf place - great prices. Cape Cod potatoe chip factory (free samples) and cape cod beer are also right down the street from hotel. Ate at San Diego's one night - it was a fun place to eat. There is a KMart near the mall area which came in handy for cheap essentials I forgot to pack.", "title": "In the Middle of Everything", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Southport-TRIP", "date": "May 14, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7615196, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pool", "disliked": "\u2014 Heavy Traffic Area, Renovation Noise"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here for 3 nights in May.

My family and friend stayed here one night on the way to Nantucket/Boston for vacation, and we found it sub par. There was a lot wrong with this place. The lobby is truly disgusting, with 5 foot ceilings and no paint on the walls, with chairs scattered around the lobby (I think they were doing renovation when we came). The rooms aren't great either, but after a day of flying and driving they were fine - and our room had a view of the trees and pond. They have thin carpets and hard beds, but they do have good tv channels. The bathrooms were horrid, with peeling wallpaper, and gross yellow crud on the shower and hair where the soap was supposed to go. It wasn't clean. The pool was gross, and my friend and I didnt go in because it looked like it was a breeding spot for bacteria and urine. The \"free breakfast\" was toast, watery juice and soggy waffles, in a small and cramped banquet room off the horrific entrance. Overall, this place is fine to stay at for a short period of time, and the accomodations were welcoming after a long day of traveling; however, it is not a hotel i would recommend to anyone.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 19, 2004", "id": 2461822}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A great stay!", "text": "This was my third stay at this hotel, and have found it one of the best Comfort Inns I've stayed at.
