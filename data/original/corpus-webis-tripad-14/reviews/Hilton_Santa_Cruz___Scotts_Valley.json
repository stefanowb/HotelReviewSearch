The hotel is located just off the main highway to Santa Cruz but you hear no road noise in the rooms. Parking at the hotel is either self or complimentary valet. We used both. The parking lot is small and located directly in front of the hotel so it's not a far walk if you do self parking. Check-in was a bit slow, but seamless. The front desk seamed busy due to a wedding party that was staying at the hotel and because of Mother's Day weekend. We booked using Hilton Honors points so I can't comment on the price of the rooms, but as Hilton Diamond members, we were upgraded to a lovely suite upon check-in. It was on the first floor of the hotel, but I think this is a criticism of the hotel layout, not the front desk staff. The suite was nicely appointed, extremely spacious and had nice toiletries. The bathroom was enormous and featured dual sinks and a separate bath and shower enclosure. The vouchers for breakfast that we received entitled us to only the continental breakfast (value of $6.95) which was a little uncommon for Diamond members. Typically we receive the hot breakfast option so we had to make do with cereal, fruit, pastries, yogurt and toast. We found the hotel to be not very soundproof. We could hear water running in the rooms above ours as well as doors closing and noise from the hallway. We used the pool while we were there and it was very nice.
