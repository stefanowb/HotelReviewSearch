Staff were very helpful, rooms were comfortable and bed nice. The pool area is spotless and the pool very nice. The only thing that lets this down is if you are planning on spending a lot of time in Avignon and dont have a car. The hotel is a 30 minute walk from the city centre and the taxi's are not cheap in this part of the world so if you want to be exploring Avignon a lot then I'd stay nearer the city centre. The hotel is also quite expensive for simple items like water - pick some up before you get here.

Tea/coffee making materials. TV. Small bathroom but good shower. Standard buffet breakfast but expensive at 13\u20ac/head. Interesting food at restaurant for dinner. But eccentric service - main course served 15 seconds (at most) after finishing first course. Hotel a 30 minute walk from Avignon and the sites. Bus stop outside hotel. Number 3 - a ten minute ride to town centre. Single ticket costs 1.20\u20ac. Pay the driver - having exact money helps. Buses run every 20 minutes but last one back to hotel is a very early 20.00hrs. So late night in Avignon means a taxi back to the hotel. Alternative is to eat in the hotel every evening becauwe there are no bars/restaurants nearby.
