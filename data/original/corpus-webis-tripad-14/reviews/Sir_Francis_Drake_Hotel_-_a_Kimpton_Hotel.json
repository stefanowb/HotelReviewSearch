Check-in was efficient and we were allowed to go straight to our rooms despite arriving well before the 3.00pm check-in time. I loved the reception area and lobby - it was very grandiose! The twin double room was spacious, clean and the beds were really comfortable. We had a great view of Union Square and Macy's. I loved the Aveda products in the bathroom and dressing gowns (one in tiger skin print, the other in zebra skin print!) were an added bonus! The hotel is in a superb location - lots of great diners (try Roxy's just up the street from the hotel), restaurants (try E&O Trading Company around the corner), bars and caf\u00e9s within 5 minutes walk; Chinatown 5 minutes walk and right beside Union Square and great shopping! Also, the cable car ($5 per ride) stops right outside the hotel and brings you out to all that is Fisherman's Wharf. We also spent two of our nights in the hotel's top floor bar - Harry Denton's Starlight Room - this has spectacular night time views of San Fran, a comprehensive cocktail menu, excellent service, live music, hopping DJs, a busy dancefloor and a great atmosphere. I hope to go back to SF and would absolutley definitely stay here again - I have already recommended it to family and friends intending to travel to SF and all of the above for a fantastic price!", "title": "Great Hotel; Great Location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Seanie1", "date": "May 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15666686, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great price for a great hotel in a great location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed last week for the first few days of our honeymoon and it was PERFECT!

The beds were very comfortable and the room we had (executive dbl dbl) was spacious but the bathrooms are small and can only allow one person at a time. The only negative I had was a standoffish staff member at the check in desk who confirmed my room type and saw that we were a family of four but never took the time to advise me that the extra sofa bed I was needing and expecting would not be in the room. So, we went to our room, found that it was missing, and had to call down to the front desk and inquire. We were offered two roll away beds, which I accepted. They filled our room completely but at least we all had a bed to ourselves. The hotel was a little bit dirty and certain things were left on the floor our entire stay! However, I still maintain that this is a good value given the prices of hotels in Union Square.

Ask for an upper room. From the higher floors the noise from outside is just a pleasant city hum. From the lower floors, the constant ding-ding of the cable car could be annoying.
