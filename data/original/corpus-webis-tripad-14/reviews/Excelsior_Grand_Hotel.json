The hotel is close to the main bus terminus where all island buses return at end of their trips. The island is quite small and buses are efficient. I went to Mdina and Marsaxlokk by bus. The Ferry point to Sliema is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel, mostly downhill. The hotel has beautiful facilities, several restaurants and a large pool. The staff are welcoming, and above all kind! You are greeted every day at breakfast on the 4th floor, with views across to Manoel Island, where small boats and cruisers sail by - idyllic! The hotel has a manmade \"beach\" where you can swim in the sea. There is a spa and an indoor pool which would be good for winter breaks. The hotel is also used for conferences and business - while I was there there were two charity events held, the US airforce had staff staying, and all of the MTV crew were there as the MTV music festival was on - I saw Lady Gaga, and the Blackeyed Peas for free - a bonus! A very varied and interesting place to stay. Valletta is an interesting old town. Lots of history and amazing architecture. Good resort for singles - lots to see, but not so easy for anyone with walking difficulties as Valletta is very hilly and full of steps. Shops close at 7pm.
