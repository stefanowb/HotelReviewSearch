It is easily the best B&B we have ever stayed at. The service was excellent, with nothing too much for the proprietors, David and Sharon, to attend to. Our double room was spotlessly clean, as was the whole house, with the toilet more than adequate. The shower was very simple to operate - a big plus for that! The B&B is situated on the main street of Edzell, a delightful village in Angus, but the traffic outside is very light and there are no heavy lorries to spoil one's sleep.

After a rash of unfriendly,untidey B&B's this was heaven sent. Sharon and Dave are the freindliest B&B owners I have ever met. They are so helpful but also give you plenty of personal space and always seem to be there at just the right time. They were extremely accomadating including letting us put away some of our outdoor kit. The rooms where very spacious for a B&B each having a sink inside the room, and though the bathrooms are outside the rooms, they still seem private as there was a bathroom for each room on the floor we stayed on. The bath and bedrooms were well kept and very clean. The bottled water and biscuits were a great touch and much needed after a long day in the hills. I had a great nights sleep which is usually difficult when I'm not in my own bed but the bedding was very comfortable. Breakfast was fantastic, cooked perfectly and the fresh eggs from their hens was an added bonus. You can tell that they love having a B&B and that they are not just doing it to have a business.
