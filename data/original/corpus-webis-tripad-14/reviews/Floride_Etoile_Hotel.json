The staff was nice and very helpful and the breakfast buffet provided us with the necessary fuel to begin each day of exploring this wonderful city. The only negative I'd say was the lack of shower curtain made it difficult to bathe without getting water on the floor. It is close to the metro station and there is a little grocery store by the hotel that you can get snacks and bottle watered inexpensively. We had a great experience staying at the Floride Etoile and recommend it to our friends.", "title": "Nice little friendly hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ldjnavyrn", "date": "March 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7215007, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Breakfast, location, value, staff", "disliked": "\u2014 shower-lack of curtain"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Myself and my girlfriend are just back fom Paris and our stay in this hotel was fine.
