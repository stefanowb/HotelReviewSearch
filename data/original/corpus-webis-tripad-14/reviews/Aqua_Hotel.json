When it finally did come, I must have run the equivalent of a good bath-full of potable water down the drain which rather undermines the hotel's eco-credentials. I was staying on floor -2 for the first time so I wonder if the problem is specific to that floor as it has never been a problem on previous stays.", "user": "marasmaovunque", "date": "January 4, 2013", "id": 148777743}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not the best hotel in Brussels: many negatives", "text": "A rather more minor issue is that when, on the advice of Reception, I got in the lift to go to my room, the lift just dropped then stopped, without opening the doors.

The receptionist was very nice, smiling and willing to help me with everything. My room was in the -1 floor with view in some courtyard, I had to go a while through the hall, which was very narrow (as well as the staircase). The room equipment was standard, very nice was the electric kettle and tea, coffee and chocolate. My room didn't have a bathtub, just a shower. The breakfast was very good, wide choice of different food, fresh hot croissants, the only thing that bothered me was that the waitress asks you if you want coffee ot tea, you have to choose and can't have both (maybe you can if you ask afterwards, but I didn't have so much time). You can catch the wifi only in the lobby (not in my room), but there were two computers in the lobby with the printer at a disposal (although the keyboard wasn't standard qwerty, the letters were set up in a different way, which was a bit confusing:)", "user": "articok", "date": "July 12, 2012", "id": 134178612}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great, modern hotel for an excellent price", "text": "This hotel was a great find.
