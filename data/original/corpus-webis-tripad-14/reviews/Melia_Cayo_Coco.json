I am not writing this to complain because it was truely a lovely vacation, however this resort is not a 5* as stated by the tour operator. We went down with high expectations about this resort and the only disappointment was the ROOM situation. Our 1st room had a large amount of aunts all around. This did not bother me but annoyed me a bit because it took 3 calls plus a few visits to the front desk to get this matter looked at. Then we opened the closed to find a hole in the wall where brown water was coming from. It made my stomach turn, because mold is not safe. After calling the front desk again, I was asked to talk to the customer service person where this matter was taken care of. He was amazing like all the staff at this resort..however things got done when they felt like doing it. We were upgraded to one of the lagoon rooms which I have to say was amazing, super clean and great view. Another problem occured with the room..toliet did not work,no towels and not to mention no toliet rolls..my only complaint is about the rooms and the luck we had. I thought I would share this to let you know that that this resort is not a 5* plus, more like a 4*. Not saying that I would not recommend this hotel, but do not expect a 5*. Have to mention though the property is very nice, super clean, staff so friendly and always smiling, weather was great, pool area very nice (water freezing). Food was not the greatest, however lets remember that you do not go away for the food. Bread was always fresh and just out of the oven. Highly recommend! Very close to the airport, if wanting to shop not to much to buy unless you leave the resort. I did not feel that if you did not tip you did not get service. Service was great either way, just the room situation was a nightmare and could have been avoided if matters were taken care of on the 1st complaint.", "title": "Room nightmare, however nice resort", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Alwayscourious", "date": "February 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4464360}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful Experiences!", "text": "My husband and I went to Melia Cayo Coco the first time in March 2004.

Our room was always immaculately cleaned by the maid who left beautiful towel arrangements on our bed each day. The room safes in the resort operate by numeric code which you program yourself, so there's never any worries about losing keys and such, which is great. Our room had a beautiful large balcony with two chairs and a table on it overlooking the tennis courts at the resort. The air conditioning in the room was way, way stronger than we needed for the weather we had.

A nice place to swim when the water at the beach is too rough. It is not too deep, about up to my neck at the deepest (I'm 5'4\") so is good for non-swimmers to enjoy as well. We got to enjoy the pool for a couple of days, then for some reason the management decided it needed to be immediately and completely drained out for cleaning! So right in the middle of our stay, the pool was completely drained making it totally unuseable at the same time as the beach was too choppy (red flag) for swimming! I found the whole situation hilarious, but some of the other tourists were not amused about that! The pool remained empty for two or three days as Cuban staff worked about, mopping and cleaning it, however eventually it was re-filled after many complaints (although not from us - like I said I just found it funny). We were told they drain the pool for \"cleaning\" once every two years. So anyone coming after us until 2007 should be ok as far as the draining thing goes!
