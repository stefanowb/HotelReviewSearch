It is not like your traditional hotel, it is intimate, friendly, relaxing, quiet and peaceful in the day and close and chatty in the lovely bar area. We met some wonderful guests that stayed during our trip and it felt like being part of a family or group of friends. You are left to be as quiet or chatty as you like, nothing is too much trouble and Imelda and Mark (owners) really know their stuff ! They recommend great restaurants and trips and can even book them for you. The pool area is like a secret garden and we decadently even had a beer in the pool! We also had tea and biscuits, not in the pool. The apartments are lovely and have kitchnets where you can keep olives, feta, crisps etc to enjoy on your balcony. They server good wine and fab coctails by Denis the cheeky barman. Denis also got our shopping for us and it was delivered to our apartment, saved the legs. We have already booked to go back next year and know we will have another amazing holiday. Thank you Pasha.", "title": "I would never go anywhere else in Kalkan!
