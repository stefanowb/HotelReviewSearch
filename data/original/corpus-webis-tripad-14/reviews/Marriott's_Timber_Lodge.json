We booked well in advance and as a result, we got a one bedroom \"villa\". This is the first thing you need to secure. Many complaints are about the size of the room. If you don't get the \"villa\" you're getting a standard Motel 6 sized room. You won't enjoy it if you have kids. There is a small refrigerator and that's it. Also, ask not to be on the first or fifth floor. I used the excuse that my wife has a stange phobia and refuses to stay on the bottom or top floors of any hotel (good one, huh?). The first floor appears to have a lot of outside noise given the amount of people and the fifth floor has slanting ceilings as a result of a building restriction which requires that hotels be no higher than the treeline. I told the sales person about being on the 3rd floor and she was surprised. Apparently most people previewing end up on the first or fifth.", "title": "NEVER DID SEE THE TIMESHARES", "helpfulness": 26, "user": "SOFTBALLDAD", "date": "July 30, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 5527021, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Tahoe,", "disliked": "\u2014 Small room, lack of service"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wow - Great Timeshare Property.", "text": "Parking is huge!! Keep in mind that it's not just the $14 per day valet charge, but also the $2 to $3 tip you will likely give each time they bring your car to you. It's safe to assume you will be looking at close to $20 per day when it's all said and done. BUT WAIT..... easy solution. As others have suggested, park behind Harrah's in their free parking lot and enjoy a 2 minute walk to the hotel. If you can request an area of the hotel to have your room, ask that you have a room that is close to room 6364. That happened to be our villa and it is super close to the parking lot since it is at the end of the building with a stairway on the end. The hotel is really large and if you get a room closer to the lobby, you are looking at an additional 2 minutes walk just to get to the end of the building.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "tennis_ace_2005", "date": "July 10, 2006", "id": 5448120}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband & I just returned from a 3 day, 2 night stay at the Marriott Timber Lodge. We stayed in a guest room with one king bed and sofa bed. Our unit had just opened 2.5 months ago, therefore everything was new. The room was small (just big enough for 2 people) but had a sofa bed, small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, etc. My only peeve was that the bathroom floor was a little dirty (hair on floor). Since we were out all day, we just went to our room to sleep, so the size really didn't matter. Also, this is a timeshare, no cleaning service (except for clean towels) is provided unless you request it (for a fee). If you enjoy skiing Heavenly Valley, this is the place for you. Everything is right outside your front door and the casinos are only half a block away. Front desk and valet staff were ok, but the concierge was very friendly.
