The venue is fantastic we had our civil ceremony, wedding breakfast and evening do/disco all in the Great Hall, which is a beautiful room with windows overlooking the gardens and huge ceilings. We were impressed with the speed and ease with which the hotel staff turned the room around, and there are plenty of nice places near the room for our guests to mingle, as well as gorgeous, well kept grounds overlooking a large pond. Lots of nice photo spots and the old building is wonderful. The staff were fantastic on the day especially the Master of ceremonies Tony, who was there from start to finish and the wedding co-ordinator Denise. The food was really nice and they were fine about catering for vegetarians and other dietary requirements. The rooms were very clean - everything was spot on. The staff made sure we did not need to worry about a thing on the day- I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a wedding venue, but book early because we had to book a year and advance. I would also recommend it for anyone wanting a nice meal in lovely surroundings. We will be going back for our anniversay!!", "title": "Fantastic wedding at the Dunchurch Park", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "sparkleyloo", "date": "January 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4385013}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "Arrived at the Dunchurch Park and very impressed with the main reception building.
