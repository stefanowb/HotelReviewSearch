The triple room we had was Remo (all the rooms are named after Roman Emporers) and it was small but clean. The 'double bed' was 2 twins put together and quite hard but ok and the central heating wasn't too good at night. The only other not so good thing about the room was that the tv only had local channels in Italian. I like to watch tv to relax before I go to sleep and wasn't able to, but hey, what do you expect for a budget room? The staff were all fantastic! From Ivor/Ivan?, the night receptionist who checked us in and gave us the low down on where to go and what to see, to the girls who were on breakfast duty. They didn't speak english too well but tried very hard and worked even harder. The location of the hotel is amazing for the price. If you take 2 or 3 steps onto the road outside and look down the via del Serpenti, you'll see the side of the Colloseum (about a 5 mins walk) with the Roman forum right next to it.

The pictures shown on the website are extremely misleading; the bathroom was extremely small. The smell permeating from the toilet was unpleasant as well. Luckily, I came prepared with an air freshener and flushing the totel sounded worse than flushing airplane toilets. Going to the toilet at night always woke up whoever was sleeping. We also had an issue where there was some type of water pump on our balcony that came on every night at 3:30 am, 4:30 am and 5:30 am so getting a restful sleep did not happen until I was headed back home on the airplane. The sheets were never changed after I specifically asked to have them changed; I knew because there was a hole in the sheet on our double bed which was two twin beds pushed together. They were not even twin longs because my boyfriend is 6'2\" and we had to sleep on an angle so he could fit. The phone did not work until the night before we were to leave Rome. The best attributes at the hotel were the cappuccino and croissants (the ladies in the cafe were truly nice), the location (down the street from the colliseum/metro stop) and the two gentlemen that worked the front desk were always helpful. After much research I really thought I had chosen the right place to stay while in Rome but at 93 euros a night; I clearly made the wrong choice.
