It is surrounded by trees and was very quiet. It is an older place but clean and pretty well kept up. We had a 2 Q room upstairs (206) and didn't hear hardly any other people, cars, etc. It had a fireplace that was all set up with matches to light it. It didn't have small kindling so the fire went out quickly as the larger logs didn't catch but we didn't fool around with it to try for a lasting fire. Popcorn and machine was provided but we were too full from our dinner (and the wine & cheese and crackers provided earlier in the lobby) to try it out. Asilomar Beach is a short walk across the street through the Conference Center's parking lot. The breakfast was filling. Besides scones, muffins, danish there were two choices of cereal and some hard cooked eggs. Pacific Grove is a charming town and I may bring my husband back for our anniversary.", "title": "Beautiful location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sky22", "date": "November 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 183967476}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Nice location with lots of trees. You can walk to beach and 17 mile drive is close by. Rooms are big and clean. A real fireplace in some rooms which is great on a cool night. Somewhat dated but somehow works because it feels right. They offer happy hour with cheese and crackers and the breakfast is delicious pastries, fruit, etc. Front desk Annette is super nice as the owner who was there part of the time. I am glad we stayed in Pacific Grove over Monterey and Carmel. There is also two hot tubs and laundry facilities. A good place to chill out and visit the Monterey Aquarium.", "title": "Great location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jlbaker55", "date": "November 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 183519233}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic", "text": "Fantastic.
