The staff was great the room was nice but the bathroom was very small. At night the court yard partyers went on till past midnight, didn't say anything to the staff so i take blame for a bad night sleep. The breakfast buffet was the best that I have had in some time! Would I stay there again -no- unless the price came down some The robes in the rooms was nice but that kind of stuff does not help me choose a hotel.

They serve a morning breakfast, and the server made me a lunch to take hiking in Point Lobos. There were well behaved and cared for dogs (cats?) everywhere.

We were not disappointed! We had the pleasure of staying in a new, bright and charming room off the street , which we loved, both for its size and for the convenience of walking Lili-our pug. As we walked into the room we were delighted with the decor - from the little elegant bar area sink and glass shelves above , to the large marble bathroom, inviting bed and window seat- under the large picture window, (which offered more privacy than one might expect, as the heads of those walking by seldom looked toward our direction.) The room had all the advantages we could ask for in comfort and amenities. We felt pampered as we relaxed and enjoyed the hospitality of fruit and drink provided for our pleasure. (Anything edible consumed by the guest in most hotels-will be added to your bill!) We woke to just the kind of breakfast I love the most! A vast assorment of pastries, fruit, juice ,ceral, yogurt and more. Lovely trays allowed us to carry our coffee mugs and food back to our room where we started our breakfast fest. We wound up enjoying more coffee and fruit in the dining area with Lily (and other pooches.) before we started off for our walk to the beach.", "title": "Lovely stay in a great location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Mme_X", "date": "July 31, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8267392, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Lovely ambiance in great location, great service", "disliked": "\u2014 Drawers in armoire that stick"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Beware before booking!", "text": "For animal friendly places to go, we vote Doris Day' the top visionary anywhere.
