We were on our honeymoon and were upgraded from the second night once a bigger room was available (four posters with a very high bed -felt like a princess!) - and given bubbly on arrival - the grounds and hotel are wonderful - ideal location for couples -(and blissfully free of young children/families im gald to report) peaceful and relaxing - the rooms are old fashioned and quant which is perfect for the location - the toiletries are lovely and you have as much to use as you need - very special staff and management - thank you!

The grounds are gorgeous, the hotel is devine, the greeting at reception was welcoming and professional, the room was pleasant, but the mattress was poor. The mattress in the Maple Room was the worst mattress we have ever slept on in all the hotels that we have stayed at. We both had an uncomfortable night and I woke up a few times feeling aches and pains. You can run your hand along the mattress and feel the springs protruding outwards so to lie on it for several hours was not the greatest. We were also disapointed by the service at breakfast. The staff at breakfast were fine in that they were not rude but they were not hospital either and the breakfast definatley was not worth \u00a310.00 each - please note we prefer to pay more for food knowing that it will be good. On checking out we were not asked how our stay was but once we had paid and we were about to leave I turned back to let the person know, quite politely, that the mattress was very uncomforatable of which she replied \"Right!\" and then stood in silence with nothing more to add.
