The bathroom was small and your face was basically touching the towel rail when sitting on the toilet but the shower pressure was acceptable. The 2 single beds were passably comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and blankets. The included breakfast consisted of bread, bread rolls, croissants (cheese, butter and jams), plain yoghurt and cereal, along with tea, coffee and a very syrupy orange juice. You could also purchase Internet time on the provided pc in the lobby, or purchase a password so you could connect your own laptop using wifi (Although at 5 Euro for an hour it was quite expensive).

Our air conditioning was the best I have experienced, cooled us down in no time & the breakfast was great as it ran from 7 till 10 giving you 3 hours to grab something to eat. Pick ups could be arranged easily from this hotel for tours and the staff on reception phoned up to your room to let you know when the tour operators arrived so you didn't miss them. The only reason I haven't chosen 'excellent' as my rating was because the toilet was situated right next to the shower with little room so that you banged your knees on the shower cubicle.
