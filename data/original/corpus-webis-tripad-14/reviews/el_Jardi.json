Each square has bars and restaurants ideal for people watching. We try to visit during the Merce Festival in September, one of Barcelona's best kept secrets. Non stop entertainment, bands of all types, fireworks and beautiful displays of the elegant catalan sardanas dance.

I had a standard exterior room that overlooked one of the plazas -- I say \"one of\" because there are two adjoining plazas upon which the hostal sits. The room was basic and small with two twin beds, a desk with tv stand and armoire -- not much more room to move. The bathroom was basic with a small shower stall. Keep in mind the walls were thin as I heard most of the noise from the adjoining room as well as when the window is open, the plaza can be noisy. (I also always bring ear plugs so that is rarely a hugely upsetting issue for me. I merely point it out to encourage others to do the same.) Also, the wifi only seemed to work in the lobby area. That being said, the location was fantastic -- surrounded by such lovely plazas in Barri Gothic. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean. The price was on par for what I would expect.

They have free WIFI in the their lobby, and if your device is powerful enough, in your room. There is a Cathedral next door and like most cathedrals with bells, they toll the bells - starting around 7 AM, so bring earplugs if you like to sleep in.
