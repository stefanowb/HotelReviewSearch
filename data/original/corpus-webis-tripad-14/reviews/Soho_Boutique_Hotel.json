We liked it but we got a very good deal (68 euro per night) and if we had paid more I think we would have been disappointed. The room was very nicely designed but tiny!! However it really was nice and very comfortable. The lobby and restaurant were very nice but seemed a bit cheap! Can\u2019t quite put my finger on it but it had something to do with the staff all wearing orange jumpers which made it feel like you were on an easyjet flight!! Breakfast was terrible, cold bacon and eggs, orange 'juice' that was like flavoured water. There was only one beer in the minibar and when I rang down and asked for more (it was late at night), I was told by quite a rude receptionist that he is not a barman!! Otherwise I have to say the staff were very helpful and were extra helpful with some queries I had before we arrived. Location was good but the particular street is not too nice. Overall I would recommend it but it\u2019s not really a 4 star so don\u2019t pay 4 star prices!!", "title": "Good value, nice design....but lacks that special something!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AllanBLondon", "date": "December 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 22556524, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Design and comfort of rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 Staff's orange jumpers!!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I loved the style and decor of this hotel.
