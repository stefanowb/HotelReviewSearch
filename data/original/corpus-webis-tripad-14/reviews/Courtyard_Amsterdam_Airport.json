The Courtyards we have stayed in (Amsterdam, Brussels, Hanover) have not offered free internet connections in the room or lobby, or free parking. Coffee service is generally limited to a machine in the lobby which serves free cups only from 6:00-9:00 a.m., which is not nearly enough hours for diehard coffee drinkers or late risers. Also, the options for breakfast are limited to a buffet which costs 22 Euros per person, which is way too much for the quality of food served and the service provided. Dinner options are better, but the service is generally haphazard and meal prices are a little high. Courtyards usually have nice lounges, have a decent selection of beers and appetizers at fairly reasonable prices, and the bartenders and servers tend to be much more attentive than they are in the restaurant. The rooms in the Courtyards are fine with comfortable beds and flat screen TVs, as well as nice bathrooms.
