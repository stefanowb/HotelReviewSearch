I am a hotel aficionado...and very hard to please. I don't have one single bad thing to say. The rooms were clean and very nice. The bathroom had good lighting and was very clean. (Even the balcony, chairs and table were clean!) The staff is truly amazing. Someone had broken a beer bottle in the hallway by the stairs. We told one of the housekeepers and she immediately stopped what she was doing and went and cleaned it up. I don't think I saw one staff member that wasn't smiling. The lobby is nice and inviting. The bartender at the swim up bar on Thursday was great. She was quick and very pleasant to talk to. (Wednesday's bartender was a little slow...but very nice.) We had great appetizers by the pool and enjoyed ourselves immensely. Parking, pool towels, waiters and waitresses, drinks, and help were readily available anytime we needed anything. Very impressed. We will be staying there again.

Our room was your average hotel room you would expect from a Hilton...nice and clean. What really made our stay however was the staff...everyone from the front desk, bar tender, bellman, waiters and restaurant staff really took the time to make sure everything was perfect and they were always fast, friendly, and attentive. They not only treated us that way..but I saw how they treated our 12 year old son while I was sitting in the lobby and he went up to ask for a soda at the lobby bar and for some brochures at the front desk....the staff gave him the same greeting and service that they would to an arriving dignitary. Its great to stay at a place where everyone treats you so well and the hotel and amenities are clean and all functioning. Also...the location is excellent...right on the seawall and near some great places to eat and the price we paid for our stay was a bargain for the quality of the experience.", "title": "service is outstanding from everyone on staff", "user": "makerr30196", "date": "March 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154792247}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in this hotel prior to departing for a cruise out of Galveston.
