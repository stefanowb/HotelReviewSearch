The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was huge. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. No breakfast, which was fine for us because we left early to go back to the airport. This hotel is very convenient to the train and bus station, but be forewarned that it's a slightly dodgy area (pickpockets, etc.) because there are so many hotels & tourists. The only drawback I found was the fact that it's on the second floor...and there is no lift.

But...instead we did stay at the Hotel Elite. What a wonderful experience, we felt as if we were in a movie, small, quaint room, little shower in the bathroom, nice and comfortablel bed and shutters that swing open to reveal the sights and sounds of Florence below.

First of all you need to appreciate hotels in Florence are very expensive and seem to be always booked so you really get what you pay for. Hotel Elite is really close to the train station in a relative safe area. To get up to the hotel you enter through a gate and head up the dark stairs which can seem daunting at first, but it's a cute little hotel that's typical. for Florence. The good thing is you can walk from here to all the major sites in the about 10 minutes or less.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "NaomiDaley967", "date": "June 3, 2006", "id": 5295274}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005", "text": "I paid 70 euros a night for a double room for myself with shower and toilet included.
