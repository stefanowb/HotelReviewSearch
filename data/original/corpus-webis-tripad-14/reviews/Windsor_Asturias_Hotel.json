We came back for Carnival 2012 and chose this hotel for its central location. This proved to be a very good choice, as Centro and Cinelandia are party central for Carnival. Massive gatherings happen just around the corner from the hotel - either in the square in front of the Teatro Municipal or a block away in the shadows of the Arcos de Lapa. Loud music, cold beer and street stalls serving all kinds of food make for a very festive atmosphere. The hotel provides armbands as an added security measure indicating that you are in fact guests of the hotel. The sambadrome is only a short Metro ride away for whichever night you choose to attend the incredible \"desfiles das escolas de samba\". The rooftop bar and swimming pool are a great place to relax in the afternoon while preparing for another evening of celebration in the cidade maravilhosa.
