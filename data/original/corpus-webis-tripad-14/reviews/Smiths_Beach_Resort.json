Each beachshack has a car spot at the front and a small courtyard with BBQ, outdoor dining set and clothes line. Appliances all new and in good condition. Modern decor. Flat screen TV and DVD player in each shack. Split air conditioner in each bedroom and living area....which was very much required during the summer days. Lovely pool (and wading pool) for a swim and deck chairs to soak up the sun....is supposed to be heated, but the day we arrived they had just cleaned and refilled it and so was not heated completely yet, but still enjoyed it as it was a warm day. Tennis court also at property. No views from beachshacks. Toiletries provided and towels were white and fluffy and linen beautifully white and crisp. Shacks stocked with ample amount of laundry detergent/dishwashing detergent/vacuum etc for long stays. Real milk (not UHT stuff) also in fridge for arrival. Handheld shower head great for those with kids, no bath tub in shacks, but bubby can be washed in basin.
