Situated atop a high bluff at the center of the Loughborough University campus, this hotel offers not only immaculately clean facilities but also abundant fresh air and walking opportunities. That having been said, other elements of what might be called \"the university idiom\" reduce the ranking of this otherwise superb facility. These deficits include extremely spare room decor; uncomfortably narrow toilets and bathroom spaces; and a certain penury with regard to amenities (only one towel was provided). The hotel is affiliated with a university that stresses sports education; as a result, the halls are filled with annoying banners proclaiming certain sports-related virtues and showing athletes in somewhat artificial action poses. Although the breakfast is superior in every respect, from taste to quantity to presentation, the other food service, whether in the restaurant or through catering, is appalling (I was confronted with a rubbery lamb shank that truly defined the \"spring\" in \"spring lamb\"). The Burleigh Court offers numerous advantages but has not yet achieved the consistent level of quality and amenity needed for a true four-star hotel.", "title": "Cheerful but not Quite a Four-Star", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "PhilonousBatonRouge", "date": "October 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180829673}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here overnight when attending a Development Day organised by the charity with whom I volunteer.

Useless the instigator stayed the injured led away. A gobby woman stayed. One man taken to his room repeatedly then he kept returning and punching the windows. Security did nothing.After 2 hours and having to close the bar because of them , they eventually went. They needed chucking out. In spite of this we really enjoyed our stay .The dinner was delicious and quality. Great choice at breakfast. Great service with a smile.

Bedrooms good. The thing is that having worked for many years in Universities, sitting in the lounge and the dining room was like sitting in student settings not a hotel. No subtle lighting or beautiful furniture. For the most part, ceiling lights ( as you would in a student common room) and upright student kind of chairs ( in the dining room) The lounge was the same and I had to wear ear plugs as the TV was blaring out ( audio) the football commentary as you would find in a pub not a four star hotel. So suggest they visit some of the most beautiful hotel lounges e.g Peacock Alley in The Caledonian Edinburgh or the lounge in The Goring London. Whilst these are 5 star, some of the features of subtle hotel lighting, plants etc, could be an inspiration.

It was probably not one of my greatest decisions but I decided to stay for 3 nights. Firstly the gym is very small and gets really busy after 5 however all the machines were clean and in good working order. There was not a great choice in the restaurant and on one night there was a long wait but the staff were friendly and apologetic and I even got a drink on the house because of the wait. All the meals that I had were superb so perhaps the lack of choice is made up by the quality. Perhaps a conference hotel was not the best choice because I was on my own and the hotel is obviously trying to cater for large groups. The hotel rooms are very small for the money and even came with an apologetic note next to the bed about the location of the hotel being on the University Campus and sorry about the loud noises but here are a set of earplugs if you need them! Luckily I didn't. My only problem with the hotel is that I was in the dorm annex that is a long way away from reception and twice my room card did not work. The second time I had finished work and had a drink in my hand but could not get in the room and couldn't get back into the main hotel to get to reception because the outside door required my room card to open it. This time I had been to meetings in Nottingham and knew for a fact that my card had been nowhere near a mobile phone which wipes them. In fact both times the card failed to open the room it had opened the outside door to the dorm complex only seconds before. I know you can phone through to reception but how long would they take to get there? The only benefit of this was that a ten minute walk to reception and back made up for the fact that I could not use the gym as it was too busy!
