We stayed at this hotel on our last night as we had a flight out of Amsterdam and it's convenient to the train station. We had 2 rooms in the Royal wing, which were OK, but definitely not worth the money we paid compared to other hotels on our trip in the same price range. Hotel Krasnapolsky seems to cut corners to give guests the appearance of luxury without actually having to pay for it. The rooms are attractive, with hardwood floors and modern furnishings. But they skimp on the big ticket items. Other hotels in this price range have very fine linens and down comforters. This one had heavier synthetic comforters and less expensive bedding. There are robes and slippers and abundant little goodies in the bathroom, but the flourescent lighting in the bathroom was dim and depressing. The decor was bargain-basement trying to look expensive -- faux granite on the bathroom floor and no evidence of design or artfulness anyplace in the hotel. I knew it was an old hotel and expected to find at least a hint of its former elegance. I didn't. I'm glad we didn't pay the 21 euros apiece for breakfast in the Winter Garden. (there's a very nice cafe next door with a huge breakfast for less than half that.) I suppose what you are paying for is the Hotel's Dam Square location, but considering how easy it is to get around in Amsterdam, and considering how noisy and dirty the Dam is, why not stay some place a little further away and just walk over?

The check in process went smoothly, not long to wait. A concierge led me to my room as it was an easier option than having the reception staff try to give directions. I had to leave the front door, walk around a couple of corners and down the street to an outside entrance along a canal. My apartment was on the top floor, which meant carrying my luggage up several flights of narrow, curved stairs. This was in a different, older building I believe as it looked quite different from the newer-looking lobby. The building looked ok, apart from the ceiling and wall across from my apartment door, which had a large water leak stain with mold growing in the ceiling. It had obviously been there some time and as of the last night I was there - when it rained quite a bit - was still leaking. Not something one expects to see in a 5* property. The apartment was fantastic. It looked great, the furniture was comfortable and the kitchen area was useful. It overlooked the back alley where garbage/recycling was put, as well as a courtyard area. There were two days when the smoke alarm went off for no reason I could detect. At night it was mostly quiet but being woken up in the morning by workers in the alley was not the best alarm. I did not need much help from the staff but when I did they were very helpful and friendly. I found it very cold the first couple of nights I was there until I finally called the reception to ask with help turning the a/c off. The location is great, within easy walking distance of anything you might want to see in Amsterdam. Instead of charging my room at the time of booking or check in, it was charged at check out, which I do not prefer. Also, extra taxes were added on at the time. This is no problem but I would prefer to know about them and the amounts before I agree to book the room. All in all, it was a wonderful trip.
