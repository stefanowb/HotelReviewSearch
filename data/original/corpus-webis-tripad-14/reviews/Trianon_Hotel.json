It was the worst hotel I've ever been to, starting with the desk clerk who was rude and barely spoke English and the elevator which couldn't hold both of us and our small suitcases, to the urine stenched hallways and black mold on the window frames. It was so bad in fact that after checking in we braved the torrential rains outside to go find a new hotel so that we could move. I literally don't think we'd have been able to spend a night there, just upon entering the room both my husband and I became so congested from the mold and mildew we coudl hardly breathe. It was well worth the extra few dollars to get a good nights sleep somewhere/anywhere else.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 6, 2006", "id": 5432283}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Avoid", "text": "We went to Amsterdam this June and were unfortunate enough to stay at the Trianon Hotel. We came as a business management group of 8 for a Teambuilding weekend. The hotel was listed as having a safe in every room but not one of us had one, as a result we all had to carry our passports and euro's around with us all the time as the room was not very secure. (Another member of our party was even given the key to another guests room). The rooms had no Air Conditioning, no Tea and Coffee making facilities, and were so small you had to put your case infront of the bed and wardrobe so couldn't use the wardrobe easily, it was more like a corridor than a room. The bathroom was so minute that we had the sink in the bedroom with us which had the tap dripping constantly. Carpets were old, smelly and had remnants of the previous occupants hair in amongst other things. There was no bar open as advertised, the only bar was a mini fridge in the reception full of tinned Lager. Breakfast was just okay, but the reception staff during the day weren't very helpful and seemed irritated if asked for assistance with Airport transport. We ended up dragging our cases around the block to another hotel and asked them to arrange our transport back to the airport which was done in minutes, free of charge. We couldn't wait to get home to our much cleaner environment, clean streets, clean people and clean beds. It's Great to be back in the UK.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 27, 2006", "id": 5393939}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Disaster", "text": "Eight of us stayed here and all of us are of the same opinion. This should be classed as a hostel, not a hotel. The room was minute to say the least, the bathroom was so small that the sink had to go in the bedroom, (which by the way was more like a corridor), next to the bed. No tea and coffee making facilities, no air con & no safe in the room, the tap water was drinkable but warm, the room smelt of urine and you most likely won't be able to open your window, infact once out of reception, the whole hotel had a strange odour. The website also says there is a bar, this consists of a mini fridge in reception selling only Heineken in tins. Breakfast was just okay, stick to toast and rolls with jam. The staff were curt, unwelcoming and bad mannered, only the cleaners said hello each day. Infact we got this reaction wherever we went in Amsterdam, only a minority of Dutch people were friendly towards us. The town (red light district Central) was miles away on a tram, ensure you have a ticket or you will be publically humiliated by the inspectors. You buy them off the driver, oh and make sure you always look both ways when crossing the road. Don't leave valuables in your room either, they will give your room key to anybody. We were a mature party of eight adults, this hotel would be more suited as a HOSTEL for the Amsterdam under privilaged. Whatever you do, don't waste your money here, the Dutch hotel ratings are not to the quality of the UK. We all hope that once you change your booking to an alternative, more suitable hotel, that you will have a better experience than we all did.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 26, 2006", "id": 5383346}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2003", "text": "The Trianon is a great place to stay if you're going to a performance at the Concertgebouw, since it's right next door.

The bathrooms look like they came out of WWII Europe, and the carleting is beyond disgusting. Still, the beds were clean, the hallways were very well lit, and they have an elevator.

I had requested a non smoking room, my room stunk of smoke. The bathroom was basically ok with plenty of hot water, but had a permanent stale urine smell. Also greeting me in my room was a dirty glass starting to go mouldy. The plumbing was very noisy , keeping me awake till 2/3a.m. , then I was woken up again around 5a.m. by roudy revellers returning from a night out. Breakfast was ok if you were there early, but if you went down after 8.30, all the good stuff (eggs,ham,cheese) was gone, and was not replenished by the staff.
