The rooms were comfortable, with effective air-conditioning if desired and Mercurey is well placed for excursions. We enjoyed a degustation with the charming lady at the winery next door and bought some local wine that never left the village as we drank it all in situ! But it is the cuisine that would take me back there in a heartbeat. The the food was superb, refined and delicious beyond words - and we have eaten in some world-class restaurants. We were on half-board and we were all more than happy to hear what the chef proposed for us every evening! Otherwise we would all have dithered indecisively all night. Our welcome was warm and M. Jayet cvould not have been more helpful. He even arranged for a mobile phone charger for one of my companions who had left his at home. We stayed at some delightful places on our recent trip but the Val D'or is the one we will be dreaming about all winter.", "title": "Best food of my life!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Theklablue", "date": "August 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 37221201}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Apparently the ownership of this establishment has changed in the last little while.
