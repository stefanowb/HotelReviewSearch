The room was a good value for the price \u2013 $139 as part of a wedding party. Comfy bed, some natural light. Bathroom had good counter space. Check in was easy and the staff was friendly. We were at hotel for a wedding and the staff working the wedding were great. Free wifi (it\u2019s always odd to me that cheap hotels offer free wifi while many expensive hotels do not). Could have used a few more amenities in the bathroom such as a shower cap. The property is large \u2013 pool area was great and there is a game area for kids. Plenty of places to sit throughout hotel and read/catch up on email. The front desk did seem a little short staffed at times. We had room service and the portions were huge.

This hotel is just about an hour away from NYC Area and is a great get away. They have amenities included like Pool, a room for playing Wii, several areas where families can meet and gather to play games, talk, eat. In addition they have an indoor pool, sauna, steam room, hot tub, ping pong Raquet ball which can be converted into volleyball if you have at least 6 people to have a game! It is also located near several vineyards so you can drive and within 20 minute have a wine tasting. The hotel rooms are pretty spacious, some are update some are a bit more classic but all are neat and you can get connecting rooms on request. With Triple A or government ID you get really good discounts through the hotels rewards site (I-prefer) Overall the value is good. Even the Pub in the hotel is priced affordably. With their I prefer rewards at check in you get a little gift too which is normally something good like a flight of wine, cheese platter or chocolate! I'm not sure what the breakfast cost because it was included in my room however it seems a good value because it is buffet but also has a made to order station. I've been several times already but the last two times everyone loved the location (Fall with my Alumnae Chapter with 9 women and the other in February 2012 for my birthday and we booked at least 5 rooms.
