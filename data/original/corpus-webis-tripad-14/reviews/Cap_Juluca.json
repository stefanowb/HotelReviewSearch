When we pulled up at the front lobby Juliette greeted us enthusiastically and warmly. We then proceeded into the lobby where we got our first glimpse of the Cap Juluca beach. I literally gasped when I saw it and was choked up by the sheer beauty of it. I have never, and doubt that I will ever, see a beach this gorgeous. White sand and breathtaking turquoise water; words cannot describe, you have to see it yourself. Reception was quick and friendly. We were offered the option of either rum punch or regular fruit punch. We opted for the rum punch and it was delicious. We were told our room wasn\u2019t ready yet because check-in was at 3, but we had come from another hotel on the island where check-out was at noon, so we were early. We went to lunch at Blue and had another cocktail while dining there and waiting for our room to be ready. We were greeted so warmly even at the restaurant, we enjoyed the food, and the service was prompt and courteous. When our room was ready, the staff at Blue informed us. We were then shown to our oceanfront one bedroom suite and could not have been happier. It was situated on the ground floor, had two verandas, two bathrooms, two flat screen TVs, and the master bath with a solarium was lovely. We immediately unpacked and headed to the beach, which was literally a five second walk from our room. When we returned from the beach there was a complementary bottle of champagne chilling for us with a note welcoming us to Cap Juluca and thanking us for choosing the resort for our stay in Anguilla. I thought that this was a very nice touch and was so pleased. This bottle of champagne went for $155 on the room service menu. Our first night, we received a call from management again thanking us for choosing Cap Juluca, asking us if we were happy with our accommodations and if there was anything we needed. We also had a complementary minibar that we were told would be replenished at a charge, but it was so well stocked that it wasn\u2019t necessary to have it restocked. It included sodas, beer and water. Water was replenished twice daily by housekeeping and was free of charge.", "title": "Stunning beach, perfect stay!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Angel420Marie", "date": "August 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 172097474}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I can\u2019t say enough good things about the beach at Cap Juluca. We felt as if we were on our own private beach because the beach chairs were so aptly spaced. The water was calm and perfectly tempered. The service on the beach was impeccable. There were beach chairs set up for us every day when we arrived. After the first day, the beach attendants seemed to know when we would arrive. So they had our chairs and umbrella set up and waiting for us. Within minutes of arriving at the beach, they would bring us our cooler with water and ask if we needed anything else. We often had cocktails and would use our flag if we wanted another. Everett was one of the beach attendants and was so personable and helpful. Around 3 o\u2019clock every day, someone came around with delicious sorbet for a snack. I loved this and looked forward to it daily. We always stayed on the beach until it was time to go in and get ready for dinner. You can find some beautiful shells on the beach here, but I recommend purchasing some goggles from the gift shop if you want to find some larger conch shells, they are just beyond the surf.
