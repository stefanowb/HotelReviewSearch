Although we had reported the problem right after checking in and went for dinner, when we came back nothing had been done. We called the front desk and they told us, the service people could not do anything so they left everything as it was without telling us. Then the moving procedure began. When the lamps in our second room also did not work properly we asked to be upgraded for our troubles. The woman at the front desk told us we had already been upgraded, which was not true. In our third room the lamps worked but we were so upset that we could not sleep for a long time. Also the air conditioning was so loud, so maybe we could not have slept anyway. Next morning we brought our problems to the attention of the front desk manager and asked why the receptionist told us we had already been upgraded? He said, that this was true because we got rooms in the executive tower. I showed him my email booking which showed that I had booked and paid for exactly this type of room. He made a copy of my email and told us: Well, too bad... no apology, nothing. In the end he offered us a free breakfast but we were already too late and had to catch our flight.
