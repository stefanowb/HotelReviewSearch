From our first spectacular views of the Old City through the lovely arched windows, continuing into the well-appointed rooms, and breathtaking pool area, we were delighted to be guests of this special hotel. Breakfasts were delicious and robust (mind-boggling selections at the buffet - and all wonderful and fresh!), and the location is the best in Jerusalem. We loved sunsets and sunrises there, and the calm and beauty that the hotel offers guests. This was a particularly important trip for my family - it was celebrating our 13 year-old daughter's Bat Mitzvah at the Western Wall - and my husband, daughter, 10-year old son and I all agreed that this was our most favorite of all the many properties we have stayed with in Jerusalem. The staff was friendly and helpful, and Michal at the front-desk was always a delight! I strongly recommend the Mount Zion Hotel to my friends and business colleagues!

The beds, bath and tv were nothing special (in fact most of our tour group said \"Are you kidding?\" on first viewing the rooms. However, we spent very little time in our room The hotel is relatively close to the Old City (I like to walk but even the non walkers in our tour made it for shopping) and the King David Hotel, Mamila area, Jaffa Gate and German section. There were many nice early morning walks and good choices for dinner nearby. I loved the breakfast options even on the Sabbath when only cold foods were available-though liking cheese, bread and salads is a plus for breakfast in Israel-there are great eggs and fish too. For the views, location, and breakfast, I would recommend this hotel if the price is right. Internet was $10 for an hour but you could use the time all day from 8am to 11pm in segments.

Although the hotel has elevators, the rooms with baclonies require climbing one flight of stairs. The views from the room's balcony of the Dormition and of Silwan are gorgeous and unbeatable. We paid $300 for this room. There was a welcome platter of fresh and dried fruit. The room's furniture was rather basic: twin beds which were very narrow (almost fell out of bed when tossing over), a small TV, a small refrigerator (no minibar), a closet with a safe, a couple of chairs and a tiny table. There were also a table and chairs on the balcony, and at our request we also got a parasol. The balcony's railing (Actually it's a wall) is approx'ly 4 feet high, which means that you need to stand in order to see the view. The bathroom was OK although there was some hair in the sink. The service was fair at best. While we were in our room, the door suddenly opened and in walked an employee and asked if we needed more towels... (I suppose it is possible that he had knocked and we didn't hear.) It was a big challenge to hook up to the wi fi system (additional fee), and my request that someone come up to our room to assist us was denied; after I finally hooked up, the signal kept going off. The swimming pool was wonderful, and the gardens leading to it are very lush. However, the swimming pool closes at 5 PM (Sunset is after 7 PM). We did not try the spa. Breakfast was fine, with the obligatory zillion different cheeses and herrings and olives. All considered, the price seemed rather steep, but I'd go back for that view. A word about the location: while it is possible to walk to the Old City and to downtown West Jerusalem, it is a good walk and you may prefer to take a taxi (There are no buses near the hotel).", "title": "Fantastic views", "user": "danielbgadish", "date": "April 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 61976277}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel looks amazing.

The rooms are renovated, clean and have middle eastern decor. Service was professional, solicitous and friendly. Breakfast was fantastic. Grounds and views are breathtakingly beautiful - probably the reason there were functions held there almost every night of our 6 day stay. That can be a problem however - due to noise from band. We were VERY disappointed that the pool closed at 5 pm - presumably this was because of the outdoor functions that took place on a terrace beside the pool and their desire not to have bathers within eyeshot of attendees of events. If you are touring Jerusalem in the warm months you'll find it a disappointment that you can't take a leisurely swim in the evening. Only other criticism is that some rooms require climbing half or whole staircase to access them (even though there is an elevator the rooms are not all on the same level on a particular floor) and not much choice in restaurants in the immediate area.
