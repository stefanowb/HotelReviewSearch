The big problem was that despite believing I'd booked 7 twin rooms, most of the rooms allocated turned out to be doubles - meaning many of the men ended up sharing a bed!

The taxi was only 7 euros but we later found out that we were only yards from the underground which is downstairs in the corner of the station in front of the departure board (go to exit near the dom cathedral square). If we had managed to find it then taking the number 16,17,18 or 19 train/tram would have taken us to barbarosoplatz station which is only about 30 metres back up the line to the Ibis hotel so if you look out the right hand window of the train before it pulls in you'll probably see the hotel.
