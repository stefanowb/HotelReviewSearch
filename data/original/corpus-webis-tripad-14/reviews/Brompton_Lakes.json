Other lodge owners should come and take a master class from Brompton, they have thought of everything in the lodges. We came armed with all our usual self catering items for the kitchen but everything and more was already there. We were two families with children aged 6 and 4, the site was great no kids play area but we didn't need one with the paths to explore on foot and on bike, boules, tennis, basketball, not forgetting the fish, ducks and geese that were so much fun to feed. The children also loved the river with their fishing nets. We stayed in Florence and cannot recommend it enough the weather was great on arrival but was chillier the other two days which was a shame as with the decking and views we would quite happily spent the time relaxing on the deck. The colder nights did mean we got the chance to light the fabulous log fire, yes they get hot but the lovely lady had already explained that on arrival, kids were great, looked at it but steered clear as they were told to. All in all a brilliant time we will definately be looking for an opportunity to return ...we would happily live there.......cannot reccomend it highly enough.", "title": "Fabulous !!!

As 6 long term friends,who frequently go away for 'girlie' breaks,we have visited some very pleasing (and not so pleasing)properties.....but we have to say that this is most definitely the best yet!!! Our lodge was 'Rebecca' and everything about it was superb...we faced the evening sun..and may I say,we were well and truly blessed with beautiful weather,so that was an added bonus! You can be as lazy or as active as you wish and the staff are very pleasant and helpful. It's a very short car ride into Richmond,which is a very pretty market town...and it's definitely worth a visit to 'The White Swan'pub just before you enter Richmond....the Sunday lunch was excellent and well worth the \u00a36.99...the meats were beautiful and tender. Anyway,back to the lodges,they are designed to offer you plenty of privacy but if sitting on your veranda,you can watch the activities of your neighbours.The wild life is lovely and we were lucky enough to see 11 new born ducks visit us daily with their mum to be fed..so sweet! Excellent place to visit...the previous reviews also say it all. Our advice...you have to go there!!!!

The oven which we used every day friday to sunday was spotless which is hard when they no doubt get abused on a regular basis. I would like to think that we left he place almost as we found it and this is partly to do with the fact that it is so immaculate when you arrive..... However enough of the cleanliness aspect. We are a group of ten women who come to Brompton to chill out, eat ,drink and play games around the fire. Brompton is perfect for this on a chilly January day.
