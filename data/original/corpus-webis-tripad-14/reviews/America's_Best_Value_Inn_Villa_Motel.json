I wanted her to see the cool little town of Manitou Springs and all of the B&Bs were either booked, too expensive, didn't take kids or had a two-night minimum. So we stayed at the Villa Motel. The staff was friendly. We had a ground-floor room with 2 queen beds. It was clean and spacious, but very old-style motel, nothing modern about it (which was fine-it reminded us of our customary NC beach motel except in the mountains). The beds were okay, not great. Shower had good water pressure. So the essentials were met. The walls were thin though, and it was interesting explaining to my daughter what she was hearing from next door at 3 am. There was some road noise, and and footsteps above us. There were a lot of Harley folks staying there that night for some reason, who were up at 6 and hollering at each other in the parking lot. So I guess noise was a factor for us, but that's not the hotel's fault.

The cabin we were assigned was the very first one and had no carport which was disappointing. We had to park in front of a tree in the one-way driveway which was kind of a pain to get out of. This is an older hotel but the room was big and clean and had a nice closet area where you can set your luggage. There was no refrigerator or microwave (which was fine with us but some may want that). The bathroom was clean but there was nowhere to put shampoo/soap, etc., while taking a shower except on the edge of the tub. Also, there was no hair dryer. The night we stayed was chilly and the only heat was via a window air conditioner unit and the heat was luke warm at best. The next morning I went to the office and told them the heat was not working properly and that we didn't have a hair dryer. I was told that the cabins don't have hair dryers but there was one I could borrow (which turned out to have been stolen). I asked if we could move to another room and the woman told me that it would cost $94 to move to the \"motel\" side of the place... but those rooms did have hair dryers. So I went one block down to the Eagle Motel and got a room for $64 that was much better and had awesome heat. The plus of this place is that it is a short walk to historic Manitou Springs downtown and also close to a 24-hour laundry mat which was very helpful. Overall, I would recommend this hotel but just know what you are going to get for your money. I would stay here again but not in the cabins and not for the price they charge. I don't believe it is that great of a value for $79 and I refuse to pay $94 just for the convenience of having a hair dryer!", "title": "Not worth the $79 rate", "user": "moonpie63", "date": "October 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 45670857}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled solo", "text": "The motels in Manitou Springs are mostly older and worn.
