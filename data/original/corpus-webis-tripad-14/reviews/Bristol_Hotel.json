The hotel was kind of pricey but well worth it! The staff are very helpfull and professional. The hotel comes with complimentary wifi in the room you stay in....it was a bit slow, but a nice convenience. The hotel has valet parking that costs about $26 per night but if you have a hybrid car it costs about half that. The room was cute and we could see the ocean from our window. The bed was very comfortable and there is an ipod docking station in the room as well as a flat screen tv and fridge. The hotel has a restaraunt and other numerous places to eat around the hotel as well as a grocery store (i think its a ralphs) down the street. The hotel is walking distance to the downtown area which we enjoyed very much. If you go downtown and like pubs i reccomend The Field for food and drink....try the boxties they are amazing! We drove to sea world which is really easy to get to from the hotel...it maybe took us 15 minutes to drive there. There are busses and trolleys right next to the hotel if you are interested in using that. after all the fees (like valet parking) the hotel came out to about $170/night. If that is too much for u i reccomend looking into staying into the little Italy area of san diego like the porto vista hotel or la pensione which will be anywhere from $100-$130/night.", "title": "Great hotel in awesome location!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bolderdash", "date": "July 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 71285984}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is right on the edge of the Gaslamp Quarter, within walking distance to all restaurants and stores but without all the noise when you are trying to sleep.
