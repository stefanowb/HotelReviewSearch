The location near Pacific Heights is a big advantage and the rooms are clean and well decorated. There is a feeling of intimacy and coziness which is hard to find in a big city. The staff are helpful and accomodating. And parking in their garage is free. The rooms overlooking Presidio Avenue are a little noisy so I would ask for a room toward the rear and/or on an upper floor. The rooms on the other side are quiet but more expensive as they have a view. When I complained about the noise I was told that the room I had been given was for internet reservations and that to get the best room and rate I should call the hotel directly.", "title": "Good value, great location", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "EB3", "date": "February 7, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3167672}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A unique place to stay", "text": "One of the attractions of the Laurel Inn is that it is in a nice, more residential neighborhood, with shops and restaurants nearby. It is a bit removed from more touristy areas, such as Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square, but public transportation can get you there and back (however, while the buses ran quite frequently during the day, they are not as frequent at night and it took a while longer to get back to the hotel). Our room was 316 (two doubles with a kitchenette) with a view overlooking Presidio Avenue. The room was quite spacious and we were very impressed with the attention to detail. The furnishing, lighting and other decorative touches were done very creatively. The bathroom was small, with only a shower, but once again the amenities (Aveda products, fresh flowers, egyptian cotton towels) more than made up for it. We enjoyed the other amenities the hotel had to offer--onsite parking, continental breakfast, cookies and lemonade in the afternoon. We did find that staying next to a major city street was quite noisy during the day (those garbage collectors have early hours!), but did quiet down at night.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 4, 2004", "id": 2381701}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A great hotel in a great location", "text": "If there was just one negative that prevents me from giving this hotel a 5-star rating, it is the inconsistency of the front desk staff. There were at least three wonderfully friendly people manning the front desk who went out of their way to be helpful. However, there were two sour people in particular who made you feel like you were imposing with every request. It is not enough of a negative to keep me from staying at this charming hotel again, but it would be nice if all the front desk personnel had the same customer service skills.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Doubtful60", "date": "July 7, 2004", "id": 2281742}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "We checked out first morning", "text": "On arriving at 3AM after a 6 hour drive we were delighted with our room (a king kitchenette) and the view from it.
