I am a former airline employee and have travelled extensively. The Fajardo Inn was honestly the cleanest place I have ever stayed- and I have stayed in far more expensive places.

Personnel always had time to answer questions, make suggestions, and always treated each guest like they were there just to insure a good vacation. The grounds are beautiful, well-maintained, and the pool area 5 star. Lots for kids and adults to do and yet very relaxing. Mexican restaurant on premises delicious and very reasonable.

When we went to use the pool only 2 people were allowed to use the pool and the additoinal person my 3 year would have to pay 21 dollars per day in order to use the facilities (mini golf, pool, ect) or I would have to book an additonal room and spend the night away from my family. So if you arrive let say at 6:00PM and the pool closes at 8:00PM you still have to pay 21 dollars for the use of the pool... $21 dollars for 2 hours is quite expensive plus $21 for every additonal day. As a consumer these rules are ridiculous. When talking to the hotel Manager the first words out of her mouth were NO you may not use the pool unless you pay the aditional fee weather its 2 hours or the full day you still have to pay for the 3rd person. In my opinion no minor child should have to pay an additonal $21 fee to use the pool especially a daily fee - one of the reasons for choosing this hotel was becaus our son loves the pool. On our second stay we stayed from Sat thru Mon. Sat and Sunday we went out on our boat so we did no use the ameneties. On monday we planed to spend the afternoon at the pool. Check out was at 11:00AM... so we Had breakfest at there restaurant and check out and planed to use the pool for the remaining of the afternoon because well we promised our 3 year old that we would take him to the pool. When we went to pool again we were told we could use the pool not because of the $21 fee but becuase you are no longer alowed to use the pool or any of the hotel amenities once you have check out or before you have checked in. Again we talked with the hotel Manager (VERY RUDE and UNPROFESIONAL LADY)... Her very first words were NO - NO you may not use the pool if you have check out of the hotel. My son bursted in tears... so did my wife becuase she would have to brake her promise to my son . We asked the hotel manager if she would make an exception for that day since we had promised our son we would take him to the pool.

beach but 10 minutes or so away.For the price, it is really a great value.The El Conquistador is much nicer and more luxurious but much more expensive.Some of the other reviewers did not have some items in their rooms, but we did.We had a coffee maker,hair dryer,iron, soap,etc.Our room did have a king size bed with extra pillows.The view was not great, but it matched the price.The floors are all tile and the maids clean them daily but I found a mat outside the room would have kept alot of dirt from being tracked in.I was annoyed by it and did wear my socks in the room to keep the dirt off my feet.Our room was very large and the furnishings were nice.The bathroom & shower(no tub) were small and did lack robe hooks,etc.There was only 1 towel bar.There was a dispenser in the shower with shower gel & shampoo.The pools are both really nice and there is even putt putt($3.00 I think.)There is a waterslide & small lazy river type area.It is really great for kids.There were always plenty of chairs open.The hotel is not in a resort type place but after we were there a night we did not mind.Seven Seas beach is about 10 minutes away and Luquillo about 20 minutes.We looked at these beaches and thought they were very dirty and gross.Take the ferry to Culebra for the day for the best beaches in the Caribbean.Playa Flamenco & the others are the best.There are a stray cats & dogs around the hotel( and all of PRico.)I bought pet food at the grocery store in Fajardo and fed them daily while there.We did not eat at the hotel.We ate at the Golden Bagel for breakfast & lunch.We tried Rosa's seafood for dinner 1 night.It was good,not fabulous, but good.I would eat there again.The flan was very good.We also ate at Restaurant Pasion something on the road towards the marina,Seven Seas beach, & the El Conquistador.It is on the left as you go up a hill.It was fabulous.Excellent service.Great skirt steak with tamarind sauce.Great fresh fish and shrimp.Yummy desserts.We have been to Puerto Rico quite a few times and have stayed in Old San Juan,Rincon,Culebra,etc.This trip was not about the beach for us- we were visting friends in Cayey-so we did not have to stay in a beach front resort.If you can stay at a really nice beach front resort, then do it.If you need to watch your money,stay at the Fajardo Inn.It is really a very beautiful property-similar to a better Holiday or Hampton Inn.It is very close to alot of things.The area around the hotel looks run down, but it isn't really.The people around the area are all different types of people.It is not a slum.Puerto Rican houses are different than American houses- they have flat roofs because of hurricanes,etc & most do have ornate iron gates & fences so it is more difficult to see people in their yard,etc.I did enjoy my stay at the hotel.", "title": "Just OK", "user": "Etoile983", "date": "April 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value":
