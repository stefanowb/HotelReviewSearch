The second night we were there the water from the air conditioning unit was dripping really loudly so we called to get it fixed. We had to call twice, because it took so long for someone to come up to our room. Then the only remedy was for us to move rooms and maintenance said that still would not guarantee that the new room would be drip free. So, he suggested turning the air up to 73 degrees. Our room was then stuffy, and we could still here the dripping. After we finally got to sleep, we were woken up, by someone placing the bill under our door and knocking at it at 5:45 AM. We were also still amazed that at the price we paid, there was not free high speed internet offered. We got complimentary slow internet, but it was faster using my iphone's wireless network.

The rooms and bathrooms are unusually large and comfortable, and the public spaces are outstanding. The revolving restaurant on top of the tower is great fun, although the food is a bit inconsistent and overpriced. The pool area also looked nice, although we came out of season. My biggest complaint is that the staff fell down in lots of small ways -- for example, when we went for a cup of complimentary coffee, the dozens of boxes of tea on display proved to be mostly empty and no one seemed to care when I reported it. Similarly, although there was a doorman on duty at all times, he spent most of his time chatting to other staff members and never seemed to notice when you actually needed a hand to get your luggage through the door.

We have stayed at the Marriott in Florence before so we were prepared for a fabulous stay. The rooms are perfect, the hotel is clean and the views are worth the stay. The pool is where it's all happening in the summer. Lots of folks were out socializing and soaking up the rays. There was always a musician either in the bar or out by the pool (which kind of got on my nerves after a while).We were stunned by the lack of service we received however. 1st nite, we had friends meet us for dinner at one of the restaurants on the hotel property. We sat outside and were promptly forgotten, literally. After about 20 minutes waiting for our waiter to take our order ( and it was not crowded in the restaurant at all) we had to go ask for someone to wait on us. It was a slow and painful process. Same in the bar afterward. We only got one drink and gave up. The next day at the pool, a server came by around lunch and said she would take care of us for the day. After getting a coke and a tea, we tipped big in hopes it would ensure she got by to wait on us often. it didn't work. She never came back. My husband walked over to where she was and placed an hour, which we never got. We ended up getting our own drinks at the bar. We vowed never to return and we won't. I've stayed at many Marriotts across the country, but this was the worst service ever. We are not lazy, service snobs. We're middle America folks who only want what we pay for.

Now to start with the pool-loved it, inside and outside(couldn't bring your own drinks poolside but they sold them, this can get very expensive if with large family). The room was absolutely beautiful with a balcony overlooking the pool. The bar happy hr was great and we enjoyed a bit of food as well and it was delicious.
