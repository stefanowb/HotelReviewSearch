The hotel is located directly across the street from the Casino and there are sidewalks to make navigation to the Casino easy. And a couple minutes drive is Magnetic Hill (Zoo and Waterpark). The hotel was very clean and I never one noticed deficiencies in this respect. I even noticed cleaning staff cleaning behind the guest washers/dryers\u2026 when was the last time you did that at your home? The beds, though a little high, are clean and provide a good night sleep. There is adequate water pressure and hot water even during peak morning usage times. During the off-season, it is possible to find a room for less than $100 per night though the summer peak season will find high rates. The room d\u00e9cor is fine, though just on the edge of going into the \u201coutdated\u201d category. Some of the ground floor rooms provide individual exterior entrances (much like a motel) and the hotel is \u201cpet friendly\u201d. The front desk staff was very courteous. The onsite breakfast offers something for everyone and is a welcomed start to the day. If the hotel was not in the location that it is, I would most likely give an overall rating of \u201cthree (3)\u201d.

The friendly desk clerk suggested a small suite which was nice, but a little pricier than we had wanted. However, we took it and had a nice evening there.

The pool and breaktfast did not disappoint. Lots of hot and cold choices, and a decent sized room so chances are you could find a table. Also the best hotel coffee I've had. The pool was warm and the hot tub was comfortable. The rooms were a little musty but clean. We had some problems. First, we were travelling with a person who needs a wheel chair. We had requested a room close to a door, which they did provide, But all the doors have lips on the floor, and in order to get the chair in and out, we would have to get the person to stand up, walk in, and then we used the chair after that. The staff were helpful in trying to deal with this, and in the end, we were given a room with a drive up, so we just let the person out, and they only had to walk right into the room. We did have some other problems, such as a broken lamp. In all fairness, the staff were more than nice about it, and the manager gave us a nice amount of Priority Club points for this.
