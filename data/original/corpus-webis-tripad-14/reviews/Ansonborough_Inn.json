We all had separate rooms, each of which were exceptional. Exceptionally large rooms, some with separate sitting areas separated by stairs, or by a wall and a door. Television in both the bedroom and the sitting room. All rooms with king sized beds. Some are 4 poster antique beds! The owners took great care in creating a luxury of the past. Antiques and high quality artwork adorn the entire property. Mini refrigerators, microwaves, and sinks are in each room. I understand that this is the \"low\" season in Charleston, but I would still expect to pay over $200 a night based on the size of the room alone. Our reservations were $169/night. They offer a complimentary breakfast every morning, consisting of fresh fruit, cereal, oatmeal, bagels, muffins, etc, and offers a \"happy hour\" in the afternoon with complimentary wine, cheese, crackers, and various dips (request that they make the artichoke dip for a night while you're there!). If ever I make plans to go to charleston for fun, I will definately consider booking here.
