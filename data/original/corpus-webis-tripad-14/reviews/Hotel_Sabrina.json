I knew I wasn't going to be happy from the minute I walked into the lobby (about 10 square feet) and discovered that my room was on the third floor and no elevator. I struggled with my suitcase up three flights of stairs only to find one of the worst rooms I have ever seen. It had one bulb in the ceiling to light the entire room and no reading lights near the bed. The bathroom was tiny and not very clean...and the odor was just overwhelming. I was forced to stay one night but got out of there the very next morning and found another hotel. Other reviewers have tried to pass this hotel off as a charming bed and breakfast type establishment, but there is charming and then there is dump - Hotel Sabrina falls into the latter category.", "title": "Three stars are just a joke!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "ntfinn", "date": "November 29, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 6305737, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of lighting and smell"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great hotel!", "text": "We stayed in the top floor suite of Hotel Sabrina. The management is very friendly and accomodating. The grandmother serves the breakfast in the morning and makes \"to-order\" coffee of choice. The bathroom showers are pretty small but that is pretty normal in Italy. The location was phenomenal as a walk to the center was only three minutes. Very close to cafe's and shopping.

Both double rooms were very comfortable, clean and quiet. The breakfast was large and delicious, including homemade bread & jam, cereal, yogurt, juice and cappuccino. It's a very short walk from the town center. We travelled by train & bus so driving & parking wasn't a concern. Not all the staff spoke English (but it is Italy) but we had no trouble communicating with our very limited Italian.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 13, 2006", "id": 5065246}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Don't believe Sabrina's 3-star rating", "text": "The price was very reasonable at 75 Euro (off season rate).", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 23, 2005", "id": 4045722}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Tuscany", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 6, "very good": 12, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 21}, "aka": "Sabrina Hotel Cortona", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "The Hotel Sabrina, located in the historical center of Cortona is in a fine, old sixteenth century building, once the residence of the famous sculptor Fabbrucci; it offers its guests a warm and friendly atmosphere with simply but tastefully furnished rooms.
