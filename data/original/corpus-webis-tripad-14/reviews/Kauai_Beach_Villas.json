Unit was average in size for a 2 bedroom but very tired and run down. Reservations were for an ocean view but that didn't happen. There was no view unless you like to watch at the Hilton Hotel driveway across the lagoon. Could see the spa and workout room across the water but could not use them. The pool area was average for a motel 6 on the interstate. The resort as a whole was was a big let down. We spent the $15.00 a day to enjoy the Hilton Pool next door, service and staff there were much better.The staff was lacking in service, maintenance crew was uninterested in making accommodation's when they turned off the water for several hours one day. Lihue is a great central location on the island, but these villas aren't the vision of Hawaii you have, however the Windham Resorts has purchased the property and that may give hope to a major renovation, the only way we would come back.

There were two large bedrooms, a large kitchen, dining room area, two full bathrooms, and a large living room area. There was also a deck with a table, chairs, and a lounge chair. The amount of space was awesome particularly as we had four people staying there comfortably, but you could have had six easily.

This was the first time we were at this resort. Being at numerous Wyndham locations, this was somewhat a letdown. However, I think they are in the process of making changes. I know part was owned by Pahio, etc. To get to it all, it does have large units and a decent lanai. It is outdated a bit, but it definitely is livable. The rooms have all the amenities with kitchens, washer dryer, etc. The pool is hideously small along with the hottub. It sounds ridiculous to say that the pool is not heated because you are in Hawaii. However, the weather gets very chilly at night and the pool never warms up. Picture immersing yourself in a bathtub filled with only the cold water faucet. Needless to say not many people swim unless it is extremely hot out. People complain that the roosters crow all the time, yes they do. Shut your windows if that is a problem. Chickens run this island. The dirt race track only goes on weekends. Who sits in their room all day to hear it? It is not that bad I don't think. There is a lagoon out in the middle with cute ducks and black swans swimming. Very entertaining if you get a unit with that view. The grounds are kept nice, and the staff is personable.The airconditioning in the bedrooms are sticking out onto the lanais from the bedrooms. They are all rusted, and there is paint and ick falling all over the lanai. The ones facing the ocean are absolutely gross looking and makes a person definitely not want to turn it on. I know, salt water does damage. I think that would be why they need central air. However, on this island you really don't need it. It is never too hot from my experience. So. all in all, it is okay. You are centrally located to get to the southern or northern end, and you are close to the airport.
