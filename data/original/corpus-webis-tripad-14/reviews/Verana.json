Mornings began with your choice of coffee or selection of teas and a pastry quietly delivered outside your house at around 6:30 am. It was great enjoying your first cup of coffee at your convenience on your private patio without getting dressed first. Breakfast included coffee or tea and freshly squeezed O.J. and a hot entree from a list of about 8 selections. Lunch included fresh juice which changed daily, a selection from about 5 appetizers and 5 entrees and a light dessert. Dinner included a \u2018bar bite\u2019, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. There are no choices at dinner. The food was very tasty, plentiful, fresh and healthy. Julian is an excellent chef, Alfredo is a gracious waiter, and Kiki is a fun bartender. Our only criticisms are that it would be nice to have a selection at dinner, we craved carbs; (there are no buns or bread served with any meal), selections at breakfast and lunch were frequently unavailable, and as someone with a sweet tooth the desserts were too small; (probably for the best)!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 24, 2009", "id": 49992933}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "POOL: The pool area, like everywhere at Verana has amazing views.
