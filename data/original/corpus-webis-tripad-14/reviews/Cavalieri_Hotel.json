The location was superb with many of our favourite restaurants and bars just a short walk away and the chance to walk past the cat village every day! The hotel itself was excellent. The rooms were large and comfortable with a lovely sea view and great facilities. It was lovely to be able to make a coffee in the room before and after breakfast. The minibar had space to fit a pint of milk and some juice in as well which was handy! We also found the free safe convenient and easy to use. The breakfast was excellent with one of the best choices i've seen. The made to order omelettes were particularly good, as were a lot of the healthy options. We also used the hotel bar which was very reasonably priced for a 4* hotel- 0nly \u20ac12 for 3 glasses of wine and a pint of Cisk! We travelled in January and it was quite cold out but we used the indoor pool every morning and it was lovely-nicely heated! All in all an ideal hotel!", "title": "Excellent Stay", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "saoirsechick", "date": "March 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125539901}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Don't listen to \"moaning Minnies\"", "text": "I can only assume that some people get some sort of perverse pleasure out of slagging off hotels.

Personally I had a great time from the moment I arrived. Room overlooking the bay was excellent, chambermaids smiley and kept the room nice and clean. Breakfast excellent, plenty of choice. I did ask the manager one morning why I could only plug in the television or the fridge at one time he replied with a big smile on his face \"which would you prefer\" we both laughed and he sorted it within ten minutes. Pool area is a sun trap all day long. Ed the barman is a star, great service and lots of magic tricks.

We looked forward every morning to our breakfast - and got very excited if the pancake station was operating! The hotel is in a quiet area, but the perfect location for bars and restaurants as everything was in walking distance. All the rooms have a sea view which was also a bonus. Our only criticism was that the reception staff, although very friendly, didn't always know the answers to some of our basic questions. For example, what bus we would need to get to a certain tourist site. We spent one day travelling for 3 hours on 3 different buses after being given the wrong information.

The hotel is in a great spot with a lovely sun terrace with views across Spinola Bay at the front and views over Portomaso Marina to the rear. Our room had a balcony overlooking marina and we paid \u00a332 per night for the room through Travel Republic which included breakfast. Breakfast was great, all the typical fry up stuff, cereals, pastries, fruit etc and some mornings there was an omelette or pancake chef. We didn't try the hotel restaurants in the evening but other guests that we spoke to seemed pleased with them as a lot of people were staying long term half board through winter. Location is 2 mins walk from the restaurants of St Julians and 5 mins walk to the livelier nightlife of Paceville. There is a bus stop at the top of the street with regular service to Sliema, Bugibba & Valletta. We paid 2.60 euros each return to Valletta and buses are very frequent. We only had a drink in the hotel bar one night as it closed quite early, but this is maybe dependent on how busy it is. Drinks were more expensive than in resort (2.50 euros for half a lager) but not excessive for hotel prices if you wanted a quiet night and the bar does overlook the bay. Rooms were clean and the staff were pleasant.
