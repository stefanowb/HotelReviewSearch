Typically (very) tiny Japanese rooms with the usual Toto automatic closet and shower+bath, small TV (only Japanese channels) and work table, free internet access, reasonable breakfast. Nothing to rave about, nothing to complain about. If the location is convenient and you don't require anything fancy, go for it. Get an upgrade to the Deluxe single or double room if you want more space.", "title": "Standard and Adequate Business Hotel", "user": "sankar", "date": "September 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 43836121, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Free Internet Access", "disliked": "\u2014 Tiny, tiny rooms"}}], "location": {"country": "Japan", "region": "Tohoku", "continent": "Asia"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 4, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 0.625}
