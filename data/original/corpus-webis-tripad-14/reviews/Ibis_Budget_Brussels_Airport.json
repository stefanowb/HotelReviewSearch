We booked ahead at the rate of 42 euros. Check in was very smooth and despite arriving several hours before noon, we were granted access to our room right away. The rooms are extremely small but served our purpose well; we only wanted to sleep and shower after a long flight. The room was a little bit stuffy, but we opened the window for a breeze. If there was air conditioning, we did not find it. The bed was a little hard. The shower was very small but everything was clean and properly functioning. There is no hair dryer but a dispenser of hand soap/shampoo is offered. There is a shuttle that runs to and from the airport, which was very convenient and saved us money, although it only runs at certain times so be sure to check with the front desk. Overall I would describe the Etap as a high end hostel offering", "title": "no frills but just fine", "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "September 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117875811}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Etap Diegem", "text": "private rooms at a very good price, or an extremely budget hotel that is clean and perfect for a short stay.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 9, 2011", "id": 117853116}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled solo", "text": "I was pleased with the value and quality which is very consistent across the Accor group at each brand level.", "title": "Refunded mistaken booking without a problem! - Good PR and Management", "user": "SliderDublin", "date": "August 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117495315}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled solo", "text": "However i do not like being told how long a review must be if the review is a voluntary exercise, this is a really inappropriate constraint and I expect many customers will simply not file a review if you impose these conditions.

The car park (shared with several other hotels) is paying - at the time of my stay, it cost 8 Euros for one night's parking. Once I had found a space, I went into the hotel and was greeted politely.
