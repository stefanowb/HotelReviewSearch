We parked our rental car in a garage underneath for their guests only. It was alot more than we expected. $35 a day!! But everyone rides bikes so I guess parking is very limited. The lobby was ok. All the hotels we stayed in had the entry key for the elevators which is a great safety feature. We were upgraded without asking to an Executive Room on the 6th Floor. Thank goodness for that. It was the smallest room we had. It did overlook the Square which I really liked. Noise was no problem unless the window was open. The beds were horrible. They were so thin and soft that when you got up you almost slid off the bed onto the floor. Gave us something to laugh about. The pillows were tiny and useless. The bathroom was nice with a full tub and lots of space. The rooms were spotless. The staff were ok but gave us the wrong directions and we walked about 1mile out of our way? Because of the beds I would definitely check out hotels nearby such as the Radisson as the location was perfect. We did the canal tour which was fabulous. Went to Trivoli Gardens which was included in our room price and I was glad as $15 admission each was alot to walk around an amusement park that really wasn't that impressive. We loved Rosie McGee's just around the corner for late night entertainment and the Hard Rock was just ok. There were lots of pubs and eateries in every direction. The Little Mermaid needs to be put in the water away from tourists climbing all over it. Couldn't even get a decent picture. And yes in Copenhagen everyone seems to smoke. And they allow it in all the bars and restaurants. Well if you are 15 you can buy alcohol! But we enjoyed the freedoms we no longer have at home tremedously.
