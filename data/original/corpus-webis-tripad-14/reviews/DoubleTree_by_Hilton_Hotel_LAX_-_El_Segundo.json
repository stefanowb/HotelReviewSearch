We stayed here for 2 nights going and coming from Thailand, and really enjoyed our stay here. The advertised 'comfy' beds were just that and the friendly check in, the warm and delicious cookie, airport shuttle, and super quiet rooms were great!", "user": "emeritus", "date": "December 3, 2006", "id": 6320523}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best ever Park-and-Fly experience at LAX!", "text": "Only downside to my mind was a shuttle driver on coming back to the hotel for the second visit who didn't help get the luggage off the shuttle; and the rather expensive breakfasts. It is a comfortable walk to several coffee shops, an IHOP, Sizzler, McDonald's, a Ralph's supermarket, and some specialty restaurants which might be a better bet. We also walked to Manhattan Mall (about 2 miles return - but a welcome stretch after 19 hours in an airplane) which had some great shops and loads of restaurants (Coco's, California Pizza Kitchen, Chili's and several others). I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone looking for a great stay near LAX. I'd choose a different hotel on the beach in Marina del Ray if I were looking for a longer stay property to explore Los Angeles.", "user": "SkipperB", "date": "October 25, 2006", "id": 6011468}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I've done my research, and Chose this hotel!", "text": "We've stayed at several hotels prior to departing from LAX, and this Doubletree was by far the best we've ever experienced.", "user": "krzypanchito", "date": "October 25, 2006", "id": 6008839}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "loved the Doubletree", "text": "We paid about $180.00, which included 10 days of parking for our car and one of the best night's sleep we've ever had prior to a trip!", "user": "chewpei", "date": "October 24, 2006", "id": 6007213}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best LAX option", "text": "It's a few miles away from the airport, which works in its favor because it's nice and quiet.
