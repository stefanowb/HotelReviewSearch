Wine and cheese tasting at night and all the local restaurant menus on hand for you to peruse. Breakfast was to die for!

John is a great host and creates wonderful breakfast masterpieces. The first night innkeeper Lori recommended and made dinner reservations for us, the second night John did so also. The JPH innkeepers are well respected, so when they call to make reservations, you get a great table. It's the little things that make a big difference. The cute chocolate mint on the night stand, the \"killer\" cookies downstairs (with milk), the sound of the water fountain, the relaxing music CD player in the room, the room diary journal that has entries from thousands of people spanning over a decade, the Wine and Cheese hour in the evening is nice, meet people from various places, (and if you brought your laptop... the unadvertised linksys wireless open access internet access). In the past we've stayed one night, now we know that 2 nights are ideal to slow down and enjoy Cambria.
