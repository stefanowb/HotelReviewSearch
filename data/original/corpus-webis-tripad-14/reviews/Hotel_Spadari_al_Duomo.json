They are clean and modern, with nice bathrooms. The front desk are very friendly, and the guest books contain various reviews from celebrities. There is a small but nice breakfast buffet in the breakfast room around the corner from the lobby. We received a great restaurant recommendation from the front desk staff...Hostaria Borromei at 4-20123 Via Borromei. Phone 02.86453760. We arrived and the evening started with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine. It appears to be a family run restaurant that mostly caters to locals, and as a result, it has a great atmosphere with superb food. I had Caprese salad all through our Italian trip and this restaurant served the best I have ever had. The bocconcini cheese simply melts in your mouth.

What was amazing about the room was though we were on the first floor and faced the front of the hotel on Via Spadari, we heard no street noise because of the double glass windows. I've heard more street noise staying on the 45th floor in mid-town Manhatten. The Spadari's excellent location close to the cathedral and the galleria afforded us the opportunity to go back and forth to our hotel during the day. This was not a luxury we enjoyed in Rome where more reasonably priced hotels are miles from the main tourist attractions. The bed at the Hotel Spadari was comparable to a bed you would find at a Four Seasons or Fairmont Hotel in The States. We really enjoyed it. We also liked the contemporary decor of the room and hotel. The bathroom was very large, well lit, very clean, and the shower had six heads. The next morning, the hotel being just a couple of blocks from the Duomo subway station, we took the subway to the Cadorna station and caught the Malpensa Express train to the airport. Took 45 minutes and you just walk into Terminal 1. No worries about traffic delays. It was perfect! I loved Hotel Spadari and highly recommend it.

A class act all the way. Our room and bed were FANTASTIC-- beautifully modern and well done. Quiet. The best bathroom I saw during our long trip (Holland and Italy)--was at Spadari. The bath had two separate sinks (the secret to a happy marriage) and also a shower separate from the tub, and everything is gorgeous and well done. Towels, robes and slippers (yes!) and perfect lighting; great closets and shelving for the many treasures you will purchase in Milan. You also cannot ask for a better location, walking distance from the Duomo and the shopping meccas, as well as easily accessible via taxi and to and from the trains. The service was outstanding. I can't say anything negative about this hotel, and its wonderful people. Book immediately!!!
