The family running the guest house are charming and very helpful. The personal touch includes the best Italian coffee with freshly made cake to wake up to, and very informed suggestions as to where to explore and where to dine. The location could not be better, just around the corner from the fabulous Piazza Cattedrale. Spotlessly clean, classy place to stay in a city which is perfect for relaxing, wandering around the Renaissance streets and gardens, and very accessible, being on the main train line from Venice to Florence. Not at all touristy, and a short hop from Ravenna and Bologna.

Mrs. Orlandini is one of the best hostesses we have ever encountered anywhere in Europe. From the moment that you enter the Locanda, you are truly made to feel as if you are in your own home. From touring advice in the city, to the best local restaurants, Mrs. Orlandini and her husband insure that every day here will be a wonderful experience.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 13, 2005", "id": 3898643}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2004", "text": "The Locanda is not plush, so if you're looking for a five star experience, this is not the place. Rooms are typically European, on the small side, but bathrooms are lovely, breakfast is fabulous and the cappucino is some of the best in the city! Ferrara is a perfect base for exploring the region, being an hour or less from Venice, Verona, Ravenna and Bologna. The Locanda can also make arrangements for you to visit one of the spa villages less than an hour from the hotel, which is definitely something we will take advantage of on our next visit.
