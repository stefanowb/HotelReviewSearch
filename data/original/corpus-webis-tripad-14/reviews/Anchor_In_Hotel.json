Rooms were quite basic and very dark, situated around a small heated pool. Breakfast is good quality although limited to juice coffee bagels and muffins served from a small reception table between only 7-9am. Motel stocks menus for local resturants and we walked to Spankys Clam Shack but found food disappointing. 2 night stay overshadowed by very heavy rain which prevented us from going up into National park.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "TAmembers", "date": "September 13, 2006", "id": 5795439}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very Nice", "text": "This was a very nice hotel located a short distance from town.
