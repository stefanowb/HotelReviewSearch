It was newer and very nicely decorated. The breakfast buffet was very good, no need to eat out when you stay here! The staff was friendly and helpful at all times. The room had a screen between the bed and sitting area which was nice for us because my husband likes to go to sleep earlier than I do and I stayed up and read without bothering him. But the tv was across from the bed so if I had wanted to watch tv while he slept that wouldn't have worked. Now for the cons. One of the main things you go a hotel for is to sleep. The fan on the air/heat was the loudest I've ever heard. It was right next to the bed and blew ice cold air over you. I got up 4 times to change the setting as we were both freezing. The second night we bought a fan at the Big Lots close by and slept much better. That is until the people in the room above us got up early in the morning and it sounded like they were stomping as hard as they could. We literally had things vibrating in our room from their footsteps. This went on for 45 minutes and we were wide awake by that point. I don't know if they didn't put enough sound insulating material between floors or we had exceptionally large people above us. I noticed while in the bathroom that you could hear very clearly what what going on in the bathroom above also (yuck).

The breakfast was a decent waffle, yogurt fare, but included eggs and sausage and a really large seating area--with overflow. All in all I was very pleased--absolutely nothing to complain about. Oh, and because they probably get lots of kids sports teams, they have you sign a \"behavior\" agreement that you will keep kids from running and screaming all day and night--under the threat if being asked to leave.

And the pool uses excessive chlorine which fills the entire pool and the lobby area with its odor. There were only a small number of towels in the pool so kids were running back to their room dripping water all over the corridors and stairs. It is basically because the hotel is understaffed.
