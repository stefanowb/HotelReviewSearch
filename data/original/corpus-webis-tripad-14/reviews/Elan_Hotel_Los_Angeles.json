But behind the worst-of-the-sixties architecture lies a little gem of a hotel with a level of service and the kind of personal touches usually reserved for the most expensive upscale chains. The hotel plays subtly on that sixties look throughout its very 21st century operation: the reception staff are dressed in fawn suits and crew neck sweaters; the lobby is furnished in modern retro; even the name evokes the era of Englebert Humperdinck and Frankie Vaughn. The rooms are a real pleasure. There are only about 20 of them, on two floors, and they are furnished in relaxing creams and browns. Toiletries are top quality, and are presented pocketed in folded towels. A dressing gown hangs on the bathroom door. There's a minibar and a stock of snacks, but you're unlikely to go hungry, because the Elan Modern includes a buffet breakfast in the very reasonable price: cereals, eggs, bagels, muffins and yogurt without the usual $15 added to the bill. Now to what's not perfect. The rooms are centered around a little inner courtyard, and for inexplicable reasons, they leave a bright light on in the yard all night. This means your room is never dark, and in fact, I ended up hanging a bath towel over the top of the curtains to block out the glare. The obsession with bright light extends to the fitness room which is oppressively overlit; it's also pretty basic, but there's a proper gym just along the road if you want a more extensive selection of kit. Despite the irritations this hotel is hard to beat, whether you're a tourist or business traveller. The attractions of Beverley Hills - the shops of Rodeo Drive and the bars and restaurants of Santa Monica Boulevard - are just minutes away, and it's a short drive to the Hollywood hills and the film studios which are a must see for every tourist.

Bed was super-comfortable with high thread count linens. Bathroom was tiny but acceptable, bathrobes a nice touch. Common areas looked like they were either being renovated or in need of renovation but all in all, the Elan puts money into important stuff (bed, linens, funky decor, breakfast) and as for the rest, who cares if the hallway looks a little shabby. Finally, the front desk was phe-nomenal. I'm not usually a P.I.T.A. but I was without a car in LA and wanted to go to off-the-beaten-track places like Japantown and they helped me find bus routes to these random places even though they didn't know where they were - which means they took the time to research my P.I.T.A. requests - all with a smile. Finally, on the last night, I had planned to use my restaurant voucher but the place was closed on Monday nights and the front desk scored me a voucher to another restaurant even though we didn't make reservations like we were supposed to.

The bed comforter had stains all over and so did the carpet and headboard. The carpet edges were brown with dirt and were very frayed and tattered.
