They gave us a room anyway. We were put on the 6th floor next to the elevators. With a view of the roof but, who goes to Vegas to look out the hotel window! Unlike some reviewers that states problem with noise. We had two quite nights. The room was a bit small but, clean and comfortable. Maid service, like the rest of the staff was excellent! As for no doorman or bellhops. I did not receive these services at the Aladdin either and the room price was much higher. Gambling in all the downtown casinos was more favorable. If your looking for a posh hotel, stay on the strip. Just make sure to bring plenty of $$$. If your looking to beat the stress and the crowds make the smart choice. Stay downtown at the 4-Queens!!! We seen Gordie Brown next door at the Golden Nugget. Excellent show! The best of the 4 we seen.

Check in was less than a minute. Casino is easy to navigate and elevators for both towers easy to find. No security whatsoever checking keys at the elevators. Room was smaller than average motel 6. Bed was similar to sleeping on the floor in comfort level. TV had about 6 or 7 channels. I ended up watching the hotels ammenity channel over and over because the goon and his wife featured were funny to watch. They were SO excited to be at this hotel, it was comical. The worst part of this room was the bathroom. It was the smallest I have ever had. The missing shower tile had been placed on the toilet tank, probably by a guest years previous. The shower drain backed up in less than a minute so you would be mid calf deep in water. The water temp and pressure sucked big time. If you turned the temp up to a decent level, the plumbing behind the wall would vibrate VERY LOUDLY. This would continue to get progressively worse until the knob was backed off enough to give you a nice refreshing ARCTIC BLAST. It would cycle like that throughout the shower. I would not stay again, regardless of the 29 dollar Tuesday.
