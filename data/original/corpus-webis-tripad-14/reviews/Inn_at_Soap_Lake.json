{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 22, "name": "Inn at Soap Lake", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Beautiful grounds and nice, clean room", "text": "The Inn really is an inn, with narrow hallways and frilly decorations. There are newer cabin-style buildings which seemed to attract families. The room I had was on the ground floor and as someone else mentioned, you can hear every footstep above you, as well as showers in the room next to you. The payoff for ground floor is that it stays cooler and needs less of the AC, which was quiet, but smelled a little \"humid.\". The highlight was the grounds -- huge lawn broken up by rockeries and a generous amount of adirondack chairs grouped in the various parts of the garden. They have lovely beach access with chairs on the beach. Both nights I was there, after a great steak at Don's Restaurant, I relaxed in a chair on the lawn and watched the other guests and the sunset.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "msanta", "date": "August 5, 2012", "id": 136330551}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here for 2 nights July 8 2012.
