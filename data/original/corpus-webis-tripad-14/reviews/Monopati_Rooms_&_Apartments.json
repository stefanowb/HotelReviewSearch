We arrived with high expectations and were not disappointed. There is beauty and serenity at any time of day: from the relaxing and delicious breakfast on Isabelle's terrace in the morning, to the flowers, gorgeous views of the old town and beautiful blue sea, to evening's absolute quiet\u2013no cars!-moonlight, and stars. Our lodgings were spotlessly clean, quiet, and comfortable. We cooked our dinners and enjoyed them out on the terrace overlooking the sea. Be sure to go down to the sea for a swim and up the hill to explore the upper town. I recommend traveling light as it is a bit of a steep walk uphill to Monopati and the path a bit rocky, but it's worth it! Our conversations with Isabelle and Chris also made the visit very special, and we are grateful for their gracious hospitality.", "title": "Beauty all day long", "user": "Voyager028", "date": "June 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114918551}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Monemvasia is one of the most beautiful places in the world in my opinion. Remote and untouched, it remains as one of the last vestiges of a Greece before the days of large hotels, chain restaurants and tourists on every corner. The cobbled streets, local culture and swimming platform have given me some of my favorite and most cherished memories. It might not be for everyone, however. Its quaint and sleepy.

The room was spotless clean, and you could find everything you could think of. Even books to read, cd to listen... No TV available which was in full compliance with the environment. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you needed for a breakfast. The only minus was that it was not refilled (we did not get another milk and since we did not finished anything else I cannot say if they would refill it). No air condition in the rooms. Only in the living room where there was aircon + fire place + fan. However we did not need any, even it was the last weekend of October. Isabelle was very helpful. The location of the appartment is ideal since it is very close to the bridge. Isabelle has also provided with maps, walking tours, pizza delivery leaflet,etc. If you can avoid it don't eat in the castle. Very expensive for the quality you get. Definitely try the omelette at the cafe opposite Kanoni restaurant.

The house itself is comfortable and nicely decorated, though spread out on 4 levels so (as for Monemvasia itself) only for those who can handle many stairs! Monemvasia is pedestrian-only so you must park your car outside the city walls and walk in. To get to Monopati, you need to walk up many steps, but it is perfectly located in the center of Monemvasia, so you can walk up to the fort at the top (you're already halfway there!) or down to \"town\" easily. The bedrooms are unusual: the main bedroom in on the lowest level and is a bit cave-like, with one window that either is left with the curtains open (leading me to think a passerby could see in) or curtained and very dark. The kids' bedroom had two single beds on themselves two different levels. All the beds were comfortable, though, and the bathroom, though small, was clean and bright. Isabelle served us a delicious breakfast in her kitchen (too windy for the terrace that day) with homemade jams and preserves.
