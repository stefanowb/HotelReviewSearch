It is two blocks away from the Byward Market, directly across the street from the Rideau Centre and about a 10 minute walk from Parliament. My boyfriend and I were traveling on a budget and we were both amazed at the service of this hotel for the price. It was one of the most economical and the amenities in the room were great. This hotel is extremely modern, offers internet access, has a pool and work out room. We especially enjoyed the huge flat screen televisions on the wall. Fabulous time and the hotel staff were very knowledgeable.", "user": "Travel_by_Foot12", "date": "April 26, 2008", "id": 15383545}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Modern and convenient", "text": "I stayed at this hotel for a night. The thing that I liked the most was the modern design of the hotel room. It is very conveniently located. Only five-ten minutes walking distance away from Parliament Hill. Less than five minutes to Byward Market. Right across the street from Rideau Shopping Centre.

The rooms are stylish and impeccable. Bathrooms are better than other hotels in this price range. Room service arrives on time and the breakfast is quite passable if you want some eggs for a big day ahead. Breakfast in the resto is OK; the best thing is the bread, croissants, etc. The staff in the Novotel are very pleasant; I have never had a bad experience with them. The location is excellent and there is easy access to 417.", "user": "GarAsh", "date": "October 27, 2008", "id": 21320359}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "So, so", "text": "Downsides: Parking is expensive and service less than stellar in the garage. They are quite surly if you lose your ticket! As noted by other reviewers, you do not go to the Novotel to use the pool and you can expect to wait for the elevator.

The hotel is perfectly located (10-15 minute walk to major attractions e.g. house of parliament, market, museum of civilisation, and national gallery). The staff were pleasant and helpful. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was far better than expected. I was somewhat sceptical about a hotel that advertised that breakfast was included in the price. My experience with hotel breakfasts in North America has been abysmal at best -- usually a stale pastry, perhaps some fruit that is well past its prime, and some liquid that has only a very faint resemblance to coffee. However, the breakfast served at the Novotel was truly impressive. If we are ever in need of a hotel room in Ottawa we will definitely stay at the Novotel.", "user": "scurtis", "date": "August 17, 2008", "id": 19043164}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Suprised", "text": "S.Curtis", "user": "greenOtravels", "date": "July 31, 2008", "id": 18458628}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing hotel room", "text": "For some particular reason, I did not have high expectations when I made my reservation at the Novotel however, I was pleasantly suprised when I checked in. I was travelling on business and didn't get in until midnight, so I wasn't in the best mood, the agent at the front desk checked me in with exceptional service!

Staff was friendly. Room was standard and clean. The bathroom was roomy and attractive but unusually placed, being right next to the bed. There is also the bonus of being able to see the shadow of whomever was inside, because of the frosted door. Bathrooms were also not soundproofed very well. lol. Decor was fresh, with simple, modern lines. There were no in-and-out privileges for the parking lot, not that you would want to leave once you got in and actually found a spot, because it is cramped and busy, as it is not only used by Novotel patrons. Great location though, you can walk to plenty of great places if you haven't planned a detailed itinerary. I'll probably try something new next time I'm in Ottawa, but if I couldn't find a comparable rate, I would stay at the Novotel again. To resume, GOOD=location and cleanliness, BAD=parking lot.
