Quiche, homemade scones, muffins, granola, smoked salmon, triple brie, crackers, toast, fruit. We skipped lunch after eating so much at breakfast. Best part is the trays and thermos they give you if you want to take it back to your room to eat. Langley is a cute little town to explore, but we spent most of our time at the Inn just relaxing. They have DVDs available in the office for use in your room, but we neer turned on the tv, the peace and quiet was just what we needed.

The shower had been updated with a nice stone, but I was surprised for such a big space to only have one shower head.

We were also surprised that there was no comfortable 'lounge space' in the room. Only a couple of upright chairs. At least in the room we were in (10) there was plenty of space for a sitting area - kind of odd to have a big corner suite but nowhere to actually hang out? The placement of the TV was a little awkward tucked in the corner - not sure why it wasn't above the fireplace where it would be a much better viewing experience.
