The staff were lovely, the location was brilliant - just a short walk to the centre of town and the views.....stunning!! Our room overlooked the countryside and watching the sunset over San Marino is a vision we'll always cherish. The spa on the deck was a great surprise and we relaxed in the sun room, feeling like we were on top of the world. The food was lovely and the dinner particularly was excellent. Highly recommended, particularly for those travellers with a car as there is nowhere to park in this gorgeous little town!

There is a private spa on the 3rd floor which offers sauna, hydromassage, face peelings, manicures, etc., but they charge the same exorbitant prices for guests that they charge for anyone off the street (eg. $35 for a sauna !). In other words, this business has nothing to do with the hotel. But it gets included in the hotel's ratings. As a result, you pay for a 4-star hotel here, but get only a 2-star hotel.

The television boasted music playlists to choose from, news, and other things.
