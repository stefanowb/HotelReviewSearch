From the time we walked in we felt appreciated and they were all very willing to answer our questions and even offer up options or solutions that we hadn't thought of. Our bellman conversed with us and showed us how many things work in our room. He also took us out onto our balcony to point out where things are and how best to get there. We felt comfortable from the start. The housekeeping staff had our room looking immaculate each day. All staff at the front desk were more than willing to help us with directions or information about tourist attractions.
