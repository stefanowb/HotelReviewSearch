Well, the designer should be got rid of! It was the smallest room I think I have ever stayed in. There was an old fashioned rather large TV placed between the door and the bed, so you had to hurdle that in order to get into bed .. good job there wasn't a fire, we'd have never got out. Plus the TV was pointless, being on a stand lower than the bed, there would have been no way to have watched it, even if we had wanted to, so it was just a nuisance. The ceiling was so low my husband bumped his head several times. The bathroom was small too and the shower poorly positioned. Not very luxurious to sleep in a cupboard. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant or a bar, and the lounge was very stuffy and formal. It was a tough choice - sit in the cramped bedroom or in the hushed environment of the lounge. There are no leisure facilities at the hotel. Even reception is just a desk with a fairly curt young woman behind it. We complained by letter afterwards and the hotel didn't bother to respond.", "title": "nice but not a five star", "user": "fi_earthling", "date": "February 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4458671}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 28, "average": 54, "very good": 177, "terrible": 16, "excellent": 241}, "aka": "Quebecs Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0760869565217, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}}
