Highly recommend getting a room facing the Alps, nothing like waking up and opening your curtains to the alps. The restaurant was a little pricey in the hotel, but there are several others in Wengen, inclding a great little pizza place. There's also a grocery store a block from this hotel. The manager was exteremely accomodating, even driving my luggage to the train station for me, only 200-300 feet, but still nice. This location makes travelling up the alps, like the Jungfrau, very quick and easy.", "title": "Great all-around experience", "user": "Herk_Driver", "date": "February 10, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4452084}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We truly stumbled upon a treasure", "text": "Thank you for your hospitality.
