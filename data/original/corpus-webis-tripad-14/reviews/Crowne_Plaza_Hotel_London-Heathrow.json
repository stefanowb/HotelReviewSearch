Arriving at the hotel at 12.30 pm after a long flight, we assumed as is normal practice in most other hotels that we would be able to check-in, leave our bags and then return at the advertised check-in time to collect our key. Check-in was refused and we were told to return at 3 p.m. however they did store our bags. Arriving back at the hotel at 4.00 pm we were informed that our room would not be available until 5.30 p.m. While waiting to speak to the manager an alternative room to the one we were originally allocated became available even though they had stated there were none free. The problem appears to be that flight crews do not vacate the rooms at the normal checkout time. Be aware that you therefore may not be able to gain access to your room at the allocated time. We had no complaints about the room and it was of the standard we expected for an airport hotel. The next problem occurred when we went to the restaurant at 7.15 for dinner. We were told that it was closed for a private function until 8 pm even though the restaurant was now almost empty. That the restaurant was closed to guests until 8.p.m. should have been conveyed to us at check-in and we could have made alternative arrangements.
