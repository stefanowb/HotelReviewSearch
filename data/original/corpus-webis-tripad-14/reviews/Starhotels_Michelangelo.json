Other guests had purses stolen during breakfast and the staff was unresponsive. They are expensive due to the location. I expected basic customer service, yet they treated guests as if they were \"doing them a favor.\" If Starhotel executives read this, I urge you to change management there and implement a customer service program, such as that offered by the Ritz Carlton.

The only things going for this hotel are the location and the clean room. If you need anything else from the hotel, you're out of luck! The service from the reception desk was awful. Each time we asked the desk for something, the answer was, \"No!\". My family and I couldn't believe how rude the staff was at this hotel. They were completely unaccommodating. We stayed at other hotels in other cities throughout Italy, and we found this hotel to be the worst in customer relations. First of all, the hotel gives you a key on a key chain the weight of a small dumbbell and they encourage you to leave it with them at the desk when you leave. We asked them to supply a second key and they said, \"No!\". So each time we left the hotel, we left the key at the desk. FYI - there was no safe on the hotel rooms. Then when we returned to the hotel, we would ask for our room key from an entirely different set of staff and they would give it to us without asking to see any identification. I felt uneasy leaving the key and without having them check to see if we were really staying in the hotel. Anyone could ask for a key from the desk and get one. We asked to have an iron sent to our room and was rudely told, \"No!\". The hotel reception desk told us that it's against the law in Italy to have an iron in your room. We were unaware of this \"law\" because we had an iron sent to our rooms in other hotels we stayed at throughout Italy and was never told \"no\" or that is was against the law. Since we couldn't borrow an iron, we asked if there was an ironing service and we were told, \"It's too late!\" So the next day we asked for ironing service earlier in the day and was given a hard time by the reception desk once again. They looked at us like we were asking for something unheard of. We proceeded to wait as the reception desk called for the maid. After, they said we would have to wait one hour and that the cost is 12 Euros per piece! We said no thanks. We decided to wear wrinkled clothes. The \"American breakfast buffet\" was disgusting! The eggs were made of powder and looked fake as they were bright yellow in color. How hard is it to mess up powdered eggs? They were runny and made me feel nauseous when I ate them for the first time. The breads they served were a strange tasting croissants and a loaf of breads. The meat they served was greasy and undercooked. My husband, who has a bad stomach was sick after eating breakfast the first morning. After that, he ate bread with butter the next two days. I was hoping the coffee would be good, but I was disappointed again! The coffee was awful too! I opted to eat the cold cereal and drank the juice instead. The service at breakfast was lacking as well. There was a number of staff walking around the dining room, however not one of the staff members on the three mornings we were there, asked if everything was okay. The hotel was booked of people on a Globus tour. You will see the Globus tour people at breakfast if you go early enough. It seems that the Starhotels Michelangelo is more concerned with packing out there hotel with people rather than taking care of them. Do not ask the reception desk for recommendations for restaurants, they will guide you to expensive restaurants that have mediocre food. You are better off reading other people's trip reports. The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to focus your Rome trip on the Vatican. The room was clean and comfortable. Starhotels Michelangelo desperately needs to work on their service. I know we were in another country but I didn't think we were on a different planet.

On top of that the hotel staff was NOT overly friendly and they did not come across as being dedicated to making sure our stay at their hotel was a top priority. The first room we were assigned reinforced our opinion that we (I) had selected the wrong hotel, especially for the pre-paid money we had put up. The carpet was worn, both seats of the chairs in the room were heavily stained and one had its fabric torn, and the walls were heavily marked with luggageg scrape marks.

You are probably best to take a longer route and go via the Vatican and take a metro or just get a taxi. Our room was nice and had been recently refurbished. However, the air con wasn't working and when we asked the manager to fix it, the attitude we received was just unbelievable. Apparently the management centrally controls when the air con operates, even though there are individual controls in the rooms. Our room was genuinely very stuffy, but the response was pretty much, \"tough, open the windows if you're hot\"! Now this would be OK if the hotel was a budget 2-star, but Michelangelo is a 4-star hotel and I felt this was downright rude and unacceptable.
