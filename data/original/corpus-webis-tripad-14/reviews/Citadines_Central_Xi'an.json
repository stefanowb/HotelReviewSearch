The Bell Tower is only a couple blocks away, and it's about three blocks to the Great Mosque. The area immediately around the hotel is pretty seedy, and there is nothing around but sign-making shops. There are no bars or upscale restaurants in the area, though there is a fast food place next door (Taste of Singapore) for cheap eats that is also the breakfast place for the hotel. The area around the hotel is very dark at night. The hotel is surrounded by run-down apartment buildings and construction sites - you can see them all from the roof top terrace. We saw other reviews mentioning sitting and drinking a beer up here, but during our stay we didn't see any chairs up there, it was just a place to walk and look at the pretty grisly looking buildings around the hotel. In the distance, you could see the city skyline. At street level, the shops are on the bottom level, with apartments above, so you don't really notice the run-down apartment buildings as you walk through the old town.", "title": "#1 on TripAdvisor?

When shown that it said that, first they told me the webpage was wrong (this is their official website), then when I asked for a manager, they called him. He came down after about 10 minutes, walked straight to the computer without a word or looking at us, said a couple things to the employees, and continued to stand there without looking up until one of the other staff members told me \"ok, we'll make an exception this time\", like they were doing me a favor by providing the breakfast they advertised.

The room smelled like wet paint, though it had not been painted - I think it was from the sign making shops across the street, though they were also doing some work upstairs. The sliding bathroom door was stuck, and you had to really lay into it to get it to close. The room was decent sized, very basic with Ikea-style furniture, but with the basic necessities like free broadband internet in the room, A/C, flat screen tv, stereo, and kitchenette. The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable. There are large windows wrapping around the apartment, but the room we had just looked across the street at a run-down apartment building, so we didn't have them open much - ask for a high floor to get a good view. We asked for one, but naturally were told that there wasn't any available, though we saw about three people during our entire four-day stay. Later that day, our room started to smell like two-day old fish. I think it was from the restaurant next door, but maybe it was the paint I'm not sure. When I called the front desk staff about it, they came up and informed me that it was my fault because I didn't turn on the vent fan over the stove to circulate the smell out. I tried to explain that I had no food in the apartment, and that the smell was coming in through the vents from somewhere else, but he only smirked like I was lying. The engineer was sent up, and he proceeded to show me how to turn on the vent fan. I tried to tell him too, but he didn't speak English and didn't understand. I told them it still smelled, and they said to just run the fan longer. So, the solution to our room stinking fish and paint was that I should run the vent fan the entire time of our stay, rather than offering us another room or even offering an explanation of what the smell was.

When we asked the front desk for a taxi, they seemed confused, and ran around talking on the walkie talkies. First they fell all over themselves to find out exactly how we booked our show, which was so they could write a note for me to give the dinner show (telling them of course that we had booked through the hotel so they could get a commission, although we didn't - they were just trying to scam them). When we got to the show, we asked them what it said, and they confirmed our suspicions, but I had already paid for the show anyway, so they got nothing. We thought they were calling a cab, but turns out they were instead getting a trainee to run out to the main street in the pouring rain and hail a cab for us. The poor guy stood out there in the downpour getting drenched for about 15 minutes while we wondered what was going on and if he was coming back or if we were going to make our dinner show on time. Finally he got a taxi for us, but he was soaked to the bone - I have no idea why he didn't call a taxi like a normal hotel, or why he didn't take one of the umbrellas with him that were sitting right next to us in the lobby for free use. Very odd.

The other reviews are correct - this is a great option especially for families with kids (hotel rooms can prove costly and disagreably crowded for them). Citadines studio apartments are spacious and comfortable, and 1 BR apts are also available. For those familiar with the IBIS chain, t Citadines studio is maybe 2-3 times the size of IBIS rooms (while less expensive), with a similar clean and modern design along the IKEA lines. Rooms come with a kitchen. We booked our room through Wotif - about 2 USD per day more expensive than the summer sale price had we booked directly with the hotel, with the added advantage of being able to cancel our reservation. Everything worked perfectly - the hotel had our reservation on file. The hotel is very well located and all worked well. The airport shuttle bus stop is about 1-2 minutes walk away, on the main square just to the right of the road leading to the Citadines. They also have self service laundry facilities on the 4th floor as I recall - around 40 yuan I think for a full load including the dryer - buy your token at the front desk. Following Sobesparky's advice we went to the roof in the evening - nice partial view of the main square and surrounding buildings all lit up.
