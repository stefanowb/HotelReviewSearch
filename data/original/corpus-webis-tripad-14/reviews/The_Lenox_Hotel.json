The first stay was delightful which brought us back when we had a family event in October. I reserved a single for my mother in law and a small suite for my wife daughter and my self. I believe that if I am going to pay a premium for a room I should receive a higher level of service along with the room being above average. Service for us was spotty, a delay in having a room ready allowed the front desk to shine by buying us lunch. A further delay though understandable was not communicated us us and that off set the good feeling from the front desk experience. We finally asked for alternate rooms and after some conversation they were provided. It may have been the change of rooms because although we received the same room it had a number of flaws which for a premium property should be unacceptable. The smoke detector was missing, I called and I told the bellman. It was never taken care of during the four days we were guests. Holes in the wall where something had been removed - not for what bills it self as a boutique hotel. Having to repeatedly call for our bags - I was comfortable with them not arriving shortly after we moved into our room even though we were told they were on the way up. I was comfortable calling and asking when they might arrive. I was told the bellman was on the way up. I was aggravated when the bags still had not arrived and I started to get questioned by my wife and daughter. I was expecting and hoping for a premium experience and that was not the case. I called about what I thought was a noisy ventilation system - I don't believe anyone ever looked at it. We loved the location, restaurant service was very uneven, the doorman was great - the hotel just disappointed. To add insult to injury I receive an automatic e-mail from the general manager thanking me for my stay and asking me to rate the hotel. I was honest with my responses and even handed just as I believe I am here. I thought a quality hotel like this would at least respond to a critical response from a guest. It didn't happen. I like the hotel, I believe it could fix the issues so I called and asked to speak to the GM. There was no response so I followed up - at this point you have a right to say I'm the moron here. the GM's assistant finally called, set up a time for me to talk with the GM which I scheduled and then he never called. Several days later I had a voice asking to me to set up a new time. Enough said - I was terribly disappointed on a number of levels. It did not ruin the trip - it was one of those things where because I walked in with premium expectation and on a number of levels they were not met.
