The atmosphere is relaxed and staff are extremely helpful - we happen to mention that we had made a booking for transport to an island with no facilities - the reception staff couldnt have been more helpful providing us with a couple of deck chairs and a small cool box to make our trip more comfortable - apparently these items had previously been left by other guests. The hotel rooms are actually juniour suites and were spacious - a fully equipped kitchen, dining area and lounge area, large bedroom with two queen beds and vanity sink area and bathroom. We even had a balcony but not all rooms have that. And we had a room that faced west and could watch the sun go down. But you actually dont want to be on the balcony at sun-up or sun-down as wee midgie things come out that they call no-see-ums and thats why you see so many bug nets over windows and outside doors. Clean towels were replaced as often as required. Beach towels are available to sign for and exchange for fresh each day. Also plentiful adequate breakfast - everything self-service -make your own waffles, fresh fruit, nuts, yoghurt, bagels, and some hot food such as scrambled egg, streaky bacon, or savoury scones that they call biscuits filled with burgers which they called sausage which were very tasty. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays they even had an early evening welcome for guests - from 5pm to 7pm - lemonade and burgers or meatballs or something small and hot was available just to help yourself. A Publix supermarket is in the same complex as the hotel so excellent location to pick up lunch/ freshly made rolls etc. The hotel was for us very conveniently located. We spent most days on Sanibel Island which was just about 6 miles to the centre of the island or about 15 mins from the hotel - it was around 30 mins to the north of Captiva island but we didnt go in rush hour - busy times coming back from the island are between 4 and 6 pm so try and avoid that as the journey is nose to tail with traffic and on the island there are stricty adhered to speed limits of 20/30/40 miles an hour. Shopping malls include Tanger Outlets just across the road from the hotel, Edison Malls with Macys/Dillards/JCPenny about 30 mins drive away and a huge Miromar Outlets about 40 mins drive which although bigger for us was not much better than Tanger outlets across the road. There is a small pool and sunbathing area but we didnt use it - mainly full of kids/families. The guests were international although no British voices were heard. This is a quiet hotel -there was also free WIFI and a couple of computers for guest use if you didnt have your own. If you are after party atmosphere/night life - this hotel is not for you (for that you would be better to go to Fort Myers Beach resort area - again about 30 mins away - neon lights and bars everywhere). A couple of nice restautants that we went to included Captains House at Tween Waters Inn Captiva with grand piano/ starched linen/pianist and The Lighthouse just at the entrance to the causeway - very good - smart casual elegant - near the marina. We would definitely stay here again - it was good value as we had booked the hotel/flight/car hire package through expedia -we had everything we needed and more - and the location was great for us.", "title": "Exceeded our expectations", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Scottish-German", "date": "April 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 103999028}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel was fantastic!

Light dinners are offered two weekdays and we really enjoyed the bbq sandwiches and salads when we arrived tired on our first day in Florida. We had reserved a one bedroom suite but, since a tour group had all the one bedrooms, we were upgraded to a two bedroom for our entire stay. We had requested a suite on a high floor overlooking the marshlands and we were given a two bedroom with the exact view we requested. The suite was immaculate, the maid service was excellent, the bed was comfortable, and we loved having a full kitchen where we could prepare dinner when we wished. The hotel is in a quiet area of Ft. Myers with minimal traffic, but next to a small center with a grocery and across the street from a Tanger outlet that is landscaped and set back from the road to maintain the quiet atmosphere. Fifteen minutes from lots of great restaurants and an easy drive to rt. 75 and Naples. We can't wait to come back next year!!!", "title": "Wow, value! Wow, accomodations!
