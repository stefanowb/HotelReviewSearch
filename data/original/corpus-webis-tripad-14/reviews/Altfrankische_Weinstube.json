The breakfast was lovely and typical of what you get in Europe - yogurt, sliced deli meats and cheese, breads, spreads, hard boiled egg, juice, coffee, tea, fruit. My only complaint but enough for me to not stay again was that because there is a restaurant on the ground (first floor for Americans) floor you could smell the cigarette smoke seep up into the bedroom, which for us was room3 on the 2nd (3rd) floor. It was enough to wake me up and jag a bit in the middle of the night. We did not hear any noise, however.

My husband left his phone charger in the room when we checked out and when we called from our next destination to ask if they could send it to our current hotel, they not only had it sent to us within 2 days, but they didn't charge us a cent and also sent a little thank you note and a postcard with it!
