The floors in my room were a wreck; they were obviously not covered after being laid and construction continued. And, they were not clean. There were cobwebs. The \u201cview\u201d from my room on the back of the hotel was of a few sad plants and the road coming into the back of the hotel. The \u201cgardens\u201d are still being planted. The screen to my tiny patio wasn\u2019t even on the tracks and was useless. Furnishings are cheap. You can listen to the heavy trucks go up and down the road behind the hotel to the construction sites up the hill. My room was at the end of the hall, and they leave the exit door next to it propped open 24/7. Went I went to check out and leave, I was trapped by luggage and bags piled up in front of my door. Might as well not have wifi; it took 5 minutes for one 9-word text to go through. There is a random screw on the wall in the bathroom as if something is supposed to be hung there, and a hook over the bed on the ceiling for something that isn\u2019t (yet?) there. The ceiling of the restaurant is plywood. They were actively still constructing and hanging lamps and painting walls. A person in my group had a huge water leak in her room. Another had many many issues with laundry service. The A/C works well. Two large free bottles of water daily. Coffee and tea in room. Buffet dinner was ok; bar service is ok. Bed is comfortable. Americans will not need an electrical adapter. Hairdryer in room. No problem with hot water, but shower pressure was very low. You can hear all of the sounds and activities in the halls due to the gap under the door. I was really hoping for better in such a special location.", "title": "Soul-Less and Still Under Construction", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "brngckn", "date": "November 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 185687312}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is essentially still under construction; choose a different property for your stay in In", "title": "Overpriced for Inle Lake", "user": "sandid3", "date": "November 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 185025938}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "My husband and I spent 2 nights at this new hotel after having spent 3 nights at the Inle Princess.
