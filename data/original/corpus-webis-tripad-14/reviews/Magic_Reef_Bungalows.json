We were picked up very late at night from the airport by the friendly temporary managers Rod and Jo. They were so very nice and helpfull. We woke up in the morning to the sound of the sea in the background against the reef. we were in a cute bungalow at the rear of the property but still had sea peeps and beautiful tropical surroundings. The property was well maintained and had a stunning boat shaped pool that was terrifically icy and refreshing. And the night time visitors of geckos and wee dogs was cute. It is very nice to make a pina colada in the bungalow and make your way down to the deck by the ocean and enjoy a sunset. :) thanks so much for our stay, :)", "title": "Great little place", "user": "Rebecca M", "date": "December 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148167468}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012", "text": "Truly a gem.
