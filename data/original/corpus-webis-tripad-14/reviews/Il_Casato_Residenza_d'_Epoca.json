The location is great, inside the city walls and only takes a few minutes to walk down to the main square.

Reception is only open for set hours - we were arriving late so rang to let them know and they kindly stayed open late for us. All very accommodating. There is no breakfast room, so a basic breakfast (your choice of hot drink, orange juice, yoghurt, bread, croissant, fruit) is served direct to your room.

The easiest way is from Il Campo, when facing the Torre di Mangia, the road to the very right is Via Casato di Soto. If you go on this road you will be entering the hotel from the third floor. If you go on Via Giovanni Dupre, you will enter the first floor where the desk clerk sits.

The hotel is well located within the main town and very close to all major sights, but there were some negatives. It is not staffed with a 24 hour reception and our luck, we arrived during the mid-day when it was closed. So we wandered around until 3:30 when reception opened again. The lady at the desk was very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were on the 2nd floor but were at opposite ends (we were traveling with two small children!) so that did not work very well for us. The hotel is in an historic building which seems as though it was chopped up to make a hotel. Rooms are scattered through a crazy floor plan, there is no elevator and the steps are steep and narrow - making it very difficult to bring up our very large, heavy suitcase. Only after you check in do you have keys to use the upper entrance. Breakfast was minimal and a bit disappointing. I do not like having to note a time to have it brought to my room but prefer going to eat when I am ready.
