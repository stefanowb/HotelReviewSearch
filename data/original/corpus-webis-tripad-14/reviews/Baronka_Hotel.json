It was about the same size of our apartment in Italy. The sleeping area was spacious and then there was also a separate sitting room with a desk (and internet cable), closet, and 2 chairs. There was even an entry way into the room that could be closed off with a separate door. The bathroom was huge and had double sinks. Everything was clean, warm, and well kept. The hotel itself is about a 20 minute tram ride away from the city center which wasn't a problem because the tram line is about a 3 minute walk down the street. The hotel has a restaurant which is pretty decent and other amenities like a pool that we didn't use. We paid around 100 euros per night which was a good value considering how large the room was. Breakfast was also included and offered a typical European fair with both warm and cold dishes.", "title": "Great Room!", "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "October 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 21336812}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "What a joke", "text": "This place managed to make a misery of my recent trip to Vienna!! 1st off if you plan to visit Vienna don't be fooled by flying to Bratislava(Vienna) airport, why the heck Ryanair have the cheek to call it in brackets Vienna when Vienna is about 90 miles away god only knows. So we arrive at the hotel at 945 pm it takes nearly 20 mins to book in by which time it is past the magical hour of 10pm, we had flown from Bristol at 6pm so had not eaten we could ear loud music and enquired if bar/restaurant was still open, we were infromed it was and we could eat. When we got there a party was in progress and we were told we could not get a beer let alone much needed dinner. We left and found ourselves in a suburb with about 3 places which served food, guess what all stop at 10! We returned to the hotel and pleaded with them for at least a sandwich, there were 2 girls on reception surely one of them could help. Eventually after many suggestions which were refuted they found us a pizza delivery menu, guess what closed. We ended up with a bag of crisps and a chocolate bar from behind the reception paid for with ten euros as we had no local currency. So to our rooms we went, both me and my colleague had been allocated rooms, myself directly above the party and my colleague above me. This hotel is huge so why they felt the need to put us in the noisiest part of the hotel beggars belief. As the TV had no english channels I was in bed by 11pm listening to the disco. The disco wrapped up at 1am and I thought I could finally get some sleep. How wrong, they then proceeded to drag tables across the restaurant floor for the next hour! An hour to re-arrange a restaurant? I eventually managed 4 hrs sleep before my alarm went and I had to leave. This place was completely useless and we did not feel like guest more like inmates. The Hotel has 3 stars but on their leaflet they claim 4, I dont think they deserve any as the following day I felt like a survivor!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "McMotel", "date": "December 8, 2007", "id": 11322771}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Friendly Hotel", "text": "We stayed at the Baronka hotel for 4 nights.", "user": "jamesplloyd", "date": "November 29, 2007", "id": 11139090}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "The hotel was very clean, rooms got cleaned daily.
