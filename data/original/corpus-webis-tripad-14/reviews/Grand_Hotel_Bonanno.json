We just came back from Pisa where we stayed in the Grand Hotel Bonanno for 2 nights from November 1th till November 3th. The reservation was made over the Internet just a day before. Our stay was good, the rooms were nice, with big beds that were a little bit hard. The bathroom was not very clean, there where hairs on some spots. We knew that the hotel was not located directly in the center of Pisa but within a 10 minutes walk you're in the center of Pisa. Therefore we liked the location. There is a free parking behind the hotel, only for guests of the hotel. Staff is friendly and the continental breakfast is great.

It is close to a busy road, but don't worry as it is very well sound proofed. We had a room over looking the road but were not troubled by any noise. The room had double glazing and a shutter that excluded any noise. Others have commented adversely about the underpass that you have to take to get on the road to the Leaning Tower. We used it late at night and and during the day and had no worries .It is actually a footpath along side and above the road. You can see clearly from one end to the other before entering. If you are arriving by train get off at Pisa St Rossalare. It's only a 5 minute walk to the Hotel. The room we had was spacious, really clean and had the largest bed I've ever slept in. The staff are helpful, quite friendly, and speak english. The breakfast is excellent, but let down by poor coffee, (in Italy!) and orange juice. There are not many restaurants within walking distance in the area. We ate in the Hotel restauant and and found the quality and portion size to be excellent. Not cheap but what you would expect in a 4 * hotel. However the pizzas are cooked from frozen, but it does say so on the menu. Excellent Hotel. Recommended. I would certainly use it again.
