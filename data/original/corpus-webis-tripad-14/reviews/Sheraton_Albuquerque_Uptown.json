If you want it, you have to pay an extra $15/day to get to be a Club Member. Another thing you have to pay for is the internet. $10/day. I'm sorry, but I guess I feel I pay enough to not have to pay for those things when I get there. If you want to be a more upper class hotel, then be upfront with your patrons and charge them for things they use in your rooms up front so they know what they're getting into...Don't get me wrong, it was nice enough, but that just made me mad. The kids had fun in the pool , the beds were supper comfy, and didn't end up using it in the end, but they've got a restaurant and bar too.

Clearly they were on \"our team\" in ensuring our conference went off without a hitch. A few examples? Accepting boxes early so I didn't have to tote them around, all hands on deck to flip rooms quickly and efficiently, facilitating early check-in so my gear would be stowed out of the way. On one occasion, we saw a staff member literally RUNNING to see what else needed to be done!!
