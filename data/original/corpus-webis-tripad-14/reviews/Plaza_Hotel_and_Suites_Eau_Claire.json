The hotel looks sort of run down from the outside, but it seems like the staff do their best to keep the rooms very clean. We got a room in the Tower. The shape of the room was quite odd since the entrance area was narrow, and widened towards the window, but spacious enough over all. The bathroom was clean as well. The hotel has a pool and a fitness center. The free breakfast in the morning wasn't anything great.
