Like everyone else, I read up on all the reviews to check if this was a decent hotel or not, and I am pleased to say it is. Lovely receptionists, helpful staff and concierge. The room was bright, spacious, with amazing views and all the amenities you need. The breakfast was also great - lots to eat! The vaporetto is a scenic 10 minute walk away, and the hotel also has a shuttle service to take you into Venice. The beach is literally on your doorstep. All in all, this is a really beautiful hotel to stay in, and staying in Lido was really great - it is lovely and relaxing..... I thoroughly recommend it!!!!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 10, 2006", "id": 5046259}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 1999", "text": "What a gorgeous hotel, i stayed here with my now ex husband on honeymoon and can honestly say that the hotel saved the trip for me and encouraged me to return for a later look.", "title": "Gorgeous Quiet Luxurious Hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "sammi-loves-shopping", "date": "April 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4829978}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "The rooms were magnificent, the service faultless and the food divine.", "title": "Grande Dame not quite ready for her close-up.", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "kamaainagirl", "date": "September 3, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3840561}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A great old lady", "text": "The only criticism was the location as i wanted to spend time exploring venice, but with a private bus/launch to the mainland at least the journey was comfortable.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "Londoner5870", "date": "August 18, 2005", "id": 3788135}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Starwood has their hands full with the Des Bains...
