A little more than one week has now passed since departing Zermatt and Coeur des Alpes, which truly stands for its name: Heart of the Alps! And it was with true grief in our Hearts we hade to leave! Yes, it is absolutely a warm and openhearted hospitality greeting you from the moment you step into the hotel. You feel like a part of the Leni & Thomas family and their remarkable team. The hotel in itself is a pearl. The furniture, the style, the d\u00e9cor and all the details join into a tastefully tranquil and beautiful design. Our penthouse suite had breathtaking views of Matterhorn and the ski slopes from basically every corner of the large room. Everything was just perfect and the interior design exquisite. All amenities needed with CD and DVD player and a fireplace. We enjoyed several afternoons in the warm sun on our large terrace, being completed hypnotized by the view. Is it possible to be more relaxed? Well, then you can always go down to the hotel\u2019s marvellous spa/haman offering you almost complete repose and recovery. Sit down in the outdoor jacuzzi and ask Leni or someone else to bring you a cold drink. Get the pleasure from the fantastic view. The breakfast served is excellent, and which hotel will call their guests who overslept breakfast hours offering to bring some to your room, or whenever at your convenience downstairs in the breakfast room? Because we re-scheduled our arrival/departure day we had to change room for our final night. We were not let down. The new lofts are probably one of the most striking rooms I have seen! They do not have the same fantastic view but it is more than compensated in its comfort and design. Another good aspect of the hotel is its location: 150 meters away from the main ski lift and 400 meters to the centre. I miss a restaurant in the hotel but hopefully the owners are considering this for the future.
