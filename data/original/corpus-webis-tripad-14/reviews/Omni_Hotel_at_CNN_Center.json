I chose this hotel for the proximity to the center, and it was closer than I imagined. Out through the side doors of the hotel, and you're in the convention center in 2 minutes. The rest of our stay was somewhat disappointing. There aren't many restaurants or nightlife in that area of town. The staff was friendly enough, but were more interested in gabbing with each other than helping guests. The information they give out isn't reliable either. We asked the front desk how to get to the nearest drug store, and she said that there was a CVS a couple blocks away, and that we had half an hour before they closed. We hoofed it and made it there in less than 10 minutes, only to find that they had already been closed for an hour. Walking there, the street was kind of sketchy, and pretty deserted except for three pan handlers that were very insistent that we give them some change, and that if we didn't have any change, that a dollar would do. Apparently, this is a problem in Atlanta since we saw several signs posted on the streets about not giving money to panhandlers. I don't want to say anything negative about the city of Atlanta in general since I only stayed 3 days and didn't venture out of the city since this was a business trip, but I will say that the hotel seemed to be a magnet for panhandlers stealthily dressed in nice clothes and sporting ipods! The hotel was deserted when we were there, and the nearby restaurants were pretty empty, too. We had breakfast every morning at Prime Meridian located in the hotel, and that was the highlight of the trip. The food was good, except for the last day when we received sour pancakes. Apparently, the batter had turned. And the \"chef's special palette cleanser\" they have in those shot glasses? They're Dannon yogurt drinks...poured straight from the bottle. I happened to catch them in the act. Room service is terribly expensive, and they charge you a room service fee on top of the charge of the food. (Something we didn't realize until after). Luckily, the room and bathroom were clean and spacious, otherwise I'd have to give this hotel 2 star. Ladies - there's a lighted cosmetic mirror for doing for makeup, but the light is very dim and useless. Overall, the hotel is basically for business, and I wouldn't stay here again unless I had to go to the convention center.", "title": "if you must stay in downtown Atlanta, I guess this is worth it", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "SustainableTravel", "date": "July 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33879744}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled on business", "text": "This is an urban hotel but the area (other than CNN Center stuff) is pretty barren if you want nightlife or fine dining. It did not help that it was late June in Atlanta \u2013 the heat and humidity was stifling. I was there on a business trip attending a conference. The conference facilities at the hotel were excellent, the food was better than the typical hotel fare for conferences, and the rooms were nice. The downside was the walls are paper thin and the group of ladies staying in the room next to me were fairly drunk and loud \u2013 nothing like listening to people laugh and carry on at 1:00am when you need to be awake at 6am to get ready for meetings. Another downside (but not unusual in urban hotels) the park across the street was showing an outdoor movie that night (Ghostbusters) and it was also very loud.

I booked the OMNI as it was attached to conference center and thought that would make it easy.Having arrived a day early to soak up the atmosphere and get started on my writing (which is how I make my living, I check into the room and was upset to find no internet connection. This began a long coil of hours (from 3pm to 10pm) before it was agreeed that the the tower I was in had \"spotty\" service and I should be moved. This is after being told 1) you don't know how to hook it up right 2) you are not following directions 3) try ethernet (although I explained the was no ethernet outlet in room). So on and so on and many trips down to lobby. I was not happy. I was less happy that the new room had only intermittent internet service as well. Room itself was ok in new tower- nothing to write home about. Clean and nice toiletries. I travel alone a lot and I must say I have never been so frightened as I was in Atlanta. The hotel is in the middle of the city (i.e. CNN, Coca Cola world, etc). but it is ROUGH. I felt subjet to mugging at any moment and this has never beenthe case. I went to the CVS a few blocks away and went out the back doo that opened on the formerly charming :\"Underground\" shopping are= I felt like I was on the movie set of \"After the Apocalpyse\". Indeed it was just not my own fears as a transist cop with a dog came up to me and asked what was I doing there and was I lost. He was noticibly nervous and told me it would be best not to be there and head back to the hotel. Lest you think I was dripping jewels and flashing wads of cash around, not the case. When I do my walkabouts in each city I visit, I dress comfy and not flashy in anyway. The whole point of them is to soak up the city's vibe. Well, the vibe in Atlanta is a bad one. An even was being held at the W hotel, several blocks from the OMNI and the doorman almost had a heart attack when I said I would walk over there (not yet dusk). Cabs lady, you have to take cabs, he told me. They jump out at you from the dark places. GREAT! ThHad another even at Coca Cola which is across the plaza from the OMNI and I was equally nervous walking the well lit paths, yet the group of us stuck together. Very escape from New Yorkish. Anyway, the OMNI is too big...more like two tower stuck together and the weird setup for getting in or out and to the proper floors is not worth the bother of figuring it out. You go up to go down and wave at everyone else on the escalators who are just as lost. The desk staff was ok (after the internet faisco) but the door men were just looking for the dollars. After tipping my cabdriver who placed my luggage on the curb, the door guy grabbed it and put it on a gurney and held out his hand. I asked if he was bring it to my room to which he said, no, and this is the last you see of me so ...<and held out his palm. I started laughing and said I don't think so, who takes me luggage up and he said they have the bell captain send someone to get it after you check in. It waits here. And then he held out his hand again. It was uncomfortable to say the least and even worse as called after me to HAVE A NICE DAY LADY. Frankly, it was the way the whole trip went which is too bad as I feel Atlanta must surely have some nice things about it...I just did not see it.
