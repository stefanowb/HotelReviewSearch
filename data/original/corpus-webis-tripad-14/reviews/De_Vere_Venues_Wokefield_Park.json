The staff were helpful and polite on checking in. The hotel is split into 2 different buildings - the mansion and the executive building - they both have a restaurant and bar. The choice of food in both restaurants was very limited - each had a set menu! The room we were given (104) was in the mansion house and was stunning! Beautifully decorated, a spacious bathroom with large bath and enormous seperate walk-in shower, lovely view from the window, large comfortable bed (maybe too firm for some), temperature controls, free internet access and ironing facilities in the room. The room also had a LCD wall mounted tv but only had a choice of 6 channels which was disappointing and no radio. The air conditioning vent also made some noise which kept my partner awake for a while and the room service meal we had was not the best i've ever had but as these are the only complaints we had i consider this hotel to be one of the best i've stayed at. The unlimited free tea and coffee stations were welcome and fresh fruit and nibbles were also provided! Breakfast in the maple restaurant - buffet style - was plentiful and tasty and was available until 10.30 am on the Sunday. The swimming pool and leisure suite were located in the 2nd building so we walked over enjoying the view of the golf course and mansion house as we went. The executive building is more modern and not as plush and elegant as the mansion house and is very corporate with BMW products in situ. The bar here was livelier than the mansion house bar which was quieter and more relaxing. The pool was clean and warm and situated with a jaccuzzi and sauna. Plenty of clean large towels were supplied for use in this area. The location is a bit rural and difficult to get to by public transport but if you drive it is in a ideal location for visiting Reading and the surrounding area", "title": "Bit too corporate but stunning location", "user": "crisp-lover", "date": "March 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 26618621}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I've just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, booked as part of a promotion running just after Christmas and paid 19 pounds per night.

Bathroom was spotlessly clean, as was the bedroom. It was situated in the new part of the hotel and had a french door which opened onto an area of grass. As other people have mentioned there are posh coffee makers in the lobby, water dispensers and free internet and printer. There is a nice bar, where the staff are helpful and a restaurant upstairs, which was reasonably priced although we did not eat there. Breakfast is offered, although we went into Reading both days so did not try it. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and we went for a walk each morning. It has a golf course which is very popular, as well as a small swimming pool and gym. There was a long queue to check out, but our bill was correct and the process was painless once we reached the front of the queue.", "title": "OK if you get a cheap deal but service quite basic and definitely more styled towards the corporate venue market.", "user": "WelltravelledMum", "date": "February 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 24953594}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I must admit that I was apprehensive after reading the reviews here, but I was very impressed.
