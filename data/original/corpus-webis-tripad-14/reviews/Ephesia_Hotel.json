We ended up going to the private hospital in Kusadasi and after tests they confirmed it was the beefburger I had eaten at the hotel. Also we would not go again because it was the noisiest place we have ever stayed. You could hear every step up and down the stairs echoing through the hallway and rooms - of course children like to play up and down stairs! The location is lovely but we definately would not recommend this hotel at all. I had to take 12 pills a day and was in bed until our departure.
