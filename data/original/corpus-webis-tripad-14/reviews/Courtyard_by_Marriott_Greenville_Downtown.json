Our purpose was to explore the downtown area of Greenville. We were able to check in early and were quite surprised and delighted with the hotel; as a matter of fact, we often felt we were in more of a luxury hotel than in a Courtyard. The lobby area is especially nice, with a nice bar area, a wonderful restaurant (Nantucket--which was doing a booming business!), and a relatively large computer area. In fact, when we didn't receive a morning newspaper and didn't receive our bill under the door, we had to remind ourselves that we were \"only\" in a Courtyard! We were in a king room on the 5th floor, and the view of Greenville at night was especially lovely. The hotel is, as others have pointed out, in the middle of the downtown area. To the left of the hotel is the pretty tree-lined area for shopping, cafes, bars, restaurants. To the right is the river area--really beautiful--with more restaurants, etc. Add to it all is the fact that the hotel is fairly new, so there are no worn areas in rooms, hallways, lobby, etc. The breakfast is Starbucks in the lobby--with breakfast sandwiches, some breakfast plates, and pastries. We stayed there on points; however, we felt that the $152 asking rate was a bit steep. It was the same, too, for a weekend night. Otherwise, we were impressed with our stay.", "title": "A lovely Courtyard", "user": "r0ckhill", "date": "August 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 116658355}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Beautiful, fairly new Courtyard Marriott..

The police let us through to the hotel, and a warm welcome awaited. Although 90 rooms were taken by press, we were made to feel like the most important guests they had received. The next morning, when all those reporters checked out, we found an amiable chambermaid who wished us a blessed day and made sure our room was cleaned.
