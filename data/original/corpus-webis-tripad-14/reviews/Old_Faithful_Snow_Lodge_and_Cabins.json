Our room was clean, modern, had nice wildlife touches and the beds were comfortable. Add to that the location - just across the road from Old Faithful itself and pretty central for most of the park's attractions - geysers, mud-pots and wildlife. There were 2 gift shops in the vicinity - both with a good variety of goods - and, in one of the stores, there was a convenience food section, also with a good variety of goods. This store came in handy when the Obsidian Dining Room was full and we didn't want to wait an hour to eat! It was also preferable to the cafeteria.

We were so glad to move into a place within the Park. We stayed here two nights and very much enjoyed it. The atmosphere and decor of the Snow Lodge greatly enhanced our Yellowstone experience and the little bit extra money it cost us to stay there was very much worth it. We were able to walk to see the Old Faithful geyser erupt, with our kids in their jammies and all ready for bed. What a great way to end the day. It was so convenient to stay there and eliminated a significant amount of driving to get into and out of the Park. The room was clean and quiet (we were on the first floor), and tastefully appointed, and it was an easy walk from our room to two restaurants (connected to the lodge) and gift shopts, etc. The lobby was elegant and rustic, soft music playing, plenty of seating for a relaxing break. We would (and will) definitely stay there again, and probably won't ever stay anywhere else when we return to Yellowstone, unless it is backcountry camping when our kids are older.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "DareToExplore", "date": "July 18, 2006", "id": 5479756}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "We stayed in a Frontier Cabin for 2 nights (6/25 and 26).

It is a lovely facility. Very new and modern. The rooms, while small are arranged nicely and the storage space is good. Room has 2 double beds with locker style closets on either side. Room has a desk and chair and an additional chair in the corner. The sink is outside the bathroom and has a shelf above and below for toiletries. The tub/toilet area is large. There is a hair dryer in the room. There is a shelf that runs the perimeter of the room that I found quite handy. The laundry is on the second floor and is wonderful. It has 4 washers and 6 dryers. Cost: $1.25 a load. Change machine located there as well. It is open to everyone in the park, so plan ahead. It is open from 8 am to 10 pm - locked the rest of the time. (Canyon was supposed to have a laundry but it was closed because the campground was closed- call ahead) Some evenings there is entertainment in the lobby. The building is not well marked, so when you find it, just locate a parking space anywhere you can and go on in. It sits off and behind the general store. You can walk easilly to Old Faithful and do the geyser trails from there. The Obsidian restaurant is very good, but pricey. The grill is good, reasonably priced.

However, our stay at the Snow Lodge was excellent. The rooms are spacious,clean, & quiet, and the showers always had plently of hot water. The beds are comfortable and warm, and the closet space is more than enough. We stayed on the third (top) floor, which probably helped reduce any noise from foot traffic that might happen if you stayed on the first floor for example. The staff (from the front desk to maid service) was very friendly and helpful. We asked for extra coffee in our room, and the maid left us six extra packets, which was above what we expected. If you don't want to mess with the free coffee in your room, then there's free French roasted coffee in front of the main restaurant in the mornings. The best thing about the Snow Lodge is the proximity to Old Faithful, which is about 100 yards away. The food at the Geyser Grill was just perfect for us - nothing fancy - just affordable and tasty food for people on the go. We had one dinner at the main restaurant, and the atmosphere was very relaxed, yet elegant. I had a lamb shank that had been slow-roasted for twelve hours and the meat fell off the bone. Delicious!
