David and Louise are perfect hosts and made us very welcome. The food is excellent, fresh and well cooked. If you want to eat out elsewhere (they didn't do evening meals every night because of the lack of demand) there are several very good restaurants just around the corner which were recommended by Louise and proved to be excellent (The Queen Victoria and The Seahorse). The tram terminal for The Great Orme is within walking distance (as is the pier) and we were able to park at the back of the hotel for the first couple of days so could just leave our car and explore Llandudno. The car park at the back of the hotel is very small and other days we decided to park on the promenade by the hotel. This wasn't a problem when we were there although I can imagine that it would be in the height of the summer months. You couldn't park for more than 60 minutes between 10.00 am and 4.00 pm but if we went out for the day that wasn't a problem as we usually got back around 4.00 pm. Otherwise you could park further down the promenade and just pay for over 4 hours parking (\u00a31.50 in October).", "title": "Excellent Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Cakesy", "date": "October 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 47101477}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were very impressed by Llandudno.
