We spent some time exploring the area, and we fell in love with the town of Davidson. Everyone we encountered was friendly, and seemed happy. Everyone in Davidson must go to the post office to get their mail, which we found incredible. Such a 'feeling' of community. It was the type of town that you feel comfortable, even as a visitor.

Great location to get to everything. We arrived at night, and we were welcomed by a friendly young man at the front desk.

He also suggested some places for us to get dinner that night.

They do have photos on their website, but we were not sure what room we had reserved, so it was going to be a great surprise. We had a large 2 queen suite. The room was very large! When you first enter there was a small kitchenette to the right, with a frig & a microwave. Then beyond that was a large closet. To the left was the bathroom. The sinks/counters were seperate from the toilet/tub/shower, which was really nice. Lots of counterspace. The room with the toilet/tub/shower was extra large, too.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "SFAAR", "date": "August 21, 2005", "id": 3795244}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2004", "text": "The bedroom / sitting area of the room was large, too.
