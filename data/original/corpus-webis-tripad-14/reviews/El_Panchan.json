I do not understand why!! The staff seemed to be running around chaotically yet achieving very little - including in the bar and restaurant. After waiting for them to figure out which rooms had been assigned to the group we were then lead along poorly maintained (very poorly light at night) paths while they figured out exactly which rooms were available. Onced assigned to our room I was gob smacked, I walked in to graffitied and dirty walls, a fithly bed, a door that didn't lock properly and a bathroom that had little privacy!! I know this place is cheap and you get what you pay for, but honestly this place was down right disgusting! We were offered another room which was just as bad and you could also see where previous guests had used tape in an attempt to plug the holes in the fly screen to keep the bugs out!! There are also what appear to be stray dogs and cats all through the grounds of the hotel. It should be said that I am not a back packer and am used to decent, (clean and safe) mid-range accommodation - El Panchan is none of those things! My husband and I walked about 800m back towards Palanque and found our own accommodation, which still provide the stay in the jungle experience, as we both refused to stay there. We only returned to El Panchan to have dinner with the rest of the tour group on one occaision and to meet up with the group to depart for daily activities. There is a wide range of food at the restaurant, the meals are huge and are good quality, however, a little on the pricey side. If you are in Palanque to see the ruins El Panchan is located basically right outside the entrance to the park - other than the location and food I struggle to find anything positive to say about this property!", "title": "Seriously horrible!!!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "NTLibran", "date": "December 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 23089251, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Decent restaurant and close to entrance to the ruins", "disliked": "\u2014 Dirty and unsafe."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled solo", "text": "I spent a night and Ed and Margaritas last night and it was a pretty good place.
