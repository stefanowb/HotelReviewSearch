The room was very large with lovely new decor. The room also had a great little mini kitchenette at the end that we didn't use but would be handy for longer stays, especially if you had children (we left ours at home with nanna!). The bed was a massive king size but quite uncomfortable as it joined together with a seam down the middle, obviously so it can be pulled apart to make up other bed configurations, not nice to sleep on. The old CRT TV looked very out of place in this otherwise stylish room.", "user": "rkca56", "date": "July 20, 2008", "id": 18059319}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled on business", "text": "The brasserie was lovely to sit outside and overlook the harbour with a drink or two...
