Rooms are very clean and well equipped. Staff are excellent. Towels changed every couple of days and linen twice a week. Food in the restaurant is very good. Its a 20 minute walk from the centre of Pefkos but we really enjoyed the stroll and the distance from town means its lovely and quiet at night. There are loads of restaurants, and some supermarkets, on the way into town anyway so you don't actually have to walk all the way to the centre every night. Favourite restaurants for us were Nikolas (just up the road towards town), Tsambikos (Bakery of Pefkos) and Lindos Cuisine (in the town centre). Having said that we didn't have a bad meal all fortnight and you could eat in a different restaurant for a month we reckoned, there are so many.", "title": "Lovely Apartments", "user": "Moray01", "date": "July 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 17697655, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The rooms are spacious and very clean", "disliked": "\u2014 Cost of air conditioning but its probably fairly steep across the whole of the island"}}], "location": {"country": "Greece", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 19, "very good": 67, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 141}, "aka": "Pefkos Village Hotel Pefkos", "slim_ranking": 0.28125, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.0}, "description": "Situated on the outskirts of the resort and just 20 meters from a fantastic sandy bay, the Pefkos village Resort is the ideal place for a relaxing and unique holiday.
