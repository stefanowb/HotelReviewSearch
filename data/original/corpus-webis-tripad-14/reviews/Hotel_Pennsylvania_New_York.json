We got to our room with beds that just had blankets and sheets no duvets. The room was dusty and looked more looked miserable - the tv was unplugged and i suspect it didn't work, the beds were rickety and looked over 40 years old the walls were covered with unidentifiable stains. and the bathroom!! rust colours all over the ceiling, grime marks galour, the toilet looked like it was open to the general public. My friend became upset and so went down to front desk who insisted that this was a standard room. My friend mentioned that there had been talk of refurbishment on the hotels website, this comment was ignored. they gave us another key to another room. It was better, except the maid had clearly not had a chance to clean it. So back down we went. They gave us yet another key. The room, thankfully was better and thankfully the room had been cleaned. This room was still questionable - I had to buy a can of cleaning fluid which I sprayed every morning on the bath and in the toilet on the sink. On my last day there I met a guy in the foyer and we got onto the subject of the hotel. He told me that the first room they allocated him had been disgusting, there were beds with no duvets, dust and rust everywhere and there had been blood and hair on one of the beds. he said they'd allocated him a second room it was better but hadn't been cleaned then he had gone down and demanded and third and a credit card refund. People be warned - I see there are people on here saying the hotel is not that bad - I've stayed in hostels all over the world - this is a HOTEL and was one of the worst experiences ever - thankfully this was not the first time I stayed in NYC so I do have good memories of the place.", "title": "3rd time staying here this year", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "cookie2crumb", "date": "November 28, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4148264}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "A dump", "text": "This was the third time I have stayed at the Pennsylvania this year.
