We stayed at 8 different hotels while there and all had a 4 star rating. Most of the hotels were okay, but the Fenice Palace was terrible. I was so glad that we only stayed there for one night. The rooms are smelly, dark, old, moldy. The beds are small and the comforters are disgusting. The showers aren't great either. The water would go all over the floor everytime we took a shower. The rest of the hotel is not much to get excited about either. Everything looks worn and in need of major repair/renovation. Definitely do not stay here if you are driving in Italy. We had the hardest time getting to it, because it is so close to the Duomo. We had to valet park which was not only pricey but inconvenient. The morning we left we ended up waiting 45 min for our car. I don't think I have ever stayed at a hotel this bad before. Maybe a motel, but not a hotel and definitely not one with a 4 star rating. If I ever go back to Florence, I would stay on the outskirts of the city. The city is small enough that it is easy to get to the tourist area.

However, we entirely agree with other previous guests who were disappointed with the standard of the hotel. Our room was acceptable (clean and airconditioned) , but certaintly not 4 star standard. Although we liked the staff, we are particularly disgusted with the standard of the breakfast service. One morning, we hate to wait for a table to become available, and then could get no service. Everything in the buffet gives the impression of having been done on the cheap: bad cornflakes, watered down juice, stale rolls, poor coffee.

I stumbled in to this hotel after the first hotel we planned to stay at was closed. So here I was I was traveling with two year old twins and a nanny on Christmas Eve and no place to stay! The staff was more than accommodating and helpful. I loved the old style hotel to begin with, I guess if you want modern this hotel isn't for you. I felt at home and relaxed there. The rooms that we stayed in were fine. I loved the fact that they had bathtubs!! A rarity in Italy. We moved to a larger apartment on the second day which provided a separate sleeping room for our nanny. The only complaint I had was that the apartment, being up on the top floor, would get a little warm at night. No problems with the elevators while we were there, I thought the braiding was a novel idea, I liked it. Breakfast and bar were fine. My children loved the staff and cried when we had to leave. Location of the hotel was great, walking distance to most of the attractions that we wanted to see, restaurants that were close and shopping markets all around us.
