I was treated like a king, the staff was very professional and welcoming, as if they really felt privileged to have me there. The hotel was extremely clean, the food was great, and in the morning it was hard to get out of bed. My bed was so comfortable, I could have stayed in bed the whole time I was there. While I was there, I also got a chance to meet the owners. Great people, they were really humble and really cared if i had any problems which I don't really remember having any with this hotel.
