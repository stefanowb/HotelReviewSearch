The buffet had lots to choose from and everything was very good. The \"restaurants\" that they offer, however, aren't really \"restaurants\" we discovered. They are the pool-side cafe turned Italian Bistro and Steakhouse. Nothing wrong with that - just want you all to be informed that it's not a \"separate restaurant.\" The room left a little to be desired, I'll be honest. But, we spent so little time in there that it didn't really matter. It was cleaned daily, it was spacious, had a nice patio, and we loved the in-room bar!! It wasn't a 5-star room, though, in my opinion. The beach was FABULOUS! Lots of lounge chairs...beautiful sand...clear water (most of the time!). We parasailed, which I highly recommend, and also took the Carribean Festival excursion, which was a lot of fun. All in all, I definitely give this place a thumbs up.

Your neighbors can hear you when you pee in the bathroom and have sex. I heard our neighbors every morning on both counts, at least they had some good times. I would rate this a 3* hotel.

The food in the restaurants is equivalent to that of a 2-star hotel. Even on New Years eve, there was nothing special in the restaurants or otherwise. There are two small pools in the resort, and they are very deep. There is no spa in this resort. I have never heard of any 5-star resort that doesnt have a spa, and only has one buffet restaurant and one other restaurant on the beach. The disco is a good ten or fifteen minute walk from the resort, and drinks are not included there. Also, you have to pay for food at the bar outside of the disco. There were also piles upon piles of cockaroaches crawling around the lobby and bar areas. The only good thing about this resort is the entertainment team; which was excellent.

For the price we paid we had an amazing time in Riu Bambu. I love the beach!!! Riu Bambu is nice, solid, clean place. We got a room in the back building - love it! After all this food consumption you need to walk a little :) We totally feel we got what we paid for, which was a good deal. The buffet was plentiful at all meals, and they did their best to change up the offerings as much as possible at dinner, the a la carte restaurant were awsome. I love the fish - I was just a little dissapointed there were not reaviling the name of it, usually in the resort are more fish choices and there is a note that describes what kind is it - Riu representative, please respond to that. The mango is the best mango I've ever have, so were the other fruits. I love the stretching class and Aerobic class on the beach, I was there every morning! My only complain is - I know i can not problably change that - the enterteining shows are sooooooo laaateee! According to me. After you get of the beach and go to dinner around 6 - 7 it is a long time to wait for it, especialy if you do not drink ha! ha! I did enjoy free 90 minutes wi fi in the lobby, all though my phone was only picking that every other day- do not know the reason. The Beach is awsome, long, you may taking long walks both directions, we were up at 7, and before breakfast I was walking, my husband was running. For all those days we had excellent weather, they were two showers, but it was still hot and it passed quickly. As for the food complainers, I always have to add this: guys I would love to see your refridge and your cooking skills... with so much food choices it is a shame to complain... shame shame shame. I've seen people reaching for hot dogs, burgers and donuts (I would not touch that, no nutrients!!! :))) daily, people that are afraid to try new food, I think those are the ones that write bad reviews about food in the resorts. How blind and ignorant you must be not to be finding food for you in those many choices buffet.... no more comments. If you a shopper and love to buy some jewerly as suvenir, you better off going to Marshalls, Tj Maxx or order from Amazon. I do not like to shop there becouse they are coming up with the crazy prices, but I do understant. Small tip - ypu can offer 2 dollars instead of 3 and still have this coconut (it is still too much, ha ha , Whole food has them for 1.99 so....) but there so fresh and so good, no I did not like alkohol in them. But is always nice to bring some of that Mama Juana :) I do not have nothing against that rezort.
