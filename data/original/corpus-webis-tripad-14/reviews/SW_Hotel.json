Based on other user's reviews that we read, the SW seemed to fit the our specifications. The SW Hotel is definitely all of these! Located on the border of Chinatown and Little Italy: Fisherman's Warf, Coit Tower, Lombard Street, The Transamerica Building, and the Hyde and Powell Cable Car line are all within walking distance. The staff was friendly, our room was very clean, comfortable, and spacious. It also had free wireless internet access and unlimited daily in and out access to their own private garage which has a cheap fee of $20 a day compared to $30 in most places. Based on other's reviews the rooms on the street side of the hotel tend to be noisy because of the busy intersection this hotel is located at.(Broadway and Grant) The concierge automatically recommended the rooms towards the back of the hotel before I could even request for them. Even though our room's window had a view of another room window, our room was indeed quiet and we had a good night's rest after a full day of sight seeing. If you are looking for no-frills and a comfortable night's rest, the SW is for you.

It was a bit difficult to find the first night since it was a busy Friday evening. Lots of 1 way streets and road closures that night that it took awhile to find a detour to the location. Also very easy to miss the parking entrance to the hotel. Room were average size but comfortable and clean. Hotel location is the biggest plus. Your are located in on the main strip of Chinatown. Walk down Grant to get the full experience. And in about 15-20 minutes, you'll hit Union Station. Lots a little places to eat too. Dim Sum is a must have. Stay away from the restaurant right across the street on the corner. Can't remember the name but it is a Chinese place across from the SW. Tourist trap. A bit pricey for Chinese food with very little portions. Stick with the small joints for great authentic, cheap eats. Oh ya... back to the SW. Staff is friendly and helpful. They printed out a Southwest boarding pass without making me pay for the pre-paid internet kiosk in the lobby (which by the way has NO printer). The cleaning staff was very, very nice. Remember to tip. They are very(x10) appreciative of it. Breakfast is toast, bagels, etc. Nothing fancy enough for a light breakfast. Like I suggest, try the Dim Sum (I recommend You's Dim Sum right next to the SW. Also, may have been a fluke but early Sunday morning at 6AM we had a false fire alarm and had to evacuate the building. Again, probably a fluke but what a wake up call.
