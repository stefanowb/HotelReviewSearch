The bathroom was on the small side but clean with plenty of hot water and clean towels daily during our 6 night stay. Excellent breakfast choice, beautifully cooked and cheerfully served up by Rhona. We managed to park in one of the two spaces available on site, there are on street spaces, but it can be a bit tight during the working day. We walked into Edinburgh through the park, a lovely start to a day of sightseeing and museum trawling. A wonderful city, superb museums.", "title": "All round good experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "marabooka", "date": "November 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 183116708}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I 'phoned Rhona the day before we arrived to check if they had a vacancy and if so to advise that our arrival time was going to be after 11pm.", "title": "A most pleasant experience", "user": "geoff96", "date": "October 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 179378539}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "She organized it for the room key to be in the outside key box ... all done without any deposit/payment being made.", "title": "frendly and nice place", "user": "Bugarin", "date": "August 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 173626147}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Buses into the centre go past every ten minutes or so and the same back again.", "title": "Excellent B&B in Edinburg", "user": "Carmen F", "date": "August 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172488405}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "There is a Laundromat a few minutes bus drive away along with numerous", "title": "Helpful to the last.", "user": "MacraeFamily", "date": "August 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 171517750}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 3, "very good": 13, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 38}, "aka": "Auld Reekie Guest House Edinburgh, Scotland", "slim_ranking": 0.216216216216}
