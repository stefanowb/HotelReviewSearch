Plusses are that the appartments are very spacious with a huge living room with sofa, DVD,TV, and free WIFI, kitchen with everything you need, two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a big outdoor veranda (although no view, only backyard of the neighbours but since the beach is around the corner not a problem). Style is modern and very simple but fine. Also a very good location, 100 meters walk from the beach and close to restaurants and shops. So at checkin I was happy but after a few days we noticed lack of maintance and service, staff are nice but not interested to make your stay comfortable at all (apart from the guard at the road enterance, he was very sweet, helpfull and welcoming). Which means our appartment was bearly cleaned (could wright my name on the bedside table, appartment was only cleaned few times in a full week only sweeping the floor and a highspeed mop at 5 pm only because we asked!). Some days there wasn't cleaned at all and our carbage (kitchen!) was smelling away for a few days, nowhere to get rid of it (I wouldn't have mind doing it myself but nobody cared to explain where). Cleaning lady was mostly 'chilling out' outside the building when we came back from a day sightseeing not intending to do any work (we did get a nice smile and hello though). One day when she did a quick sweep through the appartment we noticed later she left all balcony doors unlocked....bit uncarefull. The worst was we didn't even had one towel change in one week!!! I knew in advance that they noticed on their website if you stay one week you only get a towel change twice, which is fine if you know in advance but no towel change at all is just very guest unfriendly. After 5 days we decided to buy ourselves some new towels....When we complained at the 'frontdesk' they said to go tell the cleaning lady ourselves.....OK???? Further we noticed little things kept unrepaired everywhere, from lightbulbs that were broken, parts of the door and floor beeing broken and eaten by termites, hughe brown stains in the curtains, pond in the garden green and empty, tiles at the pool broken.... all little things but it gave us the feeling nobody cares, in few years it will probably look terrible if it continues like this. Eveything is dusting away! So overall it was ok, the location and space inside were enjoyable but the 'no service' attitude did cause some irritation which is a pitty, beeing on holiday it would have been nice to come back after you day out in a cleaned place! We know it's not a hotel but cleaning/towel change was inluded and for what we paid (24.000 bath/week) we feel they could have a least have the appartment sweeped and mopped once a day + emptying the bins.
