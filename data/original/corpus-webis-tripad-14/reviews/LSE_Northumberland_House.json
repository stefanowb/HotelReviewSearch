Reception and welcome were lovely, I felt safe at all times, the room was very clean and although the bathroom was tiny (like the toilets on an aircraft), it had everything I needed. I had a room across the hall from a kitchen which I thought might be noisy but it wasn't at all and that was on a Saturday night in July. Would definitely stay again - not bad for \u00a360!", "user": "Scarlet013", "date": "August 12, 2010", "id": 74865804}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent Stay - Location Amazing!", "text": "This hotel is perfect if you want a basic place to sleep and get ready to go out.

Northumberland House was the perfect choice! It has the best location we could find, we were in a walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to go, and if not, the underground was just 1 minute walk away. We had a twin room so it was big enough for both of us. The bathroom we got was kind of big, which I wasn't expecting after reading other reviews. The bed were made almost everyday and the towels changed, but the sheets were only changed once in my three weeks stay. Northumberland Avenue is a great street, a lot more quiet than the streets near.
