Teetotum is certainly the best option in town, as it is tucked away from the main street (which is not the most desirable location - being more like a truck stop than the quaint little village that you might expect) on the road that leads to a spectacular beach. The concept is four rooms, attached to a very cool, hip bar/restaurant. The atmosphere is very laid back and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast is simple (just fruit & toast) and for the price you might expect a little bit more. Lunch and Dinner are well prepared and there are great daily specials. The rooms are stylish, in a minimalist way - but perfect for the beach/hippy environment of Tulum. One of the big positives are the complimentary bicycles - which you can take to explore the area. Teetotum's location is perfect for those wanting to not just go to the beach - but also visit the Mayan Ruins, Cenotes and wonderful nature that Tulum is famous for.

On the road to the beach, Teetotum lies just off Tulum Pueblo's lively main street, and a stones throw from Tulum's magnificent white sand Caribbean beaches."}
