The setting is absolutely lovely and the grounds are very well kept with a nice rural view. We enjoyed a nice meal in the restaurant - the service and food were excellent although the drinks expensive (an eye watering\u00a324 for the cheapest bottle of wine). The breakfast was also very good quality. The leisure facilities were very good and we particularly liked the outdoor jacuzzi. The one thing that was a disappointment was the room. The bathroom had been recently refurbished and was nice, but the rest of the room hadn't been done at the same time and the furniture and decor was all a bit late 1990s. There was also evidence of poor cleaning - dusty carpet and an empty shampoo bottle on the floor by the window. There was no air conditioning and the doors to the room were made of cheap wood veneer. This might sound like nit picking, but when you are promoting yourself as a four star establishment the little touches are very important, and some parts are now clearly in need of a re-fresh. I would go as far as to say that, from the outside, some of the accommodation looks like the apartments you'd find at a holiday camp. It is for that reason that I am only giving it a three star rating.", "title": "Setting lovely, rooms average", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Peejdj", "date": "August 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 137788432}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Booked last minute through late rooms because of the location and it looked an okay place.

We were impressed with the room. Lovely & modern complete with flat screen tv (and another lcd tv built into the wall in bathroom!) comfy bed, double wardrobe, patio balcony area to sit outside. Very nice! Our evening meal included in the price was @ 'The Lawns' restaurant. It was divine. The drinks are a bit pricey so expect this (\u00a324 bottle house wine). The food & service from James & Katie (and staff) was first class tho and could not be faulted. finshed with coffee & chocolates! The spa & pool is also really nice.

We stayed in a modern room in the old part of the hotel which had a comfortable bed and a lovely smart new bathroom. We paid \u00a3169 for D, B & B. The dinner was lovely and the dining room was very elegant. The food and service could not be faulted apart from a pavlova dessert which was a case of style over substance. The staff were charming and efficient. The young female waitress who served us cheese was very knowledgeable. We had a lovely but expensive wine (\u00a362) which was probably 3 and a half times the cost price and drinks were generally expensive. Breakfast was lovely and was also taken in the restaurant. I only wish we could have stayed longer to use the spa facilities. We paid \u00a33.99 to rent a recent film in our room which we enjoyed. i noticed on leaving that there was a June deal which would have cost slightly more which would have included afternoon tea and a spa treatment.
