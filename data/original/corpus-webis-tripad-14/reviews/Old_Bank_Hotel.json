I have previously used the Randolph whenever I have stayed in Oxford but on this occasion decided to try something new and was pleased I did. The hotel is centrally located albeit slightly further from the station than the Randolph. The free secure car park is also a real plus point. I found the young reception staff to all be extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and well presented. The room I stayed in was not large by any stretch of the imagination but there was just about room for a desk and chair as well as the double bed. The hotel has an interesting collection of art that is on display in the communal areas and also the bedrooms which certainly makes it feel unique. The Quod restaurant is very good and room service was excellent. The breakfast buffet was certainly good quality although not huge in range. Hotels in Oxford are notoriously expensive and the Old Bank is not cheap, although I was able to get a good rate through Expedia. Overall, I would certainly recommend the Old Bank, and particularly on the basis of the excellent service, this is now my preferred hotel in Oxford.", "title": "Small but perfectly formed", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DavidMurphy", "date": "December 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148002580}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012", "text": "Exceptional hotel with gorgeous rooms overlooking spires of famous colleges.

We havd a very tasty lunch in the restaraunt (QUOD) before we went to do some sightseeing.On our return again we were greeted by efficient and friendly staff and shown to our room ( no 21).This was a lovely room, very spacious and very well furnished with a large bathroom ( with lovely toiletries) and a very comfortable bed, The hotel has been done up to a very high standard and has lovely touches like cheese and biscuits and bottled water in the room. The breakfast was very good (although not the cheapest you will ever find) with a nice selection of well cooked dishes .The only slight drawback was we could hear the people in the room above us walking around, this is due to the construction of the building but maybe some consideration could be given to screwing the floorboards down to reduce the noise. We also had a couple of cocktails in the bar which is a great place to relax and has a real 'buzz' about it without being too loud. Overall a fantastic stay and we would definitely stay here again.

The downsides - the rooms are nothing special, although the rooms at the front do have great views over All Souls. They have tried to make them upmarket with Ren toiletries and bathrobes but to be honest for the cost I would have expected something larger. The bathrooms were a little tatty. The rooms were alse very warm even with the air conditioning on and radiators off. Service in the Quod restaurant was slow although it was always heaving so it obviously has a reputation. Food good. Our room rate did not include breakfast. But the ease with which you can come and go in the city without the need for a taxi was a definite plus point and if you have a child at university then it is ideal.

The room was spotlessly clean and the mini bar selection (with added farmhouse cheeseboard) was perfect for a cozy night in. Breakfast downstairs in the Quod was excellent as usual.

Some of the fruit (e.g. strawberries, oranges) put on the breakfast buffet were rotten, I would have expected attentive staff to have removed them. My soft-boiled eggs had to be sent back because they were under cooked, and it is poor if you can't boil an egg! The bread for the toast was thin and locked mass produced. The room was nice enough, but the decor in the library is very shabby, uncomfortable, uninviting and there is an unpleasant musty smell in that area of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for location, but in terms of price, and quality it leaves something to be desired. I think it has gone downhill since my stay in March this year.
