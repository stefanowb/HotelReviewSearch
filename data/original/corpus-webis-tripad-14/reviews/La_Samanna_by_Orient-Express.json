I, too, had a very difficult time convincing my daughters to leave - they wanted another week! La Samanna delivered on multiple fronts and rarely (if ever) disappointed. From the courteous and informative airport shuttle driver, to the personable/helpful front desk/reception team, the knowledgeable concierge staff, friendly restaurant team, to an experienced and guest-first water sports team, and a very attentive beach service staff, La Samanna is a five star hotel/resort in every way possible. Previous Trip Advisory reviews complained of less than desirable service at La Samanna - this was not our experience at all. Exec team member Maylis and front desk staffer Isabel's welcoming smile, lovely demeanor, and desire to make every aspect of our trip magical was heartwarming. Concierges Monica and Roberta went out of their way to find our lost bags at the Julian International Airport and have them delivered to our room (one of our flight connections was delayed and our bags didn't make it). Julian and Boy in the Sports Shack introduced jet skiing to my daughters and truly helped make my girls' beach experience the best ever! We enjoyed our two bedroom suite (15 steps from the beach) so much! Beautifully appointed, recently renovated, and perfectly air conditioned, it was sometimes difficult to leave! We did explore other restaurants on the French side of St. Martin (we loved Le Cigale), but our food quality and presentation at La Samanna was excellent. We rented a car at the resort (so convenient) for a few days to explore the French side of the island (the heavily developed and overly commercialized and touristy Dutch side was not our cup of tea) and especially enjoyed the adventure course/ziplining experience at Loterie Park.
