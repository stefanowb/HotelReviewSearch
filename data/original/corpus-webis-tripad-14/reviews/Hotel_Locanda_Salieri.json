It was a 5-10 minute walk from the bus station, wheeling our suitcases. It takes a little longer to walk to the train station. To get to the train station, because we refused to take the expensive water taxis, we had to lug our suitcases on staired bridges, but it was worth the savings. Since it was near the bus and train stations, it was very easy to tour Venice as vaporetto (water buses?) stations were located in the bus and train stations too.

In November 2007 we stayed at the Locanda Salieri after reviewing it on tripadvisor. This was a super little hotel. for our north american cousins. Venice is an expensive place to stay. Also the size of the room will be small, in some cases very small unless paying 400+ euros a night, then you can get a reasonable size room. The Salieri is very close to the bus terminus [pizzale Roma] and vaperetto [public water taxi's] less than 10 minutes walk, over 2 bridges. the Locanda is by a canal and has a small reception area [tiny] up some stairs are the rooms, so if you have difficulty in walking up stairs this is not for you. our room was on the first floor which was a normal size room for venice. very clean. small bathroom with shower, toilet and bidet. good hot water from the shower. we were bed and breakfast. breakfast was held in the next door ribo restaurant. this had a very large garden patio at the back. buffet breakfast with a hot choice. plenty of variety to start the walking day. The staff were very friendly at both the locanda and restaurant. we had dinner at the restaurant on one of our evenings. It was very good with a much more extensive toscana and venetian menu [than you will find in many venice bistro's and restaurants] with a wonderful wine list. [it has a small seperate wine area where we had some antipasta for late lunch and a super bottle of 2003 Valpolicella]. If you like chocolate have the chocolate souffle- it is to die for. The Locanda is in easy walking distance for the Friari; Campo Margherita ; Railway station. I Would recommend both the Locanda and the restaurant.

I went back downstairs and spoke with reception. He told me I had been upgraded at no charge to a 100 euro room. I was ecstatic.

It had marble floors and walls, armoire, desk, luggage rack, large mirror in entryway, two night stands, a chair and a phone. The bathroom had a marbled shower, pedestal sink, mirror, hair dryer, and towel rack. It looked newly renovated. It was spotless with the exception of a long black hair in the sink. The balcony was facing a little canal that had light traffic that included gondolas. There was a double wrought iron planter containing red geraniums, and shutters.
