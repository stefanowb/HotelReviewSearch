However I cannot rate it a 5 because it did not have a safe deposit box in the room. I would expect this in a hotel of this quality. Also, the full length mirror had no light over it and so was not very useful. I would not have noticed this minor issue, but I was going to a formal party and really did need to use the mirror. It is a shame that there is an abandoned run down restaurant in front that deters from the overall looks of the area. I would certainly stay here again due to the fine service from the staff.", "title": "Needs a couple of minor additions to the room to make it a 5", "user": "mianoi", "date": "September 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 118546461}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011", "text": "Very nice CY in so-so surroundings, but very convenient to PVD.
