The room is bright and modern, I really liked the mural of Marseille on the wall, the easy-to-use safe, the instant coffee/tea pot, free WiFi and the ultra-modern bathroom with a rain forest shower head integrated into the ceiling (sorry previous reviewer commenting on showers for short people, I believe you couldn't figure out how to use it correctly).", "title": "Mercure - Port and City centric", "user": "ominvent", "date": "May 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 160239173}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "In my opinion there were 3 things missing from an otherwise excellent hotel. 1) The thermostat in the room didn't seem to have any control of the temperature in the room. 2) The room contained only 3 small pillows.

Shame on the staff member for not just delivering a simple, not uncommon request with a smile. 3) There is no common-use computer for printing airline boarding passes.
