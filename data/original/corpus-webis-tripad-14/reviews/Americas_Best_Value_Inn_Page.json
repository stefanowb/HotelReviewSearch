Walking to our room it smelled so strong of smoke. I was worried our room would smell also, but thankfully it did not. The room did not appear to be ultra clean. There were not enough towels in the room for the number of people we told them would be staying there. None of the ice machines in the entire building had any ice in them. Our bed rolled to one side. I thought I was going to roll off it during the night. When I pulled back the blanket, the sheets were so wrinkled that I honestly wondered if they had just made the bed without changing the sheets. I am sure I was just being paranoid, but that is really how they looked. I wish I had stayed at the Marriott property where I know I would be guaranteed a comfortable bed with crisp clean sheets. The kids did enjoy the pool the next morning, but it didn't open until 10:00 and check out was at 11:00.
