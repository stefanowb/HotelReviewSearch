When we made the reservation we were a bit skeptical since it is one of the smallest room in the lodge. When we got there, we were pleasantly surprised at this newly remodelled room. The room is superbly clean and neatly decorated. Although it's small but we don't feel it's really \"that\" small. Cannon beach area's accommodations are famous of being expensive and McBee Cottage provides a good accommodation with very affordable rate. Plus it's extremely close to the Haystack Rocks and within blocks of Cannon Beach downtown!
