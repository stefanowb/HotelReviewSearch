Questions were answered immediately especially room service. I requested several special dishes with no problem. I would recommend this resort to others even though I had a slight issue with Jose by the pool. On our first morning to the resort we took our two children (5 & 9) to the pool. We were out early probably by 9:30 that morning. The pool area had a few guests already but not many. My children had only been in the pool a few minutes when Jose approached me to tell me my children had to quote, \"not yell, horseplay, jump, splash or play Marco Polo in the pool.\" and that he was just telling me \"before he got complaints\". I was shocked. I've never been told this before at any other resort from Westin, Hyatt, Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. I said I would tell them but they are children and they may make noise. Needless to say we didn't stay long by the pool. I was not told at check in there were restrictions on children using the pool so I was confused by this comment by Jose. The next day I checked with the front desk and they did not know why Jose would tell us that and that children are allowed in the pool area as long as they are accompanied by an adult. The Manager-Hillary did leave me a nice message in our room apologizing for this but we never did get an answer as to why we were told this. That same day we spent several hours by the pool and there were other children jumping and splashing all over the pool so I really don't understand why Jose told us this.", "title": "top notch service, gorgeous property", "user": "napervilletraveler", "date": "April 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14774211, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 liked everything especially the service and mediterranean ambience", "disliked": "\u2014 another kids pools would be nice"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "While I would recommend this resort I would probably choose a different hotel if we return with our children.

The valet and bellmen are just wonderful, we never had to wait long to pick up or drop off our car.
