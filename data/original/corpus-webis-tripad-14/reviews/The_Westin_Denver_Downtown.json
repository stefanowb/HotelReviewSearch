Our room had the Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Bath, which meant a fluffy duvet and pillows on the bed and a good shower with 2 heads that had good pressure. The towels were touted as Heavenly, and I found them to be pretty good as far as hotel towels are concerned. The room was clean and updated, and I felt comfortable there. The room was quiet too, which I appreciated because I am a light sleeper. We only split an order of chicken fingers and fries from room service, so while that was good, I can't comment on the dining choices at the Westin.

I called down to the front desk to ask if this was a handicapped room to see what I would be told. The gal I spoke to said yes, this is a handicapped room.

I told her that I thought all Westin rooms had the \"Heavenly Shower\", and she said this is correct and my room has this featured shower. I told her no, this is not the case, as my shower has a special detachable single shower head (not the dual-jet Heavenly Shower head), and there is not one grab bar in the shower but three! She was unaware of this, and did not offer a change of rooms (and I did not ask, either, as it was late and I just wanted to get some sleep). Also, the entire shower/tub/tile and the bathroom counter are all original and were NOT refurbished when this hotel had all the rooms redone. It looks the same as it did 10 years ago.
