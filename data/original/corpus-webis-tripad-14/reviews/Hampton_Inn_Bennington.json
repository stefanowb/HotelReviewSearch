The staff was fantastic! We were greated by a warm welcome and check in was very fast and efficient. The bedding (which I guess is new) was very fresh and clean. I was pleasently surprised to see that my socks did not get dirty on the carpet (which is normal in most hotels). The room was spacious and cofortable. We went down to breakfast the next morn, and I was again impressed. I would typically spend $10 a person at Denny's for a hot meal like what they served. The wireless was strong (and FREE huge bonus!) I did not use the fitness center, but the indoor pool and hot tub were great.

Breakfast was above average for a Hampton, plenty to eat. Local calls were free, business center had an available computer, though we did not use it. Location is in the middle of a parking lot surrounded by strip malls, however it is easy to find. The hotel was busy, early foliage crowd.
