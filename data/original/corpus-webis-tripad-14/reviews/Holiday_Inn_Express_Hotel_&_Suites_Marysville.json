With the package we got a $50 gift card that brought the room price down $10 plus a few extra food goodies. (We are priority club members, so some of the food may have been for that). I love the Holiday Inn's new look with white bedding, two kinds of pillow & four pillows per bed, and a Flat screen tv. The breakfast was very good with real, fluffy scrambled eggs! The hotel is right off of I-5 and very easy to access the Seattle Premium Outlets without having to get back on the Interstate. There is an Applebee's close by.

Accomodations were fine. The area is breathtakingly beautiful. The complimentary breakfast is a nice touch. The only issue with the breakfast is the cereal is not Kelloggs but some generic brand, so the cereal is tasteless. But it is included in the price of the rooms(s). It would be nice to serve to Kelloggs Corn Flakes, Raisin Bran etc to the guests instead of tasteless bargain brand cereal. The hotel left me a nice message via e-mail a few days after the stay.
