Breakfast was very adequate with biscuits and gravy, waffles bagels etc. Our dog enjoyed it as well and they provide clean up bags in the pet area.

We were just passing through the Tri-Cities on our way to Boise and this was our stop along the way because the location is perfect if just passing through toward/away from Oregon. Check in took about 30 seconds. The room was way larger than expected. We had two queen beds and there was still room for a desk and a comfortable chair with ottoman. Room was super clean. Breakfast was great, especially liked the blueberry waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, which I have not seen at a continental breakfast before. I also loved the actual temperature control in the room so you could actually set a temp that you wanted instead of just \"cool\" or \"heat\" and then living with it all night.

The front desk clerk was pleasant on check-in. Our room wasn't ready so she gave us a map and directions to the Visitor Center and the park. We drove to Columbia Park and spent some time walking around, which was a nice break for us and the dog after several hours in the car. When we returned they had upgraded us to a mini-suite, which was awesome. Room was spacious and clean and the furnishings were newer. Wireless internet access was easy and fast enough. I found the bed very comfortable for a hotel, my husband did not. There was a grassy pet area with bags for clean-up. The pool and hot tub area looked clean and well kept, though we did not try it due to the large number of families with children who took advantage of that area. The work out room was small, but adequate, and I did use the treadmill. The only negative is that the workout room is not air conditioned and was very hot. The breakfast buffet is pretty meh. The usual coffee, juice, doughnuts, bagels, make your own waffles, yogurt, cereal. Whatever hot entr\u00e9e was offered was always gone when we got there, so can't comment on that. I thought the rooms were pretty quiet. We rarely heard our neighbors. The shower in the room above was very loud, otherwise it was hallway noise, and you can't blame the hotel for guest/parents/kids who are inconsiderate of where they are and yell/run/talk loud in a hotel hallway. Overall we had a great stay, with one concern. Somehow I demagnetized my husband's room card. We stopped at the front desk and asked for a new one, which the young man at the front desk issued without asking for any type of ID. While he was very pleasant, the lack of security left us a bit surprised.
