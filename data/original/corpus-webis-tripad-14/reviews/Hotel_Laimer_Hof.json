The tram is only about a pleasant 10 minute walk from the hotel and you can buy tickets from the front desk for 9 euros which is good for 5 people ( I beleive 2 adults and 3 children). The rooms come with fans which are sufficient if it is warm outside. It also has an English movie channel (free) which is rare for smaller hotels in Europe. You can get a bit tired of watching CNN and BBC every night. I would definitley stay at the Laimer Hof without hesitation.
