Unfortunately, we had a very bad experience there. My husband and I booked a suite for two nights in April, 2011(a four month advanced reservation for which we paid 68% upfront). Upon arrival, we were told that \"someone\" had called and said that we would not be arriving until the following evening and that they had given our suite away for the first night. The alleged caller could not be identified. We found this to be utterly proposterous. After some negotiations witht the receptionist there(the only person available we could talk to), we reluctantly agreed to stay in a standard room the first night and then be moved to our original and confirmed suite the following night. We agreed with the receptionist that we would pay the standard room rate for the suite as a recompense for their mistake. The standard room turned out to be too warm(my husband didn't sleep all night) with a very loud fan in the bathroom. We also requested some face cloths which we were told would be delivered but never were until I requested them a 3rd time.More on the towel issue later. We tolerated the aggravation and looked forward to our suite the second night. The suite was indeed larger but was inconveniently located. The bedroom was right next to the parking lot which did not provide adequate privacy unless you closed the window and the shade. You needed to punch in some numbers on a lock in order to enter the hallway to the suite and then unlock your door. This was very inconvenient. The window in the living room overlooked trash cans. When we checked out the next day, we were again surprised that the agreement we had made with the receptionist for the price of the room had not been honored and we needed to spend our vacation time haggling again for them to honor our agreement which they did finally honor.
