I go out of my way to stay at boutique hotels all over the world and this is my favorite. There is something magical about the place. Part of the charm of Isla Mujeres is that it is a genuine, one of a kind place. I have been going to the island since I got married 22 years ago.

First, I have stayed at the hotel since its' inception. The prior awards and positive review were well-deserved. The place was lovely, serene, catered to a quiet, private kind of traveler and I thought exceptional for the price. The pool area chairs and beds were covered with beautiful terry coverings, large rolled towels in abundance, foliage perfectly maintained, nice quiet beach area, careful attention paid to pretty lighting. In 2008 I stayed and thought things were falling off a bit - the towels were stained, the pool area not maintained as well but still a nice place. My trip this past month would be the last time I would consider staying unless I was convinced it was restored to it's former beauty. I am hopeful because I don't think they would be investing as much time and expense to a spa and gym if they didn't intend to make the rest of the place up to standard and I really do believe the owner is dedicated to excellence. My guess is that they are working around the clock to get this place ready for high season - if that is the case and I find out it's back in line I will continue to vacation there.
