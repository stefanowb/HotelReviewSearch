They do have a very convenient shuttle service to BWI. The hotel is in a safe area and outdoor appearance/lobby area is nice. The rooms are average clean - they could use some redecorating and new TV's. The TV has cable but is a poor reception - the same with the phone - it had a lot of static. Our room was directly above the pool so it smelled like chlorine which was annoying - request AWAY from the pool. There is a nice restaurant just literally a few feet away but doesn't open until lunchtime. The clerks are helpful and the lobby has a computer work station. The breakfast had TOASTER waffles (misleading on their website) but is good with a lot of variety for a continental breakfast. The pool was clean and warm with a hot tub.
