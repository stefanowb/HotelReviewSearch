It took 1 hour to receive the food which half was missing (they forgot half of the order) and the other half was cold. We left the food sitting in the room, very disappointed as there were NO other choices of dining places. Also, there was no clock in the room. We were also told that breakfast (when we booked through Hotels.com) would be included in our room rate, and it wasn't. There were no bath accessories, shower gel, shampoo, etc (nothing). We felt like we were in prison staying there. Also, the shuttle service was VERY late picking us up from the airport. We had to call and they finally made it. They were also late leaving to take us back to the airport and we almost missed our plane. The shuttle driver stood outside for 20-25 minutes smoking while anxious passengers sat on the shuttle to try to rush to catch their flight. He said the shuttle leaves every 15 minutes, when in fact it had been well over 15 minutes and the shuttle bus was full and we were ready to leave. The shuttle driver looked at me like I was crazy when I asked when the bus would be leaving (after it just sat for over 20 mins with no word from him). The service is not guest friendly and if I would have known that I would have chosen the Marriott Hotel or Sofetil which were nearby. By the way we ordered (from room service) french onion soup that was the worse mush I've ever had (mind you, this is France and I expected better) and my husband couldn't even eat his FRENCH fries which arrived cold. That is such a sad representation of the Hilton. We are rewards card users that even though I gave the front desk our rewards card number, I don't even trust that she entered it into the system (they were so unorganized at the front desk).", "title": "Treated like royalty", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "yayum", "date": "May 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7654867, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 reception, room accomadations ( comfort, quiet) and location as close to airport", "disliked": "\u2014 no complaints"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled solo", "text": "Our excellent experience at Barcelona Hilton was like night and day to the horrible experience at Hilton Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.
