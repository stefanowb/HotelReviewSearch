It has a great location 5 minutes from the airport and downtown. Manager's reception M-Th 5-7, beer, wine chips and salsa. Even complimentary bottle of water and pretzels at check in. Stayed in a King study, for a govt rate of 92/nt. Room wasn't huge but had a couch with pullout, free wireless in room and on pool patio. Lobby is very nice, continental breakfast had everything we needed:bagels, pastries cereal, coffee, juice, yogurt, and some rotated hot items, french toast sticks and sausage this AM. Complimentary USA Today paper every morning. Mall less than a mile away for shopping and movie options(small theater). Great king bed, very comfortable. Saw a king suite while it was being cleaned, two rooms very spacious. Food Lion grocery store around the corner, and CVS pharmacy. Ate at California Dreaming and Hyman's..loved both. Shopped the Tanger outlet mall, great kid clothing stores and deals. Also shopped King Street and Market area. Fort Sumpter tour this afternoon, chilly, bring a jacket.

We stayed here two nights in mid-June. We looked it up on tripadvisor, and took a chance. We are glad that we did! The hotel was VERY clean, spacious with a couch, and had good amenities, including free internet access. There were many TV stations available. There was an iron and an ironing board, and a hairdryer in our room. The A/C unit could actually be controlled and tamed (imagine that in a hotel :), and we slept well in the comfortable king sized bed. We enjoyed Charleston from this hotel, and depending on what side of Charleston we wanted to access, we took either the bypass, which is very convenient to the hotel, or the road directly in front of the hotel. This was cost effective, for the parking downtown was about $6 for an all-day slot, and we would have paid a higher cost for a hotel downtown, and would have paid parking in addition.

The hotel is extremely clean (or should I say spotless...) they also offer not just your ordinary complimentary breakfast...but a wide assortment of items including biscuits, southern gravy and grits.
