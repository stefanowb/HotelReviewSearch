The Club level rooms are very comfortable, spacious and quiet and have gorgeous bathrooms. The Club lounge set-up is excellent, continental breakfast is available - very generous, altho no hot food - cakes/snacks from 3pm to 5pm (most people are out sightseeing) and a 'buffet' from 6pm until 8pm. Not the biggest buffet in the world, but more than enough for us. Free wine/beer/sparkling wine during these two hours also, and very generous amounts. The club lounge was a home from home and we relaxed there in the evenings over a couple of glasses of wine, before having an evening stroll and then turning in after a day's sightseeing. Berlin is a must-see city and don't forget Potsdam - a history buff's treat - and the Hyatt is the place to stay. We loved it. Buy the 2 or 3 day transport pass for 18 or 22 euros, you can hop on and off U-bahns, S-bahns and buses all day.", "title": "As good as all the reviews say", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "patnlcc", "date": "October 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5946624, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 relaxed atmosphere"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "I went on a big European family vacation this summer with the whole clan (four adults, three kids, four countries, 3 weeks), and one of the highlights was the Grand Hyatt in Berlin; by far the best hotel in a trip filled with wonderful stays.

There are numerous museums, a big shopping mall, a huge live theater (Blue Man Group had just opened), an IMAX theater (and film museum), all within blocks of this hotel (and the kids loved the Mc Donald's next door!).

The suite was a real gem, with a nice view out of the corner living room that overlooked the front entrance of the hotel. The mini bar was COMPLIMENTARY (the kids loved this, as they had been forbidden to enter the mini bars in any of our previous hotels!), and there was even a stocked bar with liquor as well as a complimentary bottle of wine (my dad cracked this open right away) and a beautiful bowl of fresh fruit and cheese. There was also a DVD player with a BOSE surround sound system in the living room (There was large selection of DVD's to choose from in the concierge club room as well, with lot's of family friendly entertainment). The floor to ceiling doors opened to a bedroom with a king bed. The decor was modern (almost \"cubist\") and predominantly black (of course!), but suprisingly the room was not \"dark\". Our rooms on the upper floors were just as nice for \"regular\" rooms.
