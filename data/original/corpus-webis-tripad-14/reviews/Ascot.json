However, the room was small and the price too much for what was offered. Also, there were problems with the phone in the room - we couldn't get it to work properly, even after contacting reception - and they recommended a very bad touristy restaurant to us even after we especially asked for a non-touristy one. The price was too high for what we got - but maybe that's just Rome.", "user": "boonyc", "date": "August 7, 2006", "id": 5575788}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good stay good laocation", "text": "My Wife and I recently stayed in the Hotel Ascot, near Termini. Although the hotel was very basic it was very clean and the staff were friendly and courteous at all times. The shower was excelent, although the towels were a bit wierd (a bit like drying yourself with a table cloth, I would imagine). The only draw back was the noise insulation from within the hotel i.e. the lobby and other rooms was a bit poor. However, the windows provided excelent insulation from the noise of the busy street directly outside. Our room even had a small balcony was provided an ideal spot to people watch from.. All in all, a very good hotel at a very good price (for Rome). I would not have any hesitation to stay there again and would recomend it. Oh, they also looked after our bags before and after we checked in.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 31, 2006", "id": 4824184}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006", "text": "We stayed there in a room with four twin beds and a private bath for only 105 euros a night including continental breakfast.
