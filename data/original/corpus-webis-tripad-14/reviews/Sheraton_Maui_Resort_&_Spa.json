Our friends had a nice room too. The beds were comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. The pools were beautiful but way too cold to swim in.

The grounds, room, service and staff were first-class. We opted for a package that included breakfast which was fit for everyone's appetite. Our deluxe room (about $600 per night) had a direct view of Lanai; we had never seen so many whales - it seemed as though you could reach out and touch them. Since we checked late in the evening a king bed room (that we thought we booked) was not available but the hotel did move us to one the next day. In addition to excellent hotel dining, there are plenty of great restaurants in Lahaina; Longhi's, Kobi's and Kimo's to mention a few. If you like fresh seafood Maui is the place for you. We found that the helicopter ride up to the volcano was exhilarating. You've got to try it. We had rented a convertible car but rarely used it with the top down. Pretty much all attractions can be viewed within a 60 minute drive except for the infamous Road to Hana. We passed on it but did view the remote area on our helicopter excursion. Note that most helicopter operators heavily discount their fares if you call in and make your reservation after 5:00 pm.

We bought a package that includes daily breakfast for 2, but when we got here, we found out it was buy one get one free. What? The old bait and switch tactic! We ended up trying the breakfast the first day and it was lovely. The price for one person with tax and service charge (yes a service charge of $9.36!) and tip came to $40!! We chose to never eat anything else at the Sheraton and while talking with other couples during our stay, we heard the same thing consistently. We found a couple great spots nearby that were extremely reasonable and we were prepared to pay much more. Sheraton screwed themselves, but I am sure they don't care, since so many others pay the prices. The hotel is also desperately in need of updating. The carpet in the hallways is tattered and bubbling (a tripping hazard), the bathroom vanity is extremely low (and this is not a handicapped room) and the mattresses are well worn (comfortable linens, but extremely soft beds that slope to one side from use).

The hotel was beautiful but everything there is very expensive. $10.00 for a beer, $15.00 for a burger (and you pay extra if you want fries). I stayed in building 6 which has its pros and cons. The ocean view cannot be bat. I saw the \"ocean view\" from buildings 2 and 3 and it was good but you had to look over the grass, trees, and pool to see the ocean. Building 6 is a true ocean view, looking over 10 feet of grass and then ocean. The big con to building 6 is that it is a long walk to get to the beach or lobby or anywhere else. From the lobby you need to take 3 elevators and walk quite a bit, I would still say the view is worth it. We were there in MArch which is mating season for the humpback whales and we would sit on our lanai drinking coffee in the morning and watching the whales play, amazing experience. The short walk to whalers village is well worth it a neat little place with some great shopping! The snorkelling at black rock is terrific and there are several sea turtles that hang around so you are sure to see them! Just be careful when you get to the tip of the rock as the rocks look far away when you are looking under the water but when you pop your head up they are right there and the waves will push you into them...ouch!
