The countryside around the hotel is beautiful and there's quite a bit to see if you can drag yourself outside. We loved it all; the lovely bedrooms, the fabulous spa with some 5 or 6 different saunas and wonderful pool and the sightseeing. The hotel restaurant is really good, with dinner menus centred about the local wines, and a great breakfast buffet.
