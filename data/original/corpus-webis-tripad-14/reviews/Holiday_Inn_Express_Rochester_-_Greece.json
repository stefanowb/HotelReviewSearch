Express Check-out appreciated. The free HD-TV is what most impressed me. Refusing to have to pay for it at home it was a real treat to watch my Sunday NFL games in HD. King bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is one of those with the sink and dressing area in the room. A real plus if travelling with your partner. Loive Garden is across the street and the taxi driver said there is a major mall just down the street. I did not go to either. The only negative I would have would be the ancient and slow, noisy single elevator.
