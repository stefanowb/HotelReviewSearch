Great room, nice, with King Sleep number bed (just like home) Microwave and Refrigerator in room w/ freezer. 20 places to eat in a 2 block area along with a convenience store 1/2 block away. Rooms were clean with nice linens, appeared to have been recently updated. Room service was reasonably priced, and prompt (no more that 20 minutes). Neighborhood appears generally upscale and safe looking. A Nice touch was that Gray Line tours picks up at the hotel and returns you after your tour...Metro was just 20 minutes from anywhere we needed to get to. Will stay there again.

The bed has a hard ridge on the edge which makes it uncomfortable when you sleep near the edge. We just didn't like the air bed feel no matter how we adjusted the bed. I ended up sleeping in the chair 2 nights because I couldn't sleep on this kind of mattress. This hotel has no regular beds (except for handicap) and because of this reason only, we will not return. The bedding and pillows were very nice and the water pressure and temperature was good. We were very happy with this Radisson except for the beds.

Upon complaining and asking if this was normal, the front desk said they were having problems with it, but it had been fixed. They thought it was a setting on my individual shower control, and all they offered was an apology. My collegue who was on the 5th floor has the same problem. Obviously not the individual shower control. Also, we were there during the daylight savings time change. My collegue unfortunately depended on the hotel's automatic wake-up call system to work. It was never changed for the time change. She was woke up an hour late. She complained. This was three days before we left. It was still not set correctly the day we left. The hotel has a pool. It is outddors. But it is only open during the summer. Ok, fine. At least I can jump in the hot tub, right. WRONG. No hot tub at all. Evidently this hotel just doesn't like hot water. And the gym. HA. No kidding, a room the size of a hotel guest room, with five pieces of equipment.
