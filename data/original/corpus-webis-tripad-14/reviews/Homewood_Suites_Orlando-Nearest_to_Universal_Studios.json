I don't recall ever staying at a Homewood with such a small living room; it was barely adequate for our 2 teenage kids and like a previous reviewer, we too had to move furniture from this room into the main bedroom. Kitchen space was also the smallest I'd seen at a Homewood. Other than that, the hotel was fine. Breakfast was ok, although they were very slow to replenish items, but it was fine. The room was clean, and even though our room faced the freeway it was very quiet. Location was good. Wireless internet service was free, fast and reliable. I've stayed at better suite hotels before in Orlando for this price, but they were not available when I was making reservations. If you plan to use the pull-out sofa at this location, be prepared for it to be a very tight squeeze.", "title": "Small room, but adequate", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ats262m", "date": "April 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7293610, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Wireless internet, free cooked breakfast, seperate bedroom, 2 TV's, kitchen area", "disliked": "\u2014 small living room, breakfast items replenished very slowly"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at Homewood Suites with my 2 children, age 7 and 11. We booked a suite with 2 queen beds, the beds were very comfortable. My son slept on the sofa bed and found it to be more comfortable by putting the mattress on the floor, pretty typical for any sofa bed. The room was very clean and the kitchen accomadations exceeded my expectations with a full sized refrigerator and full sized dishwasher. There was plate settings for four, all very clean, along with basic sized pots and pans and cooking utensils. The breakfast was plentiful,my picky children had no trouble finding enough to fill them up. We only did the dinner once due to the timing, parks were open until 7 and the dinner was over at 7. The one time we did do it the food was plentiful and would definitely be enough to qualify as a dinner. \"House\" wine and beer were plentiful. We didn't use the shuttle service.

The light evening buffet and free drinks, (red/ white wine and beer mon - thur evenings, 5 to 7pm) was a fantastic bonus-we used it every evening. All staff were extremely friendly and accomodating. Free internet access and gym. My only advice to anyone going there is take note of the following when trying to find it .Head for the Sheraton Tower as a landmark because Homewood is tucked away. Going up International Drive with wet n wild on your right go straight across Universal Bvld and access to Homewood will be about 200-300 yards or so on the left and it is tucked away so watch out, but it is well worth finding.", "title": "Don't hesitate booking this one!", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "iangoo", "date": "December 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6339124, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The value for money", "disliked": "\u2014 No negatives"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in November for several days and was Very Happy with the cleanliness of the hotel as well as all the amenities.

One mile from Universal Studio's so you can walk or take a FREE shuttle. I like this place because it is a Suite.

You actually don't need the kitchen....They give you a complete Full hot breakfast buffet every morning...Bacon.sausage,eggs,potatoes,fruit,yogart,waffles and much more. It may vary a bit each day. BIG PLUS...they even have a light meal in the evenings Mon.-Thurs. including wine and beer. One night they had shepards pie,pineapple and ceaser salad. The next night they had cheese burgers,fruit and regular salad. Not bad for an evening meal. It's all included in the price of your room. Meals change nightly. They even put a meanu in your room. Last year we paid $154 a night and this year it was $124. You can't beat it. Clean, well located place. We wouldn't stay anywhere else when at Unniversal and you can always drive to Disney from there too. Next door a couple paid more than we did,not a suite and no food. Stay here instead.
