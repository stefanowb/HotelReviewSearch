Around the corner was a small desk and then there was a side room with a safe, ironing board and room for my suitcase. There was definitely not enough room for the suitcase in the bedroom which made it slightly inconvenient. From looking at the floor plan not all rooms are this shape. The bathroom was fine but again, a slightly strange lay out and because they encased the shower and loo in glass cubicles it made it very cramped. So cramped that it was hard to get out of the loo stall. The sink area was very cramped too and so there was not really enough room for a washbag and its contents. Again, the bed was very hard, as they all are in China - I had hoped that by staying at 5 star Western chain hotels they'd be softer - no such luck! The breakfast was about fifteen pounds which was expensive but there was a good range of stuff on offer and at least the pastries were fresh unlike the stale offerings I had at the Peninsula in Beijing! However it involved a long walk 10-15 minute walk to the other building which was a bore when you have an early start. They also charge for the internet which is frustrating when it would be free if you had a laptop in your room.

I happened upon the Hyatt while I was walking around town and didn't think it was in as good of a location (much too busy and noisy) or as modern as the Sofitel. The Sofitel is set back from the street so you don't hear much of the noise, and is part of a hotel complex that also includes the People's hotel and Grand Mercure so the grounds are very well kept even as you step out of the hotel. The gym and pool are fantastic, and there's a spa service as well. They made my stay in Xi'an as enjoyable as possible, and it was a great deal money-wise. All the good things said about this hotel are definitely true!
