The hosts, Jim and Kathy Huston, make you feel like you have known them forever, and welcomed us like family. The home is warm, inviting, comfortable and uniquely Alaskan. Jim's wildlife and fish trophies enhance the artistic, Alaska-themed rooms that Jim designed and created \u2013 including 3D mural paintings! Amazing! The quiet location has breath-taking mountain views that ascend above the fish-teeming lake just outside the door. Our breakfast was delicious, and according to the locals we talked to, Kathy\u2019s cooking is well known as the best in the local community.

Since this was the first time we had a retreat, we were a bit nervous looking for a place to stay. When we stumbled upon the Alaskan Host B and B, we knew we had a winner! The living room was large, yet cozy and comfortable. The bedrooms were spacious and decorated with Alaskan flair. Our hunting husbands would be jealous with all the animal mounts around the house : ) Kathy and Jim were good cooks (we even had moose sausage!) and Jim has a never-endling list of jokes!
