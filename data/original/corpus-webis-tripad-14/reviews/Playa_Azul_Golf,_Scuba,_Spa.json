When we arrived the Playa Azul, the lobby had no air conditioning, all windows were open and flies everywhere. We booked our stay on line and when we arrived the hotel, they told me that we needed to pay extra for our teens. We entered our room and the musty smell was overwhelming. The beds were hard and damp from the humidity. We then went outside to see the pool - it was filthy. I wouldn't even dip my foot in it. The beach - if you want to call it a beach - was very small. The water area to swim was also very small. It reminded me of a boat slip. No way would I go in the water. We left the hotel and went back to Cancun.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 1, 2005", "id": 3627707}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very quaint", "text": "My husband and I stayed at Playa Azul for 4 days in May 2005. It was very clean. The beds were not as hard as other people have reported. We did have a little trouble controlling the A/C, but it was usually too cold, not too hot. I believe it was because of the humidity--can't do anything about that!! The beach wa small, but never crowded and very clear and pretty. The pool was very clean and nicely kept. They cleaned it everyday. The breakfast buffet was included with our room and was excellent. A lot of variety. All employees very nice and accomodating. They supply you with plenty of bottled water, so no worries there. Overall, we had a very nice stay.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 9, 2005", "id": 3452378}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005", "text": "Just returned from Cozumel after a week stay beginning on March 4th.
