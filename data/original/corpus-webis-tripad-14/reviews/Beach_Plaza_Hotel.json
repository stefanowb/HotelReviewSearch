It was pouring down rain, so we waited until 12 to try and check-in, and to our surprise the allowed us to check-in before 4 without any extra charges. We were staying in the Apartments which were situated right next to the road. Upon immediate inspection of our room we were disappointed. The 2 area rugs in the room were both stained beyond belief. The sheets on the beds didn't look the cleanest. The tile in the kitchen was cracked. A decent amount of silverware and dishes were supplied. On Saturday, our second day, after the maids \"cleaned\" our room (which meant they supplied fresh tiles and changed the trash....nothing else), we realized we were missing a fifty dollar bill out of one of our drawers. At first, we just thought we counted wrong or lost it, but then on Monday we again had a fifty dollar bill missing out of another drawer. It's a shame that you can't leave money in the hotel drawers for fear of it being stolen by the maids. The cops were called and nothing was done. I do not recommend this hotel unless you have money just lying around and do not worry about theives.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 1, 2005", "id": 3237527}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Absolutely Terrible", "text": "Dining-I do recommend everyone eat at Happy Jack's Pancake House.

Usually, we stay at condominiums, but with the location and generally good reveiws, we chose to stay at this hotel. We love Phillip's Seafood Restaurant, the crabs are good and the atmosphere is fun, and this review does not express our opinion of the restaurant. This hotel is a complete pigs-stye. Upon check-in, we went to our parking-lot view room. The hallways stunk of cat urine, and were dark and moist. The room was even worse. The carpet looked so dirty, one had to really think before taking off their own shoes. The rooms were also small and a complete fire-trap. There were no windows or vents in the bathrooms (which I know is required in all hotels), which were far from clean. On our second day at the hotel, the power went out when a circuit blew, causing us to be left in the dark for at least an hour if not longer. During this, the elevator of course stopped, and as employees literally yelled down the shaft to see if people were stuck or not, guests were forced to climb the stairs to their rooms.", "title": "Terrible!

My husband and I alone with our 2 1/2 year old son celebrated our six wedding Anniversary on the beach. The Hotel was easy to find, located directly on the beach. Our room was small but clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was cleaned and restocked with fresh towels everyday. The hotel rates were very reasonable, Everybody was very helpful from the parking attendant to the front desk people, the staff was very friendly and always willing to answer questions. The breakfast buffet was hot and fresh, the waiterss was so funny our 2 1/2 year old loved her! I would recommend you tried the buffet. We also ate breakfast outside on the deck and enjoyed the ocean view. But, like any other piece of prime real estate you must get there early to get a great seat! IF you have to wait for seating to become available you can sit on the porch in the rocking chairs. Just be careful you don't fall asleep. One of the better buffets to try is Ember's located @ 24thst & Coastal Hwy. A great way to work off your meal is to try the one of the two miniature golf courses located directly across the street. For those who have to satify a sweet tooth just take a strool or the tram on the boardwalk for some ice cream go to Dumser's and don't worry about the calories. For the popcorn lover there's Fisher's popcorn also make a quick stop at the Candy Factory. Finally, a great place to wear down the kid and the kid in you try on the south end of the boardwalk to see Ripley's belive it or not and all the surrounding amusement park Named Jolly Roger's. With all this in mind we will definately be returning to Phillip's and Ocean City in the very near future.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "nanaof3", "date": "May 24, 2006", "id": 5211756}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Perfect for a low budget trip", "text": "My husband and I just spent a long weekend at Phillip's Beach Plaza Hotel in OC, MD.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 23, 2006", "id": 4997394}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A delightful getaway on a budget!!!!!!!", "text": "We just returned from a lovely weekend a Phillips.

The motel is older but the room was clean, the bed comfortable, the bathroom sparkled!! The Famous Phillips Seafood was wonderful and UNDERPRICED in my opinion!! The Piano bar and its warm friendly atmosphere offered a wonderful respite after a lovely walk on the cold Atlantic Ocean. We awoke the next morning with the sun rising over the ocean, coffee awaiting us in the lobby, friendly staff exchanging greetings with the guest and a delicious buffet breakfast. Check in and check out was a breeze. Yes, Phillips is an older motel but you are not paying $300.00 a nite for a room either.

Don't know if I would spend a week in the summer there, but then as regular ocean city visitors we rent a condo and are accustomed to lots of room.
