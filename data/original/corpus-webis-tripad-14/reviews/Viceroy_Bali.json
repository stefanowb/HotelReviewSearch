Breakfast is served \u201cany time before lunch\u201d and we could have it in the villa if we didn\u2019t want to go to the restaurant. We really liked the mini coffee machine in the room, like those you see in the bar. This is not something you see often in other five-star hotels. There was also a mini chiller that had non-alcoholic drinks in cans and small packets of milk. The family who owns and manages the hotel were always around for a quick conversation.
