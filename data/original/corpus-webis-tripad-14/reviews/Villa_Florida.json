They are charming and work very hard and it really shows in the results. We came to watch and ride the Tour de France Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es stages but also found something special. We can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about Nicole, Daniel and the Villa Florida. The guest rooms and other parts of this restored house from the late 1800\u2019s are wonderful and reflect the care that they put into the two year renovation of their labor of love. The breakfast and the (optional) dinner are magnificent. Nicole loves to cook and you will be the beneficiary of her skills and use of fresh ingredients. I am not someone who throws around the superlatives but we truly loved our stay, were very pleased with the service and value and would recommend Villa Florida without any hesitation.
