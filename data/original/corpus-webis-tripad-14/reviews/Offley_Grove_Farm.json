The owners are lovely people and make your stay very welcoming. Whilst the standard of the houses are well above what we originally expected, in as much they are very well put together, we wanted to give a 4.9 stars. If we were to be pernickety, the shower was extremely weak. Apart from that.......perfect holiday, will recommend this place highly and would have no hesitation to return. We recommend the Cadbury World, Monkey Forest and the Emma Bridgewater paint-your-own pottery cafe.", "title": "More than we expected, we not disappointed", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "KwaiLaw", "date": "August 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116400828}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Had a week at Offley Grove Farm in August with 2 young children (5 & 3).

I can not speak more highly about the quality of the B&B on offer at Offley Grove Farm. This B&B has made me think twice about always going for booking a hotel when ever I travel. I only actually ended up booking this property as I was attending a driving experience with my family at nearby Driveme at Seighford (driveme.co.uk) and the list of accommodation they recommended was either very expensive of not of the quality I was looking for. Having searched the internet I came across Offley grove farm (offleygrovefarm.co.uk) who have a range of fantastic cottages for 3 / 7 night stays and also I discovered have a couple of rooms available for B&B. The farm is in a fantastic location and Margaret (the owner) is one of the most hospitable people in the industry, she makes sure you have a comfortable stay and is happy to recommend places near by to visit or eat (in fact she recommended the Lamb at Edgmond which was excellent value for money). The breakfast served is one of the best I have had in a long time, made from high quality products, the only area for improvement would be to offer bean to cup coffee or a cafetier (however this is a very minor detail). The Owners are very happy for you to explore the grounds and farm, which my five year old thought was great, the excellent play area was also well received. I know I certainly will be back in the future and am already considering when I can justify a week in one of their cottages which look fantastic.", "title": "Best Value B&B in Staffordshire", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jb812", "date": "May 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129523903}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "To those who are looking for a short stay to attend one of the near by attractions - why stay at the generic hotels such as Premier Inn when you can have a luxury stay for less at this great B&B.

Margaret (owner) was efficient, kind and welcoming. All of the cottages (5 in total, housing c.40 adults) were very well turned out with comfy beds, brand new carpet and excellent furnishings. The main 'party house', the Granary was simply perfect for us to host everyone (39 people) for food, drinks and dancing (20 people can sit around the table at a time). There are plenty of picturesque walks around the area to brush off the hangover, and the views from the cottages are pleasant. Traffic permitting you can do the drive in 3 hours from London, but it seems like you're a world away in a hidden gem in the countryside. It's also on the quick train (1hr20 from london to stafford, just a 25 min taxi away). All in all I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to host a large gathering (14 ppl in the Granary, then the other 4 cottages if you have more people) in beautiful surroundings with a venue of great quality and very good value for money.", "title": "Fantastic renovated barn for a family trip.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Helanarana", "date": "October 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 119904546}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010", "text": "We stayed at The Granary at Offley Grove Farm which can accommodate up to 14.
