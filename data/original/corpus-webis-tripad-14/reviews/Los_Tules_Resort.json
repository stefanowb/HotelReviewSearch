{"user_rating": 3.5, "review_count": 231, "name": "Los Tules Resort", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Time", "text": "Just got back Oct 3rd - 10th. Los Tules is a very quiet resort community. It does not have the blaring music poolside, or resort sponsored activities. What it does have are wonderful grounds and 7 great pools. It is very important that you stay in the right accomodations as well. Stay in a 1 bedroom or larger. The 1 bedrooms have 2 baths, full kitchen, breakfast area, living room, and spacious balconey ($140 per night Expedia). You could probably sleep 4 very comfortably. If you get a standard, master, or studio; you will be disappointed. There is a store on site that you can buy anything you want. The beer and liquor is actually cheaper at this store than at Gigante across the street. If you want bourbon, bring it with you. This seems to be very hard to find in Mexico. If you want pastry's, food to stock the kitchen, etc... go to Gigante's. PiPi's restaraunt was closed. Don't know if this is just until the upcoming season or permanent. If it's open; go eat there. It's excellent! The restaraunt on the grounds (Chapultec) is great for breakfast or lunch. Wasn't really impressed with Dinner. We did go on the Chico's dive shop sand rail dune buggy tour. If you like adventure and great fun; you have to do this! It was awsome. You will get dirty though so wear the appropriate attire. My wife and I will definitely stay here again. Didn't have any problems with the staff as mentioned in earlier reviews. This is Mexico, so you have to be patient. Their culture is different in that they are not going 90 MPH 24/7. Get the right accomodations, remember you are on vacation and relax! You won't be disappointed.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 13, 2004", "id": 2700303}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved los tules", "text": "i read reviews on here last year, and decided to stay at los tules. It is in a gorgeous setting. This is definitly not a super luxorios resort. in fact for 120 a night we didn't even have a stove, or coffee maker, however i found the manager marionette to be very helpful and found us a nicer room than the man who was one of the managers. being nice goes a long way... She even arranged for us to stay in the room we liked for a longer period of time. very close to everything, and kept very clean. Want to go back, if we can get the right room. very charming.", "user": "acadialover", "date": "September 16, 2004", "id": 2579695}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Hated the Manager", "text": "My vacation was nearly ruined by the woman who appeared to be the manager. Her name is Marionette. When my party and I arrived at 3:00 p.m., she said the rooms were not ready so we changed into our swimsuits in the lobby ladies room. When we returned for our rooms, we were told only one was ready. It was up five stories (no elevator) and very small. Four people & luggage did not fit in the room. Later we got our second room which was in another building although we wanted to be together. When we didn't buy the upgrade pushed on us for $30 per night per room she yelled at us because we had bought tours from another place. She denied that she was the manager and said she did not know the name of the manager. We forfeited our reservation without a refund because of the rude treatment from Marionette. We went somewhere else. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I strongly recommend you go somewhere else.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 13, 2004", "id": 2447757}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Los Tules es maravilloso", "text": "My wife and I visited Los Tules with my sister and her husband in November of 2003. We really enjoyed the ample condo located on a corner of the building, next to a pool. We were very close to the Chapultepec restaurant, which had excellent food. Although we own a time share at the Sheraton Buganvilias Resort down the beach, we stayed at Los Tules for a week because my sister was using an exchange week. The landscaping is beautiful and well-maintained. We found the staff very accommodating, especially when my brother-in-law had to spend nearly two days in AmeriMed hospital in PV with a kidney stone. We speak Spanish fluently, but found that the staff was equally cordial regardless of what language was spoken to them. One of the security guards was especially courteous and thoughtful; when we asked him about a large house located on the grounds, he gave us a personal tour of the entire resort, proudly showing us all of the highlights and relating his personal experiences of Hurricane Kenna. Having stayed at several resorts in PV, we highly recommend Los Tules!", "user": "Se\u00c3\u00b1orDavid", "date": "July 20, 2004", "id": 2311239}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Los Tules was Great!", "text": "We really liked Los Tules Dec 2003", "user": "sunburn1", "date": "June 19, 2004", "id": 2206145}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Don't Be Fooled.", "text": "If you are accustomed to staying at refined hotels and resorts that have high quality amenities, this will not be the place for you.

As the other reviewers have mentioned, the clientelle here is pretty much just older timeshare owners, and because of that, there is no entertainment or bars to speak of. That being said, the resort is beatiful, has a great beach area, and if you bring a thermos full of you favorite cocktail with you, who needs a bar? The location is great, being across the street from shopping and a $3 cab ride to downtown. We were a little bummed the first few days due to the sedentary nature of the resort, but quickly learned our way around the cityand to the best bars, and ended up having a blast. If you do any day trips, I'd highly recommend the Wild ATV tours that go out a couple times a day just few miles inland from the resort. You could do like us and go to a Paradise Village timeshare presentation in order to get the ATV tour and a dinner cruise for free, but the value of the time lost and discomfort of a timeshare presentation may not make it worth your while. It saved us about $300 on tour costs, so it was probably worth it for 3 hours of hell.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 3, 2004", "id": 1704594}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Horried establishment", "text": "If we go back to PVR, we'll probably try to stay there again if we could get the 1 bedroom suite, otherwise we'd probably stay at a more energetic resort.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 2, 2004", "id": 1701127}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Feb 2004 Visit -- The Best!", "text": "I booked this hotel on Expedia .

Its more of a 2.5 to 3 star at a stretch. They will try to sell you on the 7 pools but they are all horrible and the one hot tub that they do have is luke warm (almost cold). We had booked 2 rooms on Travelocity one for 2 people and the other for 3. We were told that the couple would have to move the next day to another room and they had the right to move us when ever they wanted during our stay. Our room was cramped dingy with one small window and furniture that was horrible outdated not to mention that the room itself looked like it may have been renovated 15 years ago and was horrible out of date with scaring on the walls and the tile falling apart. When we asked for an extra towel for the room we had to justify the request and after waiting about 45 minutes one finally showed up. This hotel has no concept of service. If you are sitting at the pool or anywhere else don\u2019t expect any drinks. Even the Hotel Restaurant has very limited hours of operations and is more of a glorified bar. Nevertheless after enduring a horrible week at this hotel we went to check out and we were told we would have to pay an extra 15 dollars a day for the extra person in the room when our Travelocity documentation clearly said that we had 3 people in the room. After arguing with perhaps one of the rudest people in the service industry (the Horrible Manager who's named Marionette) we had the pay the charges even though we had made the reservation with Travelocity. While Puerto Vallarta was amazing the hotel was a huge disappointment. I highly recommend you choose a different hotel if you do not want to deal with dilapidated accommodations, no amenities and a lack of service.", "user": "angieciowa", "date": "December 21, 2004", "id": 2908676}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A tropical oasis...
