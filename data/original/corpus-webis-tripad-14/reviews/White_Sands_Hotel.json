There are lots of problems with this hotel, the condition of the rooms, poor quality breakfasts, staff that don't really care if you have a problem, and it is extremely noisy. We booked a non-smoking room and we were given a smoking one - and to a non smoker it really stinked! So when we asked for another room as we had booked a non smoking room, we were told that the hotel was fully booked and it wasn't possible. Our room was big, but badly in need of some attention. The carpets were dirty, there was a layer of dust on almost everything, the toilet pan smelled of pee and there was lots of black bacteria around the shower basin (which could have easily have been removed with a good scrub after every use!) and the wash hand basins, and pink bacteria on the tiles in the shower and on the wall. Our room - although it did have a nice view over the sea, was facing the front and was extremely noisy. The locals use the hotel bar and there is a nightclub joined onto the hotel - so it is noisy until the early hours of the morning with people shouting, young people singing and taxi's breaks screaching as they are picking up the people leaving the club. This goes on till about 3.30 am and is extremely loud - loud enough to wake me up! Breakfasts are basic - not like the traditional irish fare you would normally expect at an irish B&B. There is a choice of a few cereals, the usual sausages and bacon. There is a lack of cutlery and plates, which we had to ask for. We had an early flight and had to leave the hotel around 6.45am - breakfast is not until 7.00am, so when we asked if we could have breakfast (just some juice and cereal) a little earlier we were told 'that's just unfortunate that you have an early flight and can't make breakfast' When I challenged the receptionist on the fact that I had paid for bed and breakfast I was told 'it's up to yourself if you take breakfast or not, there's nothing else we can do, sorry'. Not exactly what you expect when you hear so much about the great irish hospitality. I would not stay in this hotel again. If you want a clean room that is quiet with friendly service and advice with a good breakfast look for a good B&B in the area - of which there are many of - and avoid this hotel. At \u20ac70 per person per night it is not good value for money, considering the cost of a well-run B&B.

We were on a really tight budget and couldn't afford the luxury of a 5 star hotel. We were looking for something comfortable and affordable. I found Celebrity Resorts through Hotels.com and went on trip Advisor to see what reviews were written about the place. There were mostly positive reviews and I'd have to agree 100% with all of them. The bed was comforatable, the room was very clean and it came with a stove and fridge, so we were able to cook breakfast and dinner when we didn't have the money to eat out. It was literally less than a block away from the main street where all the shopping and restaurants were. It's a short bus ride down to the main mall. We also got tickets to \"Germaine's Luau\" and the pick up spot was a block away from the hotel. The staff was so friendly and accomodating. They answered all of our questions and when we needed more towels or directions..they were very prompt. We took advatange of the swimming pool and hot tub which were very clean and relaxing after a long day of walking and site seeing. They have these beautiful Palm Trees surrounding the pool area...makes you feel like you're swimming in the middle of a tropical forest.
