I always figure, what the heck, WE booked the room, WE chose it, EVERYBODY is entitled to an off day, 'nuff said. But the Hilton Dallas/Southlake Town Square was a big disappointment. When you drive up to a circular drive and a port cochere, and have your car registered and your bags picked up by the bellhop, you expect something more than 1) a south-facing window with the thermostat controls frozen so that you can't sleep because of the heat; 2) an almost gnarling front desk clerk who practically throws your keys your way when you check out the next morning; 3) an uncleaned concierge lounge upon your return from the East Coast 2 days later; and 4) your second room littered with bits of potato chips and the hallways un-vacuumed, either. The only thing good about the stay was that we got a chance to see a couple of our kids at the adjoing Copeland's restaurant, and that we found the 3 Swedish-version, English-subtitled Blu-Ray of Stieg Larsson's \"Milennium\" Trilogy.

We stayed 3 nights. The hotel is is a GREAT location. Shopping, Restaurants steps away. The hotel was very clean and new looking. The customer service was very good. Friendly staff. Our room overlooked the little shopping area with a balcony. We were giving 3 nights as a gift, so we were able to have Concierge level. The breakfast was good every morning (Christmas morning we ate at Copelands per managements request) Coffee and Drinks available throughout the day. I'm not sure if it was because of the Holidays but there wasn't afternoon/evening snacks every night. One night I did see Fried Cheese Sticks at 10 PM? I did hear a lot of people voicing their concerns on lack of food? So, my advice is to verify what they will have before booking and paying for this level. The room was a gift for us, so any added was a plus, however, if I would have paid for that level expecting evening snacks etc then I would have been disappointed. With that said. I would stay here again on any level not just Concierge. The noise was a bit of a factor also... hall noise and doors closing/opening, maid service. I will say this is with most hotels. Not sure why there isn't a hotel door made that isn't loud :) Overall, a great stay.
