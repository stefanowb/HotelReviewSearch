I was really looking forward to staying there, however, when I got to my room I was completely shocked. Right when I got off the elevator the smell in the hallway was terrible. It smelled like an old basement and the lighting was very dim. It is creepy and when I got to my room the smell was even stronger. The room was the size of my closet, the walls had plaster that was coming off and the toilet was old and made a lot of noise when you flushed (the kind of noise that wakes you up when someone upstairs flushes - which happened to us). We ended up not upgrading the room (costs started adding up when you factor in the $45 charge for parking overnight at the hotel) and slept there for that night, but I felt I was suffocating from the smell. The bed was a queen size bed, not the king size I've gotten in other hotels in the past for that price. I feel that Priceline was not honest in that they should have put this room as a 1-star room.
