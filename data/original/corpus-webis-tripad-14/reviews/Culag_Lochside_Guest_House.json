We were extremely fortunate to have gorgeous weather for our stay which really enhances the experience of staying right on Loch Lomond. The guest house is about 20 - 30 minutes walk along the loch to Luss where we had a lovely, great - value meal with excellent service at the Village Rest. We returned to the Village Rest on our return journey for lunch and again were not left disappointed. Our room at Culag was in the main house and was clean and comfortable with fantastic views down the loch to see the sea planes take off and arrive. We had a sitting area in our room with a sofa etc. which was very comfortable. Breakfast was good with lots of choice and Patrick is a great host.", "title": "Excellent stay!", "user": "winelover33", "date": "May 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 65924264}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Culag Lochside B&B is right on the loch edge, with sea plane flights going from the same location.
