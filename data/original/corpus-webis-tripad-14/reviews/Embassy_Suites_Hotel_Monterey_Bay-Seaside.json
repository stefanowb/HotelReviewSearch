She did not offer to make any amends other than I am sorry about it, but all I can do is to send someone up to clean up the balcony. Hello!

I would happily stay here again. One problem, however, was the hot water. It took almost 10 min for the water to even get hot in the shower and then it didn't stay hot. The shower head was also off center and it was hard to stand under given the obstructions of the bars and soap trays.

After the excellence of the first one we thought we may be disappointed but am pleased to say we had a delightful stay. Check in was pleasant and quick. I asked if they sold milk and was told no but straight away one of the 2 charming receptionists said they would get me some from the managers reception. It was at our room as we arrived with our case. EXCELLENT. The room was spacious and clean with all the facilities that are required. We could see the sea from the window. Beds were clean and comfortable. We had a smoking room but well done to the housekeeping staff - it did not smell of smoke at all, which we much appreciated. The glass lift enabled you to have a good view of the enormous atrium - very pleasant it is. Breakfast is served in the atrium so very nice surroundings. Cereals, muffins, sausage, bacon, juice, coffee etc: as well as made to order omelettes which were delicious. The breakfast staff were lovely and friendly. We didn't have time to try the facilities as we had 2 long days sightseeing. This is an excellent location for seeing Monterey, 17 mile drive and Bid Sur and not too far from San Francisco so and ideal base.
