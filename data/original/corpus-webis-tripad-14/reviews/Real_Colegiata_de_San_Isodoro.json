I've stayed at several former monasteries, but this was nothing like them. One of the kind setting - you just want to immerse yourself, breathe, close your eyes, use your imagination, and you are in medieval Leon. Genuinely kind and attentive staff at the reception and the restaurant - especially I would like to thank the tall male receptionist who helped me with the translation. He answered my questions around and about the hotel, remembered I was going to dine at the restaurant and came up to help me out. It seems like the staff there really work together and happy/proud to be working there.

The staff were professional and friendly. Our room was very comfortable. The manager's tour, as many people have pointed out, was really interesting and Leon is a charming town. However, the menu in the restaurant had nothing for vegetarians. We asked if the chef could make a French omelette for us to share. This was fine and came with a salad of mixed leaves and a small portion of chips. The non-vegetarian 3 course set menu was 16 euros so we were expecting about the same for our meal but we were surprised on checking out next day that we had been charged 30 euros. The most expensive omelette ever!! We left feeling defrauded and disappointed.

So with that said, if you are looking for a modern hotel with all the bells and whistles, this isn't the place for you. It was a monastery and retains that simple feel. We enjoyed the result. We found our room to be large and with enough modern comforts, e.g. bathroom and internet access. We loved the quietness of the location. Our room was one of the larger one's facing the inner courtyard. The free parking is a real plus, although finding the hotel in it's \"inside the wall\" location called for a bit of work. Once parked and situated you will enjoy being car free and able to easily walk to the Cathedral and old town bars/cafes.
