It was much nicer than we expected, and our expectations had already been raised by the very positive reviews on Tripadvisor. Loved the boardwalk to breakfast, which was included - a bonus! We thoroughly enjoyed the yummy spread. We could see the sea from our balcony which overlooked some bush and the coast. The games room provided additional entertainment and we wished we'd had time to take a dip in the very inviting pool. The peninsula has so much for young families and with the added comfort of this resort, we are certainly putting Cape Schanck on our list of places to visit again soon!", "title": "Wonderful resort - definitely going back again!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "platypi", "date": "May 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 106294931}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Have lost count how many times we have been to RACV Cape Schanck. It's our little hide away. Short easy trip from Melbourne. Check in quick, friendly and easy. The rooms are clean and comfortable with all the mod cons you require when you're away for a couple of nights. Unpack, sit out on the balcony and have a glass of wine and watch the sun disappear. You would hardly know anyone else was staying there even though they are fully booked.Breakfast staff are so attentive. One restaurant staff member during the breakfast session (Leigh) is the most cheerful person I have ever met without being over the top. If the sun is out sit by the pool and forget everything. Wineries are definitely worth look at. Went to Port Phillip winery this time. Absolutely stunning architecture, tastings and view.
