The room was approximately 3m x 3m and the floor and surfaces absolutely filthy. The television was foriegn and so no english satalite tv. The floor of the whole room flooded when the crap shower was used. The mini bar had a bottle of water and a can of coke and nothing else. The hairdrier was useless and in addition there was no tea or coffee making facilities. The walls were so thin you could hear all the traffic adjacent and everyone else in the hotel, therefore got no sleep in 3 nights. They make you pay up front before you see the room and so you are so annoyed when you see your room because they wont return your money. The breakfast buffet consists of tea or coffee and to eat you can have egg or toast with cheese or ham. The staff are not at all helpful and are so so rude. It would struggle to get 2 stars never mind 4 star ! Please do not go at all, we enquired into other 4 star hotels while we were there and you can get so much more for less money and we know because we asked to see the rooms and we wish we had booked various other hotels before Champagne Palace. Do not go the place is a disgusting hostel nevermind a hotel.

The pics online are not typical of the rooms! The rooms are very small, dirty carpets, mold and mildew on the walls in the room, as well as the bathroom and shower. The location was close to Termini Station, but that is all I can say good about it. It is in a very low class area of town, and our tour guide was shocked to find out that we were staying there. The staff was not helpful at all, except to recommend a relative's place for lunch or dinner. When we needed ice for a sprained ankle, they said there was no ice whatsoever in the hotel, nor at restaurants nearby! When we asked for a voucher that had been faxed by a shuttle company for getting to the airport, the staff replied they had not received a fax. This happened 3 times, and the shuttle company finally asked that we call them when we were at the desk so that we could see the fax come in...that's the only way we were able to get the voucher. As it turns out, the staff wanted us to use their own shuttle, which cost more, so they would trash the faxes as they came in! The staff did not speak good English, were not helpful with suggestions of tours or anything.
