Finally found us what we requested and headed up. Room must have been one of the remodeled ones as it was in very good shape. Beds were very comfortable, but the tub was stained and the toilet wasn't securely bolted to the floor so you got rocked around. Dinner in the restaurant was good. We left about 9 Sat morning to run around and got back about 5:30. Our room had not been cleaned. We stopped at the front desk and told them as we headed out for dinner. We got back about 2 hours later and it still wasn't cleaned. We grabbed our laptops and headed to the lobby and my sister had a chat with the folks at the front desk. We utilized the bar services (Great folks in there!) while we waited. Beware of what the hotel information says about internet service. Service in the rooms is WIRED and they charge for it.
