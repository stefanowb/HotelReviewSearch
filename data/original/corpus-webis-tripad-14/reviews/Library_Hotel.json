I've never been to New York before, and was excited to stay in a manhattan hotel that was right in the thick of things. The hotel is located close to the New York Public Library and Grand Central Terminal, as well as a fair walk (20min) from Central Park. The rooms were small, but nicely furnished, I realize that space is limited in manhattan. The hotel offered a complimentary wine and cheese every night which was delightful! Breakfast in the morning was also very nice, they offered many cereals, muffins, coffees, teas, fresh fruit, oatmeal and juices. There is also a rooftop bar/lounge which is very pretty. The staff was polite for the most part. Upon checking out we realized we had been charged for using the phone in the room. The staff that we initially dealt with in trying to correct this was extremely rude and told us \"it was ridiculous for you to assume using the phone was free\" and that \"at this hotel, we don't NEED you to stay here, we get enough business as it is.\" Once that statement was said, an assistant manager came over to apologize and helped us with the bill. She told us that we were right in that it doesn't actually say on the phone in the rooms that there is a charge for using them and she quickly removed the charges from our bill. Other than the rudeness of the one desk staff I would say our experience at the Library hotel was excellent. I'm sure there are other hotels in New York that are worth checking out where they would be extremely glad to have you stay as a guest.

The hotel is everything described on it's website and more! We stayed in the Deluxe Queen room, and took advantage of the \"Book Lovers\" promotion. Even before our arrival, their team of concierges offered several ideas for things to see and do during our stay. They also arranged for a car service to pick us up at the airport, and this was well worth the additional cost (over a taxi) in order to be whisked right from the airport to the hotel. Alvin showed us to our 10th floor room, and was very friendly and helpful in answering all our questions! The room itself was very clean and at the end of the hall, with a view of Madison Avenue. The clever use of mirrors made the room seem much larger. The bathroom was super clean and spacious, with great products. I loved that the window in the room opened a bit. We loved the minibar, and the prices were surprisingly reasonable. We had breakfast each morning (included in the room rate) on the 2nd floor, and enjoyed fresh fruit salad, yogurt, bagels, coffee, etc. Everything was well stocked and delicious. The rooftop bar and terrace is also really amazing. We also ordered room service several times, and the food was delivered quickly, and was also delicious. We felt very safe and secure at this hotel, and liked its central location in Manhattan. On the way to the airport at the end of our stay, I realized that I had accidentally left some personal items in the room safe.
