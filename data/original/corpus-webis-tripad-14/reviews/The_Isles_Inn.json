Excellent place for youngish couples (say 40 & under) as the lively pub downstairs often has local folk bands/performers during August. We stayed in room # 7 on the top floor, with a view over the town square, four poster bed, large bathroom & loads of atmosphere. the lower staircase does tend to get a bit smelly the morning after a raucous night in the pub but this is probably my only criticism of the place. we stayed two nights and popped up to bed relatively early one night (11ish) - couldn't hear a thing from the band downstairs and with the windows closed no sound from street level could be heard either. is a little bit expensive for a single (we had two rooms, one dble & one sgle) at 80 quid a head compared to 45 quid a head for the double, so this isn't the ideal spot for single travellers on a budget.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "shellmack", "date": "August 19, 2005", "id": 3789394}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 20, "average": 25, "very good": 69, "terrible": 21, "excellent": 32}, "aka": "The Isles Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.738636363636}
