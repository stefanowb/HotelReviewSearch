We didn`t diamond club and found out that the only difference was they got one more a la carte then us and a section of the beach was marked off for them with a waiter that you really didn`t get to use because he was soooo busy! We used the beach ever morning and always had lots of chairs sometimes you had to walk far down the beach but we didn`t mind.

We were there for two weeks..April 1 to the 15. We have been to Cuba once before and knew not to expect much as far as food. Of course we didn't starve and always found something to eat. The Buffet food was always cold and they don't have much inway of fruit, the two weeks I never saw a banana. The bus ride from the airport is about 2 hours which is a long drive but if you travel in the daytime you get to see some of the communities of Cuba. The staff at the pool bar (Kailin, Armondo and I am sorry I can not remember the other name) were the greatest. Luise's hamburgers were the best and he was amazing. Pool activity staff were also great. The fries at the 24 hour grill always seemed to be cold and soggy as if they were leftover from the day before. We did some of the a la carte's..Mediterrain was good as well as the Italian, Cuban Grill and El Camino, the Asian was the worst of all we could not eat anything there at all, not good at all. We also did not like that you had cats in the 24 hour Grill while you were eating. Not sure if this resort is short staffed but once we witnessed a bottle of wine spilled in the grill and the staff walked through it instead of cleaning it up...this was like this for hours. also we watched staff memebers walk over litter on the walkways then we went and picked it up. (I know that the guest should not be littering they should have enough respect to bend over and pick up whatever they drop). In the property review it said there was an adult pool which is not an adult pool and that would be a nice thing to have. Three pool in all and one was a family pool which should be enforced.

The water is clear like a swimming pool, the sand white and powdery. Little shells can be collected, and it\u2019s perfectly safe for babies and children. The first few days we were there it was very, very windy, so the water was a bit rougher, they had the red flag out. But after that, the wind died down and it was bliss. Tips: make sure you \u201cbook\u201d your palapa if you need one by 6 or 7am. Not joking. My husband would go out every morning at around 7 or 7.30 and there would usually only be one or two palapa\u2019s left. And there are lots! Tons of beach chairs though, so if you don\u2019t care about shade you will definitely find a spot to chill on the beach. Oh, when I say \u201cbook\u201d I mean to put your towels on a chair to claim it as yours. We had no trouble the entire time we were there, nobody was ever in our spot when we returned to use it, I often left my beach bag with my camera and Iphone and always felt safe. The beach was by far the most relaxing place at the resort. There is a DJ there who at around 10am starts to play music. Yes there were 2 days where I heard Gangham Style, but it wasn't the usual DJ who is there 5 days a week\u2026so they were forgiven for that. LOL. They have activities at the beach if you want to partake, but honestly, it wasn't as annoying as I thought it would be (and I hate that kind of thing). Mostly because the sound of the surf drowns out the brashness of the microphone and music, so it was quite pleasant. And the further from the bar/DJ stand you were, the less you could hear it. The best time to go is after 2 or 3pm, the water is super warm, lots of people have left by then and it\u2019s a lot quieter.
