My family and I stayed for three nights and were extremely satisfied by the condition of the rooms, the location, the onsite restaurant and the staff. No doubt, there more luxurious properties in Siem Reap but for travelers seeking tremendous value, I believe the Soria Moria would more than hold its own. We arrived by bus from Phnom Penh and were met by a driver dispatched from the hotel. A 10 minute ride through town and down Wat Bo Road left me wondering whether I had made a good choice. The instant I stepped into the lobby, I had no doubt. I was struck by the tasteful, Scandinavian simplicity of the lobby and restaurant; a few minutes later, the quality and cleanliness of the rooms (208 and 209) sealed it. (208 and 209) do not have much in the way of views; we saved our \"viewing\" for the temples and town and only used the rooms to get undisturbed sleep. The hotel staff, from the cleaning ladies to the managers, are simply superb. I think some were trainees but it was a tremendous pleasure to offer some \"assistance\", however meager, toward their progress in English and \"customer relations\". It's a great place to stay - the onsite restaurant, offering a mix of local and western fare is very good. I would return to the Soria Moria in a heartbeat and would strongly recommend it to anyone who places a premium on good value while at the same time supporting, in small ways, the effort to help local men and women to acquire marketable skills.", "title": "really nice hotel", "user": "Pascale12345", "date": "December 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 148015101}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012", "text": "The staff is amazing, great location, you can walk to the pub street in 10 minutes !", "title": "Great hotel that does charity also!!!", "user": "Nessamira", "date": "December 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 147889514}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The rooms a big, bright and clean.
