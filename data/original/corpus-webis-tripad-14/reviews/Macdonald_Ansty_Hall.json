If I had paid the full price I would have been quite disappointed. The sandwiches (ham, cucumber and smoked salmon) were entirely plain with no dressing etc and had some crust attached. We had one scone each, quite nice, but served with lemon curd as well as raspberry jam which was a bit odd. The cakes were ok, but two were heavy fruit cake. We had to ask the waitress for darjeeling tea as she seemed unaware of anything other than English breakfast.

We booked a room in the main house (12) which was fine except the radiator in the bathroom was cold. The staff were excellent and offered us a different room. The room we were given (2) was absolutely stunning. We loved it. The dinner was truly first class - one of the very best we have had anywhere - and we are fussy! Breakfast the next morning was just as good - unrivalled in our extensive experience. We run our own B&B and take pride in our own breakfast being one of the best but this was as good as ours - 5star. We have been trying to buy the holders for small jam jars for our business without success - they had them. I asked the receptionist (Mohamad) if he could let me know where we might be able to buy some. He promised to find out and let us know - he subsequently called us with the full contact details.
