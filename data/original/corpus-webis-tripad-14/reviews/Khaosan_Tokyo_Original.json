I normally stay in hotels, but wanted to cut the cost in Tokyo so I had more spending money. So glad I chose Khaosan Tokyo. Staff are great and speak excellent English. There is information everywhere on how to get to places and local attractions and trips you can take, but the staff will also help you out. You also get to meet lots of friendly travellers from all over the world in the lounge area (huge tv and DVD facility provided) and on the roof garden. Free internet access (3 computers) also provided. Adaptors, phone cards and towels all sold at reception. Location is fantastic, 5 mins from Asakusa Metro station which links easily to all places. Rooms are small, but what would you expect in somewhere as built up as Tokyo?! Didn't matter at all. Wouldn't hesitate to reccommend to anyone.", "title": "Great location - excellent staff", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "FayeW", "date": "May 16, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 30082328}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We got the private room that you get to by going through a 4 bed dorm.

How can a traveller read a hand-written sign before they arrive? The manager had already kept our passports and we had no choice but pay the 50%.

The place is run by a lovely couple who are very helpful. It is located close to Asakusa station and the beautiful Senso-ji. We had a beautiful view of the Sumida river and the Asahi building from our private room. The private room had a bunk bed and it was more like a walk in closet than what we are used to in Australia, but thats Tokyo for you. We kept our suitcases on the top bunk and slept together on the bottom bunk so we had more room which suited us fine. The place is very clean and has western style toilets. The shower has an annoying water saving nozzle that stopped the water every 15 seconds but it just meant you were being enviromentaly friendly so I was happy with that. The common room was the highlight as we had alot of fun eating hot pot with other travellers, using the free internet and it had a notice board with usefull info. The place had a community vibe and we met alot of interesting people. I highly recommend this place to someone looking for a good cheap youth hostel that lets you experience all that Tokyo has to offer.", "title": "If sleeping rough is the only other option ...", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "MadVinyl", "date": "October 2, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3984556}], "location": {"country": "Japan", "region": "Kanto", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 9, "very good": 26, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 10}, "aka": "Khaosan Tokyo Original Japan", "slim_ranking": 0.490196078431}
