For the rave review we heard , we could have found much better food and service some place else. We were one of just a few people, so we were not sure what the hold up was getting a server and placing our drink order. We she finally arrived, it was with a chip on her shoulder. Her attitude really stunk. We dine out in many nice places and all over, so we know good food when we get it. I would not recommened this place for the food nor the service. And definately NOT at the price. There are way too many places in Vancouver that are by far better and not nearly as pricey!", "title": "not as recommended", "user": "patspetpalace", "date": "December 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 188709820}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent", "text": "We enjoyed an excellent dinner of salads, and then perfectly cooked fish and short ribs.

First, we advised our waiter that we were in no rush and he respected our pace. After the amuse bouche we received our first course: seabream sushi on a crostini instead of rice. Tasty, but the crostini was italian style with a bit too much garlic that overpowered the delicate fish. That slight change (leaving out the garlic) would have made this a 5 start item.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 24, 2013", "id": 185685137}], "location": {"country": "Canada", "city": "Vancouver"}, "variance": {"poor": 11, "average": 29, "very good": 51, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 119}}
