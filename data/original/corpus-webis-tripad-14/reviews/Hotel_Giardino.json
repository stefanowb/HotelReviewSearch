It is even more beautiful than before. No change as regards the friendliness of the staff, the sumptuous breakfast, the underground garage at no extra cost, the quality of the food at the Aphrodite and the sheer pleasure of having a drink in the evening in the comfortable lounge chairs around the pools. Some of your correspondents said that the mostly Swiss and German staff do not like to speak English. They have probably left as it is totally untrue. My wife is English and we live in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. When they overheard some of our conversation, they immediately switched to either French or English and spoke it very well. A most charming place to which we would love to return. The night butler offers you a choice of ten pillows and a \"tisane\" for a good night's sleep. Had a \"morning sun\" room with balcony on the first floor and were undisturbed by any noise.", "title": "A jewel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "blacklab", "date": "September 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 176015268}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Giardino Ascona is a gem if you want to hide away for a couple of days.
