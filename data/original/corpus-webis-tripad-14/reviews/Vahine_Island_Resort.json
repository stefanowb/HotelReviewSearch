I absolutely loved it. It isn't the most luxurious place ever, but definitely the most unique and tranquil. We stayed in one of the waterside bungalows. They're cozy and very charming. There was a basket with some fresh coconut meat when we arrived. We slept with the sliding doors open at night for some air circulation and to hear the waves and wind. You can also sit out on the little balcony in front of your bungalow and enjoy the stars. It was just magic.", "title": "Wonderful, private, laid-back paradise", "user": "esheng", "date": "May 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3503723}], "location": {"country": "French Polynesia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 5, "very good": 24, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 269}, "aka": "Vahine Island - Private Island Hotel Tahaa", "slim_ranking": 0.25, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Located on a private island of 23 acres on the North of Tahaa,Vahine Island offers a unique experience in an idyllic place:Luxurious accommodation, delicious cuisine, large coconut grove on an impeccable lawn and white sandy beach\u2026 Guests find total peace and privacy in the middle of one of the most beautiful lagoon of French Polynesia."}
