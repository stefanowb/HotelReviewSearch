Marcus and Carter are wonderful! I had the pleasure of interacting with them prior to our arrival and their attention and recommendations were on point (and we hadn't even arrived). One thing everyone should know so you don't make the same mistake I did, when you book your stay, book it thru their website and not thru Expedia or any other 3rd party website otherwise you'll end up paying an additional 18% tax which is already included in the rate which is quoted on the TShell's website.", "title": "Loved Our Stay at the Turquoise Shell Inn", "user": "MJ24", "date": "March 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14239344}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Truly Enjoyed Our Stay", "text": "Unfortunately we didn't leave on Friday when we were supposed to due to a snowstorm and Carter was wonderful in accomodating us to check in the next day and extend our stay by one day (so we left on Wednesday instead of Tuesday).

The room is quaint, with a nice little kitchenette which was nice because we went to the grocery store and bought a couple of snacks to hold us over while we were there. There's a TV with cable if you need to see what's going on in the states but just know it's not the cable you are used to so if you are expecting every channel under the sun, you'll be disappointed (but then again, who goes to Paradise to watch TV). The Inn is situated away from the main road so you don't hear the hustle and bustle of the road but yet you are close enough to it to walk around and get something to eat or stop and see the bridge open up when the yachts are going in and out of the harbor. During the day, starting around 10ish until about 8ish you will hear airplanes flying overhead but that really didn't bother me being from the city, I'm used to it. And no matter where you are on the island (at least on the Dutch side) you will hear the airplanes so folks who complain about that should probably stay on the French side. The small swimming pool is nice after a long day of siteseeing to sit back and relax.", "title": "Wonderful Place", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LorraineOntario", "date": "March 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 13960430, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff, clean rooms, kitchen, close to everything", "disliked": "\u2014 noise (but every place we stayed at in the Caribbean had it's own noise problem)"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Prior to our arrival, Marcus had arranged an island tour for us with Michelen which was wonderful.

The Inn is located 10 minutes from the airport so if you are like me and don't want to rent a car, the taxi is only $8 which is great. The one thing we didn't do which hopefully on my next trip I'll do, is really spend some time on the French side. If you decide that you want to travel around the island then definitely rent a car but if not, taxis are good and so is the little bus. Definitely take advantage of the day trips to St. Barths, Saba and/or Anguilla.

The Turquoise Shell Inn exceeded all of our expectations. The owners (I presume) Carter and Marcus were wonderful to us and made us feel so at home! The property is quaint, clean, and an excellent location on Simpson Bay. If you walk out the back of the hotel, you are steps from a nice beach with a wonderful view of Saba and some very cool mega yachts in the bay. The hotel sits far enough off the main street in front to be very quiet, but walk out on the street and it is very \"happening\" and lots of fun. The marina area directly across from The Turquoise Shell was fantastic, with some cool bars to hang out amidst more mega yachts, not to mention plenty of good restaurants. The rooms at the Turquise Shell were one bedroom apartments, and we were able to go to the market and bring back breakfast for the morning. The beds, AC, water pressure, TV channel selection were all great, not to mention the internet access worked wonderfully and the pool was really nice too! As planned, we went on to Saba and had a great time, then had planned to stay in the Marigot (St. Martin) area for a couple days before heading to Anguilla. We checked into a hotel in Marigot and I felt overwhelming disappointment. I did not like this area at all! (Though I did like Orient Beach and Grand Case on the French side)) We longed to get back to The Turquoise Shell. We got the heck out of that place in Marigot , and headed back to the Turquoise Shell Inn hoping for a vacancy. Technically, there was no vacancy as housekeeping is off on Sundays, but Carter said he would have a room for us later in the day and he prepared it himself.. That was amazing service and we appreciated it so much! We toured the entire island and got back later in the day feeling so lucky that we were back at the Turquise Shell. We enjoyed watching the boats/yachts come in at the drawbridge around 5:00 which is just minutes from the hotel. We, like so many others on Tripadvisor, loved Maho and watching the planes land and take off. It was really exciting and the entire Maho area was so much fun! The Turquise Shell is just a short drive to that area of the island. All in all, the whole St. Maarten/St. Martin/Saba/Anguilla trip was fantastic.
