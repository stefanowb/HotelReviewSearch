Our particular room, on the ground floor, had a nice view of the garden but was too dimly lit to read in at night because we are elderly and need more light. Most of you would probably not notice this. Matthew is a real gem, willing to answer any question and help in any way he can. He was a huge help in telling us what to order at his favorite downtown restaurant, Curate (highly recommended). Despite our travels to several European countries, including Spain, we were not very familiar with tapas (missed that lesson in Barcelona), and he patiently marked our menu and told us a lot about his travels in Spain, his relatives who still live there, and his background in the tapas restaurant business. We took so much of his time (30 minutes?) that his job was neglected, for which we must apologize. He has such good manners that we could not have guessed we were taking him away from more important work. One suggestion for improvement would be to provide an ice machine in the guest kitchen so guests don't have to bother the owner or Matthew for ice. The warm weather, coupled with warm club soda stored in our room, caused the ice to melt at a rapid rate and required us to pester the owner for more ice. Other guests were having a problem finding ample ice as well - maybe just one day and not a normal occurrence. Also, a reading lamp in the room with a higher wattage bulb would be desirable. There is a breakfast cook who evidently also helps with tidying up the rooms; she is extremely energetic and moves so fast we didn't really get to say hello, but several guests were pleased with her breakfast offerings - she alternates sweet and savory, so if you stay two days you can try both. We can recommend Blue Spiral 1 gallery and the Co-op gallery downtown, in addition to Curate.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mvpj", "date": "May 25, 2012", "id": 130598165}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I have been in BB in many countries, in particular in France, but this has been one of the best.
