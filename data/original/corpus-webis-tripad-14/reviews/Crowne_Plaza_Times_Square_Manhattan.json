The concierge is even more ridiculous. We were looking for some last minute Lion King Tickets and they told us they would start at $185 each. We called the theater directly and the price was $111 each. We also wanted to get a towncar to LaGuardia and the womon at the Concierge desk told me it would be $85 saying the service she uses has better insurance. I told her I would call someone else and asked for the number of another service with which I was familiar. She gave me the wrong number (not even close to the right number). Not saying she did it on purpose, but who knows. I did find the right number and the cost was $34.50, but I gave him $40. By the way, the name of the Limo service was CARMEL. They will pick you up at LGA and will also take appointments. They were very prompt and courteous. Other than those 2 points, everything else was great. Oh yeah, if you are looking for a great place for dinner, check out Blue Water Grill at Union Station. Will run you about $125 for dinner for 2, but very much well worth it. It's only about 10 mins from Crowne Plaza by taxi or town car. I will definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza in NYC again.

The location is great for seeing Broadway shows, with a very short walk to most theaters. The lobby and check-in areas are nothing great, but the room I had on the 46th floor, the Club Floor, was excellent. The room was very quiet and was conducive to sleeping. Lots of little extras to help you get a good night's sleep including a thoughtful clip for the drapes to keep the light out, lavender spray for the sheets, ear plugs and an eye shade. They even include a cd on tips for sleeping. The bed, with a duvet, was very comfortable and I slept like a log both nights. The bathroom was large with lots of towels and terry robes. The Club Floor has a room that serves complimentary Continental breakfast. The first morning it was very good. The second morning, there was no coffee or knives for the butter and jams and the room was overcrowded. This was a let-down.

There are spots of very good service and product at this hotel ... some of the best I have seen at 4 star level hotels; namely the bellhops and breakfast staff. Also, this hotel offers one of the best breakfasts you will get at this level of hotel. I enjoyed the bellhops they really do help you out. The Maids are very good too. The location is self explanatory -- it ROCKS! But it ends there. We were told by a staff member that the hotel has contracted out its concierge service and I left asking myself -- why even have them? We showed up at the concierge desk at 10 minutes before 8 am and noticed that the person on duty was behind the counter. He abruptly told us, before we even had a chance to say good morning, that he would not 'open' until 8 am. We went back at 8 and asked him for directions in using the metro -- which he told us just to walk and not bother with the metro; and when I told him of a problem with my coffee maker, he told me to call room maintenance. When I cast a puzzled look back at him, he promptly made the call for me. However, later that night, I noticed that noone had come and fixed my coffee pot and had to recall maintenance. On another occasion, with another concierge, I had a problem with the business center -- and the concierge told me to take the problem to the front desk -- despite the hotel guidelines saying that the concierge was in charge of the business center. What gives? Talk about a waste of money in having a useless concierge function at your hotel. Amateurs. As far as location, this place is hard to beat. But stay in a high floor on the back side of the hotel unless you want the noise. I do recommend this hotel, it is very expensive anywhere on Times Square -- just go with lower expectations. And bring a lot of cash or wiggle room on your credit card. The bar staff is good but again, the offers are very expensive. Oh yea, the rooms are ok. The 2 beds take up almost the entire room; but we warned: you can hear the other people in the connecting room clearly in their conversations and during their other necessary and sometimes unnecessary functions. Also, the heating system operates either straight on or off in high, medium or low and unless you had the heat at about halfway -- it was sweaty and stifling.

The last morning of our stay, my mother ordered breakfast from a outside restaurant to be deliverd.

It was a comforable stay in the midst of the Theater District/Times Square. We could not have asked for a better location, as we were more interested in the Art Museums. The taxi fares were very reasonable, much the same as Chicago taxi fares. Our NYC Taxi drivers were great. The food in NYC is expensive if you are on a budget, not less than $14.00 for a sandwich/lunch meal at Roxy's Deli, unless you go to McD's-which you don't want to do, unless it is for a quick soda. Roxy's Deli on Broadway at about 47th St - serves large portions of food & will hold your food for you while at the Theater to pick up later that night to take back to your room for a late night snack. I think they are open till 2:00am. Central Park was beautiful this Spring. We were able to park our car near the Googenheim Museum in a Parking Garage for approx 5 hrs for $30.00 - not bad for NYC. Back to our hotel room: we were on the 16th floor - non-smoking room that was adequate size - the bathroom was a great size - always had hot water & I could not believe how cold the cold water was in this hotel - it was like it was out of the refrigerator and it was 70+ degrees outside. The king mattress was new & wonderfully comfortable & several pillows. We saw no bed bugs like NBC or CNN had reported for this hotel. In their on-site news report they did not find any bed bugs either, in this hotel, after the lady had reported them. Evidently, this hotel was on top of it. If the bed bugs were there at one time, they had been irradicated. One thing nice during the Spring season when the hotel does not use heat or air conditioning, this hotel's windows open a few inches so you can get cooler air in your room at night. I thought this a plus. The hotel's Samplings Restaurant was nice, however, watch your bill, if you charge it to your room. They doubled charged us for our breakfast one morning. The hotel desk clerk took off the extra charge without any problem since I had a copy of our receipt - so keep your meal receipts unless you do not care.

The rooms are clean, modern, large for NYC, and very well planned. There were outlets everywhere, including in the table lamps. There was all the amenities you possibly would want and even the pillows offered everything from firm to soft so you have choices. The thermostat was new and allowed for great temperature control. The best part was the staff. From front desk, to the Brasserie and doormen, they all were the most impressive that I've ever seen anywhere in the world. The way they wanted you to know they were there to help, to take care of you, and to go out of their way to deliver service showed just how proud they each were to be there. I don't know how literally every staff member in such a large hotel can be so friendly, but they were. The only complaint was that the wait for elevators on our floor was anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes. A doorman told us at least one was down when I asked but that it had been repaired. However, the hotel made up for it when there was a charge for the bar that wasn't ours and they took it off at checkout without any questions asked. We thought this was going to be a call to our credit card company to get this take off but true to the superb customer service, there was no such need to do so. The Brasserie restaurant food is also one of the best placed to dine anywhere in Times Square (which is not where the really good restaurants are in NYC) and does not disappoint.

We booked directly with Crowne Plaza on line and had a King Superior room at $249 over Labor Day Weekend 9/2/06. Some of the hotels we stayed in before would not allow us to book for just one night over the holiday weekend. The room was spacious, very clean, nicely appointed, like new and very peaceful. We actually slept late! We seldom do that. One very minor complaint I have is they could use better ventilation in the bathrooms to keep the mirrors from fogging. The staff was friendly and accommodating. They changed our room upon request (excessively noisy children next door to the first room). Elevator service was great and security seemed decent.

The bed was huge and very comfortable very cool or warm if needed as we had one day of torrential rain. The bar was very nice for a late drink and all staff pleasant except for one of the concierges who insisted very loudly that the cheapest way to Newark airport (from city to airport) was a yellow cab at approx $75 plus toll plus tip. He said we had to listen to him as he had 20 years experience however we had been told previously not to take a yellow cab back so I enquired with a private hire and got a lovely car to travel in and it cost $48 plus $8 toll plus tip.
