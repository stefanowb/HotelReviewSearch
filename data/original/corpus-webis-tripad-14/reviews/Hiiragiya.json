There was no distractions of the outside world here. The Japanese garden outside my sliding glass doors also added to the atmosphere. I guess it's all about personal preference on location of your room. I did see the new wing and even though they did a great job with blending both wings, it felt too new.

I had heard earlier that Japanese food tastes rather bland but I wanted to make my own opinion. For the Japanese, it's not only the taste that is important, it's the food's consistency when felt inside the mouth, such as rice grains and slices of raw fish. That's where Hiiragiya comes in. Their aesthetic menu selection was tasty morsefuls from heaven. Of particular mention was one of their feature dishes (Hassun) - sushi of salmon roe, sea bream bound together with egg, grilled prawn with botargo, ginko nut and pumpkin. Their grilled butterfish marinated in saikyo miso was also a delight.

Some may find this old world charming, but in fact the \"original\"\" building (that we checked out when we were there to see which we preferred as they had additional vacancy) was dilapidated and moldy, downright awful. Looked like the old camp bunks we may have walked out of as children! Even the new rooms, which were pretty and happy, was cramped space,with low-ceilings,and felt almost claustrophobic.

This was our first time in a ryokan, and it was a very memorable stay. We knew we wanted to try one night, so we picked (based on our research) the best one there is. The Hiiragiya didn't disappoint. The service is so attentive and the sense of culture permeates everywhere. The staff are all in traditional wear and the room we had was decked out in traditional tatami mats, wooden baths, etc. Okay, you do have to have some conveniences, such as the typical Japanese spray toilet. They even drape a cover over the tv and phone so that its discreetly hidden within the beautifully decorated room. The highlight of course are the meals. I must say after the Kaiseki dinner, I would suggest this be on everyone's \"to do in their lifetime\" list. The meal was simply outstanding. Just when you think you had enough, you get another outstanding meal for breakfast. My wife and I had the Japanese breakfast and our two young daughters had the western breakfast. I would suggest the Japanese breakfast was better with more variety and interesting things. Given all this, your still sleeping on the floor in one big room. The staff do a great job setting up the sleeping gear, but it still is not as comfortable as a good bed. The pillows were just okay too. A stay at the Hiiragiya is extremely expensive, thus the one night stay. That may be enough after two outstanding meals.
