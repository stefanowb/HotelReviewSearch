This played out across the swimming pool area and the whole of the bar for the entire afternoon on Saturday and Sunday. Asking the manager about it, he said that it was due to \"popular demand\". Two men were watching it. I asked why these men could not watch it in their rooms. He said it was more pleasant for them to watch in the bar but he would turn the volume down slightly. It was not pleasant for me or other guests who had paid for a quiet holiday and it turned the bar area from a romantic retreat into a sports bar...(which the staff seemed to appreciate as they could watch the sport while no guests came in for a drink.)
