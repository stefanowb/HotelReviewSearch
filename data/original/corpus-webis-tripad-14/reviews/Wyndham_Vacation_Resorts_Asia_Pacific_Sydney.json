The lobby is tiny and not particularly impressive, and the corridors look like they need a facelift but the rooms are actually not bad. We had a decent-size studio with a kitchenette and a bathroom and I also saw a one-bedroom suite, which was quite large. No, there's no cable TV and only four coat hangers in the closet, but location makes up for a lot: it's an easy 30 min walk to the Sydney Opera House and 5 minutes to George St or Oxford St shopping and entertainment. Give the very basic breakfast buffet a miss and go to one of the many coffee places in the vicinity. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful. This is a good place for those who are not looking for luxury but want decent accommodation at an acceptable price.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "melbguy", "date": "January 17, 2005", "id": 3011503}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great location no frills hotel.", "text": "I recently stayed four nights in the Southern Cross Suites hotel in Sydney. The websites give it anywhere from 3 to 4.5 stars. I would say between 3.5 to 4 to honest. If you are looking for a high end Luxury hotel along the lines of the Four Seasons or Park Hyatt this is not the hotel for you. If you are looking for a decent hotel in a good location, then I would recommend this hotel. You enter through a small no frills lobby. The staff is friendly and knowledgable and there is a small cafe on site. I was upgraded from a standard suite to a one bedroom suite. The room was very large with a seperate bedroom and even a small kitchen. It reminded me of a typical long term business hotel suite. Much like, a courtyard marriot or extended stay hotel. The location is really the selling point of this hotel. It is just on the south end of hyde park...one block south to be exact and within a block of the museum subway stop. Circular Quay, the airport, Olympic park are all within an easy train ride from this location. Oxford st which contains a number of pubs and dance clubs is only a short walk away. If you are traveling with kids, there are even a few movie theatres and malls within walking distance. Let's face it...when you are on vacation....how much time do you really spend in the hotel room? As I mentioned...decent no frills hotel in a great location....save some money...stay here and treat yourself to a great night on the town......", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 29, 2004", "id": 2853649}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Southern Cross Suites is a No Frills Hotel.", "text": "My family spent 8 nights in this hotel in September, 2003. We were disappointed in its quality. It is not a bad hotel, but is very average. The lobby is very small and plain for a hotel in a large city. Our travel agent told us there was an on-site restaurant, bar and room service. There is no bar. The restaurant is a very small cafe with a limited menu, counter service only and which closes in the afternoon. The morning breakfast buffet there never varied in its limited selection and was quite bland. When I hit the room service button on my room phone, I got the front desk. I was told I needed to find the pamphlet in the hotel information booklet and call one of the 2 delivery services advertised there. The delivery service company will go to a set list of area restaurants then deliver food to your room. It requires an outside phone call, and as far as I can tell neither are affiliated with the hotel. Claiming this is room service is a bit of a stretch. Any local hostel can also give guests these pamphlets. The furnishings in our room were also drab and seemed worn. The hallways could use fresh carpet and wall paper as well, as these are also clearly worn with age. There is no swimming pool. There is a pool service available for a fee, which is less than a 10 minute walk. However, if you are trying to entertain children during a rain storm, leaving the hotel to go swimming is not ideal. The staff was friendly and courteous though. And check in and check out was efficient. My complaint is that I feel they claim to be much more \"luxurious\" than they are. There are also several nearby \"adult\" themed bookstores and bars, which can be awkward to walk pass when you bring your children. I definitely do not recommend this hotel for families with young children.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 7, 2003", "id": 1377437}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Average Hotel", "text": "I stayed here for about 8 days in June, 2003.
