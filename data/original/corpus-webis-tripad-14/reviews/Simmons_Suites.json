Although there are many more recognizable hotel names in the area, you would be hard pressed to find a nicer more comfortable place to stay. My party booked a total of 3 rooms for 4 people. All of us simply loved the place! When we checked in both Mr. and Mrs. Simmons introduced themselves to me. The rooms are large with a nicely equipped kitchenette, large bath and shower. Most hotels supply a mattress that is as hard as a piece of plywood. My Simmons Suites bed was surprisingly comfortable. On top of that they offer free internet access, a large variety of complimentary snacks in each of the rooms that is replenished every day and a very helpful staff.
