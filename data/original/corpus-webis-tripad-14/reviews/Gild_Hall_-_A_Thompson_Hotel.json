The hotel is fabulous. The bed is extremely comfortable, and the staff is very helpful. The concierge wasn't quite as helpful, but the check in staff were. I highly recommend this hotel. It is a quick walk to Battery Park, World Trade Center site, etc., and about a block and half from several metro lines.
