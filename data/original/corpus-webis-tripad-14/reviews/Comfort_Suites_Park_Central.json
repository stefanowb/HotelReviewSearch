Mostly from two things - our air conditioner was SOOO loud, it sounded like an airplane engine. We were going to change rooms but figured they would probably all be that loud. Not only was it loud but also rattled - so annoying. But that wasn't the worst part, we got up on our second morning and walked to our car and see some people standing around their car and they asked if our car was ok because their truck's passenger window had been smashed out and items were stolen. Luckily our car was fine but we felt really bad for them. Then the hotel never cleaned up the glass, it was still there when we left this morning! The location of the hotel is not great. It is confusing to find, confusing to get on I-75N from, and there is a sketchy apartment complex right behind it with some creepy/sketchy people walking through the parking lot at all hours. No wonder you have to use your key card to access the front lobby after 9pm!", "user": "Livelife2fullest", "date": "June 15, 2008", "id": 16952321}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled on business", "text": "The only good thing about the place, the price and the room layout. You have a separate living room area and separate bedroom area. Too bad the air conditioning is only in the bedroom area so that made it difficult for the living room to get cool enough. Oh, one last thing, you should bring an eye mask if you want to sleep in, the windows didn't have heavy curtains to keep the room dark. Only sheer curtains, I couldn't believe it.", "title": "One of the better Dallas places to stay", "user": "RogerTheChipGuy", "date": "March 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14281081}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Anyway, I hope this helps you decide if you want to stay here or not.
