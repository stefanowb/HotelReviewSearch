We are a family of 4 with teenagers. Decided to book cheap week with us all in one room then thought, \"what have I done!\" I paid an extra \u00a3100 at time of booking for a larger family room and Im glad I did because we actually ended up with a huge 2 bedroomed suite overlooking the beach and the pool! Not bad for \u00a3350pp all inclusive. I think it may be a bit of a lottery with twin rooms though, some tourists were in the main building near the prayer room/mosque, and the nightclub so I would imagine it can get noisy at times. Anyway, our room was lovely and the cleaning men were thorough and made towel art on our bed every day. The hairdryer is rubbish girls. In our suite there was also a fridge.", "title": "wonderful hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "tulip", "date": "February 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6836686, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 large quiet suite overlooking sea.", "disliked": "\u2014 everything written in German."}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Check in was hassle free, all the staff at this hotel are very polite. They love the English. The drawback for us was that this hotel was predominantly filled with Russians and Germans. I did not hear any of these people use any manners all the time I was there. They were very abrupt with the staff and the staff really resented this approach. Maybe there will be more English speaking families in the high season.
