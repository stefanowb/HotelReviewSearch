It was a bit of a trek when walking back from town up the hill and then up the 90 steps to our room but this didn't ruin our holiday or even put us off going to this hotel again. No ants in our room at all. Sure the room could do with a bit of attention but this did not ruin our holiday. It was clean and that's what matters most to us. I think as we were self catering we were placed in block M which is furthest away from the pool and bar etc but this was ideal for us as we were a couple with no children and therefore only ventured down to the pool once. As were in room M9 I think this was the reason there were no ants - I think block K may have been different. Cala Llonga itself was a nice resort with a gorgeous beach but very catered for the british which isn't really what we look for when we go abroad. We visited es Cana to the hippy market on the wednesday and visited ibiza town and visited the old town which was lovely. We had food at Valentinos which is in the centre of Cala Llonga, two nights. This was a lovely Italian restaurant which had the best ever bruschetta - I would highly recommend it, the service was also very good. We also had food at Zebra's which is on the way to the Hi Montemar hotel from the town centre. This was by far the best meal we had and the service was great. We also ate at the Terrace which was nice, it was cheap and very good value. We ate at Restaurant Cala Llonga which was on the beach front - service by the waitress was not very good and the SOS again very british menu!

I had read previous reviews and did send an e-mail asking if we could be placed not to far back but not poolside this was either not read or ignored. We arrived in the early afternoon after a short bus transfer from the airport which was hottest part of the day, the rep told us where to go for reception and left us. there was a very pleasant english lady who told us she lives in Majorca but was working on the animation at the apartments she gave us our room keya and helped us to the room, this was the highest point of the aprtments and we later discovered was 90 steps from the bottom to the room. We were wrecked every time we climbed to the room, there was also a family located that hight up which we didnt think was the right thing to have done as they also had buggies to lug as well as the children, the plus side was you got very little noise from the entertainment in the evening and were surrounded by a lovely wooded area. When you check in they do give you a leaflet giving some informaiton of the apartment and also a request to consider your neighbours in the evening and to keep noise down after twelve, there was only one night where we were disturbed but nothing to complain to much about. On the second day we decided that we would try the poolside but only did this on one day, there was music being played rather loudly around this area and also the noise from the animation team all day, although the notice given was not to reserve sunbeds the pool was not open until 10am (i think this was to allow cleaning which we could see being done from our apartment) bviously ngnored and we had to grab a sunbed on the terrace area, there was also very few sun shades for the number of beds and people. The apartment also offered all inclusive however we did not try the food facility therefore I am unable to comment on. The apartment although not huge was of ample space for the two of us and had a fridge, microwave, toaster, kettle and hob facility which was adequate a long with a glass topped table (I was unsure of this especially if anything happened and it broke) and two chairs which i also didnt think necessary in the room as the balcony also had table and chairs and was of a lovely size, the sun was at the balcony until very late in the evening. the bathroom had the usual loo, handbasin and shower, the bedroom area was two beds with bedside cabinets wardrobe facility with a safe charged at 24 euro per week with 10 euro deposit. there was a television but i could only get spanish channels although the information said sky channels unless you had to subscribe to but I didnt bother to ask and a ceiling fan. The cleaning of the aprtment was not done very often if at all but there was emptying of the bins and cleaning of the bathroom but the bedding was changed with only two nights left which we have never experience before, on arrival we did not have any handtowels in the bathroom and I requested some and didnt receive until three days later. Although the apartments are at the top of a steep hill they were adequate for what we wanted and would return.", "title": "Worst accommodation in 25 yrs abroad", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "karen s", "date": "August 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 116762573}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The beach was lovely and a walk down the road, the sunbeds and parasols cost 3.60 euro each to hire but worth it for us for the peace away from the pool. We used to visit the cafe Del Mar by the beach with the owner Fernando serving the food was always hot and tasty, we ate at the Restaurant Cala LLonga, SOS and Dohna Regina all had nice food I would recommend that you stay clear of the Snack Box my husband and I ordered our meals and the girl gave my husband what he had ordered and as he waited to eat with me nothing was set down and after about 15mins I went to ask where it was and she said she had forgotten to write the order down and had not ordered i did wait and eat but would not go back. (tip from me) when buying the large bottles of water also buy a smaller one for each member of your party or a couple of the litre bottles, in the evenings fill them up and put in freezer part of fridge and take to the poolside or beach and as they thaw it keeps them cold for quite some time", "title": "great holiday", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lisa c", "date": "August 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116483316}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Like many others i read the reviews and was concerned having two young children and two teenagers with me and my partner.

The kids idolised him and i can honestly state i have not seen an entertainer at a hotel put as much effort into his role as this man did. Hi Hotels shpuld make sure they keep hold of him before he is snapped up by a much bigger hotel chain.

We loved everything about it. The lay out of the bar, pool and restaurant was spot on! We were kindly shown to our apartment which was on 'I' floor. It had 2 bedrooms, good sized living area, kitchen, bathroom and a good sized balcony with great views. There were fans in the bedrooms which made it comfortable. Air conditioned rooms are available which you would request when booking, we was happy without. As for ants, we were all inclusive and didn't have food in the apartment so that wasn't a problem although when we brought drinks to the room, in the morning there were a few around the cups which was from our own doing. They are not like our ants back at home, they are tiny, no big deal. There were 60 steps to our apartment which we knew there would be some and if you're spending your time lazing around, sunbathing, eating etc you really can't complain. There is a spar shop just down the road and a little further on, the beautiful beach, shops and places to eat. The food in Montemar was of a very high standard. There would've been something for everyone at all times, lots of choice meats and fish, and always something the kids would eat. Tubs of ice-creams were available between mealtimes but you had to go into the restaurant through reception as the doors were locked which people might not have been aware of. The entertainment was absolutely brilliant thanks to Liam.... he really is the best, everyone loved his humour, adults and kids alike. There was plenty of daytime activities for the kids if they wanted and the evenings were always fun. The pool was well set out with a really deep area too. There was no leaving your towels on sunbeds early to save them for later as the security guard would remove them! we were told by him that to just get your sunbed no earlier than 8am and we didn't have a problem. Having a security guard and life guard was nicely reassuring.
