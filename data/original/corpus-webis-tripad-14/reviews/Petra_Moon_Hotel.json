Things started off OK but after arriving in Wadi Rum, things fell apart. I paid for a 4 hour tour. The camel ride was much shorter than promised and then the jeep tour was an hour less than agreed to. On top of this the whole tour started at 11am but the guide did not bring with any lunch (and you cannot buy lunch anywhere) so by 2pm my family was starving. After a number of calls between the Petra Moon Manager, the tour operator, the taxi driver and the jeep driver, they all agreed that there was a miscommunication and they could take us back into Wadi Rum for an hour. By this point is was too late and completely impractical.
