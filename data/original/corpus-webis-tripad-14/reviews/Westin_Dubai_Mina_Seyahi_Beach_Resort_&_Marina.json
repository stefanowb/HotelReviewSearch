This hotel is beautiful inside and out, situated right on the beach with attentive and friendly staff. The grounds are beautifully manicured and the pool is fantastic with two swim up bars and a section reserved for adults only. We stayed in a sea view club room and it was worth the extra $. The room was huge with a large balcony overlooking the water with a view of the palm in the distance. Beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious. The food was fantastic and the 6pm complimentary drinks were well received while watching the sunset from the club lounge. We both used the spa service and thoroughly enjoyed our massages.
