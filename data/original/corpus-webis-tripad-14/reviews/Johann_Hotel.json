The glass bathroom door is not highly recommended for new couples, as it may cause some embarassment..... It also had a small balcony, which for us smokers was pretty useful. The hotel has a very cosy breakfast room (where you should not expect scrambled eggs and bacon, although everything that is offered is fresh and delicious) and also a very nice backyard, where you can take your breakfast, if the weather is good. The owners are simply adorable, extremely polite, but in a relaxed and casual manner and always ready to make you feel you are more than welcome, almost part of a big bunch of friends. I loved it!!
