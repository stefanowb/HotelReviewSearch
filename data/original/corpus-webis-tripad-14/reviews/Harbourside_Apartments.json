It remains our first choice for Sydney (although, to be honest, we are so satisfied with Harbourside that we haven't stayed anywhere else in Sydney for some time - but comparing prices and locations and facilities it still seems to be good value). We were there for a week in October 2010 and again for 4 nights in November, in studio apartments with harbour view. The apartments with view are a must really - the perfect view of the harbour, Bridge and Opera House (although best views are from below about floor 13, because from greater height the Bridge deck starts to chop off the top of the OHouse, quite spoiling one's photos). We have always found the staff helpful, although the quality of help and interaction can be variable. The general standard of H'side sometimes shows its age, but apartments are constantly upgraded, and both the ones we had were modern, new and clean. Each has a small kitchen, basically equipped, and there are laundry facilities on alternate floors. There's Sails restaurant right outside the door, and Blues Point Road is a 5-minute walk away (up-hill) with delis and minimarkets, post office, hairdressers, wineshops and other shops, many restaurants (try Delicado) and two pubs. The bus from just outside H'side will take you up there, or a bit further on to North Sydney with all shops and facilities you could want. So you can eat out or shop and cook in the apartment - or on the poolside BBQ. All in all, it seems difficult to beat, and several friends to whom we have recommended H'side agree. (Oh, and come on, Andrew from Shoreham, please let's not have everywhere in the world airconditioned! There's usually plenty of air movement through the windows.)

The staff were lovely and nothing was too much trouble for them. We arrived early and the staff looked after our bags all day before we arrived back later just before dinner, again on the last day we were able to leave the bags all day. The rooms are clean and comfortable and have everything you need. Homemade muffins on the way out each morning were both a delight and much appreciated. It is obvious that the drawcard of this hotel is the view - it is simply spectacular both day and night. The location is also a plus especially if you dont have a car - you are metres away from a jetty where ferrys frequently dock well into the evening and go to all tourist spots as well as circular quay which will allow you to catch other ferries, or buses or trains to anywhere you pleased.
