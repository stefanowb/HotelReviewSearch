{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 712, "name": "Carlton George Hotel", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed for 2 nights last week with friends booked to stay with us for the second night, for a special ocassion. We live in Spain but are originally from Glasgow. Picked the Carton George from the Web choice of Glasgow Hotels. As it was a special ocassion I booked Club rooms for all. Was a little disappointed in the size of our room (511) but the standard was 1st class. Our friends room (309) was larger (thankfully as I would have rathered their room was) and again 1st class. We found the staff were pleasent and courtious. A friendly smile and hello from every member we met, and a high visible number of staff for such a small hotel. The big chap at Reception does need to smile a bit more and I can see he might be seen as \"unfriendly\", but his efficiency and courtesy to us could not be questioned. All other reception staff were very pleasant. As for a previous comment regarding the \"bribe\" of alcohol, I can only comment that I found this aspect highly welcomed, especially as we found Glasgow (or rather I think the UK), very expensive compared with our adoptive Country Spain. We didn't milk it for all it was worth but the Crystal decanters and six glasses in the rooms were a classy addition and the well stocked mini bar, which I think we used for three cold drinks only, was again a great addition. We have stayed at many 5 * Hotels throughout the world and have never received complimentary drinks on this level, especially considering the excellent Executive Lounge 24 hours a day. The staff in the Exec Lounge were very helpful and attentive as were the staff in Windows at both dinner and breakfast. Dinner could not be faulted in either presentation; choice or quality and neither could breakfast. I had read a comment about breakfast being \"ordinary\", well quite frankly how anyone could regard it as so, beggars belief. Yes it might be a little slow, but that's the price you pay for freshly cooked food as opposed to the poor \"buffet\" food offered generally these days to enable quality staff to be cut to the minimum. Again two more 5* assets. Have also noted 2 recent negative comments which I think have to be looked at in perspective. Standard rooms in Hotels can frequently be \"disappointing\" when Hotels strive to publicly meet the more diserning clients requirements in enhanced rooms. And I don't think \"standard\" usually would be expected to include crystal decanters of spirits and a stocked mini bar as complimentary. Everywhere, you only get what you pay for, and we found we certainly got that, in spades, although we will have paid more than those who choose not to. I hope those disappointed folk enjoy the fruits of their complaints. I, despite this, am glad I found nothing to complain of. Well seen this little gem, is picking up well deserved rewards.", "title": "Excellent Experience", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "WillinSpain", "date": "October 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5959901, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Quality of the room and excellent food", "disliked": "\u2014 absolutely nothing"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed at the Carlton George in September for my wedding anniversary and wished i'd saved the money and stayed at home.", "title": "What a let down...", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "ellies1", "date": "October 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 5955217, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Staff"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006", "text": "Having read all the mostly great reviews here on trip advisor I thought i was onto a sure thing.", "title": "If you have booked with Superbreak read on", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "LittleTink", "date": "October 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5924229, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the location", "disliked": "\u2014 dark uninspiring room"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006", "text": "Wrong.", "title": "Central location - great", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "shaz3466", "date": "October 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5922483, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 central location", "disliked": "\u2014 Restaurant to expensive"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "First ly let me say that my Husband i were married in 2002, since that time due to work commitments we have not been able to take any time off together to get away, secondly we are both hotel managers ourselves (although only in a lowly 3 star establishment, not 4 stars like here!) so we are only to aware of how this industry works.", "title": "Excellent Stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "croney", "date": "September 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5882093}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "My friend and I stayed at the Carlton George at the start of November as a belated 40th birthday treat for her, a rare chance for both of us to have some time to ourselves away from work, hubbies and kids.", "title": "Great Break!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "rareNItraveller", "date": "December 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6317824, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great room", "disliked": "\u2014 No luggage storage room"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Got bus in from airport and it stopped directly outside hotel - great start!", "title": "Quality hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dawsontraveller", "date": "November 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6169089, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The quality of the rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 The parking"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Although we arrived just after 10am our room was ready.
