The front desk was very friendly and helpful advising us of the bus to town, walking is definatly possible but the hill is very steep so going down is fine but we didnt attempt coming back up and for $4 return the bus was great value. The room was adaquate however considering the amazing views advertised was a little dissapointed when we looked out over a car park however it was cheap so I guess that if you pay more you may get a room with a view. The only complant about the room was that it was insanley hot, their was a fan provided but I dont sleep great with a fan blowing on me, I guess thats a hard problem to solve though. The restaurant was nice we didn't have a meal but enjoyed nice drinks and some lovely hot chips on the deck taking in the view. We didn't have a meal becasue the restaurant was very busy with a tour bus, but this was fine as Queenstown offers great food anyway. We had a lovely time and for a good deal this is a great place.", "title": "Great Value", "user": "Olivia G", "date": "November 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 120516581}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled solo", "text": "I stayed in this hotel from 28th oct to 30th oct 2011.
