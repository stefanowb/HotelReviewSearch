I went to my local AAA office and asked about a clean, comfortable and most importantly affordable motel/inn in the immediate area and they gave me the name of the Cow Hollow and The Chelsea Inn and a few others in the area owned by the same company. I walked around to a few only to go back to the Cow Hollow, I guess because the name was wicked kool also! All, I can say is that I was not disappointed and my stay was saved in large part because of my stay at the Cow Hollow Motor Inn and Suites. The rooms were very clean spacious and for the price very reasonable for SF, I thought.
