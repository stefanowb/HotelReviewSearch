So to have them waived was a plus. We had previously stayed 3 nights in a downtown Santa Fe Inn and decided to stay 2 nights at Bishops Lodge to do some horse back riding through their stables.

The service on our first night was very good, but on the second night we ate a little later (after our horseback ride) after most other guests had already dined, and therefore the service was not as good. Our server wasn't very friendly nor attentive. There was a fire in the kiva, but when we ran out of logs the staff couldn't locate any more.

I have traveled over a large part of the globe in my life, and never have I felt that I received less value for my money than at the Bishop's Lodge. Understand that this is not a moderately priced hotel, and they try and squeeze every nickel they can out of you while giving nothing in return. I understand this lodge is over 90 years old, but that does not mean it needs to be rundown and dirty. I do not kid you when I tell you that in the main lodge it looks like they still have the original carpet, it might have been cleaned 75 years ago though. I arrived with several people, and we received room scattered all over the property. There was a large difference in accommodations depending on what part of the grounds you stayed, but none were acceptable or worth the price, the only question was how badly you were ripped off and gouged. The older lodges are dirty, dingy, smell awful, and are worse than any Motel 6 or Super 8 room for 5x the price. The hallways in the old lodge smelled like a mixture of skunks, mildew and death. The \"newer\" rooms are much larger, and look great upon arrival, but when you stay there and start to notice the small details you see the lack of upkeep there as well. Stained carpets, holes in the carpet, TV from 1982, stained sheets, pubic hair in the corner of the bathroom, worn & or broken furniture. Far from luxury accommodations. The staff is a mixed bag, some very nice people that try hard, and some nasty young folks that emanate anger. They offer a free shuttle downtown by the angriest snotty young man I have ever had the misfortune of being locked in a vehicle with. On top of the outrageous prices for the feeble accommodations they hit you with about a $15.00 per day per person resort fee! So for a family of 4 it is about $60 extra per day for very little in return. When I questioned the fee the desk manager stressed that this fee included free parking! I had to park no where near my original smelly dungeon of a room, and never have I paid for parking at a facility miles outside the city limits. Room service menu claims service until 11pm, until you call at 10pm and are informed that it actually stops at 9pm! I could easily go on about the disappointments in this lodge all day, but I imagine that I made my point, no wonder they charge a $50.00 early departure fee, I am certain they see early departures all the time. In summary, if you are looking for a restaurant that smells like gas and old socks, a room in the summer in NM with no AC, service charges and fee's of every variety added to everything and everything, than this is the place for you. It is a shame. It is a great location, and I could only imagine how magnificent this place could have been at one point in history.", "title": "Friendly but clueless staff and antiquated amenities", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "OleQuijote", "date": "July 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 71288479}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The staff at Bishop's Lodge was extreamely attentive.

Location just a 5 minute drive out of town was quite nice. As we approached the property it actually looked like a beautiful resort. Little clusters of adobe style rooms built into the hills. However, when we arrived at our one bedroom suite it wasn't so sweet. The building is in a terrible state of disrepair with cracked and missing bricks leading up the stairway. Upon entering we found the following: cracked fireplace, old, dirty and lumpy carpets, mold in bathroom, broken toilet, holes in screen, no sound insulation from neighboring rooms. Old mattresses, and a large chunk of cement broken off next to lock on door leaving a huge hole in wall. In general, the furnishings made us feel like we were staying in a musty storage room instead of an upscale guest room. The list goes on but why bother with more of the details. Better off saving your money and staying at the classier Motel 6. One final note: Rick Veruni (the general manager) responded by phone to our written complaints. When he tried to apologize and ask what he could do for us I responded by asking to be compensated in some way. His response was \"I think it's just nice of me that I even called you\". He said that twice and then the conversation ended.

Here he built a private retreat; his chapel still stands today, now on the national register of historic places. After Lamy's Death, the land was acquired by the Pulitzer publishing family as a private vacation retreat. In 1917, the Thorpe family from Denver fell in love with these pristine acres, bought the property and developed the first resort in the state. Today Bishop's Lodge comprises 15 lodges for a total of 110 rooms ranging in sizes from 250 sq feet to 450, not to mention a 2000 sq foot Presidential Suite. Many of our rooms feature fireplaces and the majority all have outdoor access to patios, lawns or balconies. Our ShaNah Spa and Wellness Center which opened up in June of 2002 is a sanctuary where one can take time out to be nurtured by Mother Nature, guided by ancient wisdon and touched by angels. The experience may change your life. Other activities are abundant such as: trap/skeet shooting (offered to groups of 10 or monmre roomnights), horseback, pony trail rides, hiking, mountain biking, fitness center, excercise studio, outdoor pool, whirlpool and tennis to mention a few. Bishop's Lodge is located just 3 miles from the Historic Santa Fe Plaza. Complimentary shuttle service is provided by the lodge at scheduled times daily."}
