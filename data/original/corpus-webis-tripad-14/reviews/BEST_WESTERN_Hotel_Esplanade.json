I chose the 1/2 pensione plan which included breakfast and dinner. The breakfast was O.K. Eggs were offered if you wished them. However, the dinners were of gourmet quality.

Hotel is in the middle of nowhere, nothing in radius of 3 km, no shops, no bars, no restaurants. If you do not have a car, you are lost. Hotel staff is completely helpless and uninterested. Only a couple of them speaks English, difficult to communicate with them. The worst of all is bar/restaurant staff. They completely ignore you! One night I sat for 30 minutes at the bar terrace, waiting to be served and I was not. I complained to the receptionist and received \"I am sorry\". The other night I was persistant to see when they will pay attention to guests and I was served after 53 minutes.
