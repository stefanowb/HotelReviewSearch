Monmouth is a GREAT bed and breakfast with rooms and suites available in rebuilt outbuildings, as well as in the main house. Built in 1818 and abandoned in the 1960's before it was purchased and lovingly restored by current owners, Ron and Lani Riches, in 1978. After 4 years of restoration and continuous improvements, it's a stunning property with luxurious accommodations, including antiques and fine reproductions. Our Garden Cottage room featured a four poster super comfortable king bed, a working fireplace, antique armoire, and completely modern bath with a whirlpool tub. Really appreciated the bathrobes, complimentary water bottles, free wi-fi (though signal was weak in our room), and especially the delicious full Southern breakfast.", "title": "great weekend getaway from NOLA", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "RiverlanGone", "date": "February 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 124905089}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Only negative comment - they really need to find the cats that are spraying and causing an awful odor in certain outdoor public areas!", "title": "ASk Questions", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "juju78028", "date": "February 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 124711298}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We received a deluxe suite with a working fireplace for a cold weekend in February.

On speaking to management we were told that \" you should ask if the fireplace is working\" When I asked if they should not advise a guest of this at check in I was told that sometimes the jacuzzi didn't work either. Ours in this case did. Remember this property is touted as one of the Leading Small Luxury Hotels of the World. I have stayed in many of such properties and never found such disrepair. The shower barely trickled, their was hair around the Jacuzzi, and the \"gourmet\" dinner in the 1818 restaurant began with watery turnip soup. and had very salty redfish as one of the main courses. Now the grounds are beautiful, our room was cold sans fireplace, but spacious, and the wait staff exceptional. For a lovely meal, go to the Castle restaurant at Dunleith, or the Lorman Country store for down home cookin. Obviously, some over sight is lacking here.

We had a great stay at Monmouth Plantation. We chose to stay in two of the rooms upstairs in the main house for the most authentic of stays. I would recommend it for fellow travelers. The rooms were large and very nicely decorated. They have all the conveniences you would expect for a hotel but you are just going for the room. The grounds and house are awesome, it's really nice to walk around and take it all in. Dinner in the restaurant was ok, there certainly wasn't the quantity of food you become accustomed to in the south but what I had was very nice. A special mention to Washington, his authentic Mint juleps were fantastic. We nearly bypassed dinner and kept drinking.

This was our first exception. The property is incredible, the main house is beautifully restored,and don't miss the wonderful tour to get the full explanation of the plantation and the furnishings as well as great stories about the past owners. We had a 2-room suite in one of the outbuildings (#42) which was spacious and comfortable. BUT, it was a little shabby. The front stoop is covered with a worn and shredded cloth; the furniture in the sitting room was tired and shabby. Not antique and lovely, but worn and shabby. Not up to the expectations. There were no instructions for using the very complicated satellite TV, only a sketch of the remote and what each button does. It required much playing around to get it. On check-in, the person ahead of us had reserved (and paid for) a specific suite for their anniversary, but it was not available and he was given a regular room which did not sit well with him. The desk clerk was unable to deal with his distress (and he was very polite) and take care of the two other parties waiting to check in and also handle the busy phone. Yet she had no help and said she had no one to call. We had to wait almost 1/2 hour to check in. The lovely breakfast was marred by having to listen to Christian hymns and gospel tunes on the Musak (interspersed with other music). This may be the bible belt, but not everyone enjoys Christian religious music with breakfast. And on and on, a number of small things. The shame is that the property is truly lovely, and it would take only some attention to these troublesome details to have made it a great stay.

Their photogallery of buildings shows (apart from the main house) only pretty cottages in the grounds, with nice porches opening onto lawns. So it seems reasonable to assume that you will be in something like that. Unfortunately, our room was in the Courtyard Building, which is not in the grounds and is adjacent not only to the main house but also to the courtyard and bar where guests congregate, and it also accommodates on the ground floor the gift shop and reception office. Rooms in the Courtyard Building are on the upper floor, and the whole building has only a very limited balcony at the stair head, overlooking the main carpark, with a filthy swing-seat and dirty, worn carpet. Like recent reviewer D_M_Penny (whose review we only saw after our return home), we were allocated room 29, immediately above the office and overlooking the courtyard \u2013 and thus inconvenienced by chatter noise, phone rings and door bangings from below and around.
