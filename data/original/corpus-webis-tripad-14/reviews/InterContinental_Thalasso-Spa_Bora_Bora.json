When we arrived there, they took all of the couples into the main lobby and sat us each at separate tables and gave us a refreshing drink and a light snack as we began the check-in process. Within two minutes someone was at our table, greeted us by name, and started to run through our check-in. Because we were Ambassador members with the IC chain, we were able to get into our room right away (at 9:30am) and immediately unpacked and slipped into our bathrobes and started to enjoy our stay.

There weren't many fish which was perfect for our taste, but every day at around 5pm we saw a different ray come swimming by.

Jerome Palacoeur, made us feel so welcome and all of his staff(spa staff, wait staff, boat crew, housekeeping, dive master Ben, wedding coordinator, ceremony vahines, ceremony warriors, ceremony musicians, ceremony chief/priest, photographer, front desk staff and assisting concierge staff) made this experience one we will cherish for the rest of our lives.
