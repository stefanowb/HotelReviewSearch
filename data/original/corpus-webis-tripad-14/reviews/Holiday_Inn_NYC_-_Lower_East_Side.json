I made the wrong reservations and ended up here accidentally. I originally wanted the one in SoHo. But luckily, every Holiday Inn is about the same. The room is great and we slept well. Even though it is on a busy street, we slept like a baby. What I liked about this hotel is that it is close to a lot of great restaurants and bars ranging from high end to cheap eats. Since we drove to NYC this time, parking right across the street was very convenient and about $10 cheaper than most other parking garages. Service was great. My room didn't come with breakfast but I was given complimentary breakfast coupons that I couldn't use because I slept in past 10.", "title": "Adequate for a quick weekend...", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "De160", "date": "March 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155767808}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "As regular visitors to New York's Lower East Side we had been eagerly awaiting the opening of this hotel on the corner of Delancey and Suffolk Street.
