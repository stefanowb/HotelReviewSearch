They charged the room amount, but then they charged the card $2,000 and $1,500. We fought to get the money returned. They wouldn't believe us and the phone went unanswered many times. We had to call from different phones so our number would not show up on the caller ID (then they would answer). We finally got that back, and the next week, they charged $2,000 and $750 again! We were upset, and they would not give us the money and repeatedly did not accept our calls. Managers were supposed to call back and never did. We were charged these before our trip, so we decided not to stay. The money wasn't all returned until months after our stay. Finally our credit card company had to fight for the money, which was returned after a long hassle.", "title": "Stole Money", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "welovetravel0", "date": "November 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"business": 1.0}, "id": 22115211}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "It is a nice cozy place and the new owners are great.
