It's an older style motel, long and plain looking with outside corridors, mired in a sea of concrete, but my room had been recently remodeled: nice carpet, decent furniture, tasteful decor. Because of the way the motel sits, few rooms will have any kind of bayou view, not that you really want one as it is tucked in between a busy street and I-210, meaning there's always a lot of traffic going by (though I heard no traffic noise in the room). My room had a microwave and a fridge, but no coffee pot. Wireless internet worked well. Room was reasonably clean, but not spotless. Towels were incredibly cheap and flimsy; it was hard to get dry with one and I'm a small person.", "title": "It is what it is", "user": "Twoprofs", "date": "April 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 62368078}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have no major complaints, but if I were in the area again, I would choose a more modern property.", "title": "Oh my god I am not happy", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "wal1809", "date": "February 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 56046723}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009", "text": "Pictures posted are not of what you will find at this nasty hotel. I went for a nice vacation Valentines weekend with my wife and based on the pics we rented a room with a king bed sitting area overlooking the bayou. Sounds nice huh? NOPE there are no king beds, there are no sitting areas. If and when you can see the bayou it is trash layden. Nasty!!!! Boom boxes all night in the parking lot. NOw the best part of it all. It was 39 degrees outside and no hot water for a shower. Cold shower on valentines day makes for an angry wife. I have called and called trying to get this resolved with the manager.
