It's built upon the grounds of a castle, so there's considerably more expense in maintaining the grounds as well as the actual hotel, which is in a secondary building. The morning breakfast is served at an annex to the main building, and the grounds make for a very nice walk and a sense of serenity - you can watch people play ping pong or see the horses being taken care of, or just sit out in the sun.", "title": "Gotta be a hassle to run a castle", "user": "PuterDude", "date": "August 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 18675957, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The cheerful person at the front desk", "disliked": "\u2014 Logistical issues with service"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I mention so much about the setting because our stay was a bit of a study in contrast.

In the hotel itself it is not possible to get a cup of coffee, tea or even some water or other sodas. The beds are problably 40 years old, which you will feel the morning after, if you are able to catch some sleep. Bathroom is pretty old as well.
