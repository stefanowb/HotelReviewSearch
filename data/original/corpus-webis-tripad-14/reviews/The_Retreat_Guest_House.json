We booked the Emanuel suite and found everything as described; the room was very well appointed, spotlessly clean and well maintained. The location is convenient for the seafront and for old Portsmouth (15 - 20 minutes walk away) and it\u2019s also quiet, so you\u2019re guaranteed a good night\u2019s sleep. Breakfast was excellent with quality ingredients and splendid presentation. Mark & Sian were perfect hosts with plenty of restaurant and pub suggestions \u2013 \u2018Rosie\u2019s Wine Bar\u2019; \u2018The hole in the wall\u2019 and \u2018The King Street Tavern\u2019 are great places if you\u2019re after some good food and real ale.

Came upon the Retreat Guest House whilst looking on t' internet for a place to stay for an overnight stop in Pompey. COULDN'T HAVE MADE A BETTER CHOICE!! The proprieters Mark & Sian were warm, welcoming hosts.The room ( Ward suite ) was impressively furnished , and a good nights sleep was had on a very comfy bed. The breakfast in the morning was served with a smile,and was lovely. We have taken quite a few business cards from the Retreat, to pass on to our friends..... what a pity ,because as they say ...

Sian and Mark were wonderful, helping us to find a way of getting to the Salvage yard, and Mark's sense of humour gave us a smile. Having had our first night/day ruined by our car accident we asked to stay an extra night and they did have a room free, the Franklin room. The whole house was decorated to a brilliant standard, each room had its own charm and both the rooms we stayed in were impeccably clean. The English breakfast was amazing, I\u2019ve never seen such wonderful presentation, and it kept us filled till dinner time which was a huge bonus! The choice of cereals was really nice as well. Location was great it was a short walk to Southsea shops and we enjoyed lovely walks along the seafront to get to Portsmouth town centre and Gunwarf Quay.
