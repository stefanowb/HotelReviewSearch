Used their online reservations, and booked a PRIVATE room for 5 nights. Found another lone traveller, who also booked a private room (independent bookings). We arrived there together, at about 10.30pm, night before St Patrick's Day, to find that although they still had a record of each of our bookings, neither were for a private room! Staff were very not at all helpful or apologetic for their mistake, just said \"ah well, must have entered it in the computer incorrectly\". Of course, there were no private rooms left, so it was back to the streets for us. All of this after a 24 hour flight was not acceptable.
