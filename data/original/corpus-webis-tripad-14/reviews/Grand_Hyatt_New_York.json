Centrally located, next door to Grand Central Station, 2 blocks from 5th Ave. The Check-in was all done electronically, which was easy to follow, but it would have been nice to actually speak to someone! The concierge was extremely helpful every time we went to his desk area. Everyone working at the hotel were friendly, helpful and always smiling! They seem genuinely happy to see us! The elevators were separated into the first 23 floors and then 24-34, so we were express to the 24th floor, which meant no milk run elevator rides. We were on the 33rd floor ( near the top!) and had a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building! Our room was comfortable with a very good chair for work at the desk ( lumbar support!). Flat screen TV too. The beds could have been a bit cushier, but there were lots of pillows and extra blankets if we wanted them. I had a couple occasions to speak to housekeeping and to the front desk.

As the previous reviewer commented, the location is perfect, away from the manic bustle of Times Square but still within walking distance. We had a king deluxe room, only slightly more expensive than the basic package. The room (2736) was very spacious and spotlessly clean although the bathrooms in the hotel could probably do with an upgrade and there was no view. However, this did mean that the room was very quiet and we had no trouble with our neighbours. We have high standards and were pleasantly surprised with the hotel, expecially after reading some of the previous reviews.

First of all, we were extremely impressed with the city overall, from the airport (JFK) to the subways, to every little part of the city. It is a very clean and friendly city!! It was our first time there, we brought our two teenage children, and we all had a GREAT time! It was Easter week and toward the latter part of the week the city got crowded, especially Times Square, but still we were able to avoid the crowds for the most part. Which brings me to my review of the Grand Hyatt. Being as how we'd never been to NYC before, I thought that mYbe being closer to Times Square was the way to go, but NO! We found that the location of the Hyatt was absolutely perfect!!!!! It is next to Grand Central Station (which means that it is convenient to get to ANYWHERE in the city by taking the subway) but it is far enough from the ridiculous crowds in Times Square (which feels like Vegas)! We were always so happy to get back to our hotel at the end of each day. The lobby is BEAUTIFUL, the staff are really wonderful, and our room was great. The day we got there, the front desk attendant, Gordon, wrote out explicit directions for us to get a quick little self-guided tour of the city, from our hotel. It was such a great walk around in order to see some of the famous sites around, like Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. As soon as I saw Times Square, I was SOOOO happy that I didn't book a hotel in that area. Our hotel was convenient to everything you would want to see, with the added bonus of being like a respite from the chaos of the city. We loved it and can't wait to go back! We would definitely stay there again!!", "title": "Perfect location! Excellent service! Friendly staff!

This year, we stayed in two rooms on the newly renovated 24th floor from 12/15 - 12/19. I was very impressed with nearly every aspect of the Hotel and the renovated rooms. Upon check-in, we were greeted by the very pleasant and helpful Amanda who granted our request for two rooms next to each other, both with two double beds. The upgrade to the renovated floor was a nice surprise, and Amanda even gave our three girls their own Hyatt teddy bears. What a great welcome! As others have stated, the lobby is very large and beautiful. There is always a lot of activity there, and music booming in the bar area gives it the feel of a trendy NYC club. But the noise disappears when you step into the elevators--and there are a ton of elevators. We never waited more than 15 seconds for an elevator, and they move very quickly. Not even time to enjoy the television inside the elevator before arriving at our floor. The corridors and rooms on the 24th floor have a very chic, modern feel. The color scheme is sophisticated yet comforting. Rooms are very roomy by NYC standards. A few touches I enjoyed in the room included the iPod docking station/radio/alarm, flat-screen TV, the safe lighted from the inside with room for my laptop, the big \"rainfall\" shower head, chaise sofa, modern light fixtures and light switches, and nice size walk-in closet. Beds were plush, the room temperature always comfortable, and the bathroom amenities were upscale. Our window looked out over Grand Central Station, and we never heard any street noise. Hot water was plentiful--never an issue. Plenty of towels for the entire family. And no evidence of any bedbugs in either room after four nights. The tub was missing a stopper. We stuffed a wash cloth in the drain to hold water for baths. Housekeeping did a nice job cleaning the room but was inconsistent in leaving clean wash cloths and drinking glasses. And, as others have pointed out, a coffee maker would have been nice. My only other concern is the security of this hotel. There is nothing to prevent someone from coming in off the street and going up the elevators to the guest floors. I would recommend adding room card access to the elevators. Hotel personnel were usually standing by the elevator bank, but I never saw them question anyone. We had no problems, but I did see one person who didn't appear to be a guest go up and then quickly back down one day. I couldn't help but sense he was making some sort of delivery (hopefully a legal one). I could be wrong about him, but there is nothing to prevent this. The Grand Hyatt is a straight shot across 42nd street to Times Square--a 10-12 minute walk. Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral area is an easy 12-15 minute walk up Fifth Avenue. The New York Public Library and Bryant Park--where we love to ice skate, is a very short walk, and the Empire State Building is not far from there. Not to mention everything is easily accessible from Grand Central Station, where we also enjoyed cheesecake from Junior's every night. Tip: the iPhone GPS makes using the subway SUPER easy. It will tell you which train to get on and how many minutes until departure and arrival. Overall, I give the Grand Hyatt very high marks for location, comfort, and value. The staff was very friendly, though not intrusively so.

We went immediately to the reception to ask for a double room, and were lucky enough to get one. Especially if you pay the full price (which isn't advisable, by the way - use Priceline instead), don't be satisfied with a king room, when you could get a much bigger one for the same amount of money. In addition, the king rooms don't have a bath, only a shower. Due to a high floor, our room didn't have any kind of problem with the noise from the streets. The downsides of staying in a high floor are the elevators. There aren't enough of them for a hotel this size. Almost every time we had to wait for one, and on the way down they kept just stopping and stopping until they were crammed.

The valet person called the lobby twice for service but no one showed up. So I loaded up the baggage cart with my things and headed to the first floor to the front desk. When I was just a few feet from the desk, I was accousted by four bellman who were more concerned that I not take the cart to the front desk. I was so shocked by their rudeness and no one bothered to ask to assist me with my things. Instead of arguing, I took my bags off the cart and headed to the front desk. I immediately told the desk manager that so far, their hotel had failed my expectations for a 4 star hotel and that the staff was acting more like I would expect at a 2 star motel. The desk manager apologized but did nothing. I then checked in and waited for my companion to arrive. While waiting, I asked the desk manager to have my things taken to my room. As I handed over my items, the bellman had the nerve to wait for a tip when he was one of the men who snatched the cart from me. Of course I didn't tip the guy! Anyway, my guest finally arrived and we went to the room. The Room - Very small, hardly furnished, no mini fridge and with a terrible view and a very small window. We didn't even have a formal dresser to put our things! The Bathroom - Extremely small and you had to leave the door open in order to use the small 20\" sink. It was very ackward because the sink faucet (though modern) was placed at the wrong angle so the small countertop got overly wet during every use. Anyway, the worst thing about the bathroom was the old towels. Although we didn't get many towels they were so overly used, stained a little and well below the 4-star quality. The sheets had little black stains too! After returning from dinner that night, I called housekeeping to obtain more towels and it took them over 90 mintues to complete the request despite additional calls. By the time they arrived, we were in bed. Anyway, the next morning at 6am, I went to the front entrance and saw no one so I hailed a cab. Before getting in the cab, I noticed a large fellow (the bellman) standing inside one of the hotel doors shooting the breeze with another man. I didn't think much of it until the next morning when he failed to acknowledge me or hail me a cab. So before I got in the cab I called the guy over (and read his name tag). I asked Pedro was it his job to hail cabs for guests and he said yes. While I closed the door in his face, I said he was doing a ---- poor job at it! All of this is true and unbias when I stayed at the Grand. So if you like thin walls (hearing sounds of sex on one side and a tv on the other side), a crappy view, small room and extra small bathroom with old towels, The Grand is for you!

Due to all the recent crazy snowfall we were so happy to be going as we really did doubt it! after a great flight with virgin atlantic we arrived at jfk, customs took about 30mins so that was good. The 20 minute trip from JFK to midtown Manhattan took 3 hours because the roads were so bad in Queens, NYC state, which we had to drive through to get to Manhattan. On arrival to our hotel we were greeted with a luxurious, well kept, enormous lobby. the decor was beautiful, huge vases of flowers everywhere and a cascading waterfall at the front rotating doors. The colour everywhere is gold. We were welcomed quickly by a friendly female receptionist, we told her we were on our honeymoon and she upgraded our room free of charge to a larger newly refurbished room on the 24th floor. The hotel is undergoing renovation at the moment and Virgin let us know this about 6 months ago, but during our whole week there we did not see one work man or hear any noise at all, you would never know it was there. The main hotel restaurant was closed for refurbishing and there was a temporary one there instead, to be honest i didnt even notice as it was done so nicely. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we chose to eat out but there is a very convienient 24hour store called Market in the lobby which sells wine, beer, soft drinks, hot meals, breakfast, chocolate, crisps, cookies, icecream whatever you want and it didnt cost any more than the news agent in Grand cenral terminal nexct door Hudson News. Rooms gorgeous modern and new, nice shower and bathroom, king size bed awesome heaven to sleep in. large LG tv in room with about 50 channels, nice desk and walled in closet. Lifts were fast and well kept. Overall I would 100% go back to this hotel or any other Hyatt hotel.The hotel is sandwiched between grand central terminal and the chrysler building, it takes 10mins to walk to Times Square, 5 mins to walk to New York Public Library, 10 mins to Empire State. The subway is quick and easy to use and is good when going downtown to ground zero, statue of liberty and to the brooklyn bridge. Grand central terminal is awesome for food and breakfast in particular. There is a large cafe opposite the hotel called Pershing Square breakfast here is awesome, quite expensive but worth it. Overall NYC is expensive at this time due to the economic climate but it is still more reasonable than UK, as you get a lot more for your money. Going off the beaten track is defo the way for cheaper meals. PIzza by the slice in NYC is awesome, better than Italy dare I say it!! Ate once in TGI Fridays as we left it till 10.30pm to eat as decided to go to Rockafeller center top of the rockl after the xmas show at Radio City, it was probably the most expensive meal we had as chains in the USA are as overpriced as they are in the UK but my NY steak was awesome, cooked perfectly.", "title": "AMAZING I WOULD GO BACK RIGHT NOW", "user": "loutoo", "date": "January 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 92070170}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you want to see a Broadway show be prepared to wait a few days before you will get in and be prepared to pay a lot.
