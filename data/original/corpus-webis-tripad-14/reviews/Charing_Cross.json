We found it on Londontown.com and cross checked it on Trip Advisor. We stayed there earlier this month for 5 nights. It's in the heart of London, the staff was great, the rates were good, the room is magnificent! We didn't have a view, but we had a huge bathroom, radio, hair dryer, fridge, big and cozy bed.
