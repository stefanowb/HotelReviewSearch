It's not easy to find as the hotel is tucked back in an office park, and as noted, your really need a car to come and go. It was quiet. The room was clean and really comfortable. The small gym had all new equipment (2-3 treadmills, 1 elliptical, 1 bike, free weights). The pool was good sized for a hotel and there was a hot tub that was hot, not lukewarm. The pool room had one wall that was all windows looking out onto a garden area. The breakfast buffet was good with omelets made to order. I would stay here again.

I am a Project Manager and book hotel stays frequently for my co-workers and thus know how easy it is to have a taxi called from the front desk or what have you. The reception was about 4 miles from the hotel, and we didn't want to drive. When I called the hotel regarding any services they may have offered, they advised they only offered airport transportation complimentary - not a problem do you have any suggestions? She suggested a few companies for which the cost for a 4 mile ride would have been about $200 - so obviously that wasn't the way we wanted to go. She did say that when we arrived at the hotel that we could ask the front desk to call a cab (I am from the area but know that this is located in the suburbs - not the city and a cab might not be as easily accessible). I said great, how long is the wait typically? She said 20-30 minutes - again - great! So....when we got there I asked the guy at the front desk to call a cab and he looked at me like I had three eyes. He said we don't normally do that...ok fine...but you are a hotel and you don't have a designated conceirge - thus, you take care of guests requests. He advised that \"there is only one cab company locally that will pickup for local drives but since they don't want to pick you up for such a close ride they will take almost an hour to get here.\" No kidding - this is what this guy told me! When I called and talked the first woman - the one I refer to above - I called the actual hotel and front desk - not the main 800 number. I could have argued it and asked for a supervisor but I was going to a wedding, I didn't want to ruin my mood - so I figured the best way to handle it was to write a review. Beware, if you are staying here and don't have transportation - they tell you one thing and when you get there its something different.", "title": "Wouldn't recommend to someone without transportation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mfallon", "date": "October 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 20904147, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Room was clean.", "disliked": "\u2014 the poor customer service at the front desk"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I have stayed at this property twice in the past year, both times for four days or more.

It was thrown in the closet with the mounting kit and it did not work. The iron looked like it was 20 years old with calcium deposits of about 2mm. The bed was comfortable but the rug looked dirty and sticky. I am a gold member with Marriott and have stayed over 60 nights last year with the Marriott. This would have to be the worst.
