Not impressive from the outside, but room was a wonderful surprise. Plenty of room, great view (one of only 2 places to stay with any sort of view at all). Great private balcony out over the Appalachicola River - great for a cigar and some adult beverages of your choice (rooms themselves are nonsmoking). Relaxing just to sit back and watch the birds and river traffic - check out the Osprey nest on top of the river range marker (need field glasses). Rooms were clean, bed very comfortable, and people friendly. Be sure to try Caroline's for breakfast - try the oyster omelet. Our first trip to Appalach, but we will definitely be back and plan to return to River Inn. Appalach is not a place for kids, no rides/slides, beach is about a 1/2 hour drive - try north end of Cape San Blas. Appalach is laid back and unpretensive. Roll up the side walks at sunset. REALLY quiet on Sunday.

Our room was not the Ritz, but it was clean and spacious, plenty of room for two adults with two 25 pound dogs. Considering the age of the hotel, we felt that they had done a good job keeping the feel of its \"working man's town\" culture. The balcony, looking directly out over the river, was made for great photos ops and just enjoying the view. The lounge and restaurant were both very good with very friendly wait staff. It was a bit pricey, but it has that great \"million dollar view\"......
