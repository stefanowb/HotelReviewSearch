The novotel experience with kids is reassuringly familiar, though this hotel didn't provide a welcome gift, which the kids always like and might be worth thinking about given it was half term in Sweden too and there were plenty of kids there, it does have a businessy feel even so. The rooms are fine, the superior room a bit smaller than in some others, but the views of the harbour are splendid. Front of house staff friendly and informative if not hugely warm. The breakfast huge of course, but the one disappointment was the quality of evening food, compared to novotel a in France it was a bit frozen seeming and bland. We would have eaten elsewhere if there was somewhere nearby.. Though the batman was great and the drinks much better than food, Yes the hotel is out of the way, but the journey into town by tram or ferry part do the fun, and v short, we walked back in around 30 mins, which is manageable too, so there's no reason to be closer. The city itself had a lot to offer, the rain pretty awful as predicted, but when sunny you really appreciate it! For families visiting, universes is as good as it looks, the kids were v excited, it is better than similar places in london. Archie Atkins centre also v good for half a day. And don't miss slottparken the main park, where you will be able to play in the leaves with the swedish kids at their outdoor kindergartens, and also it has the best penguin enclosure we have seen, you really are up close, far better than london zoo. For eating, wld recommend the city museum cafe ( plainly full of swedish nct groups) and the cafe in the botanical gardens.", "title": "Pleasant as usual", "user": "twoplusonetravel", "date": "November 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 183564767}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The Novotel Goteborg is a good choice for both business and leisure travelers visiting Goteborg.

There is a main floor with a living room, kitchenette and bathroom and then a second floor with the bedroom, desk and another TV. The Apartments have all of the basics and make it good for going out to get groceries and not having to rely on the hotel for everything. That being said, I have gone for breakfast at the Hotel every morning and enjoyed some quality meals there for dinner as well. The restaurant does not have a wide variety on their menu, but having tried much of what is there, it is all very tasty. The staff at the hotel are super nice and accommodating. My only negative is that it a bit far from the action and to get to the city center requires a cab or the use of a tram system which is about a 5 minute walk. My work is very near which makes the location much better during the week.

The most outstanding feature was the view of the marina and bridge; otherwise the stay was unremarkable (but in a good way). The last thing you need on a business trip is surprise and during this stay all went smoothly. The food at the restaurant was quite good, the rooms clean and check out/in professionally done. The room was a bit small but well designed although there could have been more drawer space for small clothing. The breakfast buffet included in the room price was particularly good.
