Staff were friendly and the location was great. You can get a metro directly from gare du midi (main train station) direct to madou, which is a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. The room was lovely and bright - no peeling wallpaper in sight. Bathroom was fully tiled. Breakfast served from 6:30-9:30am and had a good variety of cereals, bread, meat, cheese as well as croissants and pain au chocolat. There is also a mini-supermarket beside the metro station for those late night munchies!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ladybird_glasg0w", "date": "November 23, 2005", "id": 4138911}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "We walked into the centre of town most days - about half an hour walk.

If you are staying there on a Sunday night this is important because there are no restaurants around the hotel open on a Sunday night. The hotel was clean, and my single room ingeniously designed to make the most of the compact space. For one night it was more than adequate, but it would be very cramped for a stay of more than a few nights. The bed was perfectly comfortable, and the reception staff were polite and helfpul.
