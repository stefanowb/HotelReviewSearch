The hotel is easily reached from the Arrivals hall of the airport after just a short walk. The rooms are well-appointed and the bed was comfortable enough for a decent night's sleep. My room looked out onto the airport tarmac and I was pleasantly surprised that I was never bothered by aircraft noise. Apparently, the hotel is well insulated from outside sounds and it was a peaceful stay. I found it impossible, however, to adequately adjust the room temperature as the ventilation system seemed to blow only cold air. Coming from a very warm climate, I was disappointed that i couldn't warm up the room, even with outside temperatures in the low teens C.", "title": "Nice hotel, but very expensive", "user": "joeb1249", "date": "September 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 139844199}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Most bizarre room decor ...
