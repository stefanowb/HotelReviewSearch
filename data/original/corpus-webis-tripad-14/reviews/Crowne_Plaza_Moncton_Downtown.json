My first issue was that our group rate was the same as the regular rate (though I believe that blame falls on my company's event organizer and their lack of negotiating that that of the hotel itself). The meeting area was good; it was clean and well equipped, and the staff did an exception job attending the beverages/lunches and cleaning up. My three interactions with staff was very pleasant, with all actively engaging me in pleasant conversation. My room, which was on the third floor, was generally clean however there was a large stain on the rug in the center of the room. The bed provided a very nice sleep and I had no issue/concern with the cleanliness of the bed and/or linen. I heard almost no noise from exterior of the room. The bathroom was also clean as well as bright and well stocked. While there was plenty of hot water, the pressure from the shower head was poor (no issue with the pressure from the faucets - need new shower heads?). One downfall might be that the bathroom offers no ventilation fan. The in-room internet (wired/wifi) was very good!! The hotel offers onsite fitness rooms, pool with hot tub and an enclosed parking garage. Plus, an onsite barber shop for those of us guys in need of a hair cut before the big meeting. Yes, the hotel is older and I have stayed at the hotel when it operated under different flags. While the hotel's age does pop up here and there, the Crowne Plaza group has done a very good job maintaining the hotel, plus the renovations over the years has certainly helped this hotel keep with industry trends and expectations. I would have no issue returning to this hotel in the future.
