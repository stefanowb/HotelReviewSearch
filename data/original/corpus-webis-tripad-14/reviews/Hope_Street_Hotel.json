The lounge, bar area and restaurant were all well appointed and the bar staff prompt and helpful. The location was good and only a short walk to the shopping centre and university.

My partner and I have eaten at the hotel's restaurant (London Carriage Works) many times because the food is very good but we are becoming increasingly fed up by the staff. Here are some examples: a waitress who opened our wine and poured it almost to the top of the (very large) glass; waitress who opened and poured wine without asking us to taste it; waitress repeatedly delivered meals and seemed unable to tell the difference between pigeon, pork and lamb; waitress not asking whether we enjoyed the food during the meal; taking the bill without saying thank you; waitress allowing us to walk past her without looking up to say thank you/good night, etc. This to me doesn't seem the right attitude and I can't think of any good restaurant I've been who would repeatedly allow this to happen, probably because establishments at this level usually train staff to make guests feel welcome and to show some interest in their dining experience.
