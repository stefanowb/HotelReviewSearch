Although it was a typical style with small sleeping area with long entrance going past closet and bathroom, both the closet and bathroom were large so the \"hallway\" was longer than usual in our room. There was a suitcase rack as well as chairs around a small table. I liked the wooden floors, not real plank wood but nice enough and cleaner than sticky or worn carpets and warmer than tile. There was a small table outside our room with magazines--nice touch--and a large common room on main floor with giant screen TV on which someone was watching an Italian movie. We had to leave early before breakfast but the desk reception clerk kindly on his own brought us coffee. Hotel is hard to find at night, up some narrow streets, but the parking is good.
