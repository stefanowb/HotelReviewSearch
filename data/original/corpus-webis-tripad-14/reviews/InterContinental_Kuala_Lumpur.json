The price seemed extremely reasonable for being a top hotel in KL. On arrival, we saw that the Lobby area looked amazing. Very big, spacious, stair cases and bustling with staff and guests. The staff were friendly and immediately took our luggage and let us check in. The room was very nice, modern, clean. The desk was spacious, with plug sockets, paper. Everything you need if you are travelling here on business. The TV is big, loads of channels and the beds are very comfortable. Our room had a window which looked into the bathroom which was very odd, but a blind is available for privacy should you want to put it down. Breakfast was certainly one of the best parts of the stay. So definitely have breakfast. A large dining area, nice surroundings, and amazing food choices from all cuisines. Such as Chinese, Malaysian, English, Spanish, Indian.. The location is great. Only a short walk to the subway station and close to the Petronas Towers and down town KL as well.
