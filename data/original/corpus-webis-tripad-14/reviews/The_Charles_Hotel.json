It was as if we were at three different restaurants. The first night was excellent in every regard including value. The second night we both agreed we would never return had it been our only experience there--everything was good but overpriced and service was more that of a struggling neighborhod bistro than of a fine restaurant. The third night we had a good main course, but for some reason the bread and chef's plate we had been given the prior nights were omitted and the service was hurried, though pleasant-- perhaps because they were very busy. These experiences made it easy to see how the hotel would receive a wide range of assessments from its patrons.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "hkwAtlanta_Georgia", "date": "December 27, 2011", "id": 122153426}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed just prior to the Christmas holiday as a family with 2 adult children. Our request for connecting rooms was honored, making it just that much easier to coordinate things with the kids. The hallways leading to the rooms have toned-down lighting which perhaps sets the mood for a very, very quiet room. No doors slamming in the middle of the night/early am, and never a peep heard from other rooms. It must be the quietest hotel room we have ever occupied! Our kids did not want to stay at one of the more vintage, luxury boutique offerings, and they chose this hotel. It could not have been better located for our trips outside and around the city (Salzburg, Dachau, Bayern Munchen match) via train or urban subway, as it is a mere 1 1/2 blocks from the main train station, and just 1/2 block from the U Line subway. We also had a very short walk to the Christmas markets in and around the city, especially at Marienplatz square. We took advantage of the hotel's room service for breakfast many of the mornings we needed to get away quickly, and were always greeted with friendly service. When milk for coffee was forgotten, it was brought quickly, and with a flower for my daughter as an apology. The concierge staff, under the tutelage of wonderful Heidi, was efficient and very helpful. She was able to secure tickets for the very popular Bayern Munchen/Cologne match at the beautiful Allianz Arena, with our request several weeks in advance, as well as arrange for a private tour of the historical city with a knowledgeable local graduate student. My daughter and I visited the wellness spa almost every evening to take advantage of the sauna and steam room, and made quick friends with Stefan, manning the desk with such charm and flair. We did not know the spa had a beautiful pool, or we would have been certain to bring our suits (although not required). The sauna/steam area has individual showers that are grouped side-by-side, without doors, so do be aware of the mingling of the sexes sans clothing. For those more modest, there are single-sex showers and changing facilities. There is a sign in the sauna/steam area that explains the circulatory benefits of foot bath/sauna/steam/swim and in what order. This fact explains the difference between the German and American spas. In America, it is all about relaxation. Even though the Charles has a Relaxation Room as part of it's facilities where one goes to sip hot and cold infusions and lie on lounge chairs, we were a bit off-put by the upbeat holiday music piped into all areas, even playing while we were enjoying a reflexology session. Melinda offered a superb massage on another occasion. Again, the music did not match the tone of the moment. Other areas to touch upon- the lobby bar had a nice jazz ensemble on the weekend, and our son, a bigger eater than the rest of us, enjoyed a very nice full buffet breakfast a couple of mornings with a selection that was superior. Our dinner at the hotel restaurant was very good, too...I could suggest that the room's ambiance would be enhanced with dimmer lighting. I must agree with others that thought the linens a bit too stiff. I read something in the room that the hotel uses linen instead of cotton for the superior breathability of its sheets....I don't know if it is worth the trade off. The only serious complaint all four of us had is that internet service is not free.

Check-in was smooth and we were escorted to our junior suite upgrade. We were disappointed with the view of an adjacent office building located across a pretty courtyard and shocked when night fell exposing our room to view. Our choice was to keep the draperies closed or ask for another room. We then discovered that the airconditioning didn't work and notified the front desk. An engineer was promptly dispatched but he was unable to fix the problem. The following day we were moved to a beautiful large suite, with two balconies, overlooking the garden. A lovely floral arrangement and bottle of wine were gifts from management due to our problems with the first room. The balance of our stay was perfect in every way. Since there were only 4 suites on our floor, with only one other suite occupied for one night only, it was very quiet. The staff was extremely helpful.

Stayed for three nights with family on a recent trip there, and found it extremely hard to even leave the hotel each morning! The staff were top-class as soon as we arrived, asking us how our flight had been and helping us with what we wanted to see and do in Munich, and one of the staff took us up to our room and explained every single part of the room that we'd need to know - including the bed-side controls to set the room as 'Do Not Disturb', which was very useful for sleep-ins! They were able to answer any question we had throughout the entire trip, and consistently asked us if everything was OK - really could not ask for better service. The Spa, pool and fitness area is absolutely brilliant - a big enough pool for the amount of guests with tonnes of lounges, a gym area with about 11/12 machines (always empty when I was in it), and massage treatments available even within a few hours' notice. The restaurant had a nice view into the small outside courtyard (equipped with outdoor heaters and chairs and tables, but as it was snowing when we were here, these weren't used), and having breakfast in here is a must if you can get it included (the amount and quality of food on offer is crazy!!). Location is great - a very very short walk from the train station, and very much central to any attractions in Munich. Nothing is more than a good walk away - we barely used public transport or taxis. Need a 10-minute walk to find good restaurants, but just ask the concierge at the front desk and they'll point you in the direction of some brilliant restaurants in the surrounding areas. And the best part of the hotel - the bar. Wow. Open-plan in the lobby with many great comfortable chairs, great drinks, and live music every night we were there (a three-man band with a piano, viola and saxophone, as well as some magnificent singing from the pianist). Best atmosphere you could ask for - come down from 8-10pm and you will not be disappointed. Couldn't find a single fault in this hotel. Do not hesitate to book!

The room was in a converted attic, super spacy, very cosy and if you lean outside the window, you could actually see the Charles Bridge down the street, which means that the location of this hotel is extremelly good, right inbetween Prague old center and Prague's Castle. Heating was working perfectly (we stayed there during this winter's big chill!). The bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean and with modern appliances. By the lobby, there's one computer with internet access and a small kitchen bay where you can make your own coffee and tea, which was very pleasant after a day walking in Prague. If you're bringing your own computer or smartphone, you can just ask in the reception for the internet password which has good reception in the rooms. Breakfast is served in the basement of the hotel which is also a thai restaurant otherwise. Even though its not the best i've ever had, it's pretty satisfactory with great croissants! The only negative aspects I can point is the staff, some were friendly, others not so much. And when it comes to pay, make your payment in Euros or they'll make you a really bad convertion to kroners and you'll pay way more than you booked.
