We only tried the restaurant once for breakfast and were underwhelmed. Dave and Mike\u2019s, a tiny diner across the street, is a local landmark and a better choice for breakfast. We did not try dinner in-house, but instead ventured a block down the road to the waterfront. Guaymas, a Mexican restaurant was our favorite there, with great margaritas, tasty food, beautiful views, and a nice warm fire to warm us on a windy cool evening. Just next to Guaymas is the ferry dock, where you can catch a boat to Angel Island or to San Francisco.
