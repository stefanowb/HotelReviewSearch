First of all if you're allergic to cats watch out here as Cactus is a cat (Jack is a pet bird, caged out front!). If you arrive to Rotorua by bus you will be dropped off at Tourism Rotorua and its just a couple of minutes walk to the hostel from here. Don't be put off by the small reception area. The hostel has plenty of space for all its guests and lots of nooks to throw yourself in to chill.

The bed was extremely comfy. The kind that when you test it after throwing off your luggage you will have difficulty getting up! There are plenty of hooks and shelves and a little dressing table too. Now if you're someone that like spacious rooms this won't be for you. The rooms are small- all of them- but they are comfortable. There are rooms inside the main building and then some that surround the courtyard area. Those surrounding the courtyard did seem bigger so perhaps request one of these when booking. The only draw back is you'll have to go outside in order to get to the bathroom, which might be a pain if it rains. On the topic of bathrooms, there are several- inside and out- so you never have to wait to go.

For example the room that houses the vending machine and pool table is called the Saloon and the courtyard bit has a great porch swing chair. There is also a hot pool/tub which is great to chill in. The tv room had a good dvd player and vcr and a good collection of movies. I found it great to chill there as there was rarely many prople in it. They only have 3 channels though (although many hostels in NZ only have TV1, Two and TV3). The kitchen was very clean and had plenty of everything, including a couple of fridge-freezers. There is only one table (seats around 6) in the kitchen, but the ajoining room has more seating, along with 2 internet computers (coin run-around $6 an hour). Soup and scones are served free every evening around 6 in the kitchen. We arrived on a Friday and the scones and soup were fresh and delicious, but we found that it was the leftovers of theis that were served the next couple of days so they weren't as good- but still free!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 14, 2004", "id": 1785705}], "location": {"country": "New Zealand", "region": "North Island", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 10, "very good": 29, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 17}, "slim_ranking": 0.596153846154}
