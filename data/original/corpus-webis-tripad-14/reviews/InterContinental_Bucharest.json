It is also close to a stop on the Bucharest City Tour (a Hop On and Hop Off tour). Very comfortable rooms and an excellent breakfast buffet. Definitely enjoy the croissants. These are the real, buttery pastry that is nothing like the pallid version served in the US. And, grab one with chocolate and you'll be eating a bite of heaven. There's lots to see in the city. http://www.offbeattravel.com/bucharest-romania-landmarks-attractions.html", "title": "Superbly located", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "OffbeatTravel", "date": "April 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 128471485}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "we tried both restaurants and the food was very good.", "title": "very nice!", "user": "pjspjs", "date": "April 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127739287}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "spa/pool on 22nd floor is a flashback to the 1970's and needs to be seen.", "title": "Great Hotel & Location", "user": "norfolktraveller7", "date": "April 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127362851}], "location": {"country": "Romania", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 52, "very good": 162, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 205}, "aka": "Intercontinental Bucharest Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0943396226415, "description": "Towering above the city skyline, InterContinental Bucharest is one of the city's favourite international high-rise hotels, a distinction owed to its ideal location, fine appointments and impeccable service.
