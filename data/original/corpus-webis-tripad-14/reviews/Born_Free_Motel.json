I wasn't sure about the hotel b/c he booked it on his own & the name is a little funky. But the place exceeded all my expectations & I wouldn't stay elsewhere in Montauk. Born Free is a small hotel about 1/2 block off the beach and 2 blocks from Nicks (good nightlife/happy hour). There are about 20 rooms & the building is only 2 stories high. From the second story you can see the ocean. It's located right near an entrance to the public beach and about 1.5 blocks to the main town. Great location! Born Free rooms are more like suites than hotel rooms - they have a pullout sofa in case you have more than 2 people & they have kitchenette's if you feel like doing your own cooking or keeping food on-hand for breakfast/lunch/etc. Another bonus is that the Born Free hotel has WiFi. Which means I can sit on the porch, hear the ocean & get some work done. They clean your place daily - new towels, etc. And the staff is laid-back & very helpful. It's about a $8 cab ride from the train station if you don't have a car. I would definitely recommend this property!", "user": "lolomojo", "date": "September 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19931430, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, wifi, kitchenette", "disliked": "\u2014 There are stairs to get to all rooms so if you can't manage stairs this isn't the place for you"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pretty darn nice", "text": "We found the room to be clean and quiet.
