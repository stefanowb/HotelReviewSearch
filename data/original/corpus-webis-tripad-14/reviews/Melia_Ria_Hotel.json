'Interesting' architecture, but with some serious design drawbacks. Very OK for a small business event, but not for a holiday. Aveiro is quite small, but the hotel is relatively far outside - just a few minutes (and a few euros) by taxi to the town centre, but an unsheltered walk of 15-20 minutes - too far to walk often, especially in case of hot sun or rain. The old part of town is small but quite nice, but there is also a large new shopping mall, standard europe. Someone mentioned 'the beach' but it's far away - we tried Costa Nova by taxi: 15 minute journey!
