Our rooms were at the Beach Club and were beautiful and well appointed. We had never visited before but travel often to better resorts where our husbands, who are avid golfers, can play - and they are serious, 36 holes a day golfers (this is their break - they are physicians, a corporate vp, and my husband is a surgeon). The grounds are beautiful. The courses the boys played were magnificent and worthy of PGA tours. The fitness center was lovely - well appointed and there are folks there for any class or tip a person might need. As I said the golf was terrific, however -- the boys were promised a welcome golf gift as part of their package and it never materialized. They were promised a daily forecaddie and that, too, never materialized and they felt bullied into accepting that it wouldn't be available to them. My husband's golf glove and towel, which were attached to his bag, went missing after the first day and there was no apology and no effort made to locate them. The following day another of our party noticed his towel was missing as well and again, no apology and no effort made to recitify the situation. Service in the restaurants (Colt & Alison, the Oak Room and Big George's) was SLOW. The required 20% gratuity which is automatically added to your bill -- whether you serve yourself at the buffet or have full sit down service - was a bit grating to us. We are generous tippers but prefer to use our discretion. Often we leave 25% or more but when we are told what to do we stop right there. My husband had a glass of orange juice one morning prior to golf and couldn't believe the added gratuity. (this was not sit down service either -- simply a grab and go) Housekeeping was very pleasant, but I was dismayed to find the previous room's occupant's undergarments in a dresser drawer -- I gave the items to the maid who was apologetic but it was sloppy. Several in our party expressed have our concern to the staff, but have heard nothing from them - a bit disappointing. Bar service around the pool was lackluster - the service person quickly walked around and unless you were looking for her and could wave her down you were on your own. The pools, though, are beautiful. Overall this is a beautiful resort but they need to brush up a bit. I think next time we'll head to Reynold's Plantation, which ironically was where we were first considering when making these plans -- but I was the one who wanted to visit this property and won out!
