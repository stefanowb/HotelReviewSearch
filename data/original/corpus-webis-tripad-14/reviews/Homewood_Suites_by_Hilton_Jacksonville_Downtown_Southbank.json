As most of these reviews will agree, it is certainly a nice hotel. One issue is that it is not located in a good area, and it would be highly foolish to walk around these parts in the evening. Also, like one other review noted, if you are on the Kings Ave. side of the hotel, which is half of the hotel, you will be hearing loud music and trains until 2 AM for the music, and trains will be on and off throughout the day/night....I think the train is realistic to deal with, but the music is ridiculous. The fact that guests complain about it and the hotel has not struck an agreement to get them to turn it down a little bit is beyond me.Also, like some reviews stated earlier, there is a weird smell that if you are sensitive to that sorta thing, will bother you...Aside from the reasons to be kept up all night, it is a nice hotel, with a good breakfast every morning. Just be aware of the the distractions....", "title": "Nice Hotel with some unfortunate issues", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jonman2001", "date": "March 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 59345247}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled with family", "text": "I was scheduled to stay at this hotel from a Thursday to a Sunday. When I arrived I was pleased by the accomodations, however, when walking into the lobby I was overwhelmed by the strong stench of some type of seafood that had gone bad. I assumed that the smell would be limited to the lobby area. Unfortunately, when I got off of the elevator to go to my room, some other type of offensive odor was immediately noticable. To my dismay, the smell was also noticable in my room. I cannot describe the odor... but it was so pungent my cousin vomited about five minutes after we walked into the suite. I honestly cannot describe the smell, my cousin and I have tried to figure it out with no success. I can assure you that neither of us have a history of mental illness and do not suffer from olfactory hallucinations, and an earlier reviewer of this hotel mentioned it as well, so I don't think it was imagined it. The hotel staff was very nice and seemed surprisingly unfazed when we told them that we were going to check-out due to the malodorous accomodations. We were later told that a \"team of people\" had been sent to try to determine the origin of the odor, so I suppose they were trying to correct the situation, although I find it impossible to believe that other customers have not reported it. On the other hand, if that type of thing doesn't bother you, the hotel is aesthetically pleasing, and the staff was very accomodating.", "title": "NICE HOTEL....

When you enter the hotel there is a foul smell and numerous guests picked up on it. You could also smell it on the elevators and in some of the hallways. The front desk people of the hotel all claimed not to notice it, which I found hard to believe. Also, the hotel is located right next to some train tracks with CSX trains going by regularly. So if you are a light sleeper, please keep this in mind. And lastly if you are on the Kings Ave. side of the hotel, there is a bar across the street that has live bands that play very loud music on the weekends until about 2 am. It got so loud that we had request a move to a the room across the hall for the rest of our stay. I will say the the front desk staff will go out of their way to accomodate any requests you have, especially Mark who was awesome in every way. And lastly, the breakfast each of our four mornings was just o.k. but I have had better at other Homewood Suites.", "title": "Highly Recommend", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "chimmicat", "date": "November 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 49490917}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I had to check out of this hotel after one day. Let me be fair, hotel room wise this is definitely one of the nicer Homewood suites I've stayed at. New, clean, well appointed. The problem here is location. This hotel is on the outskirts of downtown in a semi business section. That's all you get here. When I asked the front desk where I could go to get something to eat on a Saturday afternoon I was given strictly driving info. When i asked where I could walk to I was met mostly with a shrug. Staying at downtown hotels can be a lot of fun like in Boston, New York, even Cleveland and others cities.
