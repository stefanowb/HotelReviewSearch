This was a Best Western hotel when we stayed there. I work at a Best Western so I at least expected it to be clean. As soon as we walked in to our room I was on the phone trying to get a different hotel. Unfortunately, everybody was full. There were picture hooks hanging on the walls, but no pictures! There were only 3 channels on the T.V. that were in English. The breakfast was served in a train car which sounded like a cute idea but the train car smelled like it hadn't been cleaned since the day it stopped operating. My keys didn't work, and the desk staff told me it was because it was raining outside!!! And I work at a front desk, so I told them that was ridiculous. The 3rd night there was a huge rainstorm and water poured out of the bathroom light fixture. This hotel has since LOST its Best Western branding, that is why its now a Travelodge! Worst hotel I have ever been in!!!", "title": "Turn Back!

The front desk person was very friendly. Asking how our drive was, were the kids excited to go to Disneyland. He checked us in very fast and was extremely helpful. Even though the property is older it was clean and looked to be recently renovated. The rooms were spacious and clean. One of the best parts was the black light. You turn it on at night turn the lights off and Presto! You have glow in the dark stars to look at while you drift off to sleep. My boys LOVED it! The Continental Breakfast was standard and in a temporary room while they are building a breakfast room. Housekeeping kept our rooms clean!! Easy in and easy out to the parking structure at Disneyland Resort, another plus when leaving after a long day at the park. Didn't get to use the pool it was too chilly, but it looked clean.

We were sent to this hotel for one night because the hotel we had booked, had overbooked and didn't have a room for us upon our arrival. So we were upset but the front desk person at the other hotel said what a nice place this would be. Everyhting was fine, except for a very uncomfortable sofa bed, up until the next morning when my bf's mom went to take a shower and the ceiling started leaking throught the light fixture. It was pretty bad and the floor was flooded. You couldn't even use the toilet as that is where the leaking was going We called the front desk and they sent someone but it took him about 20 minutes to actually arrive. We all wanted to shower, but what could we do? He came in and looked at the place, then fiddled with a few things and left. We called front desk again and eventually he came back. Well, I marched right over to front desk to get a room to shower in and they promptly got us one. I would say this place is not bad. The bathroom incident was a freak thing that could've happened anywhere. The maintenance person should've been a little better and quicker because we lost 2 hours in the park that day. A friend once stayed at the Sheraton, not far from Disneyland, and the toilet broke and flooded the room. These things happen. had we been staying for more than one night, I would've asked for a new room , though.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 12, 2005", "id": 4018263}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great Place & very reasonable", "text": "I read all the reviews for this hotel before we left & was very nervous that we would be staying in a real dive. However it was quit the oppisite. The room was clean, pool was fine, and staff was very helpful & polite. There is much to do while you visit Anheim I'm not sure why you want to stay in a 5 star hotel as we were only in our room for 6 hours at night to sleep, then shower& then we were off for the day. This hotel is only 3 minutes from the free tram, and then you are at Disney in another 3 minutes, can't beat that. The hotels on the side of the front entrance have to walk or pay for transportation $3.00 aday per person. I would recomend this hotel to anyone.

The rooms were clean, a good size, nothing fancy, but then again we spent most of our time out of the room. The beds weren't feather beds but after a long day at Disney it didn't take much to get us to sleep. The room had a nice size refrigerator and it came with a microwave. We had a room with a view of the pool. We enjoyed the hot tub and pool during the evenings and morning hours. Continental breakfast was light, but filling. You get a little more than just coffee/juice and donuts. You could walk to disneyland, but after being there nearly 12 hrs. I'm glad we pd the $10 to park at the Disney parking lots. You can also see the fireworks from Disney on Friday's and Saturday's. Take advantage and step outside to view them. We saw them from the pool.

The best part of the room is the stars on the ceiling. I read this in a review so I looked for them. Turn on the black light for a while and then turn off all the lights. It was like sleeping outside under the stars. Our whole family enjoyed this. Our only negative thing would be the refrigerator did not work too well. Also, it says it is only a block from Disneyland but you have to walk across the street, down a block, over a bridge, across the street again and across a large parking lot to the Disney tram. Maybe it sounds like a quick ten minute walk, but at 11:00 pm after walking all over Disneyland, it seems like 10 miles!
