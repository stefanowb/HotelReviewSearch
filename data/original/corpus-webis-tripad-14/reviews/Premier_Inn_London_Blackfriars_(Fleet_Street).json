Very quiet location off New Bridge Street, close to Blackfriars Station & bus stops. Only 5 mins walk to St Pauls Cathedral & City of London. Restaurant staff very pleasant and evening menu reasonably priced, esp if you have the 3 course evening meal deal with breakfast. Wonderful wide selection available at breakfast.

The locality half way between the City and Westminster made it the first choice. When it comes to the rest, all I can say is that it was all right. The rooms are generally small. The toilet was f. ex. placed in such a way that everytime someone else wanted to open the door, one had to move legs aside or wear a kneepads for protection. There was no socket in the bathroom for shaving. Go figure why? On the contrary, there was a make-up mirror in the cupboard/wardrobe section with the socket, but the mess is impossible to clean on a wall-to-wall carpet when there is no hoover. The shower head was fixed to the waterpipe being that as high as 150 cm above the bathtub, it created a big mess outside(!) the bathtub, and I never used it again. Another thing is the noise being carried under the doors. There was NO sound isolation to the corridor, so no privacy. You could hear with ease the whole conversation of people disaggreeing or having fun inside. The mattresses were a bit hard, so I was actually aching in my back and shoulders every day, which is NOT good. The air-condition is probably programmed to saty at max. 21 degrees Celsius, because when we wanted to warm a room bit more, it stopped after two minutes and went down to 21 again. Mind you, we were in London when it was really chilly, with temperatures under 0 every day, so we really needed the temperature up. That leads me to the warm water issue. Both my son and I have couple times tried the warm water from watertap to the sink, without getting it ever really warm. The caution sign of HOT water seemed a bit redundant there.The only place when the water got warm was when we filled the tub.", "title": "You get the basics...", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "PeterNordman", "date": "March 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 156124189}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Then, a positive feature: they charge 10 pounds a week (or 3 pounds a day) for the WiFi, which is all right, and one can have up to three devices connected to one account.", "title": "Great hotel and staff", "user": "rammy2307", "date": "March 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 156093623}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Over to breakfast.
