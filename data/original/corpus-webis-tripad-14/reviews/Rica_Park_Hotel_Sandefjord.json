Great location on the harbour with good views. The hotel staff are very friendly & speak excellent English. The rooms are clean & comfortable. We had 2 foldaway beds added for the children, this was fine at night & when folded away we had plenty of room. Breakfast is complementary & very good. Norway is expensive but comparable with Edinburgh or London hotels when it comes to food & especially alcohol. The leisure centre is very good with a large heated saltwater pool & there is a bar selling drinks & snacks. The airport is only 10 minutes away by taxi & costs about \u00a320. You can take a day trip to Oslo by train, the station is a short 10-minute walk from the hotel. Tickets can be bought at the shop at the station. Language is not a problem as most people speak English", "title": "Short break", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "SL.123", "date": "October 29, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4070059}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "Given that Norway is without what would be considered a 'luxury' hotel anywhere else in the world, this hotel is just fine. It is NOT anything special. It is a large hotel, located near the water (a short walk to the ferry) and is proximate to a large and pleasant park. The hotel is not air conditioned (no hotels in Norway are) so if it is warm, you're in big trouble. The rooms are adequate and compared to many hotels in the larger cities (Oslo and Bergen), the price is reasonable.", "title": "For Norway, about as good as it gets", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Foplaw", "date": "September 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3900932}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2005", "text": "Took the wife away for a suprise weekend and stumbled upon this hotel.

We had glorious harbour views and the restaurant was fab. Our rooms were absolutely spotless as was the rest of the building, and the whole town for that matter.
