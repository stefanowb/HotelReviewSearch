The suroundings are a tipical Bangkok neighborhood so you go up in your luxurious room and look down ... you'll be staring at poverty. The hotel room are huge, there is a small living room with couches when you first get in, the comes the big bathroom and mini kitchen, and finally the bedroom. The kitchen has a fridge but no stove so you'll have to go out for food. DO NOT EAT AT THE HOTEL. I don't care how much money you have, it's a complete waste of money. Dinner at the Sky bar is 5000 bahts, that's more than what you would pay in the US. Instead, walk for about 2 min in any direction on Slolam and you'll have plenty of restaurants with meals at around 150 bahts. We eat several times at a restaurant called Maria's Pizza or something like that. It's a pizza house but they have very good Thai food, the best pad thai I' ve ever had, all for 150 bahts.
