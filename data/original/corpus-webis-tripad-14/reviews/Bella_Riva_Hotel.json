Nice rooms. Quiet location. Rooms with great view and gives you the opportunity to enjoy typical verona flavor. The garden is really excellent. A great combination of flora and old trees really added another paradigm of beauty to the hotel. The rooms are really nice, clean and with great views to the lake. The food is excellent. The pool serves the temperature controlled water but you may choose to walk few minutes to enjoy the lake itself. The staffs are friendly and attentive.

The sophisticated ambience, the kind and professional service and the gorgeous room and amenities of this hotel make it well worth the price. The location on the lake is outstanding. The pool is a quiet haven and the food was delicious, served on a pretty terrace facing the lake and grounds. I had some difficulty negotiating the high tech lighting fixtures; all touch button controlled from a console beside the bed, including opening and closing the blinds. But staff made me feel that this was my own private villa and they were there just to make me happy.
