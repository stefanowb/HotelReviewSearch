Tend to agree with everything that the reviewer said on 1 April. We had a similar room - the king deluxe on the first floor with the little balconies for \u00a3165 per night (booked via the hotel's website). Haven't stayed at other London hotel's so not sure if this is good value or not. The room was not large though well arranged. About 3 feet on one side of the king bed and about 6 feet on the other side. Flat screen tv on the wall, desk area and inbuilt couch. Nicely decorated - very subtle tones of creams and browns. Both my husband and I had laptops, so we appreciated the inroom safe big enough to fit the laptops. Managed to get unsecured wireless from a neighbouring office which was good. The bathroom was lovely but the shower head was so high I could not reach it and the water only came out in torrents.", "title": "Nice hotel, pleasant spot", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "jmlparis", "date": "June 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5383594}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "The area is fairly residential - definitely not in the heart of things.

It is the kind of place that I could stay for several weeks. The accommodations were luxurious compared to some of the places we have stayed in London. The furnishings in the room as well as the public spaces were very tastefully done. The neighborhood is a little off the beaten path but in walking distance to the tube station. The shopping and restaurants in the area are upscale. All I can say is that I did not want to leave except that the prices in London are outrageous.
