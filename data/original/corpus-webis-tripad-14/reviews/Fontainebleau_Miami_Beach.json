Kids said at Cookies world the slide didn't move fast and you had to help yourself down, and the lazy river pool was not heated. Food options are limited at the hotel with a 15% service charge tacked on even if you get lunch yourself poolside. After spending $70 for breakfast for the 4 of us we started buying things to keep in our kitchen for breakfast. The hotel's main dining room was sub par so we took a cab @ $10 each way most nights to Lincoln Rd. which had wonderful restaurants.

Ate in Joes Stone Crabs one night which is very touristy and good for people watching, but get there early as lines can get fierce. It was @$350 for the 4 of us.
