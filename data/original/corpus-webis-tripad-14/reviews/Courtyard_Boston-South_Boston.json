The shuttle bus drivers were kind enough to drop me off at the closest metro stop (about a 10-minute walk away) on several occasions and also pick me up from the station. I also used the complimentary airport shuttle and was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the shuttle arrived at the airport.

The subway is a five minute walk away, and a shopping mall with an Olive Garden and Chili's Restaurant is located directly behind the hotel. The shopping mall also has a Target, Circuit City, and supermarket among many other stores. Other eating places are within walking distance, but were more expensive and/or of unknown quality so we avoided them except for one which was expensive and not very good. We took the subway to the suburbs like the Harvard area or downtown for evening meals on many days and were well satisfied. We typically had breakfast in the hotel dining room which was very good, but somewhat pricey.
