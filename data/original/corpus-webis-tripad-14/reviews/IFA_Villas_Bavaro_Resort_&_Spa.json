The rating by Apple was a 3 but I would give it an upgrae to 4 1/2 apples. The rooms were above average, the landscaping was above average, the beach was excellent but lacking shades cabanas( I took an umbrella and 2 C clamps) and made my own shade. But really didn't use the seats often. The food was 1 of the best that I ever ate , and I been to Punta Cana 5 times now. The 3 special restaurants weren't the best I ever had, but the 3 buffets had a lot of varieties changing of some kind every seating. The staff was above average and I didn't have 1 complaint other that the Disco didn't change music varieties enough, too much Spanish and hardly any American. I couldn't stay up past midnight any ways. The pool music was above average and the beach music was very good too! Didn't take any tour other then the reef snorkling for 2 hrs for $20.00 was nice and we stopped off to see the shark and moray eels caged area also. The shops were the type you had to bargain for but since I was there 4 other times I knew all the angles and made great deals for myself and others. I usually too 75% off of 1st pricing then added more items and got great deals for around 60% off of starting prices. I don't know where the other reviews said the drinks were watered down because ours were very strong and if you just got shots they would knock you quickly. A few times depending on what bar you went (as there were 7 bars) they did do a few virgin drinks but I think it was just mistakes as the bartenders were very busy at all times. I would definitely recommend anyone to check out the deals at IFA VILLAS VILLAGE RESORT if size is not important to you, although this 1 was not too small but easiel to get around. I f money is not of a concern to you they this would not be the place for you! Costed us total: insurance, taxes, and all inclusive of $875. for 1 week where the larger resorts would cost you $1200-$1400. per person at this time of year. Hope I helped all!
