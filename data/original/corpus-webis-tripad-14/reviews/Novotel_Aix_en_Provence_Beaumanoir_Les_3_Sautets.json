This is not a Hotel you would use to holiday in Aix. Free parking is good.

If you don't want to pay for breakfast (quite expensive) there is a good supermarket near by and there is an electric kettle and tea and coffee in the room. There are no restaurants close so you either go to the centre ville or eat at the hotel.
