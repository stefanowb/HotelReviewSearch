On check in, they gave us each a smalll bottle of water and htey had fresh cookies on the reception desk for guests. Great breakfast, with coffee, juice, eggs, sausage, waffles, bagels, danishs, toast, english muffins, cereal, oatmeal and fresh fruit.

We ended up at this hotel by recommendation from one of the locals, and it was more than we expected. Very neat and clean room, super comfortable bed, the staff was more that friendly, and the continental breakfast exceeded my expectations. A nice room with a king size bed, amenities such as mini kitchen, and even a pool, for under US$120.00 on a Saturday night, without previous reservations.", "title": "The best value in the area!", "user": "jgkvcruz", "date": "March 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 59183213}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We do a lot of skiing in the area, and I truly believe this will be our next home away from home in the heart of the white mountains.", "title": "Perfect place to stay for Storyland trip.", "user": "globetreck07", "date": "February 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 55658525}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Perfect place to stay when visiting Storyland or any North Conway attraction.
