It is still well maintained with a design and quality which again impressed us. We paid for a club level room which left us little dissapointed as the offer in the lounge was very very limited (comparing to Interconti or hyatt club levels which we can compare to), also luxury toilettries mentioned in the reservation confirmation (Hermes) were not provided and instead some basic and not appealing bliss products in the bathroom placed. I am mentioning it as these were the reasons to pay the extra for club here. Otherwise nothing to complain about. Maybe just question why they removed one of only two chandeliers in the main restaurant which results in very dark and obscure atmosphere in this place which is also without windows.", "title": "one of the best from sheraton chain", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "travelalot2", "date": "July 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35683203}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A very good hotel in Lisbon, Enjoyed our stay", "text": "We stayed here for 3 nights in late June 2009 (my wife and I).

The hotel is situated in the business district. Notwithstanding ,it is still very close to the famous Avenida de Liberdade. This is a long avenue lined with shops and some hotels. Here one finds Armani, Trussardi and other big fashion names. The dept. stores and malls are outside the city centre in Lisbon. These can be reached by taxi. A taxi ride of say 15 - 20 minutes is normally in the regon of 6 euro, which makes it the obvious choice to travel around the city. The hotel has two striking features: the corridors are quite dark and their walls are panelled with white galss, at first they seem rather dull but once you get used to them they are quite unique. Another feature is the restaurant at the very top floor. In the evening this is the palce from where to see all of lisbon as far as the ocean. Simply great, not just for the view but also for the excellent cuisine. Pricing is obviously a bit higher. If one is used to most european cities, Lisbon proves to be quite cheap. Very good restuarants serving typical Portughese food as well as other cuisines normally cost around 80euro for two persons having a full meal incl. starter,main course wine desert and coffee. Lisbon tends to have a hot climate. So the best way to see it is early morning, and after 4-5 pm. The evenings are pleasant. I would aslo fit in a day trip to Sintra, a mediveal city just a few km outside Lisbon, even this is accessibile by taxi. I would stay away from hiring a car. Driving tends to be rather rough, and chaotic. Beware of the taxi meters, some drivers tend to be cheeky and charge more than they should. A final good word must go to the concierges of the hotel. These were all very helpful when we needed their help. The doormen too were also always very prompt to call a taxi from just round the corner and expalin to the driver where we wished to go. English is normally understood in Lisbon. but having some knowledge of Italian helps. I would go back to both hotel and city maybe in the cooler months.", "title": "A modern classic hotel with excellent service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "myself-7", "date": "October 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 46069191}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Estremadura", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Lisbon"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 28, "average": 97, "very good": 348, "terrible": 15, "excellent": 450}, "aka": "Sheraton Lisboa Hotel And Spa", "slim_ranking": 0.177272727273, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.0}, "description": "Completely refurbished combining modern elegance and simple relaxing design, the hotel is located in one of the city's most prestigious business districts.
