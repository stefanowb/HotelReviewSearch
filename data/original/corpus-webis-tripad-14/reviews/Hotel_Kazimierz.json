It is in an ideal spot in the old Jewish Quarter so we could explore the area on foot. It is an easy journey by tram from the train station and, having arrived early in the morning, we were pleased we could leave our bags in a locked room and check in on our return. Our room was very spacious, being a triple, and the tea and coffee making facilities were very welcome. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The bathroom was fine, although it would have been useful to have some sort of shelf on which to store toiletries. There was a good choice, including hot food, for breakfast, although it would have been nice to have been offered fresh tea and coffee, rather than having to make your own (Nescafe Gold Blend) especially as the water was not particularly hot. The staff on reception were always very friendly and welcoming. On the last day, we asked if we could leave our bags as we were not leaving until late and this was no problem at all. Each bag had a tag on it and we had a card with the corresponding number to claim it on our return.
