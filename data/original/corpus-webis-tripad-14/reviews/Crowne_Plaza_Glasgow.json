A little in need of an upgrade, maybe, but probably a bit soon yet. Fantastic views, friendly staff who take the time to make sure you enjoy your Glasgow stay, spacious rooms, secure car parking (\u00a36 a day is a bit steep but this is Glasgow and you won't do much better) and close to town (a pleasant 25 minutes if you walk and a very cheap taxi ride if you don't). Our only gripe is the WiFi. If its good enough for a farmhouse in rural Inverness to give free WiFi, then its good enough for you, Glasgow. And at \u00a310 for 12 hours it would equate to \u00a3600 a month if that is what your normal ISP charged. Extortionate and unnecessary.

It was just such a perfect venue, the sun was shining when we arrived and the hotel was just fantastic. We were warmly greeted and also bid farewell to by Catherine and Marik on reception. The two girls were excellent and just could not do enough for you, they both had striking personalaties and are a absolute assest to this hotel. As they are probaly the first members of staff you encounter on arrival, they certainly set the standard. We ate in the restaurant both nights and the setting was lovely in the dining room as was the excellent food. Breakfast was something else, it was buffet style and had something for everyone, the food was fresh and hot, can honestly say one of the best buffet breakfasts I have had. We met a local couple who live just 6 miles from the hotel and they regularly stay there to enjoy an meal in the restaurant and the breakfast in the morning ( a good sign). We noticed a lot of airline pilots and crew, this is yet another good sign for high standards. Our room was extremly comfortable and spotlessly clean, it had a small fridge, air conditioning and the beds were very comfortable, we were overlooking the river on the 6th floor, which was very pleasant. Overall for the size of this hotel it has a most friendly atmostsphere and I would not hesiate to recommend it to anyone. It is conveniently located and we got a train into Central Station for \u00a31.30 and a taxi back for \u00a36. Overall I would rate it 11 out of 10, special thanks to Iwona Radkowska from food and beverages department who looked after us immensely during our stay, sorry for keeping you out of bed to the wee small hours.
