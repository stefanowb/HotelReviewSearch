If I return I will definetly find another hotel. The price however was not bad for what we received. At arrival no one helped us with our luggage, my mother had to push one of the carts to the front of the hotel to get our luggage from the car and than up the elevator to our third floor room. There were two staff members present, and not a lot of visitors in the lobby. Someone could have offered us some sort of help, we had just arrived from Quebec, and we had more than one suitcase. One benefit was the computer in the room this was a nice touch which I have never seen before. The t.v. was nice, and so was the modern feel of the room with a nice shower. It was clean, and the location was close to chinatown which is a nice place to visit and eat. The street this hotel is located on, is not great compared to other hotels close to more attractions. This hotel also does not have parking and our parking thing got messed up where we ended up paying more than we should have. The beds were hard, which some people I guess like, but way to hard for me. Close to Old Montreal, we were able to walk a few blocks and we were there. There was also a free breakfast which was conveniant. Our family first traveled to Quebec than Montreal, and this hotel does not compare to how nice our other hotel was. Just think in a few years, the computers and the tv will be outdated, and it may be hard to replace all of them, making this hotel older faster. Montreal is a nice city, and I think there are other better hotels out there. If your just traveling for business this is probably made better for that, than family traveling. the hotel also did not seem very busy in our stay, which I am not sure is a good/ bad thing.
