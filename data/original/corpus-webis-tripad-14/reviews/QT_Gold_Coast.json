After reading some of the reviews, my heart sank a little when we were told our room was on level 7 - I had read that many people were disappointed with the 'ocean view' from anything below level 9. I couldn't have been more wrong! The view was fabulous and completely unobstructed and the room was beautiful and spacious. We had the misfortune of visiting the Gold Coast during the storm surge from ex-cyclone Oswald but the comfort of the room and the friendly staff made it an enjoyable experience. There was some minor water ingress in our room from the balcony door and there was some leaking throughout the hotel but as a Queenslander I can appreciate that Surfers Paradise (and anything south of Rockhampton frankly) isn't built to withstand such extreme weather, so I can't really hold that against them. Buffett breakfast was absolutely incredible and I would highly recommend dinner at the Bazaar restaurant on at least one night of your stay. Wait staff are firnedly and helpful, food is devine and the atmosphere is electric - there was even a proposal a few tables over during our dinner! If you like a cheeky cocktail, light meal and some bubbles you must visit the Stingray bar - a true testament to it's service and value is the large number of locals who drink there. My only disappointment was that you had to pay for coffee in the room (mind you, it is a Nespresso machine not a kettle and instant coffee!) and that there was no milk supplied even if I had wanted to shell out $1.50 for a pod of coffee. In my opinion, better off walking downstairs and ordering a latte from the cafe.
