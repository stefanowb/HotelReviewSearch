I do like my privacy and it did not lock. Not cool if you're staying with kids who like to open the door when you're sitting on the stool or stepping out of the shower. However, I was fortunate to be child free this trip, and my girlfriends were absolutely respectful of my privacy, so it was fine - this time. I wouldn't come back with the kids though. I liked the sink and fridge in the outer room because it made pre-dinner cocktails easy peasy. Two separate rooms made it nice to keep the tv noise down when one of us was ready for bed.

The hotel is actually connected to and directly behind the Ritz Carlton, and the entrance on Iberville is almost hidden, as it's tucked away where the valet is located. It's less than 2 blocks from Bourbon Street, so you're very close to everything, but far enough away that it's quiet. One block (around the corner) from Canal, and the trolley. We parked our car at the hotel, and walked everywhere the entire time; it's that great of a location! Once you enter at ground level, there's an elevator that takes you to the second floor lobby, and then another short walk to the elevators that take you to the rooms. The entire hotel has been recently renovated, and it shows. It had more of an upscale boutique hotel feel than a typical Courtyard. The beautiful second floor lobby has a small caf\u00e9, as well as a Starbucks and the usual \"Market\" found at Marriott properties. Our room (1029) was a King Suite that had a nice size living room with a sofa and desk. There was an area separating the living/bedroom, that had a counter area with a small sink, coffee maker, and small refrigerator. Our bedroom was also large, well appointed, with a very comfortable king bed. The bathroom has a large shower and vanity area. Both the living and bedroom have 42\" flat screen tvs, and there are more than adequate outlets in both rooms for charging electronics. Room service is available through the Ritz Carlton, as well as spa services. Since we were here for 5 nights, another unexpected bonus was a guest laundry room right on our floor (not sure if other floors have laundry rooms) with 3 washers and 3 dryers. $1 wash / $1 dry (bring quarters) The only thing missing was a table for folding.

The carpeting is plush and the decor is very modern. Have I mentioned that the staff is remarkable? Everyone who worked there greeted us with a smile and offered to help us in any way we needed. The location is very close to the \"staples\" of New Orleans (Bourbon, Cafe DuMonde, shops, great food, etc). The only downside was the cost of parking which was $37 dollars per night.

We were content with the gym which consisted of 2 treadmills, an elliptical, bike, excercise balls and free weights. The room was immaculate and more than we could've hoped for.
