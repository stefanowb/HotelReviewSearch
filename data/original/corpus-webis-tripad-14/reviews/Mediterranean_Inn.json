{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 774, "name": "Mediterranean Inn", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Forget Overpriced Downtown Seattle Hotels", "text": "I stayed here for 4 nights and I loved this little hotel. The room was clean and there was a kitchenette. The staff was very helpful, they kept our luggage for us because we got there way before the check in time. They put tags on our luggage and placed them in the back room. There were 2 computers w/ internet on the lobby, a gym and not to mention the starbucks downstairs. The bus stops are a block away which takes you to Downtown Seattle and Pioneer Square for $1.25 and it runs late. Downtown Seattle also has a ride free zone so you can pretty much go around Downtown Seattle for free and you don't have to worry about parking. There are a couple of good places to eat and shop near the hotel - check out Pagliacci's (awesome salad) and Underdawg Records (awesome music collection & the owner was very friendly and helpful). The Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science Center, Children's Museum) is about 2 blocks away. There's a Safeway and a 24 hour neighborhood grocery store around the corner. Do not miss the rooftop deck - it has an awesome view of Downtown Seattle, Queen Anne Hill, Elliot Bay & the Space Needle. You can also walk if you're comfortable walking about a mile or more. We walked from the Bellmont District to our hotel and it was not that bad. To get to and from the airport, call the hotel for a car service (Mr. Maru $35.00) - if you take a cab, it will cost you the same, if not more. The car was roomy and clean, and he avoided the traffic by going on the side streets - imagine if you're taking a cab and how much this would have cost you. The driver was very friendly and very professional. If you must take a cab - take the yellow or orange cabs. I will definitely stay here again and will recommend this hotel to anyone.", "user": "audzky", "date": "October 21, 2006", "id": 5979852}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great value, great location.", "text": "I found the Mediterranean Inn on Trip Advisor and stayed there in the spring of 05. I was there in August of this year and was once again very happy with the hotel. As others have mentioned the Queen Anne area is terrific. Lots of good restaurants close by like the Melting Pot and the Five Spot Diner. We drove into downtown but you could easily take the transit just a block away. It's a nice comfortable area to come home to. The hotel itself is basic and you definitely need to request AC if you want it as all rooms don't have it. The bathrooms are small but livable. The rooftop deck is outstanding. I could have spent a day there just reading and ejoying the view.

The hotel decor was fine (nothing special and nothing mediterranean about it, a bit dated) and everything was clean. Rooftop view was amazing, free bottled water in the room was great, free internet in the lobby also was helpful.

It was a large room on a corner with French doors that opened. Lack of air conditioning was not a problem at Thanksgiving and the noise didn't bother us either despite being on a busy intersection. Summer with open windows might be a different story. Fridge and micro were an unexpected bonus.
