Nice spacious room - classic bedroom. 10 minutes walk to all major facilities and the beach. We ended up staying longer in the hotel than we had even intended. Free web access for residents. We had a street room and small balcony which was a huge addition - no major noise complaints. 3 small negatives - extra minor tax cost added per couple on checking out which we were not aware of, we had to wait up to 10 minutes on 2 nights for the night porter to arrive and let us in and the last - dont consider having any kind of drink from their little hotel bar unless money is no problem!", "title": "Made our holiday", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "irishparty", "date": "July 25, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3699479}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Great place though and would go back in the morning.", "title": "Like a Breath of Fresh Air", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Go Travel Europe", "date": "July 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3664489}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great small hotel", "text": "(my comments on Nice though not as positive - see other section on this website)", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "Carefree_AzJuliew", "date": "July 7, 2005", "id": 3646153}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very Good Hotel", "text": "What a darling little hotel!

The Grimaldi cost a little more but was excellent value for money. We had a double room with french doors for 150euros.

Helpful bonuses were the free internet in a room near the breakfast room and the complimentary water in the mini bar for our arrival. The staff were friendly and provided a map and advice upon our arrival. Breakfast was 10 euro extra per person, although it was probably worth it to get us going for the day (cereal, fruit, yoghurt, egg, toast, pastries, juices, tea, coffee etc).
