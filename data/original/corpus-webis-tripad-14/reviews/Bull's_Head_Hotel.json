The room was smaller than I expected. It was supposed to be a double room but 2 beds had in fact been put together, there is advertised a trouser press in the room but when I asked the receptionist she said it's not guaranteed and most Hotels have single beds that they put together so the room can be used for twin or double. First time I have ever known that. The breakfast was excellent and the bar staff were exceptional. The receptionist who was on when we arrived was very helpful, showed us to our room and told us where everything was. The receptionist when we left could learn a few things from her, especially her attitude. We travelled from New Zealand. We chose this Hotel as I lived nearby as a youngster and it was always a good place to go for a drink. The cleaners seem to clean where they see. We put our suitcase on top of the wardrobe and when we got it down it was filthy as was the TV stand. They had obviously been doing some sort of repairs and had painted over it and left the room in 2 different colors. The bathroom door had a glass window so there was no privacy when going to the toilet.

Room excellent, even had two TV`s, spotlessly clean and comfy spacious bed, lovely complimentary toiletries. Great garden with comfy sofa`s and benches.
