Small restaurant literally next door to hotel open evenings from 5pm only but food very enjoyable and reasonable. Fairly large supermarket at one end of street good for stocking up as able to store items in hotel room mini bar. Initial contact with hotel via email and they were most helpful. On arrival a member of grou[p was unwell and reception staff with very nice and helped us any way they could. I travelled as 3 friends and were given 1 single room and 2 doubles for single use. Single room was small but spotlessley clean as was whole hotel. Doubles were extremely spacious and all equiped with mini bar, free safe, ample storage, tv, bath/shower, toiletries. For 3* in Rome very good. Only slight issue was single room toilet would not flush but maid got it working and showed us this but next day wouldn't work again! Breakfast fairly simple continental with cereals, fruit, yoghurts, bread/rolls, juice/tea/coffee, pastries and processed cheeses (no meats) but very nice and well stocked all morning (7am-10am). Hotel has free internet access, free tea/coffee all day in reception, lift but no bar and no problem to leave suitcases on check in/out day. Also small toilet area used to get changed in before late transfer back to airport. Altogether very good hotel, pleasant area, helpful staff and spotless! Very good rates available through bookassist.com (approx 60/65 euro per room per night) with small deposit payable on booking and balance direct to hotel at end of stay. Also good late deals on hotels own website.
