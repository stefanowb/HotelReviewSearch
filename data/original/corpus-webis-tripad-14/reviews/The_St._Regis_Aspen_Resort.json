Pleasantly met at the airport; quickly shuttled to the attractive hotel; an enjoyable bar snack in the chef\u2019s table restaurant after our long transatlantic flight; and a speedy extensive buffet breakfast the next morning not to mention the splendid Aspen Sports shop attached to the hotel. Unfortunately, with the honourable exceptions of Aspen Sports (who were consistently excellent) and the junior hotel staff who were exceptionally friendly and helpful, everything went downhill fast. Apparently $45M has been spent on the recent refurbishment and my news for the unfortunate investors is that most of this money has been utterly wasted. Whilst the rooms are reasonably sized and stylish they do not meet the needs of their guests. Cupboard space is fine for a short-stay executive but inadequate if you have ski clothes to hang up (and isn\u2019t that supposed to be a major market in Aspen?). A dopey designer might consider the room lighting to be chic and a triumph of subdued style but because there are so few lights (with peculiar and pointless switches) and none overhead it is impossible to read anything. The air conditioning is a masterstroke of stupidity. The thermostat is located 10 cm above the (single) air outlet. Thus, on one side of the air outlet, the bathroom is 15 degrees colder whilst, on the other side, the sleeping area is 10 degrees cooler. Stand near the windows (e.g. to read something) and it is 15 degrees colder. The engineer told us to set it 12 degrees higher than we wanted it. The bed, poor thing, singlehandedly attempts to redress the designed-in dreadful balance of style versus substance. It is one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. Hurrah! Unfortunately, should you visit the bathroom in the middle of the night (the lights will of course turn themselves on and absolutely refuse to turn off for some considerable time) you will bang your shin on the sharp corner of the leather covered bed base. Naturally, the style-conscious part of your brain will consider a bleeding shin a small price to pay for such finely stitched leather and beautiful sticking-out corners\u2026 Or perhaps not. You may want to sit on the sofa (what for? You can\u2019t read a book there), but whilst the cushion colours and patterns may be gorgeous, they are clearly meant to be looked at and not used because they are uncomfortable. Unhappily, our junior suite was limited to a single armchair so one of us was reduced to flopping about on the sofa anyway. Stylish but unfit for purpose.", "title": "Stylish. Unfit for purpose.
