On closer inspection though there were a few nagging annoyances that i feel could be improved at little cost. To begin with the beds were rock hard which played havoc on my ageing back. The dressing table had an annoying slope on it which irritated my girlfriend as things has a habit of sliding off!. The shower was similar to the type you get in Greece with a hand held shower and a partially covered shower curtain. This resulted in water getting everywhere in the bathroom that only dissipated when it was drained off. The AC was adeqaute on the whole but took ages to cool the room down to a sleepable temperature.

I totally fell in love with the place and Solvenia in general. The people are warm and friendly and should be very proud of the city and country as a whole. While it lacks traditional tourist sights the city wins with it's fairy tale looks and general joie de vivre and magical charm.
