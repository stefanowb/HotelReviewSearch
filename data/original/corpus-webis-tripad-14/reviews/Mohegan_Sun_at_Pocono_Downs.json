The hotel has only been open for about 6 weeks and check-in is at 4 pm. The room was very nice, with a good TV, modern bathroom, and an iPad in the room. Yes, the bed was high, but comfortable. The casino was easy to navigate and there are many restaurants to choose from. We ate at their Timber Buffet (closes at 8pm on weekdays) and it was just \"OK\", not worth the $18 per adult. Coffee/tea/etc. are available at one restaurant that opens at 7 am if you don't want to use the coffee maker in the room.", "title": "Great price-so we stayed!", "user": "Chris3051", "date": "December 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 189171066}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for three nights starting the day after Christmas. It is a nice new hotel. There is nothing fancy about the place but it is clean and the rooms are decent. We had a king deluxe room with a fairly large bathroom. For those of you who like bathtubs, take note, there aren't any available in the hotel. The shower is large with tile and heavy glass doors. It takes a long time for the hot water to reach the rooms on the upper floors. There are no mini fridges or microwaves in the room. There is a large safe in the closet. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We did, however, have an issue with housekeeping. Two days we left our room at 9:00 a.m. and returned at 4:00 p.m. to find the room still unmade. We asked one of the housekeepers in the hallway if she would please make up our room. She was very pleasant and did clean right away. In the rush, items like coffee, soap, etc. were not replenished. There is a large gap under the main door to the hallway and it can be very noisy in the hallway if people are talking late at night. Even though there were a few issues, we did enjoy our stay.", "title": "Nice New Hotel with a few issues", "user": "gusmmp", "date": "December 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 189122445}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed over night after a Christmas Party at a casino restaurant. It was nice to be able to enjoy ourselves and know that we just had a short walk in doors to the room. We got a great rate $99. Room was nice with a king bed. Very big closet and nice bathroom. Shower is large and walk in with totally see through glass door :( The bathroom door also has a beveled glass door. Someone outside of bathroom can clearly see that there is a naked person in the shower. Was not a fan of the bathroom situation. There was not an I pad in our room as stated online.", "title": "Over night stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "familyof5mttop", "date": "December 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188572967}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "For being a new hotel that just opened the service and cleanliness leave something to be desired. The service is still working out the bugs with their system. No detailed invoice, and receipts written on a piece of paper signed by whomever is at guest services. The two elevators smell of either smoke and or alcohol, and one elevator already has a crack in the mirror. Both elevators have very noticeable scratches in them. The hallway and decor of the hotel is nice, but dark. The room is small and doesn't provide you very much room for more than 2 people with an overnight bag. The bed is very high up, and for a person who is 5\"7 made it a challenge to get in and out. Also they only provide two pillows for a king size bed, requested additional pillows by calling room service. The phone that is in the room is difficult to use and I am a techy person. I think they should take out the advanced technology in the room and apply to the reservations. I received several emails before my actual stay of my reservation being cancelled, even though i received emails it wasn't. I called the night before to verify I still had a reservation. Good luck when you arrive and they want to bill your card a \"incidentals\" charge that ranges from $100-$250.00. The bathroom door is basically see through with a beveled glass. You can hear conversations in other rooms, in the hallway, and when the other doors close. The room cleanliness has noticeable dust on lamp shades, mirrors have streaks, dust and fingerprint smudges. We even have a spot on the linens that was questionable. They charge you an $8.95 resort fee, which for me was $7.95 providing you high speed internet, fitness center (that wasn't open yet), swimming pool access (that's wasn't open yet), in-room coffee with Cuisinart coffee maker, 2 bottles of water, local calls and toll free calls. If services aren't available due to construction then someone should update the website. Being told we might have them open by January 15 isn't very promising. Wasn't really sure if I could use the bottled water in the room, and also the water is under a shelf in the bathroom, not sure why they don't place it by the coffee pot. The vending machine costs of $3.00 are high for a small bottle of soda, considering you can get a free soda at the casino. The shower was nice, and warm, however I would prefer a bath tub to relax when I am getting away. Not sure I will come back to stay at this hotel, considering the high caliber of Mohegan Sun this was a disgrace to their name.", "title": "Disgrace to Mohegan Sun", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "jill7212", "date": "December 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 188497346}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Reservation and front desk check-in is extremely slow.
