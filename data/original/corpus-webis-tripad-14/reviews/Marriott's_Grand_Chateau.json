We were there for a week and had a great time. The rooms are clean and beautiful the beds are so comfortable. We had a high floor room in Tower 1 with a view of the strip and City Center. There is a small store in the lobby but no restaurants. Because we wanted to use the mini kitchen in our studio we took advantage of the free shuttle to the grocery store the morning after we arrived. It runs 2-3 mornings a week starting at 9:00 a.m. and every 1/2 hour until 10:30. After that the shuttle will take you to the Fashion Show Mall - every half hour through about 7 p.m. It's free. We ate all breakfasts in our room and lunches by the pool. The pool and hot tub - bar area is rooftop and rather small. Drink specials weren't available every day which seemed odd. How can you have Bud drafts on special with no Bud? The pool - small as it was did accomodate all of the guests the week we were there. The bartender was not personable and drinks were a bit pricey. We enjoyed our walks south to MGM, over to City Center and then north on the strip to shows at the Mirage and Palazzo. It's about a block to the strip and with the property at the \"50 yard line\" it was an excellent location for us. Our big find was the entrance off Harmon to the Planet Hollywood mall and casino. There are about 10 faded ugly blue doors facing Harmon that open up to the most fabulous shopping and dining experiece. Not only is it a great mall with nice restaurants and bars - but you cut the corner to the strip. Overall - our stay was wonderful - a beautiful room and excellent location.

The lobby was beautiful and checking in was a breeze. We tried the famous cucumber water in the lobby and liked it so much, we are going to try to make it for our 1st BBQ of the season. Every detail of this resort was impressive. We got one of the one bedroom suites and it was just what the pictures showed. The bed was very comfortable and the nearby large garden tub was the first thing my wife wanted to try out. The double headed shower was awesome! We had a full kitchen fully stocked with any utensil or cookware you could ever need. Flat screen TV's in the living room and bedroom made it hard to leave. On the 38th floor is where we got the best view of Vegas...on the sky...especially at night. The location of the resort was perfect, right off the strip but close enough to get to everything you needed to by foot.

Lauderdale for a 1br at the Grand Chateau and were quite pleased. Well appointed and decorated. Kitchen and bathroom were roomy, and with quality appliances and fixtures. Check in and check out was a breeze, and the staff was very helpful...especially when I pulled the dumb guy move and forgot it was Valentines day...(...we were in Vegas after all...all the days run together). Anyway, Paul...I think that was his name...at the concierge jumped through hoops to help me out...I mean, save my butt! As most reviewers have said the location is ideal. 1 block off the strip, which definately cuts down on the noise. (see my photos) Also, all the other reviews were very helpful regarding groceries, etc...so I won't rehash all that. We were in town for a photogaraphy conference which was being held at the MGM and it was maybe a 10 minute walk to get there. Bally's is about 15 minute walk...the show at the Jubilee Theater is a must...traditional Vegas! During our stay I'd estimate occupancy was only about 30% so it was very quiet. The weather was cold 35 -45 degrees, and windy with occasional showers. Pretty crummy weather, but the bar on the roof was open a few hours during the day...the bartenders weren't happy to be there...can't blame 'em I guess, I hate cold weather too! I just ordered more cocktails and enjoyed the view...the view from the rooftop is incredible! Great for photos! Again, as most reviewers have said the pool is small...there weren't many people in while we were there and I certainly wasn't going to venture in..although it is heated. I'll include a good picture of the rooftop. I really only have one suggestion...don't use the ice in the freezer's automatic ice maker. Dump it out in the sink, wash the bin, and use the public ice machine...on our floor it was right by the elevators. I live in Costa Rica and think I've got an iron stomach...but it wasn't enough to combat the water in Las Vegas. All in all, as I said at the top we were quite pleased, and when we get back to Vegas we'll be staying at the Chateau.", "title": "Comfort, location & privacy", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "John P", "date": "February 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25114344}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "First off, this property is a Marriott Timeshare so dont expect full service amenities such as a restaurant, room service, etc. However this property does offer complimentary valet and bell service and has a small marketplace with goodies and Starbucks coffee and Concierges to help you with your vacation activities.", "title": "Time Share with Great Location and Service", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "alexsndiego", "date": "February 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 24791326}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a guest unit/studio.
