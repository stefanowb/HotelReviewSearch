We booked a last minute package with Sandals and were excited by the carefully crafted website of the resort. We arrived amid some confusion as to which side of the resort we were supposed to be on. One employee said he would take care of us. He went off and we never saw him again. 15 minutes later, another employee asked if we were being helped and we said yes, but not very well. She jumped in and found our reservation and got us to our room. When we got to our room, the keys did not work without significant struggle. Later a lock smith came, worked on the lock, getting it as workable as he could, then he showed us how we had to manipulate the lock to get it to work. Not a good sign. We then tried to sign up for internet, which was not included in this \"all inclusive\" resort. After several attempts, I was instructed by the computer to contact the front desk. I did so 3 times, but they were not able to help except to say that a technician would call me. When I asked when, she did not answer, saying only that she would call the technician now. We waited about 20 minutes but got no call. Note, later that night, we finally were able to sign in and purchase a weeks worth of internet for about $43. Very hungry we left for dinner. We went to Valentinos, a place with a dress code. Serving Italian fare, they do not offer you grated cheese for your soup salad or pasta unless you ask for it. Dinner took over an hour to come out, despite a very narrow selection of items to choose from. We had advised an employee that we were going to leave for a buffet layout because we were too hungry to wait any longer when our food was finally brought out. We ate and the food was ok. The fettucini Alfredo was bland, no trace of garlic detected and of course, I had to ask for grated cheese. With the cheese, it had some flavor. We ate and left for another place to have dessert. Before we entered the Arizona Grill, I asked an employee if they would be able to get me a cognac or port from the bar to have with my dessert or should i go to the bar and get it myself (I had seen Remy Martin at the bar earlier) She asked us to sit down and she said she would find out. She returned to say that they had no more cognac or port. She offered me their house merlot and I said ok. My dessert came out, but my wine did not arrive until i was nearly finished my desert. This i learned was typical. The next morning I went to the buffet breakfast. I had to pick from the crumbs of bacon that remained even though breakfast was still going for another 90 minutes. Perhaps I had stumbled on a rare instance where the staff was caught by a surprise rush? No. The next day at lunch, a Caribbean Beach Party Buffet, the salad dressing had run dry. No attention to customer needs here. Allowing food items to run dry at an all inclusive is simply a sign of stinginess. The second night at dinner, we ate at the Reef Terrace. An employee took our order for drinks - Ice Tea and Merlot. We never saw him again. We had to place a second order for Ice Tea and Merlot. This time we got the Merlot, two glasses which I took knowing that getting a second glass the night before was a challenge. We again asked for Ice Tea. The third time was the charm, my wife finally getting the ice tea. We ordered. I asked if I could have soup instead of an appetizer and also have a greek salad. No problem. My wife ordered an appetizer of shrimp. The waiter brought out two shrimp appetizers. I reminded him that this is not what I ordered. He returned with the greek salad but I never did get my soup. Mixed drinks are made up of well brand liquors and most bartenders give a very light pour at that. The exception was at the Manor's swim up bar. I paid a visit to the sing along piano bar and was amazed at how the piano player waived off every request from the song book made by the guests, calling out songs that he insisted were more fun. Finally, after the guests stood firm at the end of the night, he played part of a requested song. We rode into the resort with a couple that was on their honeymoon and had booked a two week stay. The next day, the bride said she was so disappointed with the experience. We felt bad for her. On the brighter side, Jamaica has warm weather and if you go to the well enough, you will get your drinks. Compared to our truly all inclusive experience at Super Clubs in Negril, this was very poor. As I write this we are half way through our stay. We are making the best of it and I am truly grateful not to be in Afghanistan where drinks are not available and vigilance against suicide bombers is always required.", "user": "JerryC1775", "date": "March 23, 2011", "id": 101283513}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Trip was amazing!

I anxiously checked weather forcasts to see what we were in for unfortunately looked like rain. When we got there booking a seven day trip this time I found that weather forcasts are not real reliable as it rained for about ten minutes one day and was beautiful every other day. When we arrived we were greated with cool towels and taken into the concierge lounge to complete checkin and given champange which was quite delicious. My wife and I enjoyed a concierge villa suite with a shared private pool (2-4 villa suites per pool) on both trips (the first time this was a offered upgrade after recieving a call from Sandals for quite a good discount). If you want to truely relax this is the way to do it. We would start each day waking whenever drinking very good blue mountain coffee we would make ourselves provided in our suites kitchenette. We sat outside on our private balcony overlooking our pool and the beautiful tropical gardens the ocean easily visible in the background enjoying the breathtaking views. We split our time by booking a few excursions which were enjoyable similar to the quality you find with cruise ship excursions. The other days we spent at the resort relaxing at our suite, watching sports at the manor bar, in the villa pool, having cocktails from our in room bar (vodka, gin, rum, whiskey, wine, champange) or a carib beer from the fridge which was restocked daily with soda, beer, juices all included. We spent time just exploring the vast grounds which Sandals takes great care of, spent time at the main manor pool, swim up bar and pool on the Riviera side, sitting on the beach and taking a cooling dip in the ocean. We usually relaxed trough breakfast time only making the buffet style breakfast service once which was as good as breakfast buffets get. For lunch we usually ate at one of the grills either at the beach or the manor pool. We found nightly entertainment and great dining again similar to cruise ship dining only with more choices of restaurants, we enjoyed a 5 course dinner nightly with the exception of the evenings we dined buffet style and always topped off with coffee and desert. After days in the sun, we usually retired to the suite a bit earlier than say what you would in vegas we would take a dip in the pool, hang out with the couple from the next suite and go to bed only to look forward to the next day. We hated to leave Jamaica and apparantly they wanted to keep us too as our plane was very late and missed our connection back in the US ending up with an extra day off work, yeah.... can't want to \"Soon come back\".", "title": "Anniversary vacation to Sandals Grande Riveria in Ocho Rios, Jamaica", "user": "chrishawn416", "date": "April 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 106094033}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Very friendly and sincere staff, everything was nearby or there was a shuttle.

It was the wrong room. We called down and explained. She apologized and said there weren't anymore rooms to put us in for the night but would put us in the right room the next day. So we were alright with that. Got in our new room after 1:30pm that next day. Room was very nice with a balcony, table and chairs with a view of the ocean. It was magnificent! After first night in room, realized bed was broke, called maintenance that next morning and they came and fixed that day. A couple days later we came back to room and air conditioner had leaked all over floor. Again, called maintenance and they fixed that day. Room was very clean and our housekeeper constantly kept clean towels and wash cloths in our room. Bed made daily and turn down service nightly. The resort is beautiful and well maintained. Staff are all very friendly and always helpful. Alcoholic Drinks are a little weak, but that was fine with us since we're not big drinkers so we didn't end up drunk. You could ask for them to be stronger though. Service at some of the restaurants were slow..sometimes very slow. The best restaurants there in our opinion was, Valentino's, Kimono's and The Reef Terrace. Service was superb and food was excellent!!!!! Neptune's was by far the worst service. Dinner took 2 hours because they were so slow. Some of the food tasted old and was cold. They even were out of certain foods and you had to pick something else. The pools were great!! Swim up bars were awesome! One pool was really dirty though with leaves and sand. Hadn't been cleaned in awhile. Lots of cool activities going on. Water sports were fun. Excursions were awesome! The Catamaran to Dunn River Fall's was a blast! The staff on the Catamaran were top notch! The falls were alot of fun. We also went on tubing and zip line combo excursion. It was so much fun too. Staff were top notch again. On the excursion's, the tour guides expect you to tip if trip was good for you. Also bus from airport to resort expect you to tip. Same thing on way from resort to airport and also for bringing your luggage in. Excursion bus drivers expect a tip also. Otherwise you don't tip anywhere else. We really had a great time and was sad to see it end. There were a few things we were disappointed about, but overall we were very happy with trip.
