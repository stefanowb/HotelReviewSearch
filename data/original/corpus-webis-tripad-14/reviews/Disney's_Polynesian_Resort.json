I found this out on a Disney bus from another family that were not informed of their grand gathering privs as well. We were also never called before arriving to book services or make reservations.

Nice place to get a quick bit to eat in the morning before you hit the parks and a great all-you-can-eat Hawaiian restaurant as well (need reservations). There is a character breakfast here as well- the food is average but the kids love meeting the characters.

The transportation to Magic Kingdom is very good because you can take the monorail over, and you are also close to the transportation center for buses and other monorail service. Our room appeared to be newly refurbished which was nice. Did not do the dinner luau here but didn't hear great reviews about it anyway.
