The property is beautiful, the room was very nice, clean, roomy, and very comfortable. Room service was quick. Having breakfast on our room's patio overlooking the pool and the ocean was fantastic. We enjoyed leaving the sliding glass patio door open a bit at night to hear the waves crashing all night. The service was great too. The drinks were weak, unless you specifically asked for a strong one. The little nightclub was pretty lame. Each evening they leave in your room a list of the following day's activities. I was looking forward to a tennis clinic one morning, and I showed up right on time. Unfortunately no one from the resort showed up. After a while I met another guest and we played tennis (rackets and balls available at front desk) but it was a little disappointing that nobody from the resort ever showed up. The same thing happened one morning for their organized beach walk. No one from the resort showed up. Maybe it was because there were not a lot of guests while we were there. But if that's the case, the resort should not publish that they're going to have these activities. Also- their website shows \"beach party\" as one of the activities. In 4 nights, there was no beach party. They did have a nice Mexican variety show one night, and an interesting dance show another night, and outdoor movies each night on a large inflatable screen near the pool.", "title": "Rena C.

The only small things that could be improved are the quality of food and the cleanliness of the pools. The food is fine....but it's just that. It's completely what you would expect from an all-inclusive resort and the variety is impressive. The Japanese restaurant (Himatsu) is definitely the best place to eat dinner. Breakfast is generally pretty good (buffet). Lunch....so/so. Both Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo are about 15-20 minutes by van. It's worth going into these towns to check out the local flavor. The weather at the end of November is basically perfect. Mid-80's, sunny, breezy, and no humidity! You will want to reserve your pool seats VERY early (even though they say not to do this...do it or you won't get a seat). The sun sets fairly early this time of year, so make the most of the daylight. Personally, I would tip the housekeeper $3-$5 daily and that seemed to make quite a difference in how fast the room was cleaned. I also would tip $1 to the poolside bartender every time I ordered a drink. In addition to this, I would tip $2-$3 at dinner in the evenings. That's about it. I never spoke to the timeshare people....or rather they never spoke to me. They will hassle you at the airport (like the review written before me). You will WANT to believe them...they will say things like, \"you are going the wrong way.\" Do NOT believe anyone after the security checkpoint until you can actually see blue sky. Apparently, the timeshare people are allowed in this area, but our personal resort transportation people are not. If you are traveling with Apple, Am Ex, Funjet, etc...your \"person\" is OUTSIDE....DO NOT STOP FOR ANYTHING. They will even get very close and into your personal space.

This was a great touch and went over big with our kids. The room was 516, a suite, which had an incredible view. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was nicely updated with marble and granite. The food was good, not five star, but definately very good. Our son is a very picky eater, he loves Calamari, which is only served at Portofino;s, the italian restaurant, but they would get it brought over to El Patio everytime we asked. The buffets had a nice selection and kid friendly choices as well. The Seaside grill has a good lunch. The pool was beautiful, and the wait staff is excellent. We tipped all servers, and they were very appreciative. Overall the service was excellent, right down to the nightly turn down service with chocolates. A big plus at this resort is the 24 hour room service, which is quick, the food was always hot, and the ice cream was always cold. We asked how much to tip on room service and were advised 1 or 2 dollars each time. The entertainment crew is energetic and we highly recommend the snorkelling tour the hotel provides with them to a beach nearby for $20. The theme nights were great, we had a ball at pirate night, karaoke night, the tailgaters party, and don't miss the managers cocktail party with a raffle, we got a two for one dolphin swim through the tour desk. The beach is beautiful, but a bit rocky, and not swimmable, the entertainment crew has a beach walk and swim pretty much everyday that you can walk down to a nearby beach is you so desire. The service at this hotel, besides the beauty of the setting and grounds would definately bring us back again. The hotel also has a sea turtle program where guests can release newly hatched sea turtles into the sea, make sure to tell the concierge to notify you when they hatch. They also have bungee jumping everyday, which also went over big with our kids. Plan to get up early, people reserve pool chairs as early as sunrise! There was never a wait at any restaurant.Avoid the timeshare people at the airport, they try to make you think they are your transportation, just keep walking. One note, cabs to the two towns can get expensive, (25 plus each way), so try to use the hotel's shuttle, 12 each way, and keep in mind, the shuttle stops between 1 and 4 pm, which for us, was usually the time we went into town, LOL!

We had been on a plane all day and had our 2 year old with us. We just wanted to get to our room and relax. When we said no for the 10th time we were finally allowed to go to our room. Our luggage never showed up. We then received a call describing our luggage and asked if it was ours. Finally an hour later our luggage came. Our \"ocean front\" room was blocked with palm trees. We could hear the ocean which was nice but all we saw were tree shrubs and we were on the 5th floor. We ventured out to get a drink and eat and this was hard. The only bar open was the one in the lobby which had a long line. So we went to find food which the restaurants were all closed except 2 of them. One the guy told us it would be an hour wait and the other was a buffet that had been out all night. So we waited an hour and then waited another hour for our food. After our first night things did get better. Over all the food is good for an all inclusive. The bottled water was a bit hard to get. They could not grasp the fact that we drank a lot of water and were rude every time we tried to get more.

Anyways I had stripped the bed and told the cleaning lady and everything seemed fine until the day before we left when they tried to tell me I owe $90 for a special cleaning that they had to do to the mattress. I was trying to tell them there must have been a misunderstanding but they said the charge is already there and they can't take it off. I questioned when they did this special cleaning because we were never gone from our room very long, they did not have an answer. So we paid $400/night plus $60 to use the internet plus $200 in tips and they had the nerve to come up with a bogus charge like this!!!! Besides the first night, the difficulty getting bottled water, the NO view of the ocean, and the bogus charge for a mattress cleaning it was a nice resort. Oh and the resort coupons are a joke.
