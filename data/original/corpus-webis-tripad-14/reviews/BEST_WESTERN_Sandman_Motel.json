The Sandman turned out to be (overall) nicer than I'd been fearing. Staff was very pleasant, room was in good shape, etc. Very quiet, even for being right by I-5.

Sacramento is about the only city I've been to with a \"minimum taxi fare\" of $10 (eek!) when the engine starts; on average, the Sandman ran a couple bucks under that on the meter so those cabbies got pretty generous differentials. But, I knew the location before I arrived. Here are the two main \"negatives\" I found: 1) the breakfast was pretty poor (lousy coffee - in-room was as good, if not better; juice; cereal; toast; tasteless pastries/muffins) and the tiny breakfast room seemed mobbed my second day with 8 diners. 2) The \"hot\" water barely got above warm; no danger of scalding if one stands under hot-tap-only for a shower.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 16, 2003", "id": 1341843}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Location was great for our needs.", "text": "For under $70/night, it was still a better deal than the comparable in-town places for nearly double my rate (and no shuttle!).
