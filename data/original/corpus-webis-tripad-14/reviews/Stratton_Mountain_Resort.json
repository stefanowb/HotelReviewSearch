The gondola at Stratton wasnt running yet, and the stores were closed.. ghost town! But, the long trail house is a beautiful place, underground garage, very easy to get to, and the room we had was clean and spatious. The pool and hot tub are showing their age.

We stayed in the Long Trail house in a one bedroom condo. The room was clean and well equipped. The facility was beautiful and staff helpful and friendly. The location was only a five minute walk to the slopes through the village. A free ski locker was provided in the condo bldg but we opted to pay to leave our skiis slopeside overnight. Although the underground parking lot was nearly full, we never felt that the resort was crowded. We rarely had to wait in a lift line and when we did the staff kept everyone organized and moving. The slopes were in great shape for this late in the season. Our ten year old son declared that he would rather go back to Stratton next year instead of our usual Spring break trip to Disney World.

Check-in went smoothly and we parked in the heated indoor garage which is really convenient and attached to the hotel. You never have to clean off your car and we kept our skis there at night. We stayed in a studio room which was perfect for our needs. The kitchenette was great, although I would recommend bringing your own groceries because the small grocery store in the village is very overpriced. It was very cozy and nicely decorated with an updated but rustic feel.
