It was quiet. We visited on the occasion of an event at Cornell University, but it was not a busy time of year (late September). We had a room with two queen beds, and a separate \"living room\". Each had a telephone and a modern flat screen TV. The room had wireless (or wired) and it worked just fine. The air conditioner has a setting that allows the fan to remain on independent of the cooling, which helps to maintain the background sound at a constant level. A large bottle of water was provided with the room at no extra charge. There was a ironing board and an iron in the closet, a small refrigerator, a microwave and a good clock.

The endless supply of cookies and coffee in the lobby was great, but given that it was free, they were always running out. It's very new and clean inside. The pool and jacuzzi are small but nice. I can't picture a huge crowd decending upon the hotel anyway so maybe it's the right size. Tip - get to breakfast before 8 AM, because it's complimentary and being good-to-very good food, things run out quick and the staff is scrambling to refill everything. I felt bad for the hotel staff but they worked hard trying to keep up. The only criticism I would have is with the room design (kind of late to change that, unfortunately): the sink and mirror really need to outside the bath & toilet area, as with 4 people in the room things would have gone faster with the separation.

The clerk greeted me by name and I had my key and was on my way to my room in under 5 minutes. The lobby was very bright and clean as was the area out in front of the hotel. The room was fine and it was clean. I did find the walls were pretty thin as I could hear people in the morning but it didn't bother us. We went to the breakfast with about 10 minutes remaining and they were out of eggs. We didn't mind as there was a waffle maker available and plenty of bagels, cereal and fresh fruit still out.
