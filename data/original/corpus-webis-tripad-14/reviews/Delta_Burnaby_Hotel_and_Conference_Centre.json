The rooms are very comfortable as are most of the Delta, and very quiet. The bed is so wonderful, I have asked for and received the details so I can get one myself. You can upgrade to the Signature floors (the top 2) and it includes appies from 4-7 with an honor bar (very good appies) and continental breakfast in the morning, with juice, great coffees, boiled eggs, cereals, cheese, muffins, toast, etc., plus newspapers and an excellent view of the city.

Easy to get to by car (Take the TransCan via 15th Ave at Pacific Crossing in Blaine at the border---not the Peace Arch Crossing---if you're coming from the US: Google's default route is shorter but harder to folllow). Clean. Windows that open. A decent ATM in the casino (but bank ATMs are still cheaper to convert US dollars). Excellent service: We needed a few amenities like a corkscrew, and there was no problem. OK gym and outdoor hot-tub. Free Globe & Mail newspaper in the morning---an excellent choice for a paper junkie like me, but might not be relevant for someone touring Vancouver.

The showerhead didn't appear to be conservation-efficient. The hotel's location is in the middle of a suburban sprawl, except the closest restaurant outside the hotel is a McDonalds about a 1/3-mile away. There are two SkyTrain stations about 3/4-mile away, but the walking route is along a boring highway; a bus that goes to the station is a short, boring walk. This is not a city environment; Burnaby is like an upscale Terre Haute: There's no \"there\" there, unless you're really into American-style malls. There's no apparent way to turn off the loud music piped into the gym, so to watch the TV requires the volume to be very loud. The amenities shop is the worst I've ever seen, and the Starbucks in the lobby has absolutely nothing healthy---just awful-looking greasy pastry, no rolls, not even cookies.

The standard room does not come with a fridge and when I requested one at check-in the staff delivered and set one up in 30 minutes at no charge. The hotel has parking for $15 per day and since the free casino parkade height was too low for my truck I stay underground and was pleased with the amount of free space and had no concerns about theft or door dings. BCIT is only 2 blocks away so it is a great location for this or if you want to enjoy a hotel with a casino in the lower mainland. The rooms were spacious, clean and quiet with only a few rooms on each floor which kept the noise at night to a minimum if you were lucky enough to be a quiet floor. For food there is an A&W and a Chinese buffet (Jade) in the casino for quick food at a low price. The hotel also has a lounge and restuarant to enjoy or have room service after a long day. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, Subway is about 4 blocks up Canada Way, Metrotown Mall (5 min drive), and across Highway 1 (3 min drive) you will find may restuarants including White Spot, BP, and a Shark Club. If you have kids they may have limited entertainment at the hotel. Internet is extra unless you upgrade your room.
