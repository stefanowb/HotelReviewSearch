We had a room on the 14th floor (one of two club floors). Because we were there for a conference I paid the additional cost for accessing the club room which came to $60/night. It wasn't worth it. Minimal food, no alcohol, no club hours after mid-day on Friday through the weekend. Our room was fine although some of the TV stations either didn't come in or had no sound. Watch out for how heavy the closet doors are - I broke two nails immediately upon arriving when I tried to open them. The refrigerator in the room was locked. There was a note on it telling us we could order some items that could be delivered to stock it. A coworker said her frig was unlocked so I don't really know what the usual policy is. I assume you could always just call the desk and have them unlock it for you. Also, the gift shop isn't really a gift shop. There seems to be a few items (candy bars, aspirin, etc.) that were displayed in a case by the restaurant/bar. I'm guessing you can find someone to sell them to you. Please do not take this as a bad review - I'm just pointing out the few things that weren't the best. On the plus side, the staff members we spoke with were exceptionally helpful. And the room did come with complimentary bottles of water.

I had called to book a room for a conference I was attending, and the reservation agent didn't have record of our code and rate, and quoted me naerly $300 per night I asked for the hotel manager to contact me. When I didn't hear back, I ended up booking through Expedia. Is it just me, or do hotels save their worst rooms for those booked through third-party sites? About a week later, I recieved an EMAIL from the hotel and I asked them to call me, but never did hear back from anyone. When I arrived, the hotel staff was very pleasant and I was assigned to a very basic room. I went to my meeting and returned to the room after dinner, looking forward to a night in watching TV and having a light dessert. I called room service and ordered a cookie. They said that they had a cookie and icecream and so that is what I ordered. I then turned on the TV... or tried to... checked remote, physically pressed the power button, checked the cords... nothing. I called and they sent up an engineer. By this time, room service delivered... a brownie alamode. I called again to the front desk, and they said they were out of cookies and the chef just substituted a brownie. Since I didnt want a brownie, especially not one that cost $12, I asked them to remove it from my bill, and they did so. The engineer made it up to my room. After 45 minutes of watching the engineer try the same steps I had made, they dedided to move me to a different room. I repacked and moved from the 8th floor to the 13th floor... to an identical room. But at least the TV sort of worked in this one. The TV sound would cut out every couple of minutes, and the picture was pixelated. Im not sure why as the weather was good. It was more than frustrating when youre used to having a quality connection. The room itself was an average or slightly smaller than average size. The walls are a dreary sage and desperately need to be updated. The linens were all a crisp white and the bed was comfy. The shower had double heads which was nice, but the drain wouldnt stay open without having to hold it, so that was annoying. There was also nearly zero water pressure from the sink... regardless of which tap, only a dribble of water would come out at a time. Also, the bathroom door would not stay open. It would automatically close, which was a little freaky when coming into the room and seeing a closed door (every horror movie of the bad guy hiding out in the bathroom would spring to mind). On the second night, I returned to my new room after a long day of meetings with about 45 minutes to change for dinner. And... my keys no longer worked. Frustrated, I went to the front desk where I had to get rekeyed. Happily, the front desk attendant, Michelle, was very lovely and did everything she could to remedy the situation. Her customer service was fantastic and she was the only reason that I did not ask to vent my experiences to her manager. Other notes about this property, it is conveniently located... metro stop is in walking distance. There are lots of little restaurants and coffee shops nearby, including an on-site Starbucks. The \"gift shop\" was a complete joke... it is only a window display with price tags, so if you need something, you apparently have to go to the front desk and ask for the items. There is also a restaurant, but I did not eat there. All in all, I felt as though the hotel experience was less than satisfactory and took up way too much time from my very busy agenda. I was more than happy to check out. I am still just curious if others have had a problem of poor rooms being given or if they have less than stellar service if the rooms were not booked directly with the hotel. I stay at Starwood properties several times a year and have been a rewards member for years and years. Im hoping my recent experieces is not a sign of a trend.", "user": "breoni", "date": "October 16, 2012", "id": 142972499}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012", "text": "And two blocks from the Metro.
