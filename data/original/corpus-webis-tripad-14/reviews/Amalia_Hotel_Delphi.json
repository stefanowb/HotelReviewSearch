We decided to splash out from our usual budget and stay here (but at 95 euros for a triple room booked only a few days in advance I don't think you can complain) and are glad we did. Having spent a very hot day travelling and sightseeing it was great to come here and chill out,have a swim and then a good dinner. Location is great,plenty of parking and while some people may not like the design,we loved it! Our room certainly wasn't out of date and was clean and comfortable with a view out over the garden. We enjoyed the buffet dinner and thought the 15 euro price was very reasonable. Breakfast was included and there were plenty of choices.
