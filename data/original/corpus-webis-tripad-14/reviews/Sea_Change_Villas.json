Everything about the day was just what we wanted. We had a wedding package which meant everything was organised and all we really had to do was turn up and enjoy our day. We had a beautiful meal cooked in our villa by Mark which topped off a great day. The rooms and the view were amazing. The beach was so peaceful. We hardly saw other people while on the beach.

The villas themselves are outfitted with everything you could possibly need including a lovely basket of breakfast foods that the owners Deb and Charlie provide. The basket lasted us through the whole stay and we cooked lunch ourselves and would eat out at the restaurants at night. The food on the island is EXCELLENT.
