It was comfortable, modern and clean and in a great neighborhood close to many shops and restaurants. We had a terrace room which all rooms don't have. It's worth it to ask for one if they have one available. Thanks to the black out screens and soundproof rooms we were able to sleep like babies. The only complaint about this hotel is that the gym is not very well equipped. However, there is a gym just down the street with very reasonalbe weekly membership dues.

We had the family apartment on the 4th floor overlooking the courtyard. The bathrooms were clean and new. We did not use the kitchen much but loved hanging out in the living room. The big floor to ceiling windows offered a lot of light. The kids loved the 2 pools (rooftop and courtyard). The rooftop pool/view was the best that you can get on Casa Mila. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this place. The lobby receptionist was extremely helpful with directions/maps.
