It under went a remodel about four years ago and is holding up well. More recently the breakfast area was opened up to provide more room. It's a practical change that works, but do miss the old gas fireplace. Myriad dining choices nearby, and with the opening of the Domain shopping area, this hotel is convenient to some of the newest, hippest shopping Austin has to offer. The staff is courteous, friendly and helpful. While rarely an issue, it has been my experience this hotel takes seriously quest comfort and will enforce its noise policy.
