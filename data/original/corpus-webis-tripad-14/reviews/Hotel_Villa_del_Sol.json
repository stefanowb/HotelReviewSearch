Before booking the hotel I had read the reviews in this site, and I was terrified to go there, but this was a very affordable hotel and we booked it in spite of all the bad reviews. I must admit I was pleasantly surprise! This hotel, first of all, is small, but beautiful. The hotel staff was always courteous. The bar had all the drinks we wanted at a very low price. The pool was small but always warm and clean. The room was spaceous, and clean. The beach is very close. We all had a great time!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "sweetiepie17", "date": "July 10, 2004", "id": 2288484}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2004", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for one day/night for a stop over going to St. Martin. Coming from Las Vegas it is a LONG day flying to the Caribbean, so we decided to chop up the flight down and stay here before flying out the next morning for a week in St. Martin. For a night or two I would say it is perfect, cost was around $110/nt at the end of April and was about 5 minutes to/from the airport. It is only 1 or 2 blocks from the beach and there were several restaurants/bars right there at the beach that we enjoyed. Rooms are very basic, but with the other hotel rooms going for almost $200/nt for not much better (from what I have read) this place is perfect for a short stay - any longer I would pay more and stay elsewhere.", "title": "Just Fine for a Night or Two", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Perki", "date": "June 4, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 2152131}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "great vacation", "text": "i had a great time at this hotel, the atmoshpere was so relaxing, we didn't have a problem with anything. the room was perfect all the time, it was near the beach, the pool was great.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 16, 2004", "id": 1788448}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Horrible, Horrible", "text": "Reservations were made by my future sister-inlaw, as our whole family traveled to PR for a family wedding OCT '03. She was never told that hotel was to be under construction. Lobby was constantly drapped in big plastic tarps. Constant flooding occured in lobby at the foot of the stairs After traveling to PR for many hours we were informed that the bar /restaurant would not be open for food or refreshments. Our group of 19 decided to have food and drinks brought in. This bar'restaurant was rarely open in the 5 days we were there. The following day a sign was posted throughout the hotel stating that no food or beverages could be brought in from the outside. Moldy puddles of long standing water surrounded part of the pool area. Terrible part of town, sounds of people being beaten up at night. Furniture throughtout hotel in state of disrepair. Hotel staff never put themselves out to assist with any problems.
