To start, the condo was very outdated with brass fixtures, 19 inch box tvs, and one tile was loose in the bathroom. I read where some of the condos were nice with hot tubs and flat screen tvs, it must just depend on which one you get. However, the pool area was great with separate pools for adults and children, very relaxing if you are looking for peace and quiet. The staff was also friendly and there was a health club with racquetball rooms you could use for free. When we checked in they tried to get us to sit through a sales pitch for a timeshare. We were going to just sit through it at first to get discounted tickets to Williamsburg in return for listening to the sales pitch, but then they wanted us to put down a $20 deposit to reserve our sales pitch time and we told them we were not interested.
