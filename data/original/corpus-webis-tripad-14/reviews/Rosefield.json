The guest rooms are separate from the main house and have a tastefully furnished living room (with open fire) and a wonderful rose covered verandah with views down to the water. Sue and Roger were fabulous hosts and the breakfast was a delight. The bathrooms are spacious and extras like real coffee and chocolates are a nice touch. Guests are welcome to explore the grounds and wander through the gardens to the dam to see the geese, sheep and alpacas. Rosefield is located close to the Bruny ferry, Peppermint Bay and a local cheesery. A gorgeous part of the world. This is truly a five star experience - don't stay anywhere else!", "title": "The best B & B in Tasmania", "user": "tripellen", "date": "December 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 147281341}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Go there and be spoiled", "text": "Cannot say enough good things about this b and b.
