Only a couple of things we weren't happy with...Firstly, the hotel were aware that it was our honeymoon (I e-mailed them to try to pay extra for a room upgrade) - I was told the rooms were all of the same high standard, our room however was very, very small. Also, we weren't expecting any big \"song and dance\" but were suprised that we weren't told 'congratulations' when we arrived. Also, we were on the 6th floor....and the terrace is on the 7th floor...the noise wasn't too bad because we went to bed at about 1am anyway when the terrace closed, but on one particular night (the Friday) the noise was awful. Creaking and moving furniture all night and we didnt get to sleep until hours later.The next night had some noise again so it is probably just the weekends, as the whole week had been fine.

The shower temperature can be a touch binary at times, but not too bad. The aircon in the rooms was quiet and kept the room at a comforatble temperature.

We had a tub with a shower over it and the strength of the shower certainly wakened us up in the morning. The mattress was firmer than most hotels but I liked that and I loved the big square pillows on the bed. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

On our return to the hotel on our first evening there was a pianist playing and we sat and enjoyed the ambience whilst having a glass of bubby. There is a really nice roof terrace where you can chill out and have coffee or a drink and something to eat. The breakfast is very good too - continental style with lots of pastries, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, bread, cereals. We ate in the hotel for lunch and had a really tasty mozzarella, tomato and avocado salad with our sandwiches. I found the hotel food and drink to be very reasonably priced, I actually found most of Barcelona to be that way too. On our second evening we ate at Taller de Tapas in the Born District next to the Santa Maria del Mar Church. We had to wait 30 minutes or so for a table but it was worth it.
