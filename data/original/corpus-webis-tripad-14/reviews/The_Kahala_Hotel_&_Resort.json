Hawaii resorts all seem to be stuck in that 70's style era and we think it's cool in a retro kind of way. But the Kahala is in no way \"run down\" or dumpy. The style itself may not have changed in 30 years but this is DEFINITELY a 5 star hotel all the way. It's a gorgeous hotel with breathtaking views of the ocean (it is one of the few hotels that is actually right on the water, with its own private beach) and the service is outstanding. You are pampered from the moment you walk in and that's what we were looking for on this particular trip--to be spoiled rotten. If you are cheap then this is defintely not the place for you because it is expensive. Some great rates can be found on their rooms (starting at $295 for a garden room during the off-season, for example) but the food and amenities are going to cost you. But if you are looking to stay where the celebrities stay when they are in Oahu (we saw three very famous people out at the pool during our week-long stay) then it's worth the cost! To be fair, I should mention some cons in my review. Our only complaint really was with the room. Because it's humid here and also probably because it's on the water our room had a slight odor to it--like a musty-ness. I can't be sure if all the rooms smelled like this or not--perhaps it was just ours--but it wasn't overpowering or anything. But it was noticeable. Also, the mattresses are hard as a rock and lumpy. We did not sleep well at all and woke up with a back ache every morning, which for me was a real bummer because I'm six months pregnant and was so looking forward to a good-night's sleep on this trip. But alas, we did not let that spoil our fun! Regardless of a little lumpy mattress, the Kahala is without a doubt the only place we will ever stay if we return to Oahu again.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "jems1304", "date": "June 2, 2007", "id": 7741104}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Five star prices, one star hotel", "text": "I went to this hotel in 1978, I've changed but the hotel hasn't changed at all, same carpet same furnishings, same everything.

Upon arrival and after mention of the celebration of a birthday, we were instantly upgraded to an oceanfront lanai room! Imagine my surprise when after being in the room for less than 10 minutes, a special birthday cake was sent over especially for me. My 5 year old daughter adored the property. From the fun-filled Keiki Club to the DolphinQuest swim to the awesome pool and beach - she was definitely happy! My husband and I spent many leisure days by the beach and/or pool. The environment was very relaxing and calm - a huge difference from our last stau at the Outrigger on the Beach. It felt very private and secluded. There was always an attendant to help us set-up our chairs and towels and the pool-side serice was quick and efficient. Employees referred to us by our names by the 3rd day. The concierge was wonderful. She assisted my husband in planning an unforgettable birthday celebration. Breakfast at Plumeria's was an awesome way to start each day. The buffet had a great selection and the service was friendly and prompt. Dinner at Hoku's was exceptional. The seafood tower is a must! Excellent presentation! I realy enjoyed the Veranda's Lounge in the evening - listening to the piano play - who had an amazing voice. The only disadvatage is that since you are away from Waikiki, it is tough to grab a few snacks and a cheap drink - as there are no ABC stores in the area.
