I appreciate that Jackons is a very large hotel and there's little that staff can do about this issue if not alerted to it but it did disrupt our sleep. Also the hotel booklet advises guests to use their in-room telephone to call other rooms by simply dialling the room number, but in our case the room number - 401 - happened to be the same as the telephone number guests were to call to get through to the hotel bar!

Check in was pretty smooth and they were well prepared until we arrived at our rooms door, room 165 in the old part of the hotel. I tried both hey cards and neither of them would work. So I left my wife in the hall with all of our luggage and made the long walk to the desk. On my way, I encountered two other women on our tour trying to get into their room and could not. They said they had an actual key, but the lock was broken and they were working on it. The desk lady gave me two new key cards and I walked back to the room. Neither of these keys would open the door either. I again walked to the desk and by now I was getting pretty wore out and very hot since they had the heat on in the building. I told her I either wanted a key card that would open the door or a different room as I was tired of running back and forth. She then programed 3 keys and said she would go up with me. She got to the door and the first card opened the door. She left and I tried the 3 cards myself.
