As my favorite hotel, The Dominican, Brussels, was fully booked, I decided the stay at the Sofitel. Although I prefer The Dominican Hotel (better location, better beds, lovely bar, lounge and court-yard and a very special Design), the Sofitel gave me a great experience. The check-in by a very friendly lady was a little slow. The room was perfect, although the design is a little \"bland\". The check out was very good, friendly and fast. If next time The Dominican will not be available again, then for sure i will stay at the Sofitel.", "title": "One of the best hotels in Brussels", "user": "Alfred B", "date": "April 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 157764386}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I have stayed one night in this hotel for business reasons.
