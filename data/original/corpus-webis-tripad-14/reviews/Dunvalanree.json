My wife and i have just returned after spending a night at Dunvalanree. It is a superb place to stay if you are looking for a wonderful location by the beach, exceptionally friendly and welcoming hosts,and a place where you can truly unwind. However,the main reason for me would have to be for the food.It is quite simply outstanding. The hotel is run by a husband and wife, who clearly work very hard at running their hotel and indeed seem eager to look for any ways they can improve even more. But getting back to the food...we can honestly say it was one of the finest meals we have ever had.They source all the finest of ingredients locally and they are prepared beautifully by Alison. As for the hotel itself,it is exceptionally clean, full of character and the service by all members of staff is very friendly.
