The rehab was done on the cheap and eliminated little conveniences like bathroom hooks for PJs. The bed was hard (and I'm accustomed to an orthopedic mattress), and the modern-looking chair uncomfortable. The breakfast was great and the staff was quite helpful, except for the woman at the front desk. She was grumpy and made me feel as though I disturbed her by wanting to check-in (only at the appointed time--we were early and were sent away as was another lady). Also she was grumpy when we checked out. Definitely did not feel welcome, and will not return. At $212 on a Tuesday night, the room was not a bargain.", "title": "Never again", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HappyGirl00", "date": "July 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"sleep": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 116037045}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great business hotel in SB", "text": "Barbara S.", "user": "MousseMakesGumbo", "date": "July 29, 2011", "id": 115944849}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "When in Santa Barbara on biz travel you need to balance glitz with a hotel that delivers basic affordable biz amenities.

Very effecient. The lady at the desk isn't overly friendly but she isn't rude either. She was effecient and very to the point but I made no requests of her so she was fine by me. The room was your basic room but she gave us a balcony even tho we were told it would cost more for one when we called. So she gave it to us at no extra charge to our surprise. It was a clean and adequate room. Nothing fancy but we didn't expect that and it accomodated all our needs. Rooms have been redecorated recently you can tell. It's an older hotel, but has been updated properly. Highly recommend. We walked to the harbor and a small park and shopping. GREAT LOCATION!!
