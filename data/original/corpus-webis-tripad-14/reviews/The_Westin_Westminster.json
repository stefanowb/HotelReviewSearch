When you walk in the door you will be greeted by the enormous lounge filled with comfy leather and upholstered chairs and sofas, centered around a big fireplace. I just start to feel good immediately because of the warm colors and natural, \"Western\" feel. The rooms are similarly appointed, with the signature excellent beds.

The restaurant is mid to high in price (I've never been). While luckily the oyster bar isn't a Rocky Mountain oyster bar, for some reason two of the five types offered are from the east coast of the U.S. When I get hungry, I walk across the street to the Rock Bottom Brewery, where the crowd in the bar stays late and the beers are excellent and only $3.75.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 27, 2005", "id": 3420339}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wow!

While the hotel itself was nice, the service at the front desk was terrible. They have no understanding of the concept of \"customer service.\" Anyhoot, the rooms were nice but we found mold on the shower curtain, stains througout the carpet and even stains on our pillowcases. Housekeeping did not replenish any of the toiletries (like soap) until we requested it.

This visit was completely different. We were booked for a room upgrade on a high floor. Didn't happen. The room we got was worn and dirty, surprising in a relatively new Hotel. Valet parking (which they charge you for) did not exist after 11pm. They still charge you, you just get to park your own car. Housekeeping was awful. Had to call twice in 4 days to get new towels. We called because the in room coffee maker didn't work. They brought a new one...and left it on the floor. The broken one was still in the bathroom, still full of coffee and water. We swapped them and the broken one sat on the desk for the duration of the stay. Honor bar was never checked/replenished. I could go on and on. Interestingly, my note to management was never responded too. I guess we will be searching for a different place to stay on our next trip to Denver.", "user": "lepreshaun", "date": "October 7, 2005", "id": 4000482}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005, traveled on business", "text": "Possibly the nicest, quietest hotel I've ever stayed in.
