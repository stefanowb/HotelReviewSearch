It did work for us however and I'd like to thank all the people who suggested doing so. We had a deluxe room on the 22nd floor and the view was FABULOUS. Room was large and beds comfy, staff was very nice, overall we had a wonderful experience and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We booked using the 2 night package and used our $75 dining credit for room service, you get more food choices that way and the prices are a little better. You will still be chaged a 20% fee and you should also tip. For us, two nice sandwiches and fries cost us $13 tax and fee total, we didn't think that was bad at all. Be sure to get a room on a high floor.

Very nice hotel: clean rooms, good service, comfy beds, quiet at night. The location is right at the Canadian falls. Loved the view we had. We had the package with 2 breakfasts, $75 voucher for dinner. The breakfast was a nice buffet, nothing spectacular, but we like to eat breakfast at the hotels we stay at and not search for a place in the morning. Restaurant for dinner was very expensive, even with the voucher we paid extra, but I guess it depends on how big an eater you are. The food was good, so I'd recommend as a special treat. The in-room safe is a very nice extra. The bathroom had lots of counter space which is a plus. We did not rent a car and walked everywhere. If you don't want to walk the buses stop nearby. Only thing I didn't like was that the pool was not clean enough. I know it must be hard to keep the area clean, but the smaller of the two jacuzzis was dirty and some debris around the pool tile area.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "heidi123", "date": "June 18, 2007", "id": 7927036}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Overall though, I would highly recommend the Marriott Fallsview!", "title": "Decent Hotel- not as good as expected", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "simmie17", "date": "June 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7873273, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 restaurant and room service", "disliked": "\u2014 front desk- air conditioning did not work"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "arrived at this hotel after an exhausting 7 hr ride. Valet for check in was fine. However, young girl at front desk was not too pleasant. Had booked a Canadian falls view room. Room was on high floor next to some kind of outside vent that blocked a little of the view. Bathroom was huge. Went to dinner in hotel restaurant- very expensive but very good food. Waiter was exceptional as was host staff. However, on return to room air was not working properly. Called and maintenance came and said it was fixed, but it was not. I was too exhausted to call and request another room. Next day used the spa- very good but the room was stifling hot and we checked out early after room service. Again, waiter was very pleasant. I mentioned lack of air conditioning to lobby concierge as we left and he really did not care. This is a lovely hotel, but just short of a 4 star facility. If I returned to area, would try the Doubletree- saw its location a few blocks away- or the Renaissance. We also visited Niagara on the Lake- really charming small town, though did not have time for the Shaw Festival.
