However, it is also a hotel and weddding venue, so I could understand why we might need to pay a little more. We both ordered the steak sandwich which came at a pricey \u00a37.95. I opted for it as a panini and my husband had it as a regular sandwich. He had no issues with his at all, but mine was really disappointing. The meat was fatty and gristly in places. I ended up having to remove all of the slices of steaks and trimming off the inedible bits before rebuilding my panini. At almost \u00a38, which in other pubs would buy you a filling full size lunch, I expected more.
