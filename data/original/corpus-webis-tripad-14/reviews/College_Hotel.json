Its interior design is great as well as the looks from the outside. A wonderful terrace to enjoy a drink or have a meal. Bar and restaurant really cool. Our attic room was good size, comfortable with a very smart d\u00e9cor. Nice bathroom with a large shower and separate WC. Good amenities. A relaxing loft style seating area. No view to talk about, since only ceiling windows, thus not much natural light. Had a very nice dinner, an excellent breakfast and many happy cocktails in the hotel. Yes, it\u2019s a training school for hotel personal and sometimes the inexperience shines through, but the friendliness, willingness and politeness makes up for all the shortcomings. The location: It's a good 30 minutes walk to Dam Square which supposedly is the center of Amsterdam. However, it\u2019s close to so many interesting sights. Like 5 minutes walk to Rikjsmuseum. There are also many excellent restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. Slight difficulties with parking, although hotel has a garage across the street (for a fee). The hotel has no dedicated area where to stop the car (or taxi) to unload or load your luggage. No bellman.
