Our friends had to leave before breakfast so the hotel put them up a packed breakfast, which they said was really good.

The description said it was partly a converted monastry, which attracted us, but infact it is more conference-like than we had expected. However, our room was really big, with an extremely comfortable bed, lovely big bathroom and overlooking a quiet courtyard garden. The hotel pool, steam room and gym (brand new equipment) were all really quiet and are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. which meant we actually got to use them (other hotels facilities often close earlier than this). We had booked this hotel because we expected the weather to be bad and wanted somewhere with a log-fire to sit and relax by with a glass of wine. As it happened, the weather was warm so we didn't need this but there were several fire places and areas to sit which would have been great had we needed them. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as we prefer to go out - and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. We had read a tip on trip advisor about parking at the station - brilliant idea - we parked there for 3 days and it only cost 7 Euros in total. There are regular buses into the square in front of the hotel and it's a 5 minute trip costing 1.20 Euros - would definately do that again. There were lots of americans staying at this hotel who went out each day on trips, other than that it seemed fairly quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful - they booked a cycle trip up for us.
