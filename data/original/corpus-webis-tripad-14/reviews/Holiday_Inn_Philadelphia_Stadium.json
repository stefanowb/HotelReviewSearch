We were without transportation and since lobby was clean, attractive and updated, we decided it was easiest to stay. Manager refused to allow us to rebook at previous rate through hotwire, so we paid $159 for a room that left much to be desired. Carpeting was damp and sticky feeling and doors to room have about a 2 inch gap underneath allowing lots of light and plenty of noise throughout the night. It looks like old carpeting was replaced that must have been more plush than new. Between the ice machine down the hall and elevators dinging, I got very little sleep. Bathroom looks like partially redone but lots of mildew and a ceiling poorly done with holes in corners. Bed and bedding could use update! Not very comfortable. Thankfully it was only 1 night! Shuttle service to airport was timely and driver was friendly and helpful. Prior to our stay here, we spent 3 nights at a Sheraton in Center City Philly that was far superior AND WE PAID MUCH LESS!

It was very obvious, not professional at all. I go to my room, everything on the periphery looked clean but look in the tub, you will see mold on the tiles and the sides of the tub. I crashed in to sleep. Woke up early to check my email. I cannot connect to the \"free wireless internet\" because apparently the \"signal is poor\" on the 8th floor. I went to the lobby and the lobby was filled with prospective interviewees for some job in the hotel. There were no empty chairs. So when I find a chair in the corner to sit and I am told by the manager: \"Sir, can you find some other place, because I am conducting an interview here\". Customer first policy, to the core!!! By the way, the whole lobby was the hang out of business travellers on every floor of the hotel, not just the higher floors, because no one had access to the wireless internet in their rooms. I was in for another surprise the second night, there was no parking available easily accessible, apparently they let people coming for the Phillies match to valet park in their lot.
