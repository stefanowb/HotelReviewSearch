The staff is friendly & helpful. The suites are thoughtfully set up with everything you need and housekeeping is impeccable. The d\u00e9cor of the room was decent. My only regret was staying for just one night, but I will return and stay longer next time. I booked last minute and took the only room that was available; suite 105. I was thankful to have the covered deck because it was raining upon arrival and we were still able to sit out with some wine & cheese. I look forward to trying some of the other rooms. ViewPoint was aware that this get away was a milestone birthday celebration, so they left a bottle of Korbel in the room for us. It was fantastic to enjoy such personal service while having incredible privacy. ViewPoint gets my first \"Excellent\" tripadvisor rating based on service and stunning property.", "title": "Stunning!", "user": "kekeman", "date": "September 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 179175392}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Sweet view!", "text": "Stayed here 2 nights with DH.
