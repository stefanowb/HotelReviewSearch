You can go online and request more towels or pillows, or whatever you need after you make your reservation, but had plenty of towels and pillows. We wanted privacy.

You can hear light traffic on Bay St at night, but it didn't keep us awake (our room was on Bay St. Light sleepers migth wanna request a room on the pool side). Bed was so comfortable! Even my husbamd with all his back problems was a little sad that he had to say goodbye to that bed when we were leaving. Gym looked great but I had no use for a gym during my birthday vacation....come on, now! Checked out the pool, it is heated! We just ran out of time to use it.
