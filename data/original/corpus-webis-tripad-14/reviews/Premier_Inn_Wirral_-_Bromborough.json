The first night was fine (although we were very tired) but the second night was terrible. I was woken at least 4 times during the night from outside noise. There is considerable flight traffic from the nearby airport and very heavy road noise from the adjoining busy road. However, this would have been ok but there was a constant loud \"humming noise\" from what appeared to be a nearby factory or plant of some sort. When I got up (at 6am) and went outside the noise was clearly audible and I spoke to another guest who said it had been going all night. I mentioned it to the receptionist on duty but she said that she didn't know of any neighbouring properties that would generate such a noise. In the end I made her come outside and she did (reluctantly) agree that she could hear it. We were offered a quieter room. The receptionist also said that the busy road is mentioned on their web site but I checked and cannot find any mention of this, so Premier Inn need to rectify this. All that said, apart from the terrible nights sleep from the noise, the hotel itself is what you expect from this Chain, the room was a good size, spotlessly clean and does what it says on the tin.
