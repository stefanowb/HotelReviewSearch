The camper had plenty of room. Renting a golf cart is an absolute must. The campground is huge. My son is 12 and he had a blast riding in the golf cart. The camp store was to small and packed full of stuff. The arcade was small. We did play bingo and it was ok. The little ice cream and pizza place had good ice cream and the pizza was fair. The lake is really a big pond. The shuttle to and from Holiday World is great. They cruise the campground continuously and we never waited longer than 5 minutes.

We stayed at the cabins which were rustic but comfortable. If you go rent a golf cart it's a must the kids loved it. New cabins were under construction that will have TVs and will be available later this summer. However after our short stay my daughter announced she did not want to stay in the new cabins we had more fun because we didn't have a TV.

Everyone in our family absolutely loved all the facilities and hated to leave. We are already planning another reunion at the same place and time next year. The only thing that was somewhat inconvenient was the temperature was 96 degrees on Saturday when we were there and the lofts in the cabins were too warm at night and the height of the roof was too low for the people sleeping at the far ends of the loft. For that reason, next year, most of us will probably rent either regular size or King size RV's or Santa Family size cabins next year. My family stayed in a King size RV with a King size bed, full size bed, sofa, and 4 bunk beds, plus 1 and 1/2 baths and kitchen and it was fantastic. We had children from 2 mnths to 18 years old along with adults from 21 to 68 and they all stayed busy with all the activities from playing basketball, golfing, swimming, paddle boating, peddle boating, fishing, riding golf carts, etc. The whole campgrounds was immaculate, very few bugs (park is sprayed well), maintenance problems were fixed immediately and correctly. Golf carts must shut off at 11 pm so there was no noise from them while sleeping at night and security patrols in golf carts going past about every 30 minutes.

The ground staff at the resort were very friendly and helpful. They were visible, and for that reason we felt safe. The pool was clean and well maintained, and the play areas for kids were a big hit. We liked having the Shuttle service to Holiday World was super convenient, and runs frequently. However, there was some cons too....first, let me say we camp ALOT so we know what to expect in campgrounds.....the family cabin that we stayed in fell below my expectations...for several reasons. First, the was an ant infestation, yeah I know when you camp there are going to be bugs..but this was ridiculous. They were everywhere in the kitchen, and we ended up keeping our food in the sterilite containers we brought, outside. This defeated the purpose of upgrading to the cabin to have cabinet space. Secondly, the cabin could have been cleaner...there was alot of dust..clearly visible under the beds, mold around the shower doors etc. The cabins were so close to the road which would have been ok but that was where the fire ring was too...so if you have very young children..not only do you have to keep them away from the fire ( which you expect if you have a fire) but also from the road. We ended up having to stay in more than we liked because of the road and traffic. The most upsetting thing however was the explicit grafitti on the loft ceiling. I went upstairs to check it out it looked OK, but did not lay in bed and look at the ceiling until my five year old started giggling. I went up and was mortified at the pics previous guests had drawn there...it is called a FAMILY cabin. I taped paper over it--if the management could not remove it they could have at least blacked it out. We discovered this at night and did not feel like moving again with 3 little kids so we covered it up as best we could.
