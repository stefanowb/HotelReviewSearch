I parked my rented car on the street that night (not that I objected to paying the 6Euro per night charge) but there was no way I would cope with the obnoxious fumes which were even worse in the underground car park..sadly next morning I found my car impounded and three hours later waiting in the police station was forced to pay two hundred euro to get it back......... as far as I am concerned the deadly fumes were the hotels problem and there was not even an apology... I feel they could have called the police and explained the situtation in the hotel that night, but they showed no interest what so ever......... on arrival home I emailed the hotel and received quite a \"could'nt care less\" reply. They have no idea how to boil water for a cup of tea in this hotel. The beach front restaurant was excellent with bright and cheerful staff on duty evey day, and the maid cleaning the room was also cheerful.

Fully merited 4star rating. We were a group of 8 people from Cork in Ireland on our annual golf trip to the Costa but on our first trip to Marbella. Our booking was on a b/b basis and as we tended to burn the midnight oil we found that the breakfast up to 11.00am was a great idea. Breakfast was top class and kept us fortified up to our evening meal. Great choice of restaurants nearby but even though it is lovely up around the famous Orange Square the dinner prices here are a bit over the top. Hotel is situated right on the beachfront and you can enjoy a relaxing stroll on the promenade at your leisure. Indeed a few of us walked into Puerto Banus from the hotel...obviously with a few pit stops on the way for fear of dehydration. The Spa is excellent for getting rid of all those aches and pains and the treatments are top class.I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to all ages.", "title": "Top class Hotel ideally located", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ErnestCork", "date": "October 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 82566175}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Just returned from a five day break at this hotel and I must say we had a great stay.
