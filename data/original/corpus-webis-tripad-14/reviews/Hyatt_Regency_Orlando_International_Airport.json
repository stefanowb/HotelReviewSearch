I let them know we were taking a cruise the next day and the bell desk took care of our luggage right from our room. We just added the cruise provided ID tags to our luggage and the bell desk took care of the rest. The next time we saw our bags they were just outside our cabin on the Disney Magic. The airport has plenty of places to eat and when we called the front desk they were able to give us a phone number of a pizza place that delivered to the hotel also. Access to the hotel is difficult for the Pizza Delivery company so you have to meet them at the ground level car port. Our kids really enjoyed the pool area. We were not bothered by airport noise. We stayed a night after the cruise also and the concierge was very helpful. We wanted to do something the day we got off of the ship and she gave us several options and even checked us into our Soutwest Airlines flight and got us our A line number.

Almost too cheap for a hotel of this quality! Check in was quick and easy. We inquired with the concierge on transportation to Disney World and while there are shuttles available, she was able to book us a dirt cheap car rental for the day which made it cheaper than any shuttle available. The rooms were outside facing rooms versus atrium facing. They were larger than a normal hotel room and had large balconies. The bathrooms were way larger than a typical hotel bathroom with separate tub and shower. There was also 2 separate sinks which was nice so no one was in each others way. There is also a decent size pool outside. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one day and took advantage of the buffet. The prices were in line with most hotel breakfast buffet's. If you do not want to eat in the hotel, since it is in the main airport terminal you can easily go to one of the sit down or fast food restaurants available there.

Our stay at the Orlando Airport Hyatt was very relaxing and convenient. The property was clean, comfortable, updated and staffed with top-notch guest centric staff. I have stayed at a lot of Hyatts over time and have found their system to be very inconsistent in quality-service-cleanliness from hotel to hotel, but this one is a good one (other great picks are Gainey Ranch in AZ and the one on Poipu Beach Kauai - the best in my opinion). When I arrived in the Orlando airport I stopped at the Hyatt front desk and made my reservation for the following week's night before my departure. The front desk staff member was very nice, but lacking in some training on making reservations (she probably does mainly check-ins). Her colleague helped her and I was assured that a room with two double beds was being reserved. Upon check-in, I was told that my reservation was for a king bed room and that there were no doubles available in the hotel. I explained to the front desk person that with four people it was unacceptable, that I was told that a double had been reserved and I could not understand why/how this happened. She was pleasant and offered a larger room with a sofa bed and the option to bring a rollaway into the room ... all at a 70% room rate premium to what I had reserved. I told her that I would take the room, but it would need to be at the original rate that was listed in my reservation. To my delight, she was empowered to say \"yes\" and she made the change. The rest of the check-in process was very expedient and were quickly in our room. The room was very spacious and well-appointed. Within minutes, a knock at the door and the rollaway appeared. I called down to room service to order a bottle of wine (by the way, their wine selection could use a make-over) and was told it could take up to 40 minutes to receive. Once again, they over-delivered and the wine showed-up in less than ten minutes. Each time we interacted with a Hyatt employee we were treated with respect and the service was prompt and friendly -- I cannot ask for more. The bed was comfortable and the room was exceptionally sound-proof from the airport ... we did not hear one jet all night. We went to the pool on the sixth floor and it was fine, but there was no hot tub and I think all hotels should have one. The next morning, we had a Starbucks close by in the food and shopping area just outside the hotel entrance and all was good with the world. Seriously, this was probably the easiest and least stressful travel morning I have ever had and it causes me to wish that every airport had a hotel in their terminals.", "user": "CSB_Edina", "date": "April 11, 2012", "id": 127692982}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "1night stopover", "text": "We arrived late from las Vegas so we decided to stay at the Hyatt in the airport, we had seen the hotel many times while flying through Orlando.", "user": "Jakeylad", "date": "April 10, 2012", "id": 127605936}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "In Airport - walk to ticket counter, gate", "text": "The room was very comfortable with an inside balcony and a nice bathroom, we had a couple of drinks at the bar which was not really designed for anything other than diners but in saying that, the staff were very welcoming for what I'm sure is just a transit hotel.", "user": "Lucky_Patrick", "date": "April 9, 2012", "id": 127536222}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "looks nice and staff are great but...", "text": "We had a nice breakfast when it eventually arrived, even though it wasn't very busy we had a very long wait, I think American hotels like to bring you everything you've ordered all at once instead of the cereal first then the rest later which lets your cooked food go even cooler than it already is, so it was just OK!", "user": "Mike60817", "date": "April 7, 2012", "id": 127441811}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "This is all about the location......", "text": "This was my fourth stay at this property - first review.

We hadn't been in the area before and received a few recommendations with this being one of them. I give myself 2 thumbs up and an extra pat on the back for picking this place. The recommendations we received were for this Hyatt and a few at Port Canaveral. The first impression was great. We had a slight, ok, more than slight delay with flights. About 3 hours and didn't even land into Orlando until about 1:30 in the morning. Traveling alone with my 2 young kids, I can't tell you how convenient this place is. Never did I imagine I'd have the layover but to haul luggage and 2 kids through the airport was exhausting. Luckily I didn't have far to go. We got to the check in desk and that went very smooth. No hassles. The check in guy explains how the Disney Cruise luggage stuff works and we went to our room. I must say I was a little hesitant with the price but after seeing the room, it was spectacular. No noise, nothing but peace to sleep. After settling in, we only got about 4 hours sleep. Once we got up and moving about, we headed down for breakfast, again the convenience is awesome. I had to check out and I redeemed a gift voucher? and am pleased to report there were no issues with that either. The whole luggage transition and check-in was beyond easy. In fact, I had expected it to all take a little longer. So Kudos to the Hyatt. You get a lot of referrals from our cruise board and I am planning on returning again.
