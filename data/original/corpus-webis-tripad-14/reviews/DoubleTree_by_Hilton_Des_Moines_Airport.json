The location can't be beat, it's right beside the airport and several of the major roads and highways. We enjoyed the free breakfast buffet at Johnny's Steakhouse and their service has improved this time around. Marsha at the front desk was so friendly and Elva in housekeeping kept our room beautiful everyday. I e-mailed Jeff the manager a week before our visit to let him know that it was our ten year anniversary and he was so nice and friendly. He sent me an e-mail back stating that he would make sure we had a wonderful stay and he was right on the money. Don't even waste your time looking for another hotel because this one can't be beat.
