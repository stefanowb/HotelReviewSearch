The hotel was modern and much more sophisticated than we imagined. The power to the room was controlled by the insertion of your room key into a master power slot by the door. The window shades were power operated, the bed was comfortable (firm) and the bathroom was modern and clean. Fast and modern WiFi was available as you might expect in a civilized country such as CH. We were pleased to have access to an honor bar, a safe and above-average TV options. The staff were fluent in any language you can imagine and we heard multiple languages and dialects during our stay. The walk to the old-town or to the Lake was short and the property is next to the train station. This nice property made our stay in Lucerne a pleasant one and we enjoyed the opportunity to walk anywhere in just a few minutes. The food was fine and the bar-beverage service was outstanding!
