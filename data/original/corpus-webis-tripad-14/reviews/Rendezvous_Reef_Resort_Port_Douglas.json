The first unit we were put in was, dirty, dark and looked out at a back below the main road. The lounge suit (which is just outdoor wicker type furniture) have cream cushions that were stained and really uncomfortable, urine around the toilet, the window joinery was really dirty and upstairs was a safe in a cupboard with a rusty lock, which, there was a $4 per day charge. We shifted units and although a better location, the unit was still dirty. Washing machine didn't go. The staff were really nice and helpful, except Natalie, she was rude, sour faced and everything seemed to be a problem, sighing when asked a question, the worst person for a front desk job i have ever came across. The beds were very comfortable and shower upstairs had great pressure, although marketed as a 2 bathroom apartment, i wouldn't call a shower behind a door with a toilet in a tiny room off the laundry, a 2nd bathroom, we didn't use this. They put on really good breakfast.There was no outdoor area to sit in the sun, no real outdoor furniture. We compared this place to a motorcamp with units. We were so disappointed and found this place to be depressing. We checked out after 2 days, couldn't do the whole week here. This place needs totally renovated (not just a flick of paint)and some seriously new furiture. Wouldn't recommend sorry.", "title": "Rendezvous Port Douglas", "user": "Linda M", "date": "September 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 140479442}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed for 6 nights in August 2012 and thought it excellent. We were really impressed by our villa with two comfortable double bedrooms both with balconies, two shower rooms, well-equipped kitchen, spacious dining area, comfortable lounge area with tv and hi-fi, washing machine and drier and terrace outside looking out over the stream and mangroves and well-maintained garden full of colourful birds and flowers. The staff were friendly and helpful and the few small things that we reported as not working were attended to immediately by the maintenance staff. The two swimming pools looked great for families with small children but we prefer to swim in the sea (it wasnt stinger season) so we walked across the road and down a path to the amazing 4 mile sandy beach. We also walked twice via a pathway full of birds and trees to the excellent Rainforest Habitat (our tickets were valid for a second free visit if made within three days of the first visit - we also had an amazing value buffet lunch with the lorikeets there)and across the road from there is a supermarket and bottleshop so we were able to buy all the provisions we needed despite not having a car. The shuttlebus goes regularly from the hotel to the centre of Port Douglas - we preferred the friendly driver of the Sun Palm service and think it was slightly cheaper than the other one at $21 return for three of us. Most of the tour companies we booked with came to collect us free of charge from the hotel. There's all you need for a comfortable economical stay in Port Douglas provided you dont need to be right in the centre for nightlife.

We had a deluxe apartment which was okay, it was clean and well maintained. The staff were good, friendly and helpful. A stay is as good as you make it. I wasn't interested in the pool because I was travelling in winter. Having an apartment was great as it allowed self help (cooking). The beds, the important bit when travelling, were fantastic. We had a queen and a king. we changed to the king to 2 singles and they were really comfortable. One of the showers was a horrible as it had the flexi hose and the shower head wouldn't stay in the right position and kept falling down. Car parking was problematic as the grade of the carport was elevated above road level which meant that the car bottomed out when I parked in the car port. I was worried about under carriage damage in the rental car, so ended up parking on the roadway.
