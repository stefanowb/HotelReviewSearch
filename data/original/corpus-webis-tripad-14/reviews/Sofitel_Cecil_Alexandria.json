After staying in other Sofitel properties I was expecting 4 star level amenities. The hotel is quite old, was previously known as the \"Cecil\" (all the locals still know it this way). I am by no means a super picky traveler, do not need a concierge to plan everything, never order room service etc. but this hotel is truly lacking in amenities. My room looked as it had been decorated in the 1960s and then left untouched (to be fair, the bathroom did appear newer). The noise of the AC unit was akin to a plane taking flight and my view was of someones wash and bathroom. I know other rooms had a better sea view as they were being repainted (with the doors wide open at all hours) and you could see straight through. It was at the end of a long smoke-filled hallway (thanks to the Monty Bar on the same floor) and the paint fumes were noticeable as well.", "title": "Cockroaches and rude staff", "user": "sommar-sol_2009", "date": "October 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 47270046}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Needless to say I was not too pleased with the hotel.

The second room had a peek-a-boo sea view if you went out on the balcony and turned your head, but the noise level was so intense from the street that we had to close the door right away. The room itself was nice, though small. The bath was nice. To try to cross the street to the ocean side for a walk is quite a challenge. You take your life in your hands but we did it with the help of some local girls the first time and returning was even more frightening as the traffic had increased and we just had to wait and wait and then run.
