I understand that the hotel has only been open for one month and you can tell - everything is shiny & new. I'm pretty sure that we were the first occupants of our room. Room was smallish - possibly partly due to the huge and comfortable bed - and very tastefully decorated in art deco style. The basement cocktail bar needs to be seen to be believed - not sure I would extend my tasteful decor comments, but we were made very welcome and the drinks were very good! Excellent air conditioning kept the room nice & cool even on the lowest (whisper quiet) setting. Staff were very friendly & helpful.", "title": "Smart new hotel", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Localshopper", "date": "September 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8666567, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 tasteful decor", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}], "location": {"country": "Czech Republic", "region": "Bohemia", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Prague"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 34, "average": 92, "very good": 259, "terrible": 32, "excellent": 241}, "aka": "Best Western Prague", "slim_ranking": 0.28869047619, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "The elegant hotel Majestic Plaza, a member of BEST WESTERN PREMIER chain is located right in the heart of Prague, only 300 metres from famous Wenceslas Square.
