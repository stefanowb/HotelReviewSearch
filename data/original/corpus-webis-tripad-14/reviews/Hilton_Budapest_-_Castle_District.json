If you go, try to get a room in the 70s or 80s (e.g. 472 or 484). That way, every morning you will rise from your bed to be greeted by a magnificent view of the Danube and an equally magnificent view of the Parliament building.

A bit down the road is the Grand Palace and several museums. After the hordes of tourists are gone (tour buses tend to come in the morning), you can stroll leisurely around this charming district. There are many restaurants around, many with live music.

The room we had was typically arranged while the bed was very comfortable. The refrigerator was well stocked but take note: there is a CBA grocery just a block and a half down the street, east of the hotel, that has everything you need for about half the price. Everyone we ran into was most helpful -- from the bus driver who stopped and picked us up beyond the pickup point where we were on our way to the bus stop. We found the locals to be very good and willing to speak english. The metro is ever bit as good as the travel guides indicated. There was no need to use a taxi -- thereby avoiding the reported infamous taxi ripoffs we have heard about. Getting to the hotel was easy via the 'red metro' to the Moscow terrace station and connecting to bus 16, up the stairs and on the street across from the metro exit. Budapest is really a wondeful city and full of surprises -- from the large mall in the west end and the huge market in the south of the vaci utca and of course the large riverfronts. We enjoyed the Hilton and the city -- they go well in hand together as they have for over the last 30 years. We will be back and will enjoy the Hilton again.

Beautiful view of the Parliament from the room. The rooms are somewhat dated. Comfortable beds with pretty dated linens with stains and marks. Service did not meet expectations. No one greeted us when we arrived even though there were a bunch of bell boys hanging around; I guess no one had told them that they were supposed to great customers. Also, when we took our luggage downstairs to check out, no one offered us to help with the luggage. The breakfast was quite good; big variety, but again the service was sub-par; sometimes it seemed that the waiters either didn't speak English or were never told what their responsibilities were. The Concierge was very helpful: organized a private tour + recommended a couple of amazing restaurants. The Internet connection was 42 Euros/ day, so we chose not to order it. Overall, whereas we had a good time in Budapest, this felt like a 3-star hotel by US measures. For $320/ night, I expected more. I would not recommend this hotel, as it is subpar relative to other Hilton hotels.", "title": "Very nice hotel", "user": "Jimmy747", "date": "June 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 114887976}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed 7 nights at the hotel.
