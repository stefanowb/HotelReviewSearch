The next day it was off to the airport for our flight back to Chicago. The appealing thing about this hotel was its proximity to both Port Everglades and to the Fort Lauderdale airport (FLL). A free shuttle van picked us up at the CruisePort after about an hours wait and three phone calls. Not a real problem. A 10 minute ride and you arrive. Our room was very clean with a great king-sized bed. A refrigerator, microwave, and VCR come with the room. The pool was clean and enjoyable, but pool furniture had seen better days. The complementary breakfast was very adequate along with the free USA today. Another plus was the free wide band internet connection to catch up on the weeks worth of e-mail that was waiting.

On the surface, it seems like a reasonable place if you can set aside the cheap plastic feel of everything. The thing that really destroys this place is the people. The hotel is run with unveiled contempt for its guests. The airport shuttle drivers shoot glares at you after they take 45 minutes to pick you up from the airport and then add insult by directly requesting a tip while you're sill in the van. The desk clerks are mostly blunt, unfriendly, unhelpful men (although there are one or two exceptions to this rule) and the two men that seem to own the place are particularly unpleasant grumpy individuals. The contempt continues in the guestrooms where you are threatened by the large signs hanging in the bathroom (if you take one of our sandpaper-like towels, we will charge $10 to your credit card). Your obvious thieving tendencies are thankfully controlled, however, by a cord that attaches the iron to the ironing board, although it does make ironing your clothes technically impossible. I could continue on about the overall cheapness, tackiness, and grumpiness, but I think it comes down to this: if you desperately need a place to stay for a night and don't mind being an unwelcome guest then this place might be okay, but if you want a hotel that will be comfortable for a few nights you should definitely look elsewhere.", "title": "Decidedly Mediocre", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "edwhite78", "date": "March 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 4727676}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006", "text": "Stayed here for one night.
