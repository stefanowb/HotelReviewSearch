The only thing we found was true from the reviews was the size of the room and the bathroom (smaller than most). But, that did not detract from the fact that it was a nice hotel with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful and other staff members were also friendly and accommodating. Breakfast in the hotel was reasonable for Washington and it was very good. We would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again. There are several good places to eat within walking distance (Dakota Cowgirl and Thai Tanic) which were very reasonably priced. We had a late night snack at the bar (kabobs and fries) which were were very good although a bit pricey.
