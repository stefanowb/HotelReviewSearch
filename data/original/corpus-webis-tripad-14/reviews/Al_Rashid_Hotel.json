Plenty of mini-markets and eateries around. Rooms are pretty basic (dining room up a few notches, breakfast very decent) but service is impeccable. We arrived in the afternoon and asked reception to book us tickets for Petra by Night (a unique experience but immensely popular!) which they did instantly. We stayed for 3 nights and on the second night we were upgraded to a larger room which was made available in the meantime (they moved all our stuff). They offered us a complimentary dinner (very good) and, when we left, they gave us 2 large bottles of water for the road (a fantastic gesture in this hot country - we were setting off on the long journey to Wadi Rum). They let us call our Petra guide on his mobile for free from the reception phone. Receptionists and waiters very friendly and polite, made us feel at home. Only drawbacks: a. It's a 30' walk up and downhill (or a 5' taxi ride) to the entrance of the Petra site (taxis are plentiful and cheap); b. They don't take Visa (only Mastercard): they hadn't told us from the beginning so at checkout we had to rush to the bank (right opposite) to change euros (banks were closing earlier that day, a close call but we finally made it!).

The phone did not work ?? in the room. Light bulbs were burnt out, and required us to walk downstairs to request replacements. Wi fi in the rooms a definate positive thing. Breakfast: Hummus, boiled eggs, pita jams..and INSTANT COFFEE ??? really?? The hotel offered a box lunch for 5 JOD...If you are heading to Petra, I highly recommend this. It is GREAT! The box lunch included, pita bread, apple, cucumber, tomatoe, 2 sweets, flafel, juice box...well worth the money. All in all an Ok hotel in the center of town, with supermarket for water and basics, fast food and bakery ATM all within one block.
