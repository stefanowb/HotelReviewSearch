The rooms were beautiful, the amenities were luxurious and the chocolate soap could easily be mistaken for candy. The smell was like bathing with a chocolate shake.

The bed, bedding and pillows were cozy comfortable and the room was spacious and beautiful. A restaurant at our place of accomodation is not a must for us but this was just an added bonus as it was very good. The chocolate dessert we had was too die for! The beautiful courtyard cafe was a lovely spot to enjoy breakfast each morning. The owner, Carol and the staff were friendly and accomodationg. We needed a rental car one day and Carol booked it for us and had it delivered to the hotel.
