This was my children's first experience staying overnight in a hotel.

We arrived around 2:30, and the desk clerk told me our room was not ready, but would be ready around 3-3:15. We sat in the car while we waited, and came back in at 3:15, at which time the room was ready, but the clerk was helping someone else. She didn't even acknowlege that I was standing and waiting, which I didn't like--could have at least said she'd be right with me. Another woman showed up behind the desk, and helped me. She asked me if we wanted a room by the pool or on the 2nd floor, which was nice that she gave us options. I chose the second floor location because I figured the pool might get a bit loud--it's open until 10pm. The clerk gave me breakfast coupons for the restaurant for all of us, and a coupon for a free drink or dessert.
