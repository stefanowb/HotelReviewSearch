Lets start with the bad. The hotel is extremely large and seems to be an epicentre for what is going on in Times Square. If you like to be in the middle of things, this hotel is fantastic, but if not, it is very crowded. It can be near impossible to get a lift up to your room from the street level because of the hundreds of people trying to get to the times square shows under the hotel. With it being a large hotel, I was suprised to discover the lack of restauraunts. There was one marriott cafe that closed at 8:30 (NOT HELPFUL, especially after wanting as much time out in NY as possible) and an extremely over priced show case restauraunt on top of the hotel, that revolved around in useless circles so that you could see NY, but really you could see nothing. The food served there was probably worth a quarter of the price charged, and had EXTREMELY slow service, which the waiter gave me attitude about and blamed in on another large group. Needless to say, I am an Australian and am not used to leaving tips at the best of times, so this guy was not going well. After that \"experience\" I left a very small tip and never went back. Be careful as they try to pull the trick of putting an AUTOMATIC 18%!!!!!!! surcharge on the bill if u have more than 4 people. We had 5, so the $500 bill for the trash we ate went up t0 590. Rediculous! Moving on. Being a large hotel, service was lacking slightly, and it took a long time to get anything. Putting that aside, it was a top quality Marriott. The room I stayed in was newly furnished, with new TV and had a fantastic view over times square. Saying that, LOCATION LOCATION BABY!!!! This hotel is fantastc. Right in the middle of everything, walk out the door and Times Square just hits you. A great place. So, to wrap it up.

We knew the price would be expensive, but we were able to take advantage of the senior rate. There is a special check in line for elite members, which we took advantage of. Check in is on the 8th floor, as are some restaurants, shops, and lounges. We checked in the week after New Year's eve, and there was absolutely no wait. As soon as we arrived we were attended to by a check in associate, who was friendly and cordial. We mentioned our special occasion and asked if a room with a view was available. We were given a king room on the 36th floor overlooking Times Square....Wow, what a view!!! The room was a good size, clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable as were the six pillows provided. There were black out drapes, which were very efficient at blocking out the lights from Times Square and the room was dark at night and surprisingly quiet considering the hotel location. The elevator system in the hotel is very efficient...you punch in the floor you want to go to on a central keypad, and it tells you which of several elevators to get on, each identified with a letter of the alphabet. Most of the elevators are glass ones, and you get a terrific view of the inside of the hotel as you rise or lower. This is a huge hotel with 1,600 rooms and very impressive. The View lounge and restaurant on the 48th floor rotates with great views of NYC. To access the View, you have to take the elevator to the 3rd floor and change elevators to take a special one that goes directly up to the \"View\" location. Not a problem at all. They offer a restaurant and also a buffet or just drinks. Needless to say, it's pricey! Also, an $8 cover charge after 8pm. There are plenty of good restaurants right down the street on 46th, between 8th and 9th Ave. (restaurant row), which we took advantage of at more reasonable prices. We did have breakfast one day in the restaurant on the 8th floor, which was pricey with slow service. That was disappointing.

The first thing I thought as we went up the elevator was how much this hotel reminded me of the JW Marriott in San Francisco. When we arrived on the 8th floor to check in we queued for all of 3 minutes. We had 2 rooms and in a flash we were on our way to our rooms. Everywhere we turned in this hotel we were offered assistance. Our rooms were beautiful and clean. The beds were beyond comfortable. Plenty of good towels. Good water pressure in the shower. Check out was a breeze. We did so much shopping that we decided to ship what we bought back home. Not a problem. We called, \"At your service\" and a gentleman came up boxed up our purchases and off he went. We received the items in 3 days. I will note that I thought the security at the Crowne Plaza up the street was better than at the Marriott. At the Crowne one cannot get on the elevators without showing your room key. The other thing I will note is that the food was so expensive. I wasn't feeling well after the flight, and I ordered room service. I ordered a turkey sandwich, baked potato and small bottled water.

My favourite is probably the Waldorf Astoria but that went downhill after Hilton took over (although I understand it's now on the way back up). I found the Marquis on my very first stay whilst based at another hotel and back in those days the broadway lounge was a revolving bar. Today it's static, still with a great view, but I'll never understand why they introduced a revolving restaurant on the top floor of the hotel from which you can't actually see Times Square! I've recommended this hotel to friends and colleagues so I decided to give it a go myself this time and I have mixed feelings. It's in a great location and you really feel the buzz of NYC staying here. The rooms are modern and large which is another bonus in this town. They come with a coffee maker (also rare) and huge flat screen TVs. Good amenities and two Starbucks in the hotel plus a theatre ticket desk and even it's own theatre....so it pretty much has everything you need in shopping trip to the Big Apple. However, it's a massive hotel so it lacks character, the elevator system has been designed to cope (although some people don't like it, I thought it was fine) and, except for one concierge who was really helpful, the staff weren't that great.
