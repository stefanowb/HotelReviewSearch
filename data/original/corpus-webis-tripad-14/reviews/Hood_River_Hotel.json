No matter how many times my husband heard we were staying in an historic hotel, he still expected to park at the door and walk into his room! So, street parking was a surprise, plus you do have to pay the meter, the hotel had a discounted full or 1/2 day parking pass. The room was cozy, with period type furniture, and very clean. The building slopes a bit, so you sure have a feeling of being in an older place, but they did such a nice job of mixing the old and the new, it was a nice difference from an ordinary hotel stay. Staff members were very pleasant and helpful, including the restaurant area. On Tues. nights there is a band playing a jazzy, island sound in the lobby. Most guests ended up here at one time or another that evening enjoying the music. This was a pleasant step back in history (old hotel pictures are everywhere) with even an old fashioned gated elevator!", "title": "Historic step in time", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "PeggyZ", "date": "September 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5777734, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the old timey atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 metered street parking"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in this quaint hotel which is located at the end of the strip in old \"downtown\" Hood River.

I think it's unfair to assume that younger travellers won't enjoy this hotel. My husband and I are both in our 20's and we loved it! We never once felt out of place based on our age. In fact, the front desk staff seemed to be in their 20's themselves. It was over a year ago, so I unfortunately can't remember the ages of the other staff we saw, (mostly 30's and 40's maybe??). We did not see any age-discrimination behavior from the staff at all. We've stayed at expensive, modern establishments where they looked down their noses at us simply because we were \"that young couple\" and treated us like unwanted alien lifeforms because of our age, but this hotel is NOT one of those snooty places at all!
