It may seem strange but you have to go to the back of the building to access your front door. The back doors (patio doors) are facing the street and that may seem a bit weird but there is a dead bolt so we never felt unsafe at night (besides Longboat Key is very safe).", "title": "great place", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "loveflatrock", "date": "September 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 19960013, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 everthing", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Contrary to another review which said there were only 2 parking spots and 1 handicap spot, there are now 3 parking spots and 1 handicap spot.
