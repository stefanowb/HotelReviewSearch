She was very professional and did not hustle you around like the other tour agents in the lobby. She usually arrives in the lobby around 3pm. As far as the rooms, the are very damp, but keep in mind you are in Jamaica After the reading previous reviews, I packed my own sheets. I did not see any bugs on their sheets, but sprayed it downed just in case. The bed was hard and not that comfortable. Mosquitoes are very bad, so bring bug spray . The rooms were fairly clean each day, and that's very important. Most people should know not to leave your valuable items out in your room. This is our 2nd trip to Jamacia, if you have a choice, go to Ocho Rios. I only stayed here because we decided to be with the wedding party, but I would not return to this resort.
