I booked this hotel on priceline and got a really good rate. I read all the trip advisor reviews and knew I had made the right choice. I would have booked it for two nites but my husband didn't want me to because he thought what if we werent happy there and were stuck so I figured if we liked it we would jump on priceline the next morning and book it again. Anyway, when we arrived to check in, I told the desk clerk that it was our 20th anniversary and asked if we could have a view of the arch, he responded that it would be a 30$ upgrade! I told him to forget it and what ever room he put us in would be just fine. I inquired about internet, also an upgrade. I can't remember right now what the 3rd upgrade was for, but it was something that you would assume came included. Anyway, no smiles, no greeters, no \"happy anniversary\" nothing. I felt like a number in this hotel and not one of the employees in the lobby acknowledged our presence. Sure, it was a nice room and all, but customer service is where its at. I worked for one of the best hotel chains in the world for over 7 yrs and customer service was their highest priority and it showed. ( I worked for the Ritz Carlton, Amelia Island) So, just comparing, I would have rather stayed at a lesser hotel and enjoyed great customer service than staying at this hotel and being snubbed right at the door. Needless to say, the next morning we checked out and went to another, and let me just say, the next hotel blew the hyatt out of the water with thier customer service. Sorry Hyatt, you just didn't make the cut.
