I must say, when we pulled up to the Westin in Charlotte, it looked very impressive. The Concierge and Front Desk staff are fantastic. Friendly greetings and smile with what seems to be a genuine sincerity. The coming and going seems to be the best part of the stay. As I stepped out of the hall to my 7th story room, the first thing I noticed was two double beds. My reservations were for a king but since I was traveling by myself, not a problem. The room offered nothing more that a comparable express hotel room as far as features but did include a minibar. The bathroom seem outdated. The tub was in crappy shape with the stopper laying upside down in the drain with potential for going right through my foot. The spigot was turned sideways and was just not something I would consider customer friendly The nice 40+ inch HD tv was a nice added feature but was useless in that there were no HD channels that I could see. Every channel said Analog when surfing. As with any downtown premium hotel, the food prices tend to be high and this was no exception at the Westin. As I will tend to spend one night relaxing with a movie and room service, I could not bring myself to pay $20+ for burger, fries, and a drink. Breakfast was out of the question. I would stay at the Westin again for lets say, a weekend package for under $99.00, but not worth the $212, including taxes, I paid for this trip.", "title": "Underwhelmingly Westin", "user": "Stevied888", "date": "May 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 29334204}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Have been to many Westins and this was not quite like most Westins.

In the room, there was a dirty towel hanging in the bathroom that appeared to have make-up on it from a previous guest. On our second day, we returned to the room in mid-afternoon to notice that our room had yet to be serviced. I call guest services to find that you must now request for your room to be serviced...you do that by placing the reverse side of the \"Do Not Disturb\" card on your door. Oh, that card that we didnt have in our room. After 2 calls to Guest Services and an hour and a half later, our room was finally cleaned. To top the weekend off, my incidentals were charged to both my credit and debit card and the process of fixing that resulted in dealing with two extremely rude people in the Accounting department...only for them to discover that they were in error!
