To say the leaset!We started off our stay at the FABULOUS Disneyland Hotel and after a walk around the fantasic, majical Park with our 2 children aged 3 and 7 years we returned to the hotel to check in at 3.00 to be told we had been upgraded to the castle club WOW! The VIP service we received there was fantastic and sOOO friendly were the staff in the whole hotel! I had read reviews about the rooms being small but to me they were just as big as any other hotel room I have stayed in but more beautiful as Disney does! Also some people had written reviews about Disney being really expensive the only thing I saw that was pricey was the mini bar which you should avoid or you will pay 5.00 euro a bottle of water! Apart from that we ate in Mcdonalds as a treat for kids 25.00euro for burgers fries drinks deserts ect. for 4 which you would pay more for in Irelands McDonald's to be quite honest. Planet Hollywood great food but do request a time that morning at conceriage so you don't have to wait long , a meal there 4 main courses(2 adults, 2 children's meals) 1 beer ,1 wine which(in disney is very smallglasses of wine) and 2 deserts(children) 61 euro fine! We booked and pre-payed a food voucher before we left I would not do that again as if you don't make the booking for a specific disney resturant you will lose your money it is better to go and then see as you have SOOO much choice for food there and I thought the food was exceptional as was all of Disney! Our children actually got a virus going over and the help we had from the staff in the Disneyland Hotel was exceptional to say the least organising a doctor ,to cleaning our room whenever requested! I would not be able to fault the staff or service in this hotel at all.

Booked transfer witha company called tt-prestige who were great. We were greeted very warmly by the reception staff and made a fuss of the baby and 3 year old. All paperwork dealt with v efficiently, and room ready. Rooms ok - starting to show their age - but you dont spend much time there anyway. In saying that we all felt very comfortable. There is no fridge or tea/ coffee maker. TV has english disney channel. The hotel puts on a show of the characters at 4pm in the reception - if you have small kids dont miss it. Good photo op and autographs. We had booked several lunch and dinners before arrival (staying for 5 days). I would definately BOOK IN ADVANCE if you want to eat in the hotel. I spoke to several people who were told to come back around 10 pm for their evening meal (with kids) because they had not booked. Ate in inventions buffet (food was good, and good choice, also offered oz wine - difficult to get in France, characters walk about and spent as long as you wanted with the kids). Also ate in Calfornian Grill - a bit more adult - but the kids were welcome - food good. The food is pricey - but that is hotel restaurants. We also ate in the village at cafe mickey - v. busy but good fun. The park closes at 7.30 so around that time there is a mad rush to queue for the restaurants. The location of the hotel is perfect for the park - 2 mins walk. There is also a baby shop (\"buttons and bows\" i think it was called) on your right as you go in to the park- which sells nappys, baby food etc. The shop in the hotel sells all disney stuff - with a cooler for diet coke, water and milk - but expensive - 2.50E for a diet coke. The spa/pool area was very good - quiet. Sauna/steam in each changing room and jacuzzi at pool area. All staff were v pleasant and did their best to make you feel welcome. We would definately stay here again. pip pip", "title": "Dream hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Queen21", "date": "September 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 20308886, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location to Disneyland park", "disliked": "\u2014 Could replace Mattress."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in disneyland hotel France for three nights.", "title": "Worth every single penny - fantastic stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "portsmouth_sam", "date": "September 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 20305399, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything from the second we walked in I felt like royalty", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing to mention, could not fault one single thing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with family", "text": "When we checked in after 20 minutes of standing around we were directed to our room on the 2nd floor.", "title": "Our daughter had a great time !", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "svwhat", "date": "September 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 20110592, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 No coffee and tea facilities in the room"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I have never written a review before but as we had such a fantastic 4 days at the Disneyalnd Hotel during Feb half term I felt I had to write. I booked the hotel on the strength of recommendations from this site and was not disappointed. We travelled with a 5 year old and 2 year old from St Pancras and on the train a disney employee came to our seats to hand us our park passes and luggage labels. At Marne la vallee we took our luggage to disney express and within 10 minutes we were at the park gates and 5 minutes after that having lunch outside on mainstreet - so very slick operation. At 3pm we went to the hotel and checked in. We had a lovely room on the first floor overlooking the eurostar station towards disney village. the room had 2 double beds, table and 2 chairs and a travel cot, wardrobe etc and still plenty of room for all of us. We loved the little touches like bathrobes and slippers and the lovely toilettres which were refreshed each day - our kids loved the coins on the pillows that appeared every evening which we said tinkerbell left! The buffet breakfast was amazing - so much food and excellent quality and we never had to wait for a table although we got later and later each morning! The disney characters in the foyer were great and meant we didn't have to stand around in the park waiting for photos. The 2 minute walk to the park gates was excellent as if were feeling cold or tired we could come back for a break. The hotel shop was good and sold water/soft drinks and some other essentials. In all we had a great time and can't wait to go again when the kids are older. I would also recommend going out of season as the longest we queued for a ride was 20 minutes so we went on favourite rides many times over the 4 days. It cost approx \u00a31200 for the 4 days with eurostar so wasn't cheap but still think it was worth it!", "title": "Loved our trip!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "AMHH", "date": "March 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14187949}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled with family", "text": "THe holiday was pretty good - the theme parks were awesome but the hotel was only good.

Simply for one reason, No Queues for anything in the hotel... Having your own restaurant, better accomodation, lift to the park, fastpass, one-to-one access to the disney characters made the holiday very special. Couldn't help feeling a little smug every morning looking over the Castle Club balcony onto the people queuing to get into the hotel restaurant who hadn't upgraded to Castle Club. We were fortunate to have a room looking right down main street and on to the Disney castle, the people in the hotel were very helpful and spoke multiple languages. Overall a magical experience and I miss the addictive (but not at all anoying) disney music that follows you everywhere you go!

On the table was a vase of fresh roses and a 15th Anniversary mug containing sweets, which my three year old daughter believed was from Tinkerbell! The bathroom was equally impressive.

We arrived on the 7th january for three nights and imagine our surprise to see the hotel still decorated in all its Christmas finery - it was such a beautiful sight. We got checked in very quickly even though it was busy at the reception - extra staff appeared from the offices behind the counter! We got a beautiful spacious room on the fourth floor with views out over the pool and surrounding garden, the room was spotless and seemed to be very well equiped and maintained. Breakfast each day was as yummy as last year with plenty of choices across the board - we were delighted that tea and coffee was left in pots on your table - this was a small gripe last year - great to see they notice customer comments! The room was cleaned throughly each day and the turndown service with chocolate coins left on your pillow is still there. The swimming pool was open this year and our family had a swim each night after the parks closed and before dinner, others have commented that the pool is small but we found it fine and the temp was great. Kids were allowed to use the jacuzzi which my two girls were delighted with! We ate dinner in Inventions and it was as good as we had remembered with lots of fresh seafood and other great choices e.g. quaill and wild mushroom (yum) pork in apple cider sauce, beef fillet and a few different chicken dishes. The kids found lots to suit their taste too - pizza, fish fillets, chicken drumsticks, lasagne and spagetti bolognese. There were lots of characters coming to the table and they stayed chatting to the girls for as long as they wanted. We found the lounge a very restful place to go during the day between changes in parks - we had a hot drink and warmed up! Immediately after leaving the Park in the evening we had a cocktail each night which was a lovely way to unwind before our swim. The staff seemed even more attentive this year with lots of smiles and hellos.
