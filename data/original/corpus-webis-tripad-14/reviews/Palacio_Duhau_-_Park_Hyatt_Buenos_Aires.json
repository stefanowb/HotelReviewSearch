The hotel has two parts, a \"mansion\" on Avenida Alvear and a newer \"tower\" on Posadas. I was fortunate enough to stay in both places and recommend the tower over the mansion. The best of both worlds is to stay in the tower with a room that overlooks the courtyard between the two buildings and offers a majestic view of the old mansion.

One can walk through the courtyard separating the buildings or one can walk under the courtyard through the hotel's art gallery. There were two separate exhibits while we were there, so they must change the art frequenty. It added a nice touch. There are two separate reception desks and concierge desks - one in each building. This was a great idea and one I haven't seen before. Finally, there are two separate entrances with full service, one on Posadas and one on Avenida Alvear.
