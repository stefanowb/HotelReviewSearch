Ours was on the smaller side, three single beds crammed in with just enough room to walk past each bed. Wallpaper peeling of the walls, holes in the wall from coat hooks, sockets that could not be used as they pushed through into the cavity, plus the sockets required a three pin adapter before you use your european adapter! The main light above the large mirror on the wall also failed to work. The heating in the room was just good enough to take the chill off the room, which was of no use as the window was permenantly open and could not be closed. Although there was a notice on the window telling you not to open the window as it is a maintenance window. We were not alone with these complaints. The location of the hotel seemed strange too, very difficult to find a decent restaurant or shops, next door is a restaurant with pizzeria written above the door but they told us that they do not sell pizza. They did manage to feed all 54 of us with plates of antipasti, pasta and fried fish, with plenty of wine. So hats off to them for that. Food at the hotel was ok, but it was nothing compared to the photo's supplied on the web site. This hotel also appeared to be short staffed, as the Guy serving Breakfast also served dinner and we also saw him running the bar, which was completely under stocked and rarely open. The last thing to remember is not to leave your passport with them as this is placed behind the reception counter and not kept in a secure place. The counter is not continually staffed. The Hotel staff did try to be helpfull and it was clean and tidy. My title for the review says it all.
