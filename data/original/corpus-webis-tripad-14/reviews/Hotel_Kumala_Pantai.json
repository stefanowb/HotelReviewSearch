Having stayed earlier at the Jayakarta (practically nnext door) we would rate the Kumala Pantai much higher. Whilst similar the pools are better and the breakfast is much better. Only one complaint is that they should invest in a better quality of linen - both towels and sheets. The Junior Siute is a bargain. At 950,000 rp/nite (about US$90) with two rooms a huge bathroom and a patio three steps from the pool it was fantastic. Position is unbeatable with easy access to shops and restaurants.

The new wing pool and bar are great as we had a choice of 2 pools with the connecting hotel. There new massage and beauty centre is a big winner and we used it often, although more expensive than on the street it was more of a professional option as the staff are well trained.", "title": "Value for Money", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Ozejim", "date": "March 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25408008}], "location": {"country": "Indonesia", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Kuta"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 17, "average": 54, "very good": 173, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 117}, "aka": "Kumala Pantai Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.223602484472, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}}
