The stay here was superb; this is an idyllic quite location which has everything for a young family. Our 22 month old spent most of the time in the children\u2019s pool which she did not want to get out, there is the use of an indoor spa pool for a few hours if you want to get out of the midday heat. There is pool waiter service so there is never a need to leave the comfort of you sun lounger. The use of the spa and a massage half way through the holiday was a treat and worth every penny, there are 35 min treatments right up to 2 hours, the costs for the treatments range from $65 euro\u2019s to $250 euro\u2019s. The food within the hotel was delicious and the menu is changed every 3 days and all the staff are more than helpful. If you are half board then take advantage of the dine around in the marina but double check which restaurants are part of that. The ever so friendly reception staff will give you a gold card which entitles you to 10% off the majority of the restaurants. One of the top dine spots is tomato top quality fusion food with a top quality price to go with it, maybe a bit disappointed with the fish mish mash which was around $250 euro\u2019s, would I get it again probably not. Make sure you book well in advance as most get fully booked quite quickly. When you\u2019re done, have a wonder around the boutiques in the marina which have everything a woman would need and no pound land here just over priced cloths for the rich holiday sun cruisers, the Staff are friendly just follow you around the shop making you feel a little un-comfy. There is a child care from 10 am to 1 pm for a bit of time to yourself if you want it. Staying at this resort also gives you access to the a private beach area where again you have all the service you need just wave the flag and you are waited on hand and foot. In the resort there is also a children\u2019s play area with a child minder so you can eat and enjoy the fine dining and Greek wines. From there relax by the pool bar, or if you have young children there is a free DVD rental service. And most of all enjoy. We will defiantly be going back.", "title": "Better then Perfect", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Jasonscott80", "date": "May 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129945943}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The most friendly resort, top service and very high attention to detail, lovely to kids of all ages and the coomon areas are very luxurious and comfortable, a great place for a relaxing few days break. the spa was way to expensive so we gave that a miss!", "title": "Port Sani in Halkidiki", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "deborahfelstein", "date": "May 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129560231}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled with family", "text": "If you are looking for somewhere that caters for families and a little bit of luxury (ok, quite a lot of luxury) you won't regret booking Porto Sani Village. The service is excellent. All the staff love kids and the kids love the resort. The resort if very well maintained. The kids club is great. Food is excellent and the restaurants at the marina are also very good. The adults only pool is a guilty pleasure. If your kids are teenagers I'd recommend the Sani Hotel or Beach Club. If you are a couple I'd avoid school holidays. Everyone we speak to is there because of a recommendation and we are family of 5 (2 x seven years olds and a 3 year old) and have been three times in the last four years. We love it.

It is perfect for families with small children. Besides this resorts fantastic pools, restaurants, beach and spa, you have access to the other sani resorts next door as well as all the restaurants on the marina which is right outside the resort. We went with another family. We each had a 5 year old and 3 month old babies The older kids loved the pool and the beach. They went to the kids club only once but liked it. We also sent them for tennis lessons. I loved the spa and the breakfast was incredible. We preferred to eat at the restaurants on the marina rather than at the resort but that works out well too as the restaurants can bill your room directly and also give you a discount as a Sani guest. I don't think it'll be exciting for older kids due to limited water sports at the resort.

It definitely is a fantastic hotel if you have babies/ toddlers in tow. The Manager and staff are happy to help at all times. However, the biggest downside is that none of the pools are heated. We went in May 2012 and unfortunately had pretty mixed weather, however being English would still have braved the pool had it been heated. However it was FREEZING!

The resort is very much geared toward families and our trip during term time meant most children were pre schoolers and babies. The best part of this being if your child became grizzly at any time you won't feel like you're ruining anyone else's holiday as everyone else will be tolerant/understanding/dealing with the same grizzles from their own kids! The suite was nice, spacious and comfy. Couple of minor gripes, like nowhere to hang wet towels in the bathroom. They do change them twice per day, but I'd rather do my bit for the environment and reuse. Dine around was great, Tomata was our fave by far, but we enjoyed everywhere. Breakfast is also lovely, great selection and best of all there's a kiddy play area which meant a more relaxing meal for parents. The marina is lovely to wander round. Porto pools are really nice, but again couple of things that could easily make it better - the kids pool area is completely in the sun. Just a partial canopy would mean kids could splash all day without being exposed to the sun, most of our toddler's grumps were caused by us telling her she needed to come out of the pool to be in the shade. Also the indoor pool is freezing, in spite of claims to be heated. The beach is lovely, nice sand for castle building and plenty of sunbeds all with parasols. Also the cr\u00e8che was great, the staff were super nice and the facilities are excellent. Our daughter spent 3 hours there on several days. It's about a 10 minute walk from the village but you can get a ride on a golf cart if you feel lazy :-) there's also a good size playground. Overall perfect for relaxing, but don't come here if a) you don't like children or b) you want to see much authentic Greek culture.

We don't usually go back to places but we've made an exception with Porto Sani. Sakis, Victoria, the Maitre D' and in fact the whole team go to great lengths to make your holiday perfect. Their attention to detail reminds me of 5 star hotels in the Far East but with a more informal and friendly tone. The facilities, suite accommodation and especially the food in the Artemis restaurant are really excellent. The beaches are great with a private beach area exclusively for PSV guests, with Babe Watch service for little ones if you want to go for a swim or read your book for a bit, and drinks and meals delivered to your sunbed from the Ibiza-esque Sea You Up restaurant (also good for a grown up evening drink or meal). We like the ouzerie in the harbour and at Sani beach club, the Greek fish restaurant next to the supermarket overlooking the harbour is also good. Sea You Up is also very good and the Water Restaurant at Sani Asterias Suites has Michelin standard food........with prices to match......we paid 260 euros for dinner for 2 with drinks......one for a v special occasion and the yacht owners!! We thought Tomata restaurant was v poor, and the Macaroni ok but nothing special. Highly recommend the Greek Night at the Artemis on a Wednesday. The free sunset cruise on Saturday is a nice touch -would recommend that. The kids club is very good, our kids enjoy hiring bikes to ride round the resort and loved the playground. Our girls are aged 5 and 7, and whilst last year they made lots of friends by the pool, this year it was almost all babies and children aged 0 to 3, but possibly it's just the time of the year.
