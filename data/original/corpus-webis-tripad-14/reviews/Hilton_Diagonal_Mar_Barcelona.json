The bathroom looked great, but the shower door leaked so after a shower you stepped into a large puddle of water. And the first morning there was no hot water, so no shower or shaving - did not expect that at all! The bed was comfortable, and we did get one complimentary water bottle each day; lighting in the room was good. Views of the waterfront were great, and the hotel location for us was fine; enjoyed the tram and metro close by to get you anywhere quickly, and the mall with the foodcourt across the street. Didn't use their internet; way too expensive and the mall across the street offers it for free. Executive floor was good offering breakfast, and then small snacks, fresh fruit, and drinks throughout the day. Overall the stay there was very good; but it seems they put more effort into making the room look good in a photo, and place less effort on functionality. They did try to overcharge me handsomely at check-out, but they were very pleasant about correcting the billing issue.", "title": "High on looks, less on function", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ats262m", "date": "March 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 58743662}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel is located on the edge of Barcelona beside a very large modern shopping mall - not what you would travel to Spain for.

By the time we arrived at the hotel, it was around 7.30pm, there were no porters available, so we brought our luggage up ourselves to reception. Check in was smooth and we were allocated an upgraded room on the 26th floor. The room was light and airy with a king bed and nice furnishings. Shortly after we booked, we were contacted by the hotel to advise that their executive lounge would be closed for refurbishment, however they were happy to offer us free internet use and vouchers for free drinks at the lounge bar. We were advised that our luggage would be brought up to our room shortly. Indeed about 10 minutes later the porter arrived with our luggage. He apologised that he was not outside to meet us as he had taken a short break. It was nice of him to apologise. Once settled, we went downstairs for a drink and met an American couple who were also taking a cruise the next day, although on a different ship from us. We were given a couple of drinks vouchers when we checked in and I offered these to the barman when I went to the bar. He said that he would take care of that later and that he would brink our drinks over. This is how the evening continued. We sat with the American couple chatting for a very pleasant couple of hours during which time the barman kept bringing over drinks. About 11pm we decided to go to bed, I gave the barman 10 Euro and asked if he wanted our vouchers, he thanked me for the tip and said, he would take care of everything. We let the vouchers on the table and went to bed very happy. We had a great nights sleep, the bed was comfortable and the a/c worked fine. Breakfast was very good indeed. Staff were very friendly and efficient and the choice of food was excellent, all the usual items were there, along with several Spanish dishes. After breakfast, we went back to our room and packed as were were booked for one more night in another hotel before our cruise on 23rd Dec. We called down for a porter and one arrived quickly and took our luggage to the lobby. We went down and chcked out. Again everything went smoothly. The porter called us a cab and loaded our luggage into the boot for us, I gave hime something his trouble and we went on our way. We enjoyed our short stay at this hotel and we are looking forward to going back in May 2010 for 2 nights. 10/10", "title": "Great hotel, friendly service, nice rooms", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mklovesny", "date": "January 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 52759799}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Location", "text": "There is a lovely shopping mall across the road from the Hotel You have loads of restaurants bars shops etc", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "jtsj16", "date": "December 29, 2009", "id": 52107148}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel is very modern.
