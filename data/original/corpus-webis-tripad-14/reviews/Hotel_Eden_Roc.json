Look no further book your room now. We stayed at the Eden Roc the first week in May. We could not have had a more pleasant experience at this delightful charming hotel. The owner Domenico and his two sons Raffaele and Lorenzo could not have been more helpful and gracious. They made suggestions about our daily itinerary and helped with transportation and restaurant reservations. Cafe Positano was wonderful! The hotel staff was extremely efficient. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and being greeted by a warm and friendly reception each morning. Carlo was particularly helpful and knowledgeable about Italian wines and added to our memories at the Eden Roc. Our junior suite was very spacious and well designed. We had a large balcony with a \"breathtaking view\". The hotel was spotless. Not only was it charming but it was very clean and well maintained. It truly lives up to its rating and more! We would like to thank the Cassola family and staff at Eden Roc for making our stay in beautiful Positano and the Amalfi Coast one we will never forget.
