Don't expect luxury, do expect a great experience at a bargain price. You will never find proprietors more friendly and welcoming, and the area is very aptly named (Vallehermoso = beautiful valley). The town is pleasant, with some reasonable restaurants and bars. The hotel overlooks it and the valley beyond and so many rooms - certainly ours - have wonderful views. The rooms are clean and simply but tastefully decorated, and the food is really good. The small dining room is very conducive to friendly conversations with other guests. There's also a small but beautiful garden area, and a shaded table on a terrace overlooking the valley which is delightful when its hot. You can get teas, coffees etc brought out for a very reasonable charge.", "title": "wonderful - don't miss this hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "peterjames2000", "date": "March 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14302915, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 character, owners, views", "disliked": "\u2014 leaving"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with family", "text": "If you're a hiker you could easily spend a few days walking, with varying degrees of strenuousness, from the hotel. In addition to climbing up the valley (as described in the previous review) you can also walk down c 4 kms to a small beach - too rough for swimming alas so there is a summer lido. A German artist has restored an old building there and turned it into a small gallery, cafe and occasional performance venue - see www.castillo-del-mar.com. It has a dramatic location on a wave pounded promontory, and beautiful views of the coast, Tenerife and La Palma. We were fortunate to have nice weather and I don't think we've ever been in a more inspiring location. (NB Although the road down from the hotel is fairly quiet, you can bypass part of it by walking on the trail by the barranco that farmers use to access their crops - which are themselves fascinating to see. Never seen avocados growing on trees before! You can also access a neglected but fascinating botanical garden this way.)", "title": "Rustic bliss!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "911SC", "date": "January 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12298068, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The views and the friendly owners", "disliked": "\u2014 Cold showers"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Only two very minor downsides - parking as mentioned (we parked down on the main square and could see the car from our room), and some noise from cockerels and dogs which, although some way away, seems to be magnified by an 'echo chamber' effect from the valley walls.
