We ate in a comfortable room, were served coffee or tea, fresh squeezed juice and pancakes every morning. The buffet included eggs, meat, cheese, fresh fruit, breads, Hans' homemade jam, granola, yogurt and cereal. During breakfast Hans was always available to answer questions, give advice or just chat. It was also an opportunity to talk with the other guest and share suggestions about things to do or restaurants to go to. It is a family run business whose owners make their guests feel like family.
