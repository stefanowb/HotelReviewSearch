Booked directly with hotel website 30 days in advance and received an excellent rate. We booked a king room with the most comfortable and enormous king size bed ever. We even thought about buying the bed as it is available on the minibar list!!! The room was not as large as I expected from their onsite information, but was more than comfortable with a desk and chair, easy chair and ottoman, tv cabinet, baggage rack, wardrobe with courtesy slippers and robes, and the largest minibar and servery I have seen anywhere around the world. The bathroom and minibar area had mirrors everywhere. The bathroom had a separate bath and large shower, large vanity and loads of bench space for toiletry bags. The provided shampoo/conditioner/soaps etc were of a very high quality. Didn't hear any noises from adjoining rooms or the hallway. The only problem was the room was rather stuffy without ensuring the aircon was on low. And the very warm quilt got too warm without the aircon on all night. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel so I cannot comment on that. Valet parking was an extra charge but well worth the expense.", "user": "mep01", "date": "October 27, 2007", "id": 10381862}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "It's Okay - Definitely Overpriced Given the Lack of Quality", "text": "Given the price in regards to other hotels in the Melbourne market, I was expecting Four Seasons-like quality and service - boy was I wrong. Basic things like the towels and furnishings are average to low budget - simply inexcusable. To this day, I wince at the thought of toweling off in the shower with the sandpaper that passes for a towel at the Langham. I stayed four (4) nights (9/24 - 9/27), so I was present long enough to make a proper assessment (the towels never got better). The bed is great and everything else, including the food, is medicore at best - but expensive relative to the Melbourne market - definitely not worth AUD 300 / night considering the other options available such as the Westin and Crown properties. In general, the staff is unusually young, naive, and in need of some immediate training/polish. Stayed an additonal night down the river at the Crown Promenade - definitely nicer (larger, more comfortable room with modern furnishings) and slightly cheaper. Don't waste your time at the Langham.", "user": "GolfBiz", "date": "October 7, 2007", "id": 10047845}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What an expereience", "text": "This Hotel has it all, the views are fantastic ask for a room that over looks the River. The Reception is lovely. When you are in the Room you feel like you could stay for quite some time. The BED is so comfortable, and massive pillows that you just sink into. The only downfall I have for this Hotel is that it is extremely expensive and you are on the other side of the River so it does have a good 10 to 15 minute walk across the bridge to the main shopping streets and theatres etc. This is a Hotel that if you want to indulge stay here.", "user": "colin65Melbourne", "date": "September 28, 2007", "id": 10014024}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific", "city": "Melbourne"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 36, "average": 110, "very good": 360, "terrible": 27, "excellent": 1490}, "aka": "The Langham, Melbourne Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.00561797752809, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}}
