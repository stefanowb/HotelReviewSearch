The drive to the hotel (we live a few hours north of West Baden) was beautiful this time of year, and we stopped at several antique stores along the way to poke around. The French Lick Village Market antique mall was very fun with a quirky mix of new items and antiques. Found a beautiful candelabra there! Check in at West Baden was easy and the room was exactly as described here and on the hotel website. Couldn't find any pictures of the bathrooms so have posted those here. Slightly disappointed that the bathroom had no soaking tub, for a room of this price I would expect at least a soaking tub, if not a jetted tub. Room service for dinner and breakfast was fast and the food was delicious. Gambled a little in the casino at French Lick, the reviewers on here are correct that it is very smokey and a shame that the ventilation isn't better equipped. I've been to Las Vegas numerous times and the casinos there were never this smokey (at least not on the strip, some of the downtown casinos could get pretty bad). The designated nonsmoking gambling room was great and much more comfortable for our lungs. The history of both hotels is amazing, and we wished we had more time for the guided tours as we had lots of questions about both resorts once we were able to walk around and enjoy the surroundings. Shuttle was no problem and fast between both resorts, we used it twice, once early in the evening, and once about 2:00am, and both times no long waits. Had drinks in the lounge at West Baden and enjoyed the live band, very fun people watching, many dressed for halloween. Will definitely return.", "title": "Romance and History", "user": "ilona06", "date": "October 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119905644}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Great hotel!

There are lots of rocking chairs on the verandas to help you enjoy the peaceful surroundings. However, the grounds were underwhelming.

If you can muster up 8 people together you can do it for as little as roughly $150 per person. It is an experience you will never forget. Quite unique! Wander the grounds and study the interior...it will take you several hours. For entertainment the neighboring French Lick Resort has a Casino and a bowling alley, on occasion entertainment as well.

Valet parking was not going to work for us as we needed access to the car and bikes later in the afternoon. The bellmen seemed to take offense that we were not valet parking. He also was rude about how long it was sitting there when we were clear we were checking in.... Later we witnessed a bellman telling motorcylists that they could not park in the self park area due to liability when there were no signs indicating there was special motorcycle parking. It was very rude and offensive to all who saw this incident. The staff at the front desk was also snooty to us at check in and at check out.

The hotel has been lovingly and truthfully restored to its glorious past magnificence. We were invited to afternoon tea by friends who were celebrating one of the spouse's birthday..We were seated in an area in the lobby and were able to admire pretty much everything. The wait staff brought English style sandwiches and trays of tea samples. We were to indicate our choice after which they brought 3 pots of our favorites. Unfortunately the tea pots were not marked so after the first cup we were reduced to guessing which is which tea. The wait staff were pretty average--we could tell they were anxious for us to leave..So the bottom line is: go for tea in the early afternoon not late and ask them to place stickers or some identification on the tea pots for those times when the wait staff were not around to pour.
