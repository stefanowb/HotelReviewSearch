Our room was simple, clean and nice...no major frills! You will be able to walk to everything. The beach is a rocky tiny inlet...we had to purchase towels and mats once we arrived. Breakfast was great! Do not hesitate to book a room here...we had a great long weekend!!! We flew into Bari, rented a car was arrived withing 30 minutes. You will not find a ton of tourists--which we liked!
