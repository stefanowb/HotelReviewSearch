Extremely friendly service from everyone in the hotel. Very conveniently located for the tube, and even on the weekends when Tower Hill station was closed, it was easy to walk to another station within 15-20 minutes.

Rooms are clean and have a very modern design: light woods, white walls, black and white photo on the wall. The rooms can seem a bit soul-less/pale, so if you want a place with a rustic, cosy feel, the Mint will not suit you as well. Standard rooms are compact in size, and baths feature a shower cubicle (no tub). A good room amenity is the Apple IMac with free internet. Beds are comfortable, and there are a few different pillow options available upon request. Location is 5 minutes from Fenchurch St station, and less than 5 minutes to Tower Hill tube station. There are a lot of good restaurant options nearby, including those at St. Catherines' Dock at the foot of Tower Bridge. The rooftop cocktail bar has lovely views over London.
