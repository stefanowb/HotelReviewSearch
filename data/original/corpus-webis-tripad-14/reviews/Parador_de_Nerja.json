Although the building does not look like an ancient Spanish castle as the typical Paradores do, but more like a modern apartment building, we were pleasantly surprised. The initial contact at the reception was somehow reserved, but the same people became very friendly and attentive later on. All staff were very friendly, housekeeping excellent. The room was functional, very clean, and had a balcony with a beautiful sea view. All rooms have sea view. It was quiet, except that on the east side there are some emissions from nearby bars, they close around midnight. There is no ironing board nor a coffee maker/kettle in the room, beds are comfortable, television has a great variety of channels, including cnn and bbc, air-conditioning. A bit annoying are the small portion soft drinks in the minibar, all 2 dl bottles, if you are thirsty, the minibar is empty pretty soon. It was a smoking room, much appreciated even though I preferred to smoke on the balcony. A real highlight was the breakfast, with all kind of warm dishes and a great variety of fruit, bread, cold meat, cheese, etc. It's one of the best breakfast buffets I've seen in Europe. As the weather was warm and sunny , we could sit on the terrace and enjoy the sea view. There is a nice and well groomed garden with interesting species of trees I had never seen before. The swimming pool was closed for maintenance, a pity, because the sea was not very warm (about 17 C). Beach by the way very clean and water transparent. The lift/elevator to the Burriana beach is spectacular. From the hotel a nice ten minute walk through typical Andalusian lanes takes you to the centre of Nerja with the famous Balcon de Europa. Other upsides are free internet in the lobby, and reception orders priceworthy taxis (e.g. only 70 euros to Malaga Airport).
