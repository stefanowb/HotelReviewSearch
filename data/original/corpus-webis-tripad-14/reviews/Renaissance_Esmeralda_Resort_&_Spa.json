During this time the Pacific Life Tennis Open event was going on which I also attended. This property is five to eight minutes away depending on a bit of traffic but excellent location when attending that event. It was big and spacious and very overwhelming for one who had not seen it up close before, there are two entrances, one that seemed to lead directly to the front desk and valet and the other to the main lobby of the hotel. With so much activity going on, one needs to be sure on what they will need, if it's help with your bags or you want the valet to park your car, you may have to be assertive and ask as there current guests going in and out of there at the same time. Quite alot of hussle and bussle that is for sure. The inside lobby is spacious and well kept, with a coffee shop and other shops popping up, there is a grand staircase which leads down to the pool area and lower level lounge and open sports bar. Very impressive and nice to look at on a sunny day, the rooms are big and full of light, mine was overlooking the courtyard and of course it was a hoot to see the tennis stars coming and going, not to mention running into a few while walking around my floor, in the elevator and the coffee shop on the grounds (which was a personal favorite as they made this large chocolate sugar cookies, that were incredibly tasty...I had one every day I was there) Also, there was a cobb salad from the room service menu that was awesome as well! Let's not beat around the bush, prices are up there, but, hey you knew that right? since you will choose to stay at this property. No whining from the peanut gallery. Just have a good time, and the good time will come right back at ya!", "title": "\"Quite a place\"", "user": "AdrianS779", "date": "December 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121825470}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled on business", "text": "The complex is large and at times a bit overwhelming, but we found our room on the sixth floor overlooking the gorgeous mountains to be very comfortable.

My family and I will never ever stay at this property again. When we arrived at the valet area to check in on 12/02/11; the attendants just stared at us while we started unloading all of our luggage. Later that evening I met up with some friends that live in the area for some drinks at your bar downstairs over looking the pool. I ordered a bottle of red wine and the bartender gave me 3 spotted small wine glasses. I looked at the glasses and asked the bartender for 3 nice big cabernet glasses I saw in the near distance, and he said NO, we don't give those out because hotel guests steal them. I practically had to bag for 3 cabernet wine glasses to enjoy the $75 bottle of wine I just bought. After that my friends and I went out by the fire pit to enjoy the wine, 15 minutes later a bartender comes outside, doesn't say a word to us, and turns off the firepit. My group went inside and the male manager informed us it was a code that the firepits had to be turned off. If it was a code for the gas firepits to be turned off, why was the entire pool still being heated by gas still on. He told us we can enjoy our wine inside in the nightclub. We went inside and the nightclub attendant told us we can't take the wine in the club. It was starting to get ridiculous.... I saw another manger walk by (female w/blonde hair) and informed her of our issues and asked if I may have her business card and she said NO in a rude way and asked if I was even staying at this hotel and stormed off...... Later that morning I spoke to the female manager behind the counter at checkout and informed her of our problems with our stay and she said she would look into this, didn't even apologize................ I can not believe how poor the customer service is for a property this beautiful... I will make sure to inform all of my friends not to ever stay at this property.
