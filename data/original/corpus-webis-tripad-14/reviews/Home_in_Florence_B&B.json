The room, with painted ceiling, lovely antique furniture, mini-fridge, and a huge bathroom, was incredibly clean. We had plenty of hot water, a rarity in Italy. The free internet access was a welcome touch. The location was great as it was only 15 minutes from the main attractions. The street was mostly quiet, save for the rare motorino in the middle of the night. The breakfast, which is served at a bar down the street and around the corner, was fantastic. The barista, Giancarlo, is welcoming, and we enjoyed being part of the fabric of Florentine daily life, watching people stop in for a cappucino before making their way to work or to drop their kids at school.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "m&badventures", "date": "March 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6911080}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007", "text": "If you're planning a visit to Florence and think that staying in the historic center is the only way to go, think again!!!
