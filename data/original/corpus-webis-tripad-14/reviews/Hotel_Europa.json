We did a trip to Florence for the day (1 hour) by train. It is about 15 minutes walk down to Piazza Maggiore, the central part of town. Our first impression of the hotel was not good. The man who was on reception when we checked in was really rude. He wanted to keep our passports and give them back to us later simply because he couldn't be bothered to photocopy them. We asked some basic questions which required information especially as it was Holy Week and we wanted to know about the religious services and he couldn't answer them. That evening when we came back a different man was on and he was extremely helpful and gave us alot of information (during our visit he was the only one). We stayed 4 days there and during that time we found the reception staff, women included less than pleasant and very unhelpful. This brings me to the other point on all three mornings, we were woken at 8.30am by the housekeeping staff. They seemed to take great delight in banging the doors of rooms loudly shut, banging their vaccum cleaner into walls and speaking at the top of their voices. The rooms have a red light on the outside which indicates it is occupied yet cleaning staff had absolutely no consideration for guests who may have been asleep. On a positive note, the breakfast was excellent value and included. You could eat as much as you liked with cereals, croissants and other pastries, eggs, bacon, ham, salami , fruit, yoghurt etc.. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend the restaurant La Mela at 5 Via Fusari for dinner. Also the Basilica Di San Domenico is worth a visit, it has a beautiful cloister and St Domenic's tomb is there. I also enjoyed the market area off Piazza Maggiore. Also Eataly is a great place for food lovers to enjoy a glass of wine and some traditional food. Bologna is a beautiful city to explore with its covered walk ways and much more.
