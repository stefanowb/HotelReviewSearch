Well, villas are not that available on Crete, so we were advised by a Fodor's certified commentor to check out the Ammos Hotel. We're glad we did. The staff was a amazing. Friendly, hard working and eager to please. We loved the food and thought it was a wonderful modern take on classic Greek dinning. Try the Greek yogurt parfait with crushed graham crackers at the bottom. Wonderful. Mykos, the owner, was astonishingly accessible. He recommended a number of great activities for my family and children. My kids are older--21, 22 and 24--and they were in the minority. There were a lot of younger partners with kids ages 2 to 6 years old. All of them were remarkably well behaved--the Brits being so much more mindful of their kids being polite than Americans (I am American so I can say that). The style and design of the Ammos is very contemporary. The location, on the beach, can't be beat. It turned out that this hotel had the intimacy of a villa but with a great staff who dotes over guests. Great job! Worth having three rooms for the weeks. Thanks everyone at the Ammos for making our stay so memorable. Some day, some way, we will be back. PS the Coco Mat mattresses are dreamy.

Feels like being forced to leave home. Because that's what this hotel is about : making You feel like You are at home and they do excel like very few do. This is a small property, with only few rooms, so from the very first moment You enter Ammos, You feel as if You've arrived at a friends house. The owner Nikos will probably greet You at the reception and show You to Your room. We didn't even bother unpacking, because the smell coming from the restaurant was just too much to resist. Ammos Cretan cuisine at its best. Absolute respect for the freshest product. The feeling of the place is laid back elegance. The room I stayed with my 2 daughters was a double, but it didn't feel crowded at all. If You decide to stay at the hotel and linger by the pool or sunbathe at the beach You will have attentive and smiling staff pampering You in every possible way. If You want to exploer, Nikos will give You the best tips - trust him, he knows the most beautiful (and tasty) places on the island. We were in a group of 9 : 4 adults and 5 kids and all of us feel like we left a piece of our hearts in this beautiful place.

There is limited storage space due to the presence of the kitchenette, which could be very useful if you have children in tow. The bathroom was small but functional, with a lovely rain shower, soft fluffy towels and Apivita toiletries (available in M&S in the UK). We didn't find any problem with ventilation unlike a previous reviewer, nor for that matter were there any cats around.

We really loved Hotel Ammos and would definitely recommend it. It is best for couples and families with young children rather than teenagers. If you don't like children this may not be the hotel to come to as other reviewers have said, but to be fair all were very well behaved when we went and as I am 6 months pregnant it was interesting for us to see families on holiday. It is stylish, spotless, relaxed and very friendly. All the staff are warm and very professional and there is a genuine happy ambience there. The building and interiors are spotless and well designed with interesting fun designer (but never pretentious) furnishings and well tended gardens. The food was competitively priced and delicious - the breakfast buffet was particularly lovely with a good variety of fresh sweet and savoury food, freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh breads and pastries and lots of different fruit. They serve food and drinks by the pool or down on the beach as well as the restaurant which was great especially when you are too lazy to move from your beach lounger and you are craving a banana milkshake! We felt the food was not on the small side as an earlier reviewer said nor was the room on the small side. We changed rooms half way through our holiday due to availability so sampled both the sea view and garden view rooms and both were excellent - comfy beds, rain showers, well equipped kitchenettes, very quiet air con, non humming fridges and fresh flowers. When we moved rooms we were told we needn't pack all our things up as the staff could move everything for us (except the safe contents) as 'we want our guests to have a trouble free holiday and spend their time on the beach or wherever instead of spending time moving rooms'.
