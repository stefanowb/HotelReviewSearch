I chose this hotel because it had good reviews, and lo, I made a very good decision. The room was clean, small for a suite, but having two separate rooms was great- we had a few people come over for drinks one night and not haing to subject them to our bedroom was great! The shower/bathrtub/jet tub was great, tons of hot water and clean towles. Balcony was cute, we had it open the entire time we were there! The restaurant downstairs was affordable, we typically had our breakfast there. Id love to go back to this hotel soon! Concierge was helpful, though they didnt have as much to offer in terms of information as say, a more expensive hotel. They did however, get us tickets to two separate tours, which were great and well worth the $30 USD they cost. Great experience for the cost, Id give this place two thumbs up!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "awaters80", "date": "February 16, 2008", "id": 13606216}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I just returned from a 5 night stay.
