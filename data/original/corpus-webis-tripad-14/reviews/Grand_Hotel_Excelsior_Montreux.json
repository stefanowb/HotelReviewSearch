An easy walk to the centre of Montreux, yet in a quiet, peaceful area. There is also easy access to the bus stop and buses every ten minutes to anywhere along the Montreux Riviera. Better still, these are free with the Montreux card. From reading our guide book, we expected to be given the cards on arrival, but we had to ask for them, then were given them without the book which went with them. We helped ourselves to one from the reception desk the following day. Following advice from other reviews, on being given the room key, I asked if we were in one of the refurbished rooms. The reply was, you are in a standard room on the second floor and it is very nice. The room and bathroom were large, with a small balcony. However, the carpet was faded, the mattress was very soft and their was no headboard and no valance. The outside of the balcony door was badly in need of a coat of paint. This is not quite what we would expect from a four star hotel. After two nights of trying to sleep on the very soft mattress my back was extremely painful. We asked if we could have a firmer mattress and were told all the mattresses were the same. The housekeeper was very helpful and put boards under the mattress, this did not help, so she found a firm thin mattress and put the boards on top of the soft mattress, then the firm mattress on top.
