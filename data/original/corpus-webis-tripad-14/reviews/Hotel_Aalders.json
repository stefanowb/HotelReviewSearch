The staff was so very helpful, the breakfast so delicous and Eurpoean, the hotel was comfortable and cozy, just what you would want in Europe, and the location was incredible. It is situated between the two most popular musems, one block from a tram stop, and in walking distance from EVERYTHING. It was more than we could have ever hoped for. I travel extensively for my job, and I would be happy to stay here again, anytime.
