The hotel is a comfortable, no frills hotel on the main street in Zermatt. The rooms are of good size and the beds are comfortable. We were in a standard room while a friend was in a room with french balcony. Both are very similar in size and comfort, and I would not hesitate booking one as a double for a future stay. We were in room 204, which was nice and toward the garden side, however, one in our group who was on the street side was not bothered by any noise as is mentioned in previous reviews.

We booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and booked a family room for myself and 12yr old daughter and 18yr old son, away from the sound of the disco (thanks for that advice). We had a family room on the top floor at the back of the hotel. From the balcony we could see the Matterhorn which was an added bonus. The rooms were a good size, nice living area and my son had his own bedroom and ensuite and TV. The rooms were cleaned every day and our beds turned down every night! not sure we liked that very much as our PJs were arranged in different positions each night, but it made us laugh when we actually arranged them ourselves before we went out to give the maid a little giggle! The cosy bar with a roaring fireplace was great for a drink in the evening and the restaurant was always accommdating with great food, I think we ate there twice. If we ever go to Zermatt again we will definately stay at the Pollux, central to everything and only a short walk from the Sunnega ski lifts, the breakfast buffet also was lovely, friendly service, and very attentive.
