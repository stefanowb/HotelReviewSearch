Our studio room was tight for our stay but we managed. Love the location - we walked to Disneyland everyday. We had tickets for ART but never used them. There is construction between hotel and parks so walking on the sidewalks have now gotten to be more of a problem. Construction has closed one of the sidewalks so only one left to walk on. The pool was wonderful and warm. The kids loved it! Our biggest problem was breakfast. What a frenzy. Food was good and always was being refilled but such a crowd!!! People everywhere and sometimes no place to sit down to eat. Breakfast staff tried to keep places cleared but was almost impossible. Breakfast area is large but almost could have used two areas to serve breakfast. This was our only negative of our trip. Maybe solution would be to offer discount if you don't eat at the breakfast. Next time we would probably get food at store and eat in our room. Much less stressful. Front desk staff were friendly and attentive. Would stay again.", "user": "nanaKay", "date": "March 23, 2007", "id": 7209304}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Location, Great Breakfast", "text": "I recently stayed at this hotel for a 5 day Disneyland vacation with my 10 year old daughter and 20 year old nephew. We booked a studio suite and were very pleased with the size and cleanliness of the room and the in-room kitchen facilities.The complimentry breakfast buffet at this hotel is excellent and there is something for everyone. I personally recommend the oatmeal! The hotel is within walking distance of Disneyland but we were happy to take the shuttle or a cab (cost $9.00 including tip) back to the hotel at the end of the day (some evenings we were just too tired from running around Disneyland all day to walk back). There are hotels/motels that are closer to Disneyland, if walking distance is your main concern, but I would book here again in the future despite the slightly longer walk of about 10 minutes. I found the hotel staff, housekeeping, front desk and the breakfast buffet wait staff to be friendly and helpful.", "user": "goinonaroadtrip", "date": "March 20, 2007", "id": 7195249}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Would recommend this hotel", "text": "The good: Full kitchen with oven, microwave, full fridge, dishes and utensils. The grocery service is the greatest. We used it twice. We filled out a grocery list, dropped it off at the front desk in the morning, and when we got back from Disneyland in the afternoon, all the food was in the frige and ready to make dinner. They bought us exactly what we ordered, and no delivery fee. The breakfast was also really great. Nice to have some food before heading off to D-land.", "user": "Familyof5fromOregon", "date": "March 10, 2007", "id": 7010354}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Residence Inn Maingate was WONDERFUL!", "text": "Just so-so: Our room had just one queen bed and a pull out sofa.

I had been tracking the renovation of the pool on-line before our trip, making sure it was complete before we arrived. They said it could be closed up to a month! This was very diappointing to our girls. They offered free swimming at a near-by hotel's pool (not convenient), but luckily the next day the pool was open.

The rooms were big (unlike other residence inns I've stayed at). We had a backdraft in the fireplace on one night and had to move rooms at 1:30 in the morning. They comp'd us into an upgraded two room suite though and never flinched. Oh, beware of the laundry service, fading and shrinking are guaranteed. Awesome experience though and we stayed for nearly a week.", "user": "KellyJones34", "date": "February 11, 2007", "id": 6780706}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "This was a good deal and a great location", "text": "Must say this hotel is really pretty good. Staff was friendly, rooms were clean and comfortable, location was great. We got a fair price via Expedia. It's very convenient to take the ART transportation to Disneyland. Breakfast was busy, but was pretty good food and the staff seemed to keep up with the constant flow. We visited for 5 days and will probably return and will definitely recommend this to friends. They are very family friendly.", "user": "AlohaHonolulu", "date": "February 7, 2007", "id": 6752247}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Had a Great Time", "text": "We stayed 4 nights at the Residence Inn Maingate during our trip to Disneyland and were completely satisfied with the property. We had a one bedroom suite with a fold-out bed in the living room which was very spacious. We also had a small balcony with a table and chairs which was nice for sitting out and enjoying the weather. We found the staff helpful and pleasant. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the breakfast was more than adequate (pancakes or french toast, waffles, fruit salad, cereal, eggs, various breakfast meats, bagels, muffins, tortillas etc). They also have coffee available all day. The breakfast room can get crowded, especially on the weekends but when the weather is nice, there is a pleasant outside patio. We used the ART to get to and from the park as the walk seemed a bit far with a 5 year old and you have to walk by an empty construction zone. You can get an all-day pass for the ART at the hotel for $3. The bus stops at 3 other hotels but it's very quick (maybe 8 minutes to the park). If you know the approximate times that the buses arrive then there is little waiting. They also have a small \"store\" where you can buy some basics such as milk. The hotel has a nice pool area and another hot-tub tucked away near units 20-24. The only downside is that all one-bedroom suites are upstairs so you have to lug your things up and down and this could be a problem for people who cannot handle stairs. Check with the hotel in advance if stairs are a problem. The only other issue was that the Disneyland Express operated by Grey Line Tours cannot get into the property because of the size of the bus. We had to haul our suitcases to the street. I would recommend going with a compnay that has smaller vans that can go right up to the front desk/lobby area.", "user": "foodie66", "date": "February 5, 2007", "id": 6746681}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Stay away!", "text": "We came here as the first hotel on our Honeymoon trip.

We loved everything about it. We booked a 1bedroom unit, which features a separate bedroom with 2 comfortable queen beds and a family room with sleeper sofa and kitchen. The kitchen consists of a oven, stovetop, microwave, dishwasher, and sink. Each day we enjoyed the free hot breakfast. There were 2 alternating menus. The first consisted of french toast and bacon; the second was pancakes and sausage. There were also eggs, burritos, make-your-own waffle, cereal, potatoes, fruit, and other options. We filled up on a huge breakfast, ate snacks in the theme parks, and fixed dinner in the room at night. We saved a fortune on food. The pool was warmly heated. Our group of 5 or 6 buildings had its own hot tub, which was quite relaxing. We used the ART shuttle to get to Disney--you could walk, but I would recommend the shuttle to save all of your energy for the parks. Besides, ART is free for kids under 10.
