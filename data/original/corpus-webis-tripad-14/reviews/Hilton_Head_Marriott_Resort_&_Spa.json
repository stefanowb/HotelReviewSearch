I ordered a VIRGIN Mango Daquri, came out 10 mintutes later and I drank the whole thing. After like 2 mins. after I drank it, I said \" Mom, I dont feel well. Can I jump in the pool?\" And she said yes and I did but then they ordered me another and all of them ( mom, dad, mom's friend and my bro) tasted it and it had rum in BOTH of them so I had to lay down and i fell asleep.

We checked in early and Brian, our front desk person, was very accommodating. I had reserved an \"island view\" but after much clicking, Brian put us in and ocean view (not ocean front). Pays to be nice. Good enough. Only one minor irritation: it was the third room key that actually worked. Overall, the service was excellent in all areas. I guess I expected less from such a large resort. (The cab driver told us Marriott has 13 properties on the island. This one is the \"hotel.\" It doesn't say anything on the property about \"Hotel & Spa.\" Says \"Marriott Resort, Golf,\" etc. but no Spa signs.) The room was on the side on the third floor yet angled to face the beach. Great view of the beach. Was kinda glad we didn't get an ocean front room. They all face the large pool/bar areas, which are - I imagine - quite noisy if you want to take a nap during the day. A day on the beach with 2 chairs and an umbrella will cost you $18 plus tip. Great beach, warm water at the time (85 degrees). The bar \"Liquid\" is just above the beach and service was good. Quite easy to charge everything to the room. As far as dining at the Resort, we tried Conroy's but it was a busy \"reservations only\" night so we ate \"bar food\" outside at Ocean Blue which overlooks the ocean as it's name implies. Quite nice and the food was pretty good. The resort has a \"grocery store\" if you want to save money on water, sodas, etc. The pools were clean, numerous, and large. The towel lady has been there 30 plus years and was very nice. Again, starting with Brian, every employee was very nice (including the gal who evicted us from our beach chairs in the late afternoon). For a family resort, the employee attitudes were remarkable considering all of the yelling, screaming kids around. (Not that bad, just noticable. There are many ways to get away from \"kiddie noise\" at this Resort.) The room was clean and the king bed was plush. The room had a shower only, which I thought was odd (not that we wanted to take a bath), and the glass door opens and can possibly hit the bathroom door, so we had to be mindful. As far as transportation on the island, there are many miles of bike trails and there's a shuttle to the local mall. Many people talked about the constant insect infestation on the island, but we didn't see any evidence of this either at the Resort or anywhere else on the Island. In conclusion, this is one of the best \"something for everybody\" type resorts I've stayed at. They are able to pull it off with little compromise. When we go back to Hilton Head, we'll stay there again. The \"first impression\" was good enough so that I won't spend the time or energy seeing if there are other places we might want to stay at on the Island.", "title": "We'd stay again!", "user": "Pramstroker", "date": "August 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 18824657, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Front desk Brian and the rest of the friendly staff.", "disliked": "\u2014 Couldn't stay longer."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here for a conference, so i did not select this property.
