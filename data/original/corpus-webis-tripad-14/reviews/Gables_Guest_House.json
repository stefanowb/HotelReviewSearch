At that point I would not have cared what the place was like. However I was bowled over by the friendliness and helpfulness of the owners. I have stayed in a few places recently in Oxford and the owners have been less than welcoming, This couple however were born to be in the hospitality trade. I was given directions to the pub and takeaway. Broadband was available. My room had chocolates and a decanter!. Also a dressing gown and hot water bottle were in the wardrobe (not needed however as I was like toast) Also a trouser press. Then in the morning whilst I had breakfast (A varied choice which was nice) Sally's husband turned up with a shovel and wellies and dug my car out of the snow.
