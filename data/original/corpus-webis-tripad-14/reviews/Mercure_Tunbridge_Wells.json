The Ouste part of the hotel is beautiful and very impressive with a very welcoming receptionist. Our room was a disappointment. We had booked a superior which was supposed to have its own lounge area. This actually consisted of 2 small arm chairs 2 feet away from the bed! When my husband enquired if we had e correct room he was assured that this was a superior. We felt like we had been conned into paying quite a lot extra just to have 2 armchairs squeezed into the space. The actual bedroom was decorated beautifully, loved the wallpaper, however, the bathroom had several cracked tiles, mildew around the taps and tiles in the bath area and I kept finding hairs everywhere that weren't mine!

When I came out of the pool there were 5 ladies getting changed and there was literally nowhere for me to put my belongings. I got so irritated I went into the only toilet there to change. There seemed to be no heating in this toilet and it was freezing! The pool is very small. The steam room an obvious add on and quite ugly. The jacuzzi was not working.
