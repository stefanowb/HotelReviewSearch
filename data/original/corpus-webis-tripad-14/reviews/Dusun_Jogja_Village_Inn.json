The entrace changed, the old gallery was gone, but inside, it is as beautiful as ever. Still clean, well kept and all the greeneries are grown, adding the calm atmosphere. The location is good, Yogya is a small city, you can reach all must-see spots by becak. The food is to be honest, nothing special. But it doesn't really matter. Close by, you can get many kinds of food. And even they have a supermarket around the corner. It's a great pace for couple, families and friends.

Staff were wonderful especially dory who we wanted to take home, peter, nora and of course putri who organized our amazing tours. They have a spa as well. They have a movie room which was fabulous, we watched a few movies. They really need to get comfortable chairs in the movie room!! Hard couches are not good.

Also the staff start cleaning at 6.30am so it is bit noisy. I was in bed by 9.00 pm!! Great location.
