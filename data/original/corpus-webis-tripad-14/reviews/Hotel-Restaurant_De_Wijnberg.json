Food was OK but not very special. You could choose a better quality surprise menu if you were willing to pay 15 euros extra (per person). Hotel rooms are very small and lack any comfort. It's like you step back in time and find a cramped hotelrroom in the attack with a tiny bathroom with shower like you would find in some hotels in 60s or 70s. No decorations in the room (execpt for one ugly advertising poster). Very noisy, traffic and people outside the hotel till late in the night.
