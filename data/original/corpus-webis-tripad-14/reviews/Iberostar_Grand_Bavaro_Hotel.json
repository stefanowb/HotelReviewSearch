The food was great and it was awesome that our butler made our reservations for us - all four nights - and delivered the confirmations to our room.

It was the first time to every go to an island since prior to this trip I had always driven down the east coast to either South Carolina or Florida. It was also the first time I have ever been to an all inclusive resort. There were a lot of islands and places to choose however I finally selected the Dominican Republic and eventually Iberostar Grand Hotel Bavaro. I have to say that I'm so pleased that I selected this hotel since the food, accommodation, service and activities were all fabulous. I just wanted a place to go that I did not have to worry about anything in order that I could relax, read a book by the beach and finally enjoy some sun after a long winter in Canada. The thing I liked was that you could just that and relax or if you wanted to get involved in all of the activities that are going on at the hotel.

If we go back to DR we will go back to this resort for sure! It started with the private transportation which was rapid and courteous.The welcome arrival was correct but nothing extravagant. Our room had the ocean view. It was small compare to other resort we where in but very very clean and this those matter a lot for us. Our room butler give us a professional and very well detailed informations regarding all the resort services.The IGBH has beautiful gardens, its spacious. The hall has always fresh flowers it has great surroundings.. One must be careful when walking because the floors are very slippery and it might be dangerous when wet.The beach entertaining is just amazing. The beach drink services is a little too much. They should be more discreet. One time within one hour we where asked five time if we wanted something to drink. It's far too much. We know that receiving tips might be their goal but one must also respect the customers needs. There where small sandhill around many palapas. Those should be leveled by the maintenance people because it's unconfortable. We are early birds and personnaly I'm at the beach at +or- 06h30 waiting for the sunrise then going to the buffet. After that little cleaning at the room for aprx 15 minutes then under the sun for the entire day except lunch time. Well although it did not affect us, I have seen towels on some chair before I arrive and those chairs being empty for 5-6 hours.Just disgusting The room services is perfect. As far as the restaurants are concerned, frankly we where not impressed. Beside the Italian one all the others where ordinary and for us, the Japanese food was tasteless. But again that's always different from one person to another!! As strange as it could sound, we eated very well at the two buffets. Beside a few servers that had almost no smile, all of the remaining of the staff always had them. There is something that made really a good impression on us. During our stay, management conduct a customer appreciation survey that was made with a majordome (verbally) and at the buffet (written questionnaire). This second one was made by a private businees firm. For us, when an enterprise takes the time to spend money for a survey inquiring how their customers appreciate their level of services, then this entreprise care about their customers.

The room, while smaller than other Iberostar Grands I have visited, was contemporary in design with a very interesting spa tub that faced the courtyard with electric blinds on 2 sides. Very cool! Butler is also included and dinner reservations were made by him. Dining reservations a little difficult to get, but we found if we checked at the restaurant the day we wanted to dine, there was not a problem. I think in peak season it would be a good idea to make your dining reservations in advance. The Italian restaurant left a little to be desired but the gourmet restaurand and the steak and seafood restaurants were great. Iberostar is still serving plenty of lobster both for dinner and lunch. Free wi-fi in room and it worked well. The public areas were truly unique works of art! The full sized ship in the courtyard serves as a night club/sports bar inside and cocktails and entertainment on the deck outside. Iberostar \"shines\" with their entertainment in their inside theater. \"Rock Show\" was extremely entertaining (we don't usually go to the shows). Also serves good wine and top shelf alcohol. We really love this resort even though it is prices, it is well worth it. We would positively return and highly recommend Iberostar Grand Bavaro.

He gave us a map of the area and kind of pointed out where Iberostar Grand was, but circled Hard Rock and drew stars all around it. He told us to call Hard Rock and that we could get $100 to gamble with, free transportation to and from our resort and free spa treatments. We were then told on the sly by another airport employee not to fall for it and that it was a time share sell trap. We also learned from other travelers later in our vacation that Hard Rock does indeed push (very aggressively) time shares. This is another plus about Iberostar Grand. We did not get a single time share push the entire time we were there. The resort is classy.

The food is standard for the chain Japanese steakhouses we have at home, tasty and in large quantities. We also ate at the Italian restaurant, which gets some less-than-stellar reviews here, but which we enjoyed immensely. The food was presented beautifully and was very good, in portions that were entirely more than we could eat. We really loved the surf and turf, which had an excellent variety of dishes and all cooked very well. We were a little disappointed that crab legs seemed to be still frozen instead of served hot, but as they were only an appetizer, we just skipped over them. The wine served with the meals is pretty middle of the road, but absolutely drinkable. The non-wine lovers in our party had cocktails instead.
