The rooms aren't air conditioned rather they are cooled by a central system so they have the potential to get stuffy when its warm outside. The internet that is provided by the hotel is quite reasonably priced when compared to internet cafes in town. The breakfast buffet had a good range of food but avoid the juice as it isn't very good. I would reccomend the Ibis range over hostels as they give you a good room for the price.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "T-A-UK", "date": "July 30, 2007", "id": 8256956}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have found that IBIS hotels really do mean business.

There was nothing old about the room and bathroom. IBIS hotels are very modern and so affordable. I will be using IBIS where I can because I can be guaranteed of a very good room that rivals many 4 star genuine hotels. When I travel, I am the type of traveller who views hotels as rooms to sleep in and thats it......I am out all day and evening so I am not too bothered about 5 star, 4 star or 3 star. Just a clean comfortable and very affordable room. I like to spend my money on other things like sightseeing and shopping. IBIS hotels in Switzerland exceeded my expectations. Will use them again and again when I visit Beautiful Switzerland and hopefully thats soon.", "title": "No complaints really, had a very pleasant stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Misty78", "date": "June 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 8020292, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The really clean and quiet room + the air-conditioning", "disliked": "\u2014 no fridge in room"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good, friendly, reasonably cheap, but out of the way", "text": "Stayed here for three nights in July 2006 - I found the hotel to be very clean, safe and comfortable - nothing luxurious, but then I wasn't looking for luxurious anyway. :)", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "unspecified", "date": "August 26, 2006", "id": 5711636}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "The most important thing for me was that the place felt safe and everything worked (including the air-conditioning, which I really couldn't have lived without as it was EXTREMELY hot in Zurich during my stay).", "title": "Clean and comfortable", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "CHDD", "date": "July 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5523164}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "This hotel offers good clean and reasonably equipped rooms at a good price, particularly at the weekend.
