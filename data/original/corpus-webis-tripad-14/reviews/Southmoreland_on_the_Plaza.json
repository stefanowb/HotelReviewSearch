We arrived to find a roaring fire, wine, cheese, and fabulous cupcakes, complete with American flags. The staff was inviting and helpful and gave us a tour, and helped bring luggage to our room. The location is perfect for exploring the Plaza area, just a few blocks away. We had dinner and drinks on the Plaza and returned to our room. It is always a pleasure when a property provides special extras, in this case: a decanter of sherry in our room, a sleep/noise machine, and a wood burning fire place that was prepped during turn down service. The Southmoreland has a lovely outdoor area that we hope to experience on a return trip during warmer weather.", "title": "Southmoreland thought of every detail", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Kerri W", "date": "November 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 184827946}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Greeted by a lovely host, amazing and delicious breakfast, comfortable room and beautiful surroundings. We were walking distance to the plaza and art museums in a safe quiet neighborhood. The grounds were set up to sit, read, and relax as was the house. When we returned at night to cookies and coffee or tea to slip up to our beautiful room or relax on the outside deck to watch the stars was a perfect evening! We will return again.
