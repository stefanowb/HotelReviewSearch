Seascape is very accommodating providing a great breakfast and very comfortable beds. If you plan to stay at Seascape Manor when most of the rooms are booked, hop right out of bed and get in the shower early in the morning. If you don't, you will bathe in icecubes and don't plan on getting a warm shower before the afternoon! The upstairs showers seem to have problems that the owners won't acknowledge ... they either scalding hot water or freezing and you are constantly backing off trying to adjust the water between hot and cold. This is not an inexpensive B&B and other guests have complained, but the owners don't seem to care, maybe because there is no remedy.", "title": "Nice place, but ...", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Karen026", "date": "February 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4474805}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at Seascape for our anniversary on June 29 to July 1 in the Precious Moments room.", "title": "Beautiful, Romantic Weekend Getaway", "user": "jamaicaluver", "date": "July 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8040017, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Romantic atmosphere, Peaceful, Room, View, Closeness to beaches", "disliked": "\u2014 Had to leave!!!!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "This B&B is immaculately kept.
