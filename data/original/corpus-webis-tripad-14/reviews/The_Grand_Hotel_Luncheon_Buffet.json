In a choice between the Afternoon Tea or Lunch Buffet, there is only a $5 difference.........so the Lunch Buffet it was! (BTW, the Afternoon Tea looked to be held in a main Lobby of The Hotel, so it's not exactly intimate or private.) We were in line at 11:40am, and they opened the dining room promptly at Noon. We were stoked to get window seats and a table for just the two of us. The food was fancier than a country buffet, but I'm sure it wasn't as fancy as the fare you'd get for breakfast or dinner. That being said, it was an experience I do NOT regret. The service was wonderful - our Waiter was quite attentive. He also not only volunteered to take our picture, but he tried to tweak the lighting and our poses to get a fantastic pic. Yes, the dining room was likely 98% tourists, but that's just what it is at that time of day. Overall, it's an experience you should try, if your budget allows. It was a nice surprise that the tip and tea/coffee were included in the price.", "title": "Worth the Experience -- arrive early!", "user": "Stonefad", "date": "September 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 179100007}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited September 2013", "text": "... a few nice touches thrown in, shrimp, oysters, smoked whitefish, etc. The setting and the service make it special, but for the most part there's nothing really special on the buffet line.
