I live in Manila, but our second office is in Cebu in the South and when I am there I need a comfortable and supportive environment to hang my hat. I was fortunate to have stumbled on the Radisson Blu by default as I was so amazingly disappointed by both the Waterfront Hotel and the Marco Polo Hotel (where I found unbelievably insulting management and ridiculous service). This hotel is lovely and clean and the most comfortable business hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. Within moments of entering the lobby you can see and feel both the attention to detail of the grand \"open\" space design and the warmth of the people. The staff is lovely and supportive and when you are far away from home, it is such a delight to have people call you by name and welcome you back. The restaurant features, beyond a doubt, the most extensive and amazing buffets (breakfast buffet was included in my stay). The options are extensive, but being from California most impressive to me was the ridiculously huge availability of fresh vegetables and succulent fresh fruits, which made my stay even that more enjoyable. The fitness center is exceptionally appointed and the staff is attentive and remembers your every need. A trainer is also available to help with machines or any necessary guidance you may need. Room service, nearly a must for a weary business traveler who works during the night is astonishing. Where on earth can you get a more delicious bowl of pumpkin soup with a shot glass of heated maple syrup topped with cream on the side? Every attention to detail is paid at this hotel, with special \"extras\" like shower gel and a shower \"puff\". Staying for weeks at a time in one hotel can get old, but not when it feels like everyone knows you and wants to make certain you are comfortable at every turn. The SPA is amazing and working at night often causes one to need a good massage, which is a highly recommended benefit of this gorgeous hotel, it is not a \"cheap\" massage, but it is well-worth the price and the lovely treatment rooms and gracious staff are worth every penny. The hotel is conveniently located next to a major mall, so additional supplies that might be needed for any journey are readily available. The pool is gorgeous and the attending staff would not let you sit without handing you the appropriate towel for the occasion. The hotel is beyond a dream for any business or leisure traveler and as an extraordinarily picky American (I can freely bash myself at this point), I can attest that this hotel passes even some of my most demanding standards with flying colors. I will be back again and again and I hope others will follow but not too closely because I would like to make sure my room is available. :)", "title": "My perfect home away from home", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "courtneyb", "date": "August 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117281873}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011", "text": "I would definitely recommend this hotel!

It is just right next to the gigantic mall, SM City Cebu, whose owner also owns the hotel. If the Ayala Center Mall has Marriott adjacent to it, then SM City Cebu has Radisson. Although I prefer Ayala Center to SM, I would still choose Radisson over Marriott. I have also stayed a few times in Marriott and it pales in comparison to Radisson's grand lobby, pool, spa and of course great food. I have one complaint during one of my stays in the hotel and it was related to making up the room. The previous night I had an in-room massage using my own exotic oil so the next day I really requested my room to be made up. The night I came back to my room it still smelled of the massage oil as the beddings were not changed. I furiously relayed my disappointment to the housekeeping.
