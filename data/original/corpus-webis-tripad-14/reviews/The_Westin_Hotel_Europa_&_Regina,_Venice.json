When asked about 2-3 restaraunts we had been recommended by friends familiar with Venice, he dismissed them ALL outright. Saying Chinese people had taken over the restaraunts..whatever that meant - he insisted on sending us instead to Do Forni in San Marco. He did not even bother with giving us choices, making a reservation without telling us and then insisting we go, since he made the reservation. (smelling a generous commission here?) The restaraunt was the worst we've ever been to. 280 Euro for 2 antipasti, 4 mains and a bottle of wine. the price wouldnt bother us if the food had been edible. the service was rude insisting we order 1st & 2nd course 1 minute after seating us and getting very aggressive about it, they forgot to put in the order for the antipasti, the fish was spoilt and they burnt 1 main and forgot to tell us, bringing it 20 minutes after all the other mains had been finished! Why would the Westin send its guests to such a horrible place? But then again, why does the Westin have a concierge who obviously is disinterested in his job and racist to boot. It spoilt our trip as 3 of us were extremely sick after the meal!", "title": "The best bar on the Grand Canal!", "user": "LancashireVoyager", "date": "June 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 132708694}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I do hope the hotel reads this review and the GM insists that the concierge is banned from recommending Do Forni or that he is given some training in how to behave as is expected from a Westin concierge.
