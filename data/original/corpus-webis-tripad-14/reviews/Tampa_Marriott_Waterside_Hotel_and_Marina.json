This will appear to be too detailed and is written primarily for other platinum elite members who will understand. There is a service level you learn to expect and when it fails to deliver it is definitely noteworthy. The GOOD: location, location, location. Walking distance to beautiful riverfront area. Live music within earshot of your balcony nightly. The POOL with self service ice by the bar and plentiful pool towels and chairs. Conscientious and pleasant staff who follow up on requests even when not fulfilled. Their heart is in the place so an A for effort. The BAD: one bath towel per person in room even when asking for extra towels. NO weekend coffee options other than make it your own in the room. When we called for coffee through room service they simply brought us more packets and empty plastic cups so we could make it ourselves. No concierge club on weekends. Thunderous Loud noise of cigarette boats in harbor. When our wine and cheese-crackers welcome amenity was brought up they brought just ONE wine glass for the two of us. Turn down was an abrupt knock at the door and a hand extended with a greasy cookie in a paper wrapper. (Hence the lack of towels issue). Valet service is Painfully slow and inefficient. Call with plenty of notice to retrieve your car. Again. The location makes this a great place to stay.

Our bad experience began at checkin with the rudeness of the man at the front desk. The Marriott brand nickels & dimes there patrons to death. $14.95 for Internet service, really even if you are a silver elite member! The only hotel chain I have stayed in lately that still charges for Internet. Then there was the $5.00 bottles of water in our room, ha ha it was only $2.00 in the vending machine across the hall. No safes in your rooms, very inconvenient. Found used soap in the box at the sink. The best part was requesting the duvet cover be removed & replaced with sheets & a blanket. 1. Duvet removed, stuffed in closet & bare quilt left on bed, 2. Returning at 11 pm, no one to make bed as originally requested. Sent someone with set of sheets & another quilt. Finally received a thread bare blanket queen size for a king bed. At midnight we were making our own bed. 3. Next day bed was made another set of sheets was left after we requested a king size blanket. After 3 nights we had a duvet cover, 2 quilts & 3 sets of sheets.
