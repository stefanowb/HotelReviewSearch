I arrived at this Econolodge around 6:30pm to check-in. The front desk clerk was very friendly. The hotel itself seemed a little sketchy and I didn't feel all that safe in the parking area. Anyway, I carry my two bags of luggage up to my room. Open the door to find the room had not been cleaned from previous guests. So I'm a little annoyed, but maybe it was an honest mistake. I head back to the car and I see the front desk clerk running through the parking lot yelling \"I gave you the wrong room.\" No she didn't, she realized the room was dirty after I left the lobby. So she goes with me to the new room and opens the door, checks the bathroom (why I wondered?), turns on the heat, checks for a TV remote and leaves. After less than 5 minutes in the room, I realize the smoke detector is chirping because the batteries must be dead. I left to get some take-out dinner. When I came back to the hotel, I stopped at the front desk and told the clerk about the detector. She said all she could do was move me to a different room because their was no maintenance man until the morning and she was alone. I agreed but really had no choice. I go to my old room to collect my luggage and go to the new room (my 3rd). After I open the door I hear a big german shepard-type dog at the door of the room next to me barking. I leave the room to get my take-out bag out of my car, the dog in the room next door barks again. I arrive back at my room and the dog barks a third time. OK, back to the front desk. I tell her I can't stay in that room for 4 nights with that barking dog. Why would the hotel put people with dogs on the 2nd floor anyway? Shouldn't they be on the first floor in case the dog needs to be walked? And why would she put me in a room with a dog next door? Now I am really angry and I tell the clerk she has one more chance to find me a room or she finds me another hotel and pays for it. She is patient and upgrades me to a larger room with two beds. That didn't matter to me because I'm by myself. The new room (my 4th) is located at the far end of the hotel and doesn't have the same outdoor corridors. Keep in mind that I've had to carry my luggage back and forth to my car. This time I was smart and went to check the room first before bringing my luggage up. I go to the room and swipe the key card and it won't open the door. I tried several times. Back to the office. I tell her it won't open the door and a guy in the office (I assume her boyfriend or husband) says sometimes to the afftect that the cold weather affects the electronics on the doors. I remind him that it's an inside corridor room and the hall is not cold. She doesn't believe the key won't work and follows me back to the room. As we enter the corridor, she comments how warm it is. Hmm, but still too cold for the door electronics to work? She tries and sure enough the key doesn't work. She uses her master key to open the door and we both notice some white substance all over the carpet and that it hadn't been vacuumed. I can't believe this. She goes to the room directly across the hall. Swipes her card, opens the door and the door falls off the hinge. Goes to the room next door to that, opens the door and the room is clean but someone used the toilet and didn't flush it (I also notice no towels). Goes to the next room, swipes her card and opens the room and this one looks fine. SEVEN ROOMS LATER!! The clerk leaves to go get me a new key card and I bring my luggage up and check out the room. The remote didn't work. When she returned, I had her get me a new remote. Keep in mind, I haven't eaten dinner and it's now cold. I eat and call Choice Hotels directly. I thought I was doomed because when you book using rewards points they are non-refundable. The CSR at Choice said if I checked out they would refund my points. It was late and I didn't want to move to a different hotel, so I stayed there anyway. The room was quiet and clean, so I was OK with staying the other three nights.

When my girlfriend alerted the front desk, they stated allot of the rooms are missing them. I guess some people like to steal $5 coffee makers. :) I can't recommend this hotel though overall due to the fact it is not too clean.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 17, 2006", "id": 5146857}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "I booked this hotel online having never been to the Springfield area. My boyfriend and I spent the day at Six flags and checked in around 10:30pm. We were relieved as soon as we opened the door. Our room was clean, and stocked with towels, coffee, and soap. Our king size bed was very comfortable, though our pillows were kinda flat. The man at the front desk was very helpful and check in/out took less than 5 minutes. I would reccomend this motel to the budget minded and no-frills kind of people.", "title": "Very nice for 50 bucks!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "elizsa", "date": "September 20, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3924343}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Santee"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 11, "average": 6, "very good": 14, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 25}, "aka": "Howard Johnson Express Inn Santee Sc Hotel Santee", "slim_ranking": 0.461538461538}
