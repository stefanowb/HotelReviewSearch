Our biggest gripe was that the resort is old and its showing its age. Our aircon did not work properly and the pillows and linen smelt of mould (as the the entire room). Our 'free' room internet connection did not work for the entire two weeks, although the pool areas do have WIFI. The rooms maids never left towels for some reason and we had to ring up on a daily basis...It would have been okay if we had been paying two or three star prices but we paid five star prices and were not very impressed.
