The hotel is 5 minutes walk from a Tube station and a shopping mall is also close by. Due to Beijing being so big and the sights so spread out we found being close to the tube extremely convenient and at appox 30p to use the tube a cheap option to get around. The reception is beautiful and all staff were very friendly and helpful even allowing us to leave our cases there for 2 days whilst travelling to Xian. On our first 2 nights stay we were upgraded to the continental suite which was on the 10th floor. The only real difference to standard rooms was a larger bathroom and shower cubical. The rooms were spacious with extremely confortable beds. You have a mini bar and free water along with all the usual free toiletries. The breakfast was lovely with a choice of fruit, breads, meats, cooked breakfast, cereals etc etc what you would expect from a 3-4 start hotel.

Do note that the free wifi touted on the website applies only to the lobby and executive lounge--in the rooms there is only ethernet and for a cost. The hotel is bordering on luxury, as one reviewer remarked, but fails to reach that because it is visibly shabby and aging throughout--the carpet in our room and in the hallways is heavily stained, tiles on the floor near the restaurant are coming up or missing, the walls are scuffed, etc--basically one big updating of the surfaces would make a huge difference in one's sense of the quality of the hotel.

We were quoted, in writing on a sheet on the desk, a price for a private tour of the Great Wall and Ming Tombs. The cost was on the steep side but we were strapped for time and decided it was worth the convenience. We were then told we must pay in cash, which we did--foolishly, I'm afraid, so that was our stupidity. The tour was perfectly fine--the tour guide was friendly and helpful, the driver a bit all over the road but not unusually so. However, on our return to the center of the city, the tour guide offered to make a special stop for us at the Olympic buildings--we thanked him but said no, we were tired. Then he got on the phone and we recognized the words for \"2 Americans\". Without being asked, we were suddenly pulled into an unplanned stop--at a \"historic teahouse/silk museum\" we had not requested at which we were treated to an aggressive (even by Beijing standards) sales pitch and insistence on purchasing silk goods on display. We left quickly (and politely) without purchasing and waited in the car for the tour guide, who did not follow us out but spent the next 20 minutes on his cell phone in the lobby. Things went from bad to worse when he finally rejoined us, offered another teahouse which we rejected, and then relented to take us back to the hotel. The sheet on the tour desk which was shown us for pricing that morning did/does not mention something we found out only at this point--that all the entrance fees to each site (two for one part of the Wall, one to go up, one to go down, and then for the tombs) were NOT included in the price we had paid in cash at the outset (and these totaled 1/3 again the price of the tour, so they weren't minor). We were then told in the car that we had to pay these fees to our guide, again in cash, immediately. We had just enough cash on us to cover this plus a small tip, luckily. We apologized profusely for the small tip but explained that we hadn't been told there would be further fees and hadn't brought much cash. The guide said it was okay by him, but the (non-English speaking) driver would be furious and we really needed to tip more, so he would be happy to take us to an ATM to get more money! This after we had asked the tour desk staffperson and she had informed us that tips were optional, and said if we were *especially* happy, to tip the amount we already had (10%). We of course did not consent to this. When we got to the hotel, the tour guide took us in to the tour desk staffer so we could \"tell her how he was as a guide\" (while he stood there); she told us that although the sheet she provided didn't mention added costs for our tour, that entry fees were only included in the cost of the *other* tours on the sheet--and that we had been an \"emergency\" tour because we had come in after 8am (although she never mentioned either of these things when demanding our cash earlier, and neither is mentioned in any way on the information sheet). By this point between disingenuous apologies both were beginning to create contradictory excuses and we were too exhausted to fight with logic. We're taking it as our own stupidity for not having insisted more on what was presented in writing and on challenging the \"cash only\" requirement while sitting in a well-stocked business office in a big hotel, but we thought we should warn others. I've had tour guides (in larger bus tours) who were clearly on the \"take\" before, but nothing like this in terms of direct pressure and embarrassment--and both the guide and staffer told us that their company was unaffiliated with the hotel so there was no recourse that way (this was one of their excuses for the added costs)--apparently the tour company just rents the space in the lobby (although the hotel lists this as one of their services).
