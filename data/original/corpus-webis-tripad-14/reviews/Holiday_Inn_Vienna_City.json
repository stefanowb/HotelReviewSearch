As it turned out, it had so many more benefits than just location. The room was clean and just the right size for European standards. The windows blocked out the street noise and we slept like babies. The breakfast was hearty and complete with scrambled eggs, bacon, yogurt, cereal, fruit, pastries. Breakfast was a fair price for hotel guests (7 euro) but an outrageous 17 euro for our friend. Had we known that, she would not have eaten with us. Service was excellent, every staff member greeted us warmly. Parking was the tightest I have ever seen, but doable even for my midsize SUV. The only drawback was the weak wifi, and the allowance for only one device per room.
