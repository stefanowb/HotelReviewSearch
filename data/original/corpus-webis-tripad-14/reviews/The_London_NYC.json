Considering this is one of the most expensive cities in the world, The London provides a relatively sane price with excellent staff, large rooms and perfect location. Our package included breakfast which was a varied buffet and quite satisfying. The staff goes out of its way to be helpful, from the front desk to the concierge to the doorman. One evening when it was pouring rain, we had only 3 blocks to walk to our restaurant for the evening and lamented taking a cab for such a short distance but didn't want to get soaked. The doorman heard our conversation and offered us the the hotel car and driver which was not in use at the time. He whisked us to our destination in short order, saving us from both wet feet as well as a cab fare. That is service! The concierge was always friendly and extremely helpful. The only downside to our room was that the huge 2 person shower did not have a door and hence the water poured onto the floor every time we used it plus there was a distinct lack of privacy if that bothers you! One other caveat is that the closet was also a strange design. Also no door, and angled oddly so that there was very little room in it. The decor is very minimalist which isn't particularly our taste, but the bed was comfortable and the amenities were fine, including 2 flat screen TVs, one for each room.

It was apparent to us after a couple of days that other guests were greeted with a friendly hello, how was your day - we noticed this because we had the experience of head down, don't make eye contact experiences on a daily basis. As a young couple, on the holiday of a lifetime in a very expensive hotel that we paid for ourselves we both felt that we weren't treated as other perhaps more older or 'serious' guests. I'm sure nothing was meant by it however it was plain to both my partner and I that we were not taken seriously as welcomed guests. I personally have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, and other five star hotels all over the world and the London lived up to that in every other case except for our reception - I want to stress that no one went out of their way to be nasty, however both my partner and I were not treated equally - next time please don't judge a book by it's cover, if you hadn't we probably would have spent a lot more money on room service.", "title": "Had a great time and loved the room but.....", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RebelSorensen", "date": "October 25, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119698494}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "This hotel has found a way to combine Business, Pleasure and style.
