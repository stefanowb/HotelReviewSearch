It's not cheap, and because of that, I had very high expectations. To my pleasant surprise, they were more than met. As other reviews have said, husband/wife owners Ken and Susie are the perfect hosts. They really seem to love what they do, which adds to the enjoyment of staying here. Every evening, they host a happy hour in their downstairs pub, generously pouring local wines with accompanying appetizers and telling stories. It's like being invited to a party every day. We stayed there three nights celebrating our 11th wedding anniversary and got to know other guests and Ken and Susie, adding to the party feel. (By the way, we were suprised by a bottle of champagne waiting in our room with anniverary wishes.) Ken and Susie will do everything they can to help you and make your stay enjoyable. They even offer a tutorial about local vineyards, providing coupons and making recommendations. Our room was great. We were there during what was possibly the hottest week in Napa Valley history, and thankfully our room had two air conditioners. Breakfasts were lovely, coffee and tea were always available and there were dishes of chocolate candy everywhere. The home-baked chocolate-chip cookies left in the lobby throughout the day are to die for (I think the best I've ever had) and are reason enough to stay here! Thanks, Ken and Susie, for making our anniversary memorable, romantic and fun despite the uncomfortable weather!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Kaycj", "date": "September 8, 2006", "id": 5779274}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "Our weekend get-a-way to Napa was planned to be a very special anniversary celebration, so consequently we did some research to locate the perfect B&B and are so pleased we chose the magnificent Cedar Gables Inn!", "title": "This place is truly Napa Valley's most enjoyable B&B", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Luluslegacy", "date": "June 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5363489}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We Loved It!", "text": "The location was perfect, just on the fringe of downtown Napa, in a safe neighborhood within walking distance to several great restaurants.
