First and foremost upgrade your room from standard to superior befor you leave if nothing else, are first room was in block 53 ground floor rooms even though we had requested 2nd floor befor going, we were traveling with another couple and had are teenage boys booked into their own room, in total we had 3 dumpy dirty broken down bug infested moldy cigar stinking rooms! Needless to say I spoke to front desk immediately about being moved but they could not do anything till morning so I spent first night sitting in a chair I was not getting in that bed no way no how, the door in one room had no lock, the other room had a broken safe, other room had broken shower head. Next morn first thing we wen't to desk to get rooms fixed and of course they did not have 3 rooms in the same block unless we paid to upgrade what a surprise! Even though we had booked months in advance they just simply didn't care so 500 dollars Canadian later we went to block 47 rooms 21 22 24 what a difference an upgrade makes even the toilet paper in this room was better we had a view of the ocean, room was clean,bright balcony with table and chair it was a complete 360 from the standard room so do yourself a favor and upgrade your room. That being said you make your vacation and we had a fabulous time. food was plentiful although boring after a couple of days, beach was nice but covered in stinky seaweed the whole week never cleaned but we enjoyed the warm water and swimming in the waves,local drinks were plentiful but you had to pay extra for premium alcohol, we were only able to book one a la carte even though we were entitled to 4 and the man booking restaurants was not at all helpful we figured out on are own that the restaurants were only working at half capacity some were being renovated and others were simply closed and because we spent first morning changing the rooms we missed out on booking restaurants tough luck yet again! But we ate at buffet and it was fine just repetitive. Adult relax pool was very nice went to play ball in activity pool with boys to find they had drained it to fix broken tiles that every one had been complaining about in past reviews so good news is pool is fixed but sucked for our boys since they had no pool for activities and beach was red flag every day of our trip so we allowed them to play ball in adult pool, sorry if this interrupted anyone's sleep but we were not told the pool would be drained during our stay. All and all it appears we went mld during the clean up and repair week Befor busy season starts this is fine had we known about this befor booking and we could have made a choice to stay under these circumstances but we were not given this choice. Last thoughts on mld te resort is ok not a 4 star not bad but not great just ok we had a fun relaxing vaca because WE made it fun not the resort,we won't return this resort for above mentioned reasons and many more that I didn't write about just to long already just remember count on yourself to make your vacation fun.AND UPGRADE YOUR ROOM!!!", "title": "Make sure you upgrade", "user": "Sheshe64", "date": "November 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 120231626}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have been to Cuba 10 times, 3 times in Santa Clara, and found this facility to be one of the best they have.

The water and beach is very nice. Its hard to know where you want to be at the beach or at the great pools. This was my second visit and was better than the first. This place just keeps getting better. We had room 4526 and up stairs room and was very nice. Can't wait to return.

The main reception complex is beautiful and in full splendour with a large theatre for entertainment laid on nightly with a large bar so you do not go short of drinks. The Music Bands are a must to listen and dance to. The food is beyond reproach within the large buffet restaurant where the staff ensure you are well looked after. I am not one for giving tips/gratuities anywhere in the world but providing the service is what I expect it to be then I do relent at times. However whilst in Cuba please give small tips/gratuities around 1 to 3 CUC\u2019s as the Cubans who are a happy people, polite and courteous are on a very low salary, around 20 CUC\u2019s monthly that\u2019s about \u00a314.00 a month to us, they are most grateful and they will provide you a good service at all times. It also has a number of A Le Carte restaurants , all being nice with an ambiance that you would expect. The food is again beyond reproach though on some occasions I left feeling hungry but hey!

Remember I said isolated, there is nowhere to go from Cayo Santa Maria except a little place called Pueblo which is a hop skip and a jump away or a bus ride from the resort which has shops, restaurants and a few market stalls with local wears, also not far away is a Dolphin Sea Centre which I cannot comment on as I did not experience it. Your nearest big town is Santa Clara in fact where you land on arrival which is 1hr 50 mins away by coach or car but take advice before going, and arrange a tour. We went to Havana for three days a two night and stayed at the Hotel Nacional that entailed a 50 min flight and all transfers from hotel to airport to hotel with Breakfast and Dinner Buffet style for \u00a3227.00 each. Great value though the Hotel Nacional buffet food at dinner was not up to our standards so we had breakfast which was fair and we ate out in the day and evenings in a lovely little restaurant Caf\u00e9 El Mercurio in San Francisco Plaza in the old town where the staff and food were brilliant, so if you are ever in Havana give it a try you won\u2019t regret it. Please get the most from Havana, it is a must, do the bus tour for a few pesos and then go to the large castle/fort by bus T3 from Plaza Central where they do the nine pm gun fire every night. Over all Cuba is a great place to go with a very low crime rate friendly and accommodating people.
