It's convenient to the Capitol Reef NP, and is set in attractive surroundings with farmland next door. The only non-smoking room they had was a kitchenette, which was more than I needed, but very large. Although the fixtures were on the elderly side, it was clean, comfy, and the road is quiet at night, so good for sleeping. There is a large, smart conservatory-type indoor pool extension, and although I didn't have time to try it, judging by the happy sounds coming from other guests it was proving popular.", "title": "Nice quiet stopover", "user": "Aztec_Tripper", "date": "May 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16424336, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beautiful setting", "disliked": "\u2014 Older fittings"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I ate at the diner next door, and was well looked after: clean and not expensive.", "title": "We expected more....", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "rml86", "date": "April 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 15070280, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Close to Capitol Reef", "disliked": "\u2014 Not very clean."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "An okay Cheap Sleep", "text": "For the $50+tax I thought it was very good value, and would happily stay there again.", "user": "Ellie", "date": "March 11, 2006", "id": 4600191}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not too bad for the money.", "text": "A relative of ours suggested the Aquarius Motel for our visit to Capitol Reef. They said that it was old, but clean. We were initially impressed with the friendly greeting, however the Kitchenette Suite did not live up to expectations. On the surface, it looked clean. However, we found that it wasn't very clean at all. We even found mouse poop in two of the three beds! When we brought this to the management's attention, only a half-hearted apology was given. If you owned a motel, wouldn't you at least offer another room or some other type of concession? We half expected them to at least offer a discount in the price when we checked out, but all they said was: \"It sometimes happens!\" Maybe management of this motel should double-check the rooms before the guests arrive? On the other hand, our kids did enjoy the pool.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "TravelinOn", "date": "July 2, 2005", "id": 3630337}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Family Owned Motel", "text": "Traveling in Autumn, 2004, my sister and I stayed here.
