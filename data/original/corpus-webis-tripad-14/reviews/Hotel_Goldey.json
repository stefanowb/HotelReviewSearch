Great views of the Alps and the river from our balcony. Loved watching the sun rise on the Alps (beautiful pictures). Definitely worth the extra money to get the river/Alps view. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good continental breakfast and afternoon tea/cake included in the room rate. Rooms are very clean and bright with modern bathrooms. Good color scheme in our room (yellow and white with blond wood). About a 10 minute walk to either train station (but a pretty walk along the river). The hotel is not right downtown (about a 5 or 10 minute walk to the middle of town) but the plus to this is that the hotel is quiet - no road noise.
