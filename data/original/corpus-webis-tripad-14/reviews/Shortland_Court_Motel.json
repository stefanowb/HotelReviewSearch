Property recently renovated and very clean. Room itself was fully self contained with kitchenette, microwave etc, plus separate bedroom. Decor nice and bathroom recently updated/repainted. Only downside is some units right next to busy road and can be noisy early evening. Also, complex is no longer under Best Western banner. All in all, a good experience.", "title": "NIce Motel, Would stay again", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Biddleonia", "date": "January 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6610561}], "location": {"country": "New Zealand", "region": "North Island", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 5, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 2}, "aka": "Shortland Court Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667}
