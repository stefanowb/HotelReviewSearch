Love that the bar was open 365 days a year. Sometimes hotels will cut corners and close the bar for the winter months. Not at this Holiday Inn, everything was top notch!! Delicious Cuban sandwich and gin & tonic for lunch! MMMmm!! Staff was exceptional! Everyone spoke and was so willing to help. By far the nicest Holiday Inn I have ever stayed at.

It was still private in the room and quiet when we needed to sleep (the pool opens at 9 a.,m. then closes at 6 p.m.).

Whoever put the hot tub (for adults only) in the back of the kiddie pool area was an idiot. Kids are all around it and want to go in it and the hot tub closes when the kiddie pool area closes. (During our stay, the kiddie area and the hot tub sometimes closed earlier than the stated times. We were asked to leave the hot tub early once during our stay.) Had to turn in cards to get towels. I don't know if they were also serving as lifeguards, but the two teenagers running the towel area were normally not at the \"towel hut\" and at times there was a sign saying that you had to go to the front hotel desk to get towels. Despite the sign, the front desk staff seem aggravated that they had to hand out towels. Otherwise, front desk staff was very courteous and helpful.
