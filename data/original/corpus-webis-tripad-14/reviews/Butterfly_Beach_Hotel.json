The hotel is close to both Oistins and Lawarances Gap which is great for the fish fry in Oistins and there are alot of restaurants and bars in Lawarances Gap. There is also access to 2 lovely beaches from the hotel.

Our room overlooked the hot tubs and had a sea view and it was lovely to wake up and see the clear blue sea every morning. We hired a car for a few days and toured the island and saw some lovely places. There are not many places to eat nearby so if you don't eat at the hotel you will have to go into the Gap.

Our initial reception was appalling - our room was not ready, the receptionist was rude to the extent that I was ready to come home. Our room was large but the cleaning was questionable - the skirtings had not seen a cloth in weeks. Room service appeared to consist of making the bed and straightening the towels. Our bed sheets were not changed during our 7 day stay (a hole in the bottom sheet confirmed this). The restaurant was over-priced and poor quality, and the staff (apart from John) were surly and unfriendly. The pool area had clearly seen better days, with old paint and furniture that was very dirty. We finally decided to use the hotel as a base, only eating the non-cooked element of the breakfast, hiring a car and seeing the island, (with thanks to Deborah on the tour desk) - and found the hotel was not representative of Barbados.
