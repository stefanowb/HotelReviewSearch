The hotel has an a fairly bland look on the exterior , but inside the design leads to an oasis of calm. The corridors and open spaces are cool and airy. The hotel is convenient to an excellent beach and has its own beach club ,which we did not visit but looks impressive. We walked to one restaurant locally which was fine, other nights we drove to la calla , cabopina, or calahonda ,all of which have a choice of good restaurants. The hotel has 3 swimming pools and a children's pool, all in all a place I would re visit with pleasure.", "title": "Excellent hotel and location.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TorresN_Ireland", "date": "October 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180214815}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband took me to this hotel last week for my birthday gift.

Thank you to a recent Trip Advisor review which mentioned taking a travel kettle - we did! We ate in Baraka only once, then ate out each night and especially enjoyed the Beach House & Banderas restaurants - both easy walking distance near beach. We also found a lovely modern newly reopened & refurbished pub just down the hill, La Higuera, and were made extremely welcome by Christina and the world's smallest guard dog \"Dolphin\" on each visit and their Goulash was fab too.", "title": "Lovely Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MandR1988", "date": "October 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 180090602}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We didnt use the Hotel Spa - the complimentary day ticket we received could only be used on our first or second day when we had other plans.

It was absolutely beautiful. There are pools at the resort but nothing compares to the few minute walk down to the beach club and the Mediterranean beach waiting for you. For a few euros, you can rent chairs and the bar staff will come out and take your order. We were fortunate enough to arrive a little later in the afternoon and not incur the chair charge. Be aware the Spanish sun can still be strong as we got sun as late as 3:30 in the afternoon. There are sofas lined up outside the beach club where you can relax with a drink and appetizers and watch the sunset over the sea. The rooms are good sized and well appointed.

I agree with a lot of other reviewers that this lovely hotel tries hard but it's not really 5*. The fact is that the staff are so smiley and adorable that you feel bad pointing out stuff that just doesn't quite cut it. The front desk staff are excellent. Helpful, young and charming. The breakfast buffet is good - the charming Pinuccia stands out. The buffet dinner however is not quite up to the job. Barak is a good restaurant but lacks atmosphere. I would drop the miserable Rachmaninoff and play a bit of uplifting New York Piano bar stuff or Ella Fitzgerald or something chilled (same at breakfast - I LOVE Rachmaninoff but not with my bacon and eggs - both of which were very good by the way!) I also have to agree that attention to detail was missing and yes, the fabulous pool areas were marred because they felt a bit grubby - Geronimo the barman was a delight so once again you tended to overlook the detail. The hanging space in the wardrobes are too short for dresses. The lovely bath was too short to lie in. Glasses and plates were left in the room without being cleared. You see, I feel dis-loyal even saying this but it's all justifiable. I love this hotel, I want to go back but I also want to rectify the niggles. The main thing that put guests' back up (I heard a lot of talk about it) was the E35 charge, per person, per day to use the beach club - just cheap and how maddening is it to have to walk all around the perimeter of the hotel to get to the beach. Why not put a gate (activated by a room swipe key and closed at night for security?) in the corner of the gardens closest to the beach? There is the sweetest young man to run you down there but this is a hotel design fault. I also agree that there is a divine veranda area with stylish sofas and comfy chairs and also nice tables and chairs on the lawn but the bar staff aren't really well enough trained, plus once again, I agree, it would be simple to offer some good, upmarket bar food. The bar menus are grubby and sticky and need a re-think. I loved being at this hotel and will go back by which time I hope that the constructive criticism will have been taken on board by the management.", "title": "Building not 5-star, but staff and cleanliness are!", "user": "402Traveller", "date": "September 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176005811}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just come back from a long weekend stay at the hotel with my husband and 19 year old daughter.
