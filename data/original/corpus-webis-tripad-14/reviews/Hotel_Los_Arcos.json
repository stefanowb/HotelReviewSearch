It is a simple place with no frills. The amenities are basic, but enough to make your stay comfortable. The bathroom is rather small and dark, but very clean, which I liked most about the hotel. They offer you free coffee 24 hours, and the staffs are very kind and helpful. The hotel has a huge parking space. Their online booking system is reliable and efficient.", "title": "A good value in Catemaco", "user": "humble_drinker", "date": "September 22, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 118449170}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "It is located in the center of town, and you can easily reach any point of Catemaco. However, due to its centric location it can be quite noisy till late at night. There is a pool, and many guests with children lounge around the pool till late.
