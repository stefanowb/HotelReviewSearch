We found it through Trip Advisor, which is how we found every hotel on our two week trip. The Locanda Vivaldi is right on the Grand Canal, just a bridge or two past the Danieli from St. Mark's, and has beautiful views over the water from some rooms and from the rooftop terrace. The rooms were large and family rooms are available, they are decorated beautifully and the bathrooms are modern. The terrace is open for drinks and dinner, and throughout the day and night is left available for guests to use at will. The service was adequate but certainly not friendly, but the hotel itself and the lcoation made this an excellent stay, and we would recommend it to anyone going to Venice.", "title": "Great hotel, excellent location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Mondak", "date": "September 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8660046, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and quality of room (size, decoration, A/C, quiet)", "disliked": "\u2014 Service was less than friendly"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I've never had cause to complain on any review site before, but I have to say, the way my husband and I were treated at this hotel left me fuming.

In particular Stefano the manager of the hotel is largely to blame for my poor review. In reality with the exception of Stefano and his horrid performance my review might have been very different. Never in my life have I been treated so horribly by a staff member at any establishment. After we checked in for 3 nights we were told by Stefano that our room would most likely be available for only 2 nights and we would have to move to another comparable room without a view. Stafano failed to tell us that the other room was half the size without a bath. My wife packed our bags on the second day and we were moved to the other room. when we returned and saw the room I complained and was told by the front desk that they couldn't understand why Stafano moved us because our original room was still available. The next day on check out before I had a chance to say anything Stafano confronted me called me a liar and said he had never told us the room was comparable he then yelled at me and insulted both my wife and myself. Honestly the man should not be working in the hotel. He ruined what is in essence a ver nice hotel. Unfortunatly he is the manager and therefore has a major affect on the hotel and your stay. Therefore I suggest finding something else.
