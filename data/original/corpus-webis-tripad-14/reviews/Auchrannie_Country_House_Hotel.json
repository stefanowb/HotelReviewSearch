The room was really lovely. The beds were extremely comfortable, the good size TV was good to watch when we were tired after a day exploring Arran. The complimentary water was really welcome as was the use of a fridge to keep our wine cold. Both the House hotel and the spa hotel had swimming pools and pamper facilities. I had a very relaxing massage and it was reasonably priced and very good. The dining facilities were excellent. We had breakfast in the Eighteen69 restaurant looking out on beautiful gardens. In the evenings we ate at the Brambles restaurant and the staff were very attentive. I loved the fact that the hotel resort used Arran Aromatic products in the bathroom and selections of Arran cheeses in the restuarant. I would definately recommend this hotel.", "title": "2 night stay with a friend", "user": "Isabel M", "date": "September 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139890614}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Spent two nights at the Auchrannie Spa resort recently and had a thoroughly great time.

There was a slight mix up with our order, which was rectified within 5 minutes of our telling the apologetic waiter - so it didn't detract from our experience at all.
