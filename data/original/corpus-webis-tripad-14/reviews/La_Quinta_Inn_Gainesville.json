The room is fairly good sized with a desk, desk chair, side chair, and recliner. With all the furniture there is still a decent amount of floor space.

First, I didn't know that this was a motel style inn. I prefer inside hallways. But, that aside, the room was substandard. The bathroom had stray hairs on the floor, the shower was a trickle of water on your head, the complimentary shampoo bottle they provided was dirty, the toilet had some brown stuff (don't want to think too much about that ) on the front of the bowl, the beds were uncomfortable. Also, they have satellite tv, and only have a few channels--none of the major ones. I couldn't wait to check out. Felt like I needed a shower after leaving there.

Compared to the La Quinta I stayed in the previous night, this is not up to La Quinta standards. It is an older, and I'm sure a remodeled property. The water pressure for the shower was not much more than a trickle, although lots of water from the tub faucet. If this is done to save water, it is not being accomplished as we had to take longer showers due to the low water pressure. Also, the water would change from warm to cold when other water was used close by. The wi-fi was also weak. when I asked at the front desk, I was told that was normal. I have not had any problem with wifi at other La Quintas. The breakfast was the most frustrating. It is served only until 9:00am, at a motel in Florida with people on vacation. And I think just about everyone in the motel descended upon the breakfast room at 8:45am. The waffle machine was slow - the waffles stuck to the griddle and the only thing suggested by the front desk was a wet rag. They said they were told by the manufacturer to not spray oil when the unit was hot, and with 5 and 10 people standing in line, it stayed hot. And the waffle mix dispenser constantly clogged up, but with no staff there to watch, that made getting a waffle a long procedure. At least they did not close down the breakfast room at 9AM when so many people were still waiting to eat. On Saturday morning, there was a man who tried to keep things better supplied and the line moving a little faster.
