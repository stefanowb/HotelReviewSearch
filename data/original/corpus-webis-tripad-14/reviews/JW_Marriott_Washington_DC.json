The rooms are also just fine -- smallish compared to the last JW Marriott at which we stayed, but par for the course for a JW Marriott in the middle of a large metropolis, I suppose. They're very well-maintained. The hotel is for sure oriented toward conventions and business travelers; that much is clear just by looking at the lobby crowd any given morning. There are multiple floors of meeting spaces, etc. with merely a functional lobby. This lack of a real public space could be a bit offputting to a pleasure traveler, but it is what it is.
