There were the thin, hard pillows that were anything but comfortable. There was the total absence of decaf. coffee both in the breakfast room and my room. There was the bathroom door that didn't fit properly and couldn't be closed completely. There was the loud crash and thud of numerous large laundry cages being loaded in and out the elevator and staged on my floor between 6 and 7 AM.
