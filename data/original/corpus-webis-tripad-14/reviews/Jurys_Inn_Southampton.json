One was out of order for coffee - the other one wasn't working at all. I told a staff member who told me \"they should be working\". I agreed, they SHOULD be but they are not. It took a quite forceful exchange to get some coffee and tea out for the guests at 7.30am - peak business breakfast time. I went to reception on my way to work to advise about both sets of problems. The receptionist took details and gave a vague apology. I thought when I got back from work I'd find some kind of explanation/apology note from the manager in my room. There was nothing.
