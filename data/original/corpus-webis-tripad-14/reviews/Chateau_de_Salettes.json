We stayed in room 19, it looked wonderful, it was very clean and luxurious.It was very disappointing that I could not sleep at all because of the bed, a thin mattress on boards squeaking every time I moved. Dinner was brought to us with no choice offered in an empty restaurant. It felt very awkward being there. In the morning when we were trying to explain about the bed the staff said the manager was not there and we should write to him.
