This was one of them. The hotel is convenient to stay for a night. You can have a walk and dinner in Quimper and then head back for the hotel for the night (what we did). The breakfast here was only OK, with several choices not available (probably a big group got rid of everything very early in the morning). Anyhow, if you get a good price, the Oceania in Quimper is a nice, modern and clean option. The close Carrefour is a plus to stock groceries and petrol before leaving in the morning to continue the trip.", "title": "Good option for a stopover.

What a delighful surprise after being disappointed with so-called 3 star hotels of the Mercure chain. The Quimper Oceania, like the Oceania Airport hotel in Nantes, was stylish, service very professional, bedroom and bath spotless, and rooms well lighted. Next time we visit France we will check on this chain's properties first. Although I threw away their directory, I recall that they had properties in many cities in France.
