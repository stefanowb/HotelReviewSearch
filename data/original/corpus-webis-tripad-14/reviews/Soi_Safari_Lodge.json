We arrived late evening at the Soi Safari Lodge and were given rooms with no windows other than a small one in the bathroom that reminded me of a dungeon. The next night we were upgraded to better rooms with a view of the lake. There were three captive ostriches on the grounds that we enjoyed watching, however, we would have preferred them to be wild. The facility also houses other captive animals included some Grey Crowned Cranes that had clipped wings that I found offensive. I understand that they also house an African Fish Eagle. The service was only somewhat average and the food - not so great. However, I don't think there is anywhere else to stay in this small, depressed community. If I were to visit again, I would skip Lake Baringo.", "title": "Lovely situation but service only basic!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SVfromUK", "date": "September 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 141390407}], "location": {"country": "Kenya", "continent": "Africa"}, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 3, "very good": 1, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 8}, "aka": "Soi Safari Lodge Kenya", "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667}
