This is a very nice hotel, at a fairly reasonable price. The rooms are clean and comfortable. We booked a triple room, which we rented for only $77 dollars per night, considerably less than the tripadvisor average price. It was very large, with the two queen beds and a nice sized sitting area with couches and a desk. The front lobby was decorated for Christmas already, which was a nice touch. We found absolutely no problem with the wireless internet, as a previous review stated. The pool looked nice, also, and the continental breakfast was very good. Overall, we had a very plesant stay and would stay again if we needed to stay in Omak.", "title": "Good value, Nice hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "dogbone1002000", "date": "December 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6322126, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the clean, comfortable rooms, good price and hospitable staff", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing much... ideally the continental breakfast could have offered more fruit, but it is out of season so that wasn't a problem"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "I have stayed at the Omak Inn several times when I have been up there for business.

When the front desk person I spoke with sounded very confused while placing our reservation, it prompted me to call back to confirm later in the day. There was NO wireless internet in the room. This was a big problem as I had stressed that it was mandatory as we own a computer business and must be able to access the internet to keep a check on our servers etc. Whatever you do do not spend your hard earned money at the restaurant next door that they recommend, one would be much better off with the Subway sandwich shop also right next door.
