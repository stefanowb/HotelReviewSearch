The big attraction was to see the midnight sun for me at 1am! The scenery combination of mountains and sea together is quite incredible. Lots of activities too, recommend the sea safari (touching the ice walls from the boat is a must do!) and the deep sea fishing, mountain trekking and the massive waterfalls on the Reisa River. This is undoubtably one of the world's most beautiful places and the lodge fits right in. The only bad thing is that we had to leave!!!

The real point of the lodge is ski touring, which I can't comment on. But the scenery, service, food and design were all excellent - beyond our expectations. The setting is incredible, and although the lodge is right off a major road (you can't tell this from the pictures) it still feels remote. There's not really any traffic - you are pretty far removed here. The views from the dining area and living room are simply breathtaking. The staff was incredibly sweet and welcoming, and for two of the nights we were there we were the only guests and had a private chef! (That would never happen in season, I'm sure!) The meals were inventive and delicious, and without a doubt the best food we had in Norway. Thanks, Steve!! Mid-June is a bit of a tricky time to visit this part of Norway, and the Glacier Walk we had booked was cancelled since it was still too dangerous. The lodge staff did their best to advise us of options for day hikes, but weren't as well informed as I would have expected, and the owners were absent. If you are traveling here in the summer and want to hike on your own, I would recommend coming prepared with proper maps. The rooms are small and cozy, but the decor throughout is exceptionally well done. It is a really special place, and I would recommend it without reservation.", "title": "One of the best family holidays ever.
