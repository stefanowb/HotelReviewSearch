We booked this hotel through priceline for $60 and when we got there rooms were selling for $209 a night!!( plus an additional $35 charge for parking, which is ridiculous!) The room was very clean and modern. We had a room with two beds and they were very small, not sure we could've fit two ppl in one bed! The only thing I didn't like was the pool was really small and closed at 10pm, to me that was odd since it is New Orleans, ppl are up all night!! They have room service and a pretty good menu, if you don't mind paying $7 for mac-N-cheese! I had to pass.

Door guys met us at the car the moment we arrived and were amazing the entire visit. Our room was beautiful, clean and quiet but we had not received the requested fridge. I called the desk to ask if it was possible and a fridge arrived within 15 minutes. The bedding is top of the line luxurious and rooms have flat screen tv's with cabinets storing drawers and the coffee makers. The staff was absolutely amazing with Good Morning and Good Afternoon and How can we help you ..everytime we passed the lobby. I cannot rave enough! Their ATM was broken but they desk gave directions to the nearest ATM and suggested a restuarant that we have fallen in love with! Daisy Dukes is now a must visit! As for the location - Harrahs was a 4.50 cab ride and the streetcar was 2 blocks away...very easy to navigate from here.2 Trips this year and I'm still amazed at the hospitality of NOLA after Katrina...such a wonderful and historical, fun place!", "title": "Wonderful!!!

After being satisfied greatly that I was getting four star accomodations at a great price, I viewed the picutures posted on line for this hotel. It now way prepared me for the beauty, and sophisticated charm that we were about to behold. We only live forty five minutes from New Orleans and I needed two rooms for one night for my two daughters, one son and four young grandchildren. Our accomodations were pristine, beautifully decorated and everything worked. The staff was friendly, well trained, and effective in extending the comfort of a fine property. Parking was pricey, Valet service was available for $30.00. It is pretty conviently located and the view, may I say, was spactacular. Staying at down town hotels in the city causes your view of the city to be somewhat minimal because of the many tall buildings. We got to view the city from our room and my grandchildren were in awe. They just sat with me and gazed at all the sited. I must hail this property for their lovely and very plush bedding, fine linens and comfortable and abundant pillows.

They were a host hotel for the Jazz Half Marathon and all employees were informed and had information when needed. The only thing negative I can say is the cost of valet parking was a bit high at $31.00 plus some taxes (ended up $38.00). I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Instead it was a double, with the bed so close to the entry that you had to dodge to keep from banging knees. I stayed in the room though because the view was fantastic and nothing was left on the level I asked for. The showers were not as hot as I like them and the pressure was weak. The staff is laid back and super nice. If there were 10 stars for the staff I would give it to them. I did have entry to the concierges lounge which by far is the best one in any Marriott worldwide that I have been in. Very clean, nice staff and the fresh yogurt with granola was delicious.

We were able to walk to most of the local attractions (Bourbon Street, Harrah's, etc.). Rooms are pleasantly decorated and seem updated and clean. This hotel has two towers, and I didn't see any real advantage to one over the other - views appear the same, same distance to get to hotel amenities, etc. There is a restaurant on the lobby level, which has slightly better than average food, but the menu is pretty limited (and it's at hotel lobby prices - expensive). There were constantly lines at the front desk, but I know the hotel was sold out and very busy with the convention there. The elevators took me a minute to figure out, but they are quite efficient, which is great because during a convention with a sold out hotel I would normally expect to wait, but the wait times were usually quite short. During my visit I requested my room be cleaned at a certain time, and they complied with that. There is a full Starbucks in the lobby. The trolley is right outside the hotel, and taxis are plentiful out front as well - but we pretty much walked everywhere as a group. One side of the hotel has a river view, if that's your thing. I had city views, which is fine for me. This is a tall hotel - can't remember how many floors, but I usually request a high floor to stay away from city sounds. However, this usually means that if the elevator is packed, I have to endure many stops before getting to my floor - but their elevator system seems to help with that considerably. If you're looking to plan a business meeting, I highly recommend this hotel. Meeting rooms were nice, the service was good, and it was extremely convenient.
