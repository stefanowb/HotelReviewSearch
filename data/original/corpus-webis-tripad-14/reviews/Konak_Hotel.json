Upon arrival we were greeted by smiling staff all willing to take our cases and make us feel welcome. The apartments were clean and spacious with no problems whatsoever. The maid came in everyday to change our bedsheets and lay fresh towels and was very nice to us despite her only knowing the basics of english language. The staff were just lovely and very helpfull and friendly i could not ask for such nicer people to name a few theres Saffet,Emre,Rambo,EnesAkin and more who i didnt catch the name off. Everyday they were cheerful and happy and always pushing me and my friend in the pool which was funny. If it was someones birthday or any other celebration the whole aprtments would know about it making a big fuss with cake,loud music and dancing and happy faces everywhere. The pool was clean and very quiet in the day time a great place to relax really. At the night they sometimes had pool parties where everyone would get in the pool and have a great laugh which we enjoyed so much.
