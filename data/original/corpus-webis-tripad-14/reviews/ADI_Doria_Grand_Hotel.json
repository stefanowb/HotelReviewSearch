It has lots of positives for the tourist and is a haven from the hot hectic shopping streets of Milano. Good location near stazione centrale, not too seedy neighbourhood, no street noise, A/C worked well, lovely linen, big bed, big marble bathroom with powerful shower, good buffet breakfast, flat screen tv, a real key to get into the room and not a piece of plastic - quite rare these days! The carpet was quite old/worn but the room felt clean. The reception staff were nice and helpful overall even if they appeared icy at the start of our stay. Walking distance to the Corso Buenos Aires shopping street. Supermarket across the street. All up we would have liked to have stayed longer as it was very comfortable.

It's a long walk but down an interesting street with lots of diversions (shops, foods, great people watching, beautiful buildings, etc.). Later, for dinner, we went to a wonderful restaurant called L'Osteria del Treno, located only about 5 minutes away from the hotel. When we checked out, we walked to Stazione Centrale, a mere 5 minutes away.
