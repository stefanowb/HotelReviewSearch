First ,If your not staying in a suite - forget it!! The first day we arrived we payed for 3 rooms. In our room I pulled back the sheets to lay down and found hair and cooked rice in the bed. Yuck! By mid day we had ants crawling in our room. Okay - this can happen. My mother's room had ants too - bad! So we let the front desk know and they said they would spray the rooms. No one ever came so at 10pm at night we were switching to new rooms. What went from bad just got worse. In our room the carpets were damp and the toilet had mold growing on the entire seat! My mother's room had mold growing on the walls - all over the walls! The toilet didn't flush either. This time I went to the manager and spoke with him. The rooms were terrible but the staff from the time we arrived was great! The manager exchanged our rooms to 3 suites at no extra charge and paid for our breakfast the next day. The suites were clean, new and updated. They were fresh and really made the difference. In the rooms there is a plastic desktop that states if your not satisfied they will make it right and they did. I would not return to this hotel unless I was in a suite. There is a restaurant attached (Friday's) but there is a Cracker Barrell, Denny's, Komo's Steak House and two other restraunts all in walking distance. There is a Walgreens in walking distance too.

The room was very clean and we do not have any complaints. There is a computer with free internet access and printing wich came in very handy....also, a games room and gift shop. Adam at the front desk was especially friendly and helpful. Free parking was a bonus. Also, after a long hot day at the theme parks...

The toilet did not flush unless you held the handle down. The grout around the tub was black. The stopper for the sink was disconnected.

We had a wonderful experience and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It was clean and comfy and a short walk to Universal/Islands of Adventure/City Walk. Although you do have to cross 5 lanes of traffic initially, the traffic lights do provide you a leisure pace to cross. The walkway to Universal is very clean, peaceful, and tropical. It took us approximately 10 minutes to get to the entrance. Now mind you, this hotel is nothing lavishing or fancy, so if you're looking for something really upscale than you might want to stay in the park and pay a ton of money. But for the price, the Holiday Inn was worth it. The pool was refreshing- and the staff at TGIF's was at hand to serve you food and drinks by the pool. My family and I stayed in a one bedroom suite, (which was great) because we have a teenager and the bedroom provided privacy for my husband and I while my teenage son enjoyed the pull-out sleeper with his own t.v. in the living area. The cleaning service was A+. Our room was cleaned spotless every day and there was plenty of clean towels and extra bedding on hand. Also to keep in mind, while the Double Tree hotel is also within the same vicinity and walking distance, what I didn't like about the Double Tree (if you observe in photos) is that none of their windows open for ventilation. While all the rooms are air conditioned at Holiday Inn (as I'm sure with the Double Tree), at least at the Holiday Inn you're able to get some fresh air from the windows as well.
