We have been fortunate enough to have stayed at many 4 and 5 star properties as my boyfriend is a corporate travel agent and we get some great perks. I have never written a review of a hotel before this one and what prompted me was the lobby bar situation at the Loews Ventana Canyon Resort. Let me start with our check-in. We had requested an early check-in but understandably, it sometimes cannot be accommodated as was the case this time. We did have to keep checking each half hour to see if the room was ready. We also were a little grumpy from our very early morning flight so it seemed worse than it was. There were, in fact, quite a few people waiting for their \"early check-in rooms\". Anyway, our room was great. Clean, bright, view of the city, very close to the elevator and on the 4th floor (so nice view). The marble around the sink in our bathroom was cracked as mentioned earlier, and the bathtub was huge!!! I mean huge!!! The staff at this hotel was very cordial and friendly. The Concierge was the absolute best. Very helpful. Now to the Lobby bar. I think being non-smokers living in a state that has banned smoking from all public places (even bars) has spoiled us. The lobby is attached to the lobby lounge/bar area. A very nice looking comfortable area with a big fireplace in the center. The problem for us was that they allowed smoking in there and at night the entire lobby wreaked of cigar and cigarette smoke. In the early morning you sould still smell the stale smoke lingering. We never sat in there. In fact, we actually went to other resorts to have a cocktail before or after dinner. It was really a shame. They do have 2 pools, but the second pool is kind of hidden behind the spa. It's not as appealing because it's surrounded by a huge iron fence but we were told it is very quiet. There are more good things about this hotel than bad, but I'm not sure I would stay here again unless they enclose the lobby bar.

It was totally worth it. Everyone is very friendly and professional. Services like \"turn-down\" and free-water for hiking is greatly appreciated. We got a great deal on their direct website ($208), and were upgraded to a nicer room (nicer means \"view\") just for joining the Lowes hotel program online before arriving (you get other perks with that, too). The rooms were fantastic--- very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful and featured a large jacuzzi tub. Pool-area is beautiful and the pool itself is immaculate. We didn't eat there because having been \"locals\" for four years, we had our favorite restaurants to attend. I'd recommend leaving the resort for food- you'll gasp at how much they charge for guacamole at the pool, and it ain't fresh!

I had requested a room with a view of a \"grass or desert landscape view\" since my husband loved the desert. I had booked this under an AARP rate and was surprised when our room (room #3269) ended up being approx. 5 to 8 minutes of walking distance from the lobby. There was no straight route of getting there as the elevators did not go from the lobby anywhere near our 3rd floor room. We had to get off and walk a long long way. After walking that distance with our heavy luggage (it was about 108 degrees that day) we found our room to be in a very dark corridor, so dark it was difficult to unlock the door. I was still optimistic that the room itself would make up for the walk. I was very disappointed to find when I opened the door to the patio that my long anticipated view was of desert scrub and we couldn't see anything at all beyond it. The room did not even have a coffee maker. Yes, it did have a small tv in the bathroom but a coffee maker would have been more appreciated since tv screen was so small you couldn't have viewed it from the tub anyway. The room was clean and I have no complaints on the staff of the hotel. They were very friendly to both of us. I just wish our visit would have been more of what I had hoped it to be. The grounds were so beautiful, I just regret not being able to enjoy their lovliness from our room instead of from the window of our car as we drove away.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 24, 2005", "id": 3497496}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "My husband and I were st Loews Ventana Canyon Resort for four days.
