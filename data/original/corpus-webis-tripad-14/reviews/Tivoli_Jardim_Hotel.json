Hotel Tivoli Jardim is the little sister hotel of the larger and grander Hotel Tivoli Lisboa next door. \u00a0The hotel was clean and modern, and the staff was pleasant and helpful. \u00a0Standard rooms are modern, nicely decorated, but a little small by American standards. \u00a0The lobby area is also very small. \u00a0With the exception of two clamshell hanging chairs located beside the reception desk, there was no place to sit and relax. \u00a0However, one flight up is a small lounge/bar with additional seating. \u00a0Our stay included breakfast, which offered a nice selection of fruit, cereal, yogurt, bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage and pastry. \u00a0Guests staying at Hotel Tivoli Jardim are welcomed to use the facilities at Tivoli Lisboa next door, including a pretty outdoor pool, but with a somewhat inconvenient hike up several levels of steps, but well worth the walk. \u00a0This lovely, inviting pool is round, surrounded by trees and greenery and includes bar service, and is a popular place to relax for guests from both hotels and, as such, lounge chairs are scarce during the mid-day hours. \u00a0Consequently, it was difficult at times to find a vacant chair or lounger. \u00a0Otherwise, it's a lovely hotel oasis. \u00a0For guests who don't mind small rooms and a less than inviting lobby, the hotel is a fine stopover for a short stay in Lisbon.", "user": "Sloan_Chace", "date": "August 1, 2011", "id": 116121149}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Ants all over the Dining Room", "text": "Had seven nights here at the end of July.
