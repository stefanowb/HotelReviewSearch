With the Kastelli this is different. The hotel price through tour operators is much more competitive that booking direct \u2013 which seems odd \u2013 but then it does give more of us the opportunity to experience this excellent hotel. It\u2019s interesting to read such mixed reviews on TripAdvisor when this is one of the very few hotels that we have been back to and have had such a great experience on both occasions. The rooms are quirky and cool, the staff friendly and the location excellent. You are just a short stroll from Kamari\u2019s lively strip and the beach and yet you feel a million miles away when lounging by the lovely pool. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I have enjoyed and the setting by the pool is beautiful. We always eat out in the evenings so I cannot comment on the evening food but there are plenty of taverna\u2019s, bars and restaurants along the strip. Kamari is the best town on the Island for nightlife and whilst Fira and Oia are well worth a daytime visit I wouldn\u2019t trouble them in the evenings when you have Kamari\u2019s strip on your doorstep. Be prepared for the bar prices \u2013 there appears to be a pricing cartel and it will cost you five quid for a pint anywhere in Kamari and seven quid or more in Fira. Finally, make sure that you pay the legendary Irene a visit at the very end of the beach. Irene Bar is fabulous for lunch and the filleted sardines are the best on the planet.", "title": "Kastelli Not So Quiet Resort", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Katz6", "date": "October 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 46179276}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This review is based on the fact that this hotel is a member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World. The reception staff were terrible here, I find any positive reviews about them very hard to believe. Our first experience of this was as soon as we arrived, we certainly didn\u2019t appreciate being told to hurry when being shown to our room (the woman was practically running). We were shown to a hideous twin room (we booked a double) which was 2 star at very best. The bathroom was shocking - very shabby - a flush which didn't fit the loo, a wonky broken loo seat, mildew shower curtain and a tiny bath. Grey towels supposed to be white I think. Bad red and pink d\u00e9cor (bad paint job too) and finger marks all over the place. If Small Luxury Hotels of the World saw this room, I hope they would be wondering if they should put their name to it. We saw other couples changing rooms throughout our stay, so I can\u2019t understand why they would risk putting anyone in these rooms because the result will only be bad reviews on this site.", "title": "A beautiful oasis in a wonderful location with fab staff!", "user": "QuirkyKat", "date": "September 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 45530973}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Myself and Gill stayed at this resort from Sept 8th -15th.
