Andy, the proprietor is very jolly and an excellent host. Staff are friendly and nothing is too much trouble for any of them. Breakfast was perfect - cooked if you want it or cereals and fruit if you don't with a waiter who remembers your order from the previous day - impressive! Dinner was equally good and again great service. My only constructive comment would be regarding the heating in the rooms - despite turning the radiators off, they are still too hot due to the heated towel rails in the bathrooms. So hot - but many people may prefer it this way. Rooms are very individual, with sloping floors etc. All in all, I would highly recommend this place and hope to return.", "title": "Nothing too much trouble", "user": "diddi2012", "date": "November 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 145029300}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Staff very friendly and helpful.

Had lovely welcome from Andy who was always smiling and took the trouble to ask us if we'd had a good day, what we'd got planned etc. and seemed genuinely interested. Room was well furnished and bed very comfy. Nice also to have electric heater so we could control the heating ourselves (perfect if like me you feel the cold!). View from window was just overlooking a flat roof and buildings but on the plus side this meant that we weren't overlooking the road and it was therefore quiet on a night. Towels changed each day which you don't seem to get very often these days. Good hospitality tray. Ate in the restaurant both nights and food was excellent (as it was at breakfast). Lovely oak carved dining room. Reasonable prices and a very high standard of food/presentation, even when they were busy the food was served promptly. Bar can get very busy on a Friday/Saturday night and we preferred to walk round the corner to have a drink in The Feathers (which was quieter and a more relaxed atmosphere with plenty of space and nice sofas and arm chairs to just sit back and relax on, although that is obviously personal choice for us).", "title": "Lovely Visit", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Cakesy", "date": "April 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157017713}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Parking is in a long stay car park, probably about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.
