We started making phone calls to find a new one and came across Duques de Bergara through pure luck. The lobby was grand and our room was spotless. Our a/c worked very well, the beds were super-comfy and our bathroom was all marble and very nice. We had a tiny balcony overlooking the entrance to the hotel and could see part of Placa Catalunya. We had a noise & light blocking door leading out to the balcony so the room was pitch black and silent while we were sleeping (maybe too much)! Location is very convenient too, not far from Las Ramblas and very close to transportation. The airport bus drops you very close by and is a bargain for 4 (or 5?) euros. Plus, El Corte Ingles in Placa Catalunya is my new favorite department store!", "title": "Great find", "user": "michyNYC", "date": "August 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 18955839, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 cleanliness of room, convenient location, noise & light blocking door"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We are pretty well-traveled and have stayed at a variety of hotels, B&Bs, etc from -5-star to basic. This by far was the worst hotel experience we've had. We checked into a room with a smelly bathroom, and stinky tile floor. The room was overall pretty run down, with old, scratched up paint on the walls, and old furniture. We couldn't sleep because of the offensive smell. So we complained and asked to be moved. They first offered to clean our room, which did not help with the smell. The room we were moved to was even WORSE, and SMALLER in size. We rejected that, threatened to move out, and were offered a third room. When we lied down in bed, we discovered BUGS crawling all over us. We catapulted out of bed, and out of that hotel.
