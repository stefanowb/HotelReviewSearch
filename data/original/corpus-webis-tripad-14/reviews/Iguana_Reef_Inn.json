It was quite hot while we were there and the pool was perfect! We also greatly appreciated the large air conditioned rooms. We had a standard seaside room on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool, and a 2nd floor standard parkside room. Actually, the parkside room was nicer because it was a corner room with lots of windows.
