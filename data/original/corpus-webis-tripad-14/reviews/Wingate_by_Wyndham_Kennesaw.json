Definitely fit the bill for a one night stopover on our way to Florida. It's in a very, very busy area..... Lots of traffic and congestion. It was a Friday evening in an area of lots of shopping and restaurants, so that may have been a contributing factor. Getting to the location off the x-way was a bit tricky. Our nav system got us to the location, but the driveway we were directed to was closed off. We had to drive around a bit through various parking lots and shopping areas to find our way to the entrance. Tricky, but we managed.
