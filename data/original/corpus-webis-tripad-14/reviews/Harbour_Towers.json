This years experience was a little different than last. The positives were that the staff were very helpful and friendly, and the beds are relatively comfortable. Some of the negatives are, that there were apparently some water problems because when I went to take a shower the water fluctuated between glacier cold and scalding hot the entire time! I has to jump out of the tub at least 10 times to avoid being scalded. All I could think of was thank goodness I am relatively young and could do this without severely injuring myself. I promptly called the front desk and they sent up a repair man, and offered to give us another room. We decline and just asked the the problem be fixed. We did not have time that day to move all of our things to a new room. The front desk did send up a note that evening apologizing and gave us a voucher for 3 breakfasts at the resteraunt in the hotel. When we went to check out, these breakfasts were charged to our room and I had to some what argue with the person helping us that those were not valid charges. Also, the rooms were not air conditioned and this meant that we had to keep the windows open which made for a quite loud night of cars honking etc. We also had a down comforter that had stains on it, and the elevators smelled really badly.
