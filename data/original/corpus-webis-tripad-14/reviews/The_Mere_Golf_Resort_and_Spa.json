I had two treatments, a back massage, then a break in the relaxation room before an excellent facial, both therapists were very friendly and caring.

Upon being checked in I decided to visit the leisure club or rather a leisure club with a prison desk. The blond haired lady was incredibly intimidating and her her colleague was flicking her bobble around! The changing rooms and spectacular poolside made me feel better especially the heated pool and jets. This uplift was short lived, no one was manning the leisure bar and after asking for service, scary blond haired lady tried her best to get staff but then giggled with her colleague while looking at me -fantastic service! Her colleague was short with dark hair and ponytail just in case management read this. The hotel rooms are nice but the teles channels only had half working. Club lounge restaurant is a beautiful setting but food and service were poor. 50min wait and confusion amongst the staff respectively. If the owners of this resort live away from it I suggest they come for a closer look, as the setting and facilities give this place potential but whoever is in charge either doesn't care or doesn't know what there doing", "user": "Adam H", "date": "February 3, 2013", "id": 151288561}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Just spent 2 nights at the Mere Hotel and could not fault the hotel in any way.

A light bulb had blown in the bathroom and this was replaced within about five minutes of my call so it would appear that they value service. Excellent spa facility on site with very large swimming pool and five different spa rooms to test out as well as bracing cold and aromatherapy showers. You could spend hours in there! Even though this is a golf resort hotel we didn't see any golfers around (a plus even though I play golf!) so I presume the resort does its utmost to keep separate areas for leisure visitors and golfers.

It is a little tricky to find the entrance if you come in from the M6 side, and our sat nav directed us to the delivery entrance first of all. The refurbishment work on this place has been carried out to a very high standard, and the new buildings blend well with the old. Judging by the number of Range Rovers in the car park, it seems to be the venue of choice for the Cheshire set. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We ate in the golf clubhouse bar in the evening as it was less formal than Brown's restaurant (and cheaper) and the service was very good. Entertainment was briefly provided by a woman screeching at the top of her voice about her partner's soup being served cold, followed by her storming out demanding to see the manager, as her mortified partner tried to calm her down! Breakfast was a more relaxing experience than at other places we have been to and although it was self service, it was quiet and it was nice that they brought the toast to your table, rather than having queue at a slow browning toaster. We enjoyed using the spa, and it was good to see that under 16s were banned from the hydrotherapy pool and there were restricted swimming times for children. The room was a decent size, and it was furnished to a high standard with a spotless bathroom and good quality toiletries. Everything was clean and tidy throughout and it was just a nice peaceful place to be. I think it would be particularly nice to come in the summer when you are able to sit outside and enjoy the view over the lake.

Whilst proceeding through the booking it confirmed number of people & the small print confirmed children under 12 stayed free, child o/12 \u00a3 etc. The following morning I received a call stating there was a charge of \u00a335 for the child - no welcome hello or introduction of who the caller was - I had to ask who was calling! I advised of above but was told it was policy for the hotel to ring to confirm the extra fee. I questioned this as the small print stated child free & I was advised that is only if the existing beds were used and as this was a double room there was a charge for an extra bed. From a customer perspective and past experience with booking.com by entering the number of guests I assumed we would all have a bed to sleep? I was advised that if the child slept in the double bed with us there wouldn't be a charge. The young lady stated she would speak with her manager & call me back. Two minutes later I received a return call, no introduction again. She had spoken with her supervisor the fee stood & she then explained how I should have interpreted the small print (I'm not sure that is what trading standards would have expected of me.) She then stated it wasn't the hotels error it was booking.com and they would be contacting them later that day. I may have considered paying the additional fee had the small print not have been so misleading and if I had been treated with some courtesy. Very disappointing service.
