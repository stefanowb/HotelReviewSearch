Fantastic hill/ridgetop collection of stone buildings and setting and views. Spacious clean well equipped (yes - a washing machine!) 2 bd apartment. Close to Castellina and well positioned regionally for all that Tuscany has to offer. Luigi the manager had gone so we missed his (apparently) excellent individual input. We'd stay again but definitely not in an apartment due to quite intrusive noise from adjacent apartments morning and night, and lack of privacy in the outside table sitting area, but we would stay in a separate villa/house ( ...nearly all the glowing reviews are from people who stayed in these types of accomodation). The infinity pool (not heated so not used) and bbq area is nicely set out. Quite cool evenings in our stay so we got the log fire going a couple of times....10 euros a pop! Internet only via one desktop in the office...6 euros an hour! The in house wine tasting was a treat. We tried the restaurant at the driveway/entrance and found the food really good and the owner a bit of a character - if you are thin skinned go elsewhere to eat.", "title": "fond memories despite..", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DebJD", "date": "November 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 21446584}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a wonderful stay here for three nights in October.

If I were to go again with just one other person, I would probably stay at a B&B only because we found we didn't need all of the space we had!
