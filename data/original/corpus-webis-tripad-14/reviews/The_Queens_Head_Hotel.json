We'd had a nightmare journey trying to navigate through Bedford (must ask Santa for a SatNav next year). The hotel seemed in the middle of nowhere and situated on a busy main road. As it turned out we could not have picked a better hotel to stay in. Our room (room 2) was spacious, clean and well equiped and fortunately not overlooking the main road so nice and quiet as well. Electric panel radiator in bedroom meant we could have the heating on when we wanted it, not when the hotel dictated it, which was very pleasant at this time of year. Bathroom was adequately furnished with a shower much better than the one we've got at home.
