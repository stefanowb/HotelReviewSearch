Embassy Suites is our favorite hotel and we normally spend 10 to 12 nights a year at different locations around Dallas and Austin. The Frisco location is by far the best one yet. We had a balcony suite that was extremely large in compariision to other Embassy Suites hotels, it also faced directly at the Roughrider field. This made it where we could sit on our balcony and watch the game. The staff were very attentive and made us feel very welcome. The rooms were clean, towel animals on the bed were an added surprise, and breakfast was great as usual.

The couch cushions were stained, as were the dining table chairs. You'd expect the room at the ES to be luxurious and spacious. It was NOT! Linens are outdated. Rooms are small!

Although on first appearance the room seemed OK in that my daughter who uses a wheelchair could get into the bathroom and bedroom areas easily. However, after the first night, we realized how mistaken we were on first appearance. The roll in shower, after one use, flooded the entire bathroom floor, as the shower was neither sloped for better drainage nor had a barrier dam to prevent the water from spreading. Everything that had been on the bathroom floor was soaked. In addition, the beds were fairly high off the ground so I had to assist her into the bed as she couldn't do it on her own because of the height. This problem, however, we could live with. When I reported the shower problem to the front desk, they sent the plumber up to the room since they thought it was simply a clogged drain. He checked it out and confirmed that the shower was poorly designed and that there was no plugged drain. He reported his findings back to the front desk and they suggested that I form a towel barricade on the floor to prevent the water from spreading. They said no one had complained before about this situation, so they were willing to provide me with an extra supply of towels each day for that purpose. I asked for the manager who then suggested that we transfer to a non wheelchair accessible room. I said I would consider that, even knowing that my daughter would probably have to crawl into the bathroom, but only if they could provide me with a common tub seat that fits across a tub so she could at least use the tub for bathing. The manager said that they only had a tub chair that was about 36 to 48 inches in length and that it would only fit across the tub in a lengthwise or diagonal direction. I said that that would be useless because it would prevent her from safely moving to the bottom of the tub for sitting. Because we were at the Embassy Suites for a family reunion with more than 6 other rooms already booked by our relatives, I saw no other alternative but to stay in the wheelchair accessible room with the daily flooding floor. Each morning I would put the towel barrier down around the shower and then call the front desk for clean up.

He replied that I should have moved to another hotel. As mentioned previously, with a family reunion at this hotel, that would have been ridiculous, particularly since we were all sharing cars.
