When you are working to a budget, you want absolutely everything for the best price. I had asked for a view of the pool before our stay and the staff were lovely about this.. We had only booked a double which dont have balconies but they gave us the only room with a huge window overlooking the pool which looks lovely at night which is all I had really wanted having seen the pictures on the internet beforehand. We could just see the Club twinkling opposite above the other rooms. We were a bit unsure about how safe we were in LA so we decided to order takeaway to our room both nights. Despite asking lots of questions about how to go about this, the staff were always pleased to give advice and offer us menus to look at. I have to say that both meals were absolutely wonderful. I was a bit disappointed with the room I guess as it had no bedside lamps which meant that you had to get out of bed to turn the light off and also despite having items to make coffee, no coffee machine??? The thing which I found most difficult however was the noise. I am from the country in Lincolnshire and am used to quiet at night but there was a constant hum all of the time - we guessed from the pool. But on top of this, the fridge was also very loud and our neighbours decided it was a good idea to play their TV very loud until about 3 in the morning not considering other guests at all.

We like the room right away because of the size ( we just came from a much smaller room in san fran.) My son was in his glory with the free snacks that were given to him with a smile every time. I also made use of this feature on beach days and we must of saved a good one hundred bucks overall getting snacks before we left for the day. We swam one night the pool was clean and heated with nice music playing. We loved the baked goods in the morning the best of any continental breakfast we ever had. Another great feature of the hotel is they have washer and dryers. we were on vacation for two weeks so we need to do some wash. washer was one dollar per load and dryer around seventy five cents. They give you free laundry detergent. This hotel is everything this web site claims it to be. Friendly hard working staff, clean, great location , and with All the freebies its a good value for families. I have to give a shout out to the housekeeping staff. perfect service never knocking on door when we slept in and room always spotless when we returned with the extra turn down service you don't see much any more in this class hotel. Now I do have one complaint and its pretty significant. the air conditioning system is old and very loud which made it hard for me to get a good nights rest. Besides the noise the room temp changed from hot to cold all night long blankets on blankets off. I was unable to get up as early as I usually do making my mornings a little rushed. I never complained about this to management because moving rooms was not an option for me ( I hate doing that more then anything) and I read that was a problem so I suspected all the rooms were like that. I know the manager reads this site. Please do something with the air conditioners and you will have your self a perfect hotel in my opinion.

Our room was lovely. You could tell it was an older hotel that had been refurbished. But with great attention to detail! It was so clean. The bed was comfortable with a wonderful soft duvet. There was a refrigerator, a coffee maker, blow dryer, huge remote control television, makeup mirror, delicious smelling tangerine smelling soap, shampoo and cream rinse and abundance of wonderful fluffy towels.

The bed was so cozy and squishy with the pillows and duvet. The rooms were big, with 2 TVs. Our son had the hide-a-bed, and felt like he had an apartment to himself when we went to bed. The breakfast was so yummy. It poured while we were there, and I wondered how we would get our breakfast to our room; but no problem: they had cut plastic bags to cover our trays. They also had umbrellas for anyone that needed them. All the staff were exceptionally nice to deal with. I feel though, its sort of \"the squeeky wheel gets the grease\", stuff happens when you complain, but the first day the room still wasn't cleaned at 4:30PM, and no extra shampoo, and towels (for 3 people). But the next day (after complaining), the room was cleaned earlier, with enough towels, and shampoo. It truly was perfect for us.

The hotel part is small and set around a courtyard, there are lots of steps to navigate if you have heavy luggage or are unsteady on your feet and no elevator (check out the photos posted by another reviewer). The rooms are pretty basic and our bathroom was quite roughly finished, but it was clean and comfortable and had everything you need, including a refrigerator. The table top ironing board was a pain as it collapsed every time any kind of pressure was applied - a regular ironing board would have been much better. Other than that, the facilities in the room were fine and the shower was EXTREMELY powerful! It was quite noisy at night with other guests arriving back late and also there was some traffic noise as our room was right by a side street. Breakfast was OK. The big pluses for this hotel are its location, the reasonable cost and the extremely helpful and pleasant staff, especially Mike - give that man a raise!
