As with many places, high end and low end, your attitude definitely influences the service you receive and I wonder if that might not be reason for some of the negative experiences. It is true that many places in Mexico (and elsewhere) that are 5-star are not necessarily what you would consider a 5-star say in NYC, London, or Paris. Doesn't mean they're not nice places to stay!
