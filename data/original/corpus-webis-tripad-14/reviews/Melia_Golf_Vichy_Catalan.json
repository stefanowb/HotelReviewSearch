The accommodation was clean and comfortable with a contemporary feel. We managed to get interconnecting rooms on a last-minute booking which surprised me. The only shame was that the interconnecting rooms did not have a balcony so once we'd put the kids to bed, it was not possible to then sit outside on balcony for the rest of the evening. The breakfast was excellent, but for the price, only good value when included in the price of the room. The pool was comfortably big enough for those of us with younger children.

Our only gripe was we couldn't get lunch until after 1.30, but that was our own fault because we booked a tee off everyday at 1.00pm, so we missed lunch, and couldn't get anything to eat until both restaurants opened up at 8pm. In the evening there is an \u00e0 la carte affair which we found a bit too much, and didn't really fill you, certainly wasn't worth the money, stick to the second restaurant next door for good old fries and a continental burger!
