Again, not to say it was terrible. It actually was fairly comfortable. The bed and linens were good and everything appeared clean. But it was not a luxury hotel in any sense, and I was paying luxury prices. Also, it was advertised as having a balcony. I think they should clear up that the balcony is actually a closed-off terrace off the entry hall to the room. The table and chairs on the terrace were sort of strewn around, so no care was taken to make it welcoming in the off season. You could not see this \"balcony\" from the room, so it was quite different than I expected. But it did have a knock-out view of the Swan River. We did like that, and the view really saved the room in many ways, as we also had a small river view from our bedroom. But all in all, the room was very lightly furnished, and bathroom was just OK. We also had a very noisy generator or something adjacent to the room which ran at random times, even in the middle of the night.", "title": "Brilliant!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "findarainbow", "date": "August 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172607638}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Regency Club was better than expected.

They were helpful and knowledgable. I took my daughter for a sandwich in the cafe restaurant on one of the evenings I was there. It was a simple order of a toasted cheese sandwich. It took over an hour to arrive. I asked several times where it was and each time I was told a few more minutes. The cafe was not busy at the time so I have no idea why it took so long When it finally arrived there was no apology for the time it took. Terrible service in a country where service everywhere we went was fabulous. The hotel is well located close to the city centre with lots to do in the area. The decor throughout is very bland.
