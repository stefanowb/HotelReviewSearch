We stayed here from the 23/09 - 26/09 and were not dissappointed. Our room was on the 3rd floor in the main building and our view was nothing spectacular. But who goes to a hotel and stares out the window the whole time. This was our first time in America and we found the front desk were extremely helpful with any of our needs. Very convenient having a small shop inside the hotel. We found that walking to Downtown Disney was a good option for meals as it was only a 10-15 minute walk down the street. Downtown Disney also has access to the actual park. Quite a few times we actually walked to Disneyland instead of catching the ART bus. But the ART buses were also a good way to see more of Anaheim as they had to go to other places before they dropped you off at DIsneyland. The restaurant was nice, but as a lot of people say the meals are huge. But good value for your money. And just down the road, about a minute walk is a shop, which is handy for snacks. Overall this hotel was excellent. A great way to start off our trip in the US.

Since we are all larger people, and since my husband and I have bad knees, we prefer a king bed, and were happy to find that this hotel had King Suites, a king bed with a queen sofa sleeper. Going through the Holiday Inn website, I found that a King Suite would only be $530 (room and tax) for 4 nights Advance Purchase (non-refundable), only $156 more than a Standard 2-Queen room. Our friend would pay the difference, so SOLD! A month later, we arrive, only to find that the only suite available was a Queen Handicapped, which meant that my husband and I spent the next four nights fighting for space (you should SEE my bruises - the 3 incher on my knee is a real beauty!). AND, the bathroom was a nightmare - the bathtub had a seat that could be lifted but not kept out of the way, making the tub half normal length, it had no spigot, and the hand shower (which should have been both a handheld and a fixed-slidable showerhead, but the showerhead part was missing and the slide broken) worked intermittantly at best. There was also no counter space (the bathroom was huge, but it's all open space to accommodate a wheelchair), which made it interesting for 3 adults to share. The final insult was the elevators - our building (the only one with suites) has 2 elevators. One of them was under reconstruction (wires hanging out of the call button plate), and the other did a bungy-cord dance on reaching our floor (6), which traumatized our travel companion who has a phobia about elevators anyway. When management was confronted about the problems, they did offer to knock off what worked out to $39 from the bill, but frankly I felt that it should have been the difference between a suite and a standard room - after all, we only got 2 queens and had to work around an extremely inconvenient bathroom and a wonky elevator.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 12, 2006", "id": 5335616}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "Overall, I will stay again if the price is right, but I won't trust that Advance Purchase (where they have my money even if I don't show up) will get me the actual room I've purchased.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 12, 2006", "id": 5333146}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "One other thing - we're annual passholders, so we drive over and park in the garage at Disneyland.
