{"user_rating": 3.0, "review_count": 34, "name": "Totem Inn", "reviews": [{"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the Totem Inn 2 nights and they were like night and day. The first night was one of the worst nights I've spent at a hotel with the rating of 1 or less and I've stayed in a lot of hotels. This room rates below some of the rooms I've stayed in 3rd world countries with the noise. And yes, I had earplugs with me which didn't help with the base that kept banging well into the wee hours of the morning. We arrived around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and were given a room in the front nearest the restaurant-bar. I figured that since we were probably the last to arrive we understandably got the worst room. Early the next morning 5am when I requested another room I realized that there was a really nice room at the back of the hotel that was vacant which we should have been given. Instead the room we were given the first night was horrible. The beds very uncomfortable, the shower curtain reeked of mildew and had not been washed possibly ever. The loud music played until well after 2pm!!! A terrible combination as we had to get up @ 5am to be @ Denali NP for an early bus tour. When I found out that I could have had a much nicer, cleaner, more comfortable and definitely quieter room I was not happy. To add insult to injury the front desk admitted that they knew there was a noise problem with the front room but they gave it to me anyway - very poor management. Thank goodness for the night manager who helped us change rooms before we had to leave for our 6:30am bus tour. He was very understanding and helpful.", "title": "This is the review you need to read if you don't read any others", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bbeerbower", "date": "August 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 173583358}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Now for the complete opposite review. We changed rooms @ 5am on the 2nd day to a vacant room in the back. The room was cleaner, the shower curtain had recently been washed so there was no mildew smell, the beds were very comfortable and on a Sunday night there was no noise. Bottom line, had I been given this room my review would probably have been a 4 or 5 instead of a 2. I talked with the owner about this and she was not very sympathetic. Not a way to treat customers and very poor management. She did tell me that they knew there was a noise problem with the front room as they had previously had complaints and that they would change the shower curtain. A little common sense would go a long way in this situation. Why would anyone knowingly give a customer a known problem room when a really nice one was available? This is just plain stupid. Thus the poor review. Hopefully if you choose this hotel you will get one of the nicer rooms and if you stay on a Saturday night be sure to request one at the back of the hotel otherwise pass it by.

I wasn't sure about the Inn but we were comfortable in our room. OK, it wasn't the Hilton and the beds a little hard but we were tired from a long day in the park so it felt good. I always check the sheets and they were clean. Also, I inspected the bathroom before using it and was satisfy. For the price we thought we got a bargain as everything in Alaska, especially near the park is twice, what we paid here. We also ate five meals at the Totem Caf\u00e9 and thought it was good, price reasonable, especially the bacon and egg breakfast's.

My first impressions when I pulled into the parking lot was, \u201cwow nice looking place, looks better than the web site pictures\u201d. When checking in, the desk person was very nice and reminded us to turn the refrigerator on if we were to use it. They keep the power off to conserve energy and help keep them clean. Works for me. The prices were posted and agreed with the price quoted to us ($130 plus tax). The room and bath were nice and clean, furniture was a little dated but still looked nice. The beds are great\u2026..I never slept on a memory foam mattress before, now I need to get one for my home. The room has a large flat screen tv with over two dozen channels but only one news channel the rest were network, movie and sports channels. A large Mr. coffee and microwave were on top of the fridge. I used the coffee pot the first night and had to ask for another packet of coffee from the housekeepers the next morning. The young man said no problem and gave me another with a clean filter, very nice. We stayed for three days and only had one problem. The brewery a couple of blocks down the road was having live music and we had to close our window to block the music (very loud). The weather was very hot and only a fan to keep the room cool, but we knew this in advance because we checked every motel in the denali area looking for air conditioning. Nobody has air in the Denali area, nada. The restaurant and bar does have air and they are the only ones on the road, we spent some time in the bar keeping cool. Food was great and we eat there and in the bar which I think I will review on the other listing. I would love to give 5 stars, but it really needs air conditioning. I even used the fitness room to do my morning walk while the wife did our laundry before the housekeepers got there, it supplied at no extra cost. They also supplied free WiFi. Great little place for a small town motel. We did not find or have any of the problems the other reviewers had.....", "title": "Not much else in the area.", "user": "doozerkitty", "date": "August 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 170934152}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Healy"}, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 8, "very good": 7, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 7}, "slim_ranking": 0.75}
