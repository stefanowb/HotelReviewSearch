We received a very warm welcome and were offered plenty of practical advise on what to do & see. Breakfast was by far the best we had during the whole trip! Beyond Banff being an obviously great location for exploring this part of the Rockies, Treetops is very conveniently located in easy walking distance from downtown Banff without having any the noise. The common guest room is beautifully decorated and has a great balcony. If you wanted to be a bit picky, you'd have to point out that the rooms are not very well soundproofed.

Our room was below the main gathering area and come early morning as they were preparing the breakfast for the guest the noise woke us up earlier than we wanted to be.

We arrived tired and hungry after an 8 hr drive from Kelowna and were disappointed with the shabby appearance of the house. Things got worse when we were shown our room.. We had booked the Evergreen Junior Suite. It contained a bed , 2 chairs and a small table. The decoration was plain drab woodchip wallpaper and 2 non-descript paintings.
