When I checked in the first night I had to stomp out a bug within 20 seconds of walking in. It was nearly midnight so I tried not to worry about it. Tonight I had a bug run along the top blanket and I had to crush and kill it. I called the front desk and they said they would have housekeeping come up. I said that was a good start. They then said they would get another room ready for me. When I spoke with the front desk clerk, I wanted to confirm that I would not be paying for my stay. He could not confirm this so I declined the room until he could get a firm answer for me. He returned and told me housekeeping could not find any bugs in my room. I said I would return to the room and show him. Upon returning to the room, upper management denied any findings of bugs. I showed them the roach picture on my phone and they did not care. I checked out of the hotel with no discount and only a comment about a manager who may call me in the morning. I decided to check into the Hilton next door where they were very helpful. My room is just as nice and $60 less/night! Unfortunately, I have come to find the entire resort is owned by the same person. I'm not expecting a follow up call or any type of rebate. I am with a conference of well over 100 people. I have already contacted several of them to make sure they check their beds tonight, but suggested they check out. I plan to tell the meeting organizers about this horrible expereince in the morning. I spend at least 150 nights/year in hotels and after many years of extensive travel have never experienced service this poor.
