This was our first experience in a Paris hotel, but overall it wasn't negative. The room was a triple and was fairly reasonably priced since it was the winter (~$140). There were three twin-sized beds and a small amount of walking space around them. The receptionist wasn't the friendliest person I have met, but she served her purpose and didn't do anything particularly rude (she just wasn't particularly friendly either). The room was clean as far as I could tell. The carpet seemed a little \"sticky\" so it was probably dirty, but I keep my shoes on in hotel rooms for fear of dirty floors. The bathroom decor was more up-to-date than the decor in the room. We had a small shower. There were very few outlets to use for plugging in hair appliances.", "title": "Not too bad by Paris standards", "user": "lasiteral", "date": "March 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 57596711}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Overall, by French standards, this room wasn't bad.

The location was very convenient for sightseeing since the metro stop is literally a few steps away from the hotel door. We drove a car to Paris, and it cost about EUR 20 for us to keep the car overnight in a mechanic's garage that also serves as a parking garage for the hotel (where the receptionist told us to park) about 2-3 blocks away from the hotel. A bolt was missing from one of our struts when we left, which caused us to wonder if the mechanics were harvesting parts from cars??

If you have big suitcases then be prepared to struggle through them. Then the awful stench that hits you as you enter the tiny lobby with the unfriendliest receptionist ever. Then the lift. Anther awful smell in there. Then the shabby, unlit corridor leading to the room. You have to press the switch for the lights to come on. And finally the room. Oh My God! The smell of it was too overpowering. We had to open the window to air it for a long time. The room and its furniture are so dated it looks like it's from another era. We felt like we were catching something just by standing there. Admittedly the bathroom and the breakfast were not too bad, but the towels were so old they had started to fray.
