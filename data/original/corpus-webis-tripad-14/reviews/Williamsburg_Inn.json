It really is first class...services, people, accommodations, amenities, and nearby historic attractions. When we arrived at our spacious, well laid out suite, we asked the front desk to have the \u201cfireman\u201d come, bring some firewood, and light our fireplace. It quickly warmed the room and us. Even though it may not sound like a significant event, it felt so good and relaxing in such a historic setting. The Inn has so much, a spa, a championship \u201cGolden Horseshoe\u201d golf course, and wonderful traditional food. Although British royalty has stayed here, the staff makes you feel like \u201cfamily\u201d right at the beginning of your stay when Emery, the Doorman, welcomes you. The dining area is well staffed with people like Linda and Nevin who try to make your experience enjoyable with their recommendations. Our \u201cpackage\u201d included admission tickets for the adjacent historic Williamsburg area. If you have never visited Williamsburg, this is a treat for all, regardless of age. We debated \u201cRichard Henry Lee\u201d and \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d and attended a service at one of the oldest Episcopal churches in US (Burton Parish) where all the Virginia signers of the Declaration of Independence worshiped.

For the $20. price for the breakfast buffet, we felt it should have had an omelet/egg/waffle station, but the selections were adequate. Staff seemed very friendly and accommodating.
