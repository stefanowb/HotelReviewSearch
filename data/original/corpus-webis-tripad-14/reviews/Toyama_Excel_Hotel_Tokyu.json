The room was pretty small and with no air it was getting too warm and stuffy. The manager came up and informed that it wasnt faulty but meant to work that way since it is still running as centralised heating and not airconditioning. He opened the window but it was too noisy. So finally he upgraded us to the larger room. Thank God since with the larger room it was not stuffy and as warm.", "title": "Good value", "user": "WorkTraveler9929", "date": "March 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 154688157}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Suggestions", "title": "Good Hotel and reasonable rate...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "T1m-L1z", "date": "November 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 120084344}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "1.
