The rooms are properly constructed walls with a sturdy peaked canvas roof. The rooms are decorated in a 50's safari theme, which is quite appealing. You get a bath with a fantastic view and an outside shower, which isn't nearly as scary as it sounds! All rooms are very well spaced out (There are just 6 rooms in total, which means only a total of 12 guests at any one time - Makes for a very exclusive feel to the place) and connected by raised wooden walkways. The lodge does not allow you to walk to your room alone at night (In case of animals - which believe me get VERY close indeed!), but you can walk at free will during daylight hours.", "title": "Fantastic Hamilton's - Don't miss", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NYCTravelMan", "date": "November 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10889532, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Game Drives", "disliked": "\u2014 Pool"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The program of the day goes approx as follows: 0600 wake up call, 0630 game drive begins, 0830 tea and biscuits in the bush, 0930ish breakfast back at the lodge, 1400 lunch, 1600 2nd game drive, 1700 sundowners (Drinks and snacks watching the sunset in the bush), 2000ish dinner.
