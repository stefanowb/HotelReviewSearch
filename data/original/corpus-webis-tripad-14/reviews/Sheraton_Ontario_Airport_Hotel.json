The spring-loaded bathroom doors were very annoying, but make sense being it's adjacent to the main door.

Last week when I was there they moved the breakfast to a meeting room with signs that said China travel group. Why would I want to eat with a group that I was not part of? Last month when I there they changed the breakfast around to cater to a large youth group convention again ignoring the needs of the business traveler.
