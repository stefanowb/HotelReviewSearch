Choice of breakfast was good - juice, cereal, cold meats and cheese, bread and a TOASTER - unusual in Europe. We stayed for 4 nights and I 'assumed' we had the special deal - stay 4 nights and pay cash and get the 4th night free....there was a misunderstanding about this but it was resolved eventually by the manager in my favour. So confirm when booking that you have this deal - don't just 'assume' it will happen.
