The hotel was perfectly suited for that purpose. It's about 15 minutes away from the Park, and close to a Safeway supermarket, Target, and several other stores. We stayed in a junior suite which had a full size fridge and microwave and sink, but no oven or utensils. There was also a little balcony which had room for two chairs and a small table. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was fairly spacious, had lots of towels, and the showerhead had excellent water pressure. The furnishings are updated and modern.", "title": "Excellent stay and well suited as base to travel to and from McDowell Park", "user": "starhawk", "date": "October 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 183099331}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is pet friendly which is a plus, as we had two dogs with us. There is a dog path outside the hotel around the pool, with dog waste bags available outside. We didn't visit the casino, but we did try out the onsite restaurant for dinner and breakfast, which were very good. They were very accomodating about dietary restrictions and helpful in suggesting alternatives. Room service was very prompt and courteous and the food was quite good (salad and the margherita pizza). The hotel pools were clean, there were plenty of towels, and it was uncrowded and fairly quiet. The outdoor common spaces were beautiful and had plenty of seating. There's a nicely landscaped pathway through the back of the hotel which is xeriscaped and very pleasant. Plenty of free parking.

The room we stayed in didn't have a microwave and the bathroom was a little small. We stayed at another hotel right before this and it was a little cheaper and better in most aspects. The casino was cool very big, but very smokey. The pool was really nice. We had one of the less expensive rooms so that played a part of it I'm sure but for the price I felt it could have been nicer. It does have a cool sitting area with couches and stuff so that was kind of cool. It is also way out in the boonies which we liked but its something to keep in mind.
