My brother-in-law also happens to be a banker, so the fact that this hotel is in a retro-fitted former bank building fit the bill. They and I could not have been happier with the choice. First off, the location could not be better, just a block's walk from Ford's Theatre and across 9th Street from the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery and Museum of American Art in the historic Pension Building--my favorite Smithsonian museum. Other sites, like the Spy Museum, the Verizon Center sports arena and the Shakespeare Theatre's two houses, are immediately nearby, as are two metro stations--Gallery Place and Metro Center. There is also an abundance of quality Penn-Quarter restaurants in the vicinity. The hotel has retained the high-ceiling/marble column grandeur of its former status as a prestige bank building. The rooms are small but cozy, and my picky family members reported that the bed was extremely comfortable. Most of all, the staff was among the friendliest and most helpful we have encountered in any hotel. (For a hotel in this price range that appeals to tourists, friendliness is sometimes in short supply.) My guests had a top-floor room facing the back, which meant that there was not much of a view, but they avoided the noise of both 9th and F Streets, which can be very loud, especially on weekends. We had one meal at the popular Gordon Biersch restaurant on the ground floor, and we found the food to be mediocre, despite the bustling crowds.

We were greeted at the front desk with complimentary wine, cheese, stew, fresh fruit. We were offered free bottled water from their bar. The room was spacious, recently remodeled. The breakfast area was very stylish and hip, food was excellent. The swimming pool was small, but there was a swimming pool (not common in Washington) which the kids enjoyed. Excellent location, great restaurants around. We probably got lucky at $200 a night including breakfast. We found this was such a wondeful hotel, staff was really friendly.
