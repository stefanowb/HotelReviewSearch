I searched for hotels through Tripadvisor and bought it through our local agency. The hotel is situated on a quite square, next to a beautiful church Santa Maria Novella. It is close to all main sites - the Dome, Palazzo Vechio, or the area around San Lorenzo church. I had a small but well equipped, quite room with a pleasant bathroom and a good bed. There was no view, but I didnt mind. The double rooms were much bigger and had a view. The hotel is about 100 metres from the train station, it is in walking distance to bus that takes you to the airport. The staff spoke english and also other languages, they were really helpful - booked museum for me (Uffizzi,Accademia and chapels necessary), restaurants and weather. The breakfast includes sweet pastries, cheeses and hams, youghurts and freshly made capuccino etc.It is possible to sit outside on a terrace. The hotel is situated in the second floor of a house, there are security cameras and they lock the entrance for night, there is a lift. The hall is nicely decorated with beautiful ceiling. I would recommend my friends to stay in this hotel if they decide to go to Florence.", "title": "Great small hotel in Florence!", "user": "EvaPrague", "date": "April 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7479286}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Florence is a beautiful town, even more from inside than outside. There are so many art collections to see and the churches (Bargello,Pitti Palace, Palazzo Strozzi...), it is really necessary to plan 5 days for this. If you want to visit villas and/or Fiesole, you need to plan longer. The shopping is also pleasant, more affordable than in Milano. The airport is very small, with very few shops. Unfortunately it is impossible to get into Vassari corridor unless you are a group and plan away ahead. The food is lovely.
