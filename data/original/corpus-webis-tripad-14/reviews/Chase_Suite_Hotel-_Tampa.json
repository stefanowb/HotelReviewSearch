It was simply the best way to start our vacations. Ask for the transportation to the pier, it's cheaper than the cruise line and very reliable. The suites are huge, on two floors, perfect for two couples or a familiy. They offer the breakfast(continental). Becky, our minivan driver was just the nicest bus driver ever! The restaurant just besides the hotel(Bahama Breezes) is excellent but very crowdy, reservation are preferrable.

The rate was very reasonable and all of the members in our party were very impressed. The shuttle service picked us up from the airport and took us to the Chase Suites, as well as provided us a 10:00 am ride to the cruise port. Our 1 bedroom was a complete mini-apartment suite with kitchen and den. We walked to the beautiful Bahama Breeze restaurant for dinner, which really gave all of us a pre-caribbean experience. A market was also adjacent to the hotel, where we picked up soft drinks, snacks and water for the next morning. Breakfast was available in the lobby, which included cereal, bagels, pastries, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, etc. When we arrived back in Tampa, shuttle service also took us back to the airport. All of this service was included in our hotel price. We have stayed in many hotels before cruising, and the Chase Suites was certainly our favorite, especially with the shuttle service included for all.

Downtown Tampa, Ybor City, Busch Gardens, USF, U of Tampa, football and baseball stadiums, etc. etc. ridiculously easy to get to from this location. We walked to Bahama Breeze for dinner. Every employee we met, EVERY employee, was kind, courteous, and helpful. My deadbolt jammed... it was fixed immediately! My pizza deliverer went astray...one of the employees found him and pointed him in the right direction. This hospitality sets a tone; the guests we met were equally friendly and engaging. People actually converse at breakfast, at happy hour, at the pool. My cousin and I had a GREAT time during our stay. It's not the Ritz, by any means.
