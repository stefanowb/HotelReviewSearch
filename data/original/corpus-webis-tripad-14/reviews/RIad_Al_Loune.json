We stayed from 31st October - 8th November 2012 for our belated Honeymoon. We didn't want to leave. A warm welcome, beautiful arcitecture and stunning decoration, the cleanest rooms and all amenties you could want: fresh, fluffly towels, cotton buds, shampoo/ conditioner, hairdryer. Complimentary water and fruits in room. Beautiful breakfast, all 'homemade' at the Riad. Spa treatments available at extra cost if required. Most importantly the staff: Khadija, the Manageress, Youssef, Latifa & Zeineb. All lovely people, who work incredibly hard. Could not have been more welcoming. They cannot do enough to help you and will assist in anyway they can to ensure your trip to Marrakech is everything you hoped for and more.

This was the most luxurious Riad that we stayed at with well equipped comfortable rooms that have a lot of character in a quiet location. The staff were very attentive and helpful, offering a warm welcome and aiding us with all our requests. The Riad is beautiful and very well maintained with lovely detailing in the architecture. You couldn't help but notice the small details that make a difference. Generous breakfasts, lovely bath oils and fresh fruit in the bedroom.

It is truly delightful, a real haven from the madness of the soukh. Gorgious bedrooms with wonderfully comfortable beds covered in the highest quality of - we think - Egyptian cotton. Decor is delightful and at times inspired. Mohamed, his wife and the staff could not be nicer or more helpful and we can certainly see where the previous reviewers are all coming from. Breakfast is a real treat, especially if the weather is not too inclement and it can be taken on the rooftop terrace. The public spaces are also wonderful.
