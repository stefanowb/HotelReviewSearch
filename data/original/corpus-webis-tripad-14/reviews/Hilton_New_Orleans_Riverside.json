The hotel is situated at the end of Poydras Street. A trolley stop is out front. The hotel is close to the French Quarter. The problem is once you get to the lobby, you need to keep walking. Rooms are located pretty far from the lobby and, depending where it is, you need to transit multiple escalators, elevators and/or skybridges. Downsides to the hotel were that the Executive Lounge was closed to rennovations and it got very noisy on the weekend nights when people started partying in their rooms. The breakfast buffet was great - a vast selection and the hotel staff excellent. All in all, we'd probably stay at the Doubletree next time as it is closer to the French Quarter/Canal St and you dont need to hike a mile to your room.", "title": "HIlton Riverside Hotel - nice, but what a hike to your room", "user": "capturedplanet", "date": "October 12, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 83152829}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "This Hotel is beautiful hotel, but thats it.

This hotel is a fantastic idea for several reasons: (1) the views of the river are wonderful, (2) it's quiet, (3) it's a 10 minute walk to the French Quarter, (4) it is attached to the River Market, which is very convenient when the weather is rough, and (5) the rooms are excellent. The fact that it's attached to the River Market is great for a lot of reasons. The River Market is indoors, which provides good entertainment when the weather is bad, and the food court is excellent - including Mike Anderson's seafood (i.e. this is not the food court you have at your suburban malls at home). So, we can enjoy a good meal in doors, without a long line, and with great views of the river when it's convenient. Otherwise, we're out in the French Quarter all day and night. The walk is about 10 minutes, and there is a lovely riverside park to use to get there that makes for a very pleasant walk. Or, if it's windy, we use Canal St. and are shielded by the buildings. We like that at the end of a long day or night, the Riverside Hilton is a quiet peaceful retreat away from the French Quarter crowds and noise. Also, it's always host to one of the teams/fans for the Sugar Bowl, which is a good indication. If a 10 minute walk is too long for you, the cab rides are cheap. The kids love to sit by the windows in the room to watch the huge ships/barges navigate the river (and the adults do too).
