The furniture in the rooms is worn out and the layouts just don't make a whole lot of sense. The hallways are beyond hot and there is only 1 bank of elevators in the hotel. The hotel is set up like a square with the middle cut out.

I can't say they weren't nice...just odd. For example: One morning we walked down to breakfast and told the host \"2 please\". He responded with \"You want a table?\". We responded with \"Uh, yes, for 2 please.\". He says nothing further to us and waives for us to follow him. He walks us to a table and points to it. The waitress says something to him and he waives his hand at us as if saying no and points to another table. We ask him \"You want us to sit here?\". He points again to the table and walks off. OKEY DOKEY...very strange. Our odd encounters at this place are just too numerous to mention in this review. However, the waitress at breakfast...I believe her name was Mary Lee or Mary Lou???...heard our complaints and did her best to make up for the strange customer service we had been receiving.
