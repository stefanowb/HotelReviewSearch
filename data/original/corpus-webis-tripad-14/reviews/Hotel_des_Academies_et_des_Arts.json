I feel compelled to give new visitors to Paris a bit of a warning about the Underground as it generally receives unrestrained praise. Yes it works fine if you are knowledgeble about all the recent alterations. However, if you are not, be prepared for frustrations. For example, we wanted to take a riverboat cruise on the Seine and were told to take the number 6 (I think I am remembering the number correctly) in the direction of Charles de Gaulle Airport and were given directions to the Underground station. However, when we arrived, there were no signs indicating a that the #6 had a direction of Charles de Gaulle. All that was available was direction Nation and direction Etoile. Turns out the Etoile is Charles de Gaulle, but it took some research to find out. Similarly, we took a side trip which required we get a train at Gare de Lyon. We took a taxi there, but decided to take the Underground back as the map of the underground indicated that good old number 6 stopped at Gare de Lyon. We found the entrance to the Underground and need to head in direction Etoile (we had wised up at this point). But it seems that the platform for direction Etoile was closed for some reason, perhaps for repairs. Again, a frustrating difficulty for someone unfamiliar with the peccadilloes of the Underground. Other problems we found we that the maps of the Underground are not current, though station signs are. On a couple of occasion the maps showed the direction ending at a location but, evidently, the line had been extended so we could never find the direction shown on the map. Why they don't post easily readable lists of stations like the ones which are actually in every car is beyond me. In short, being familiar with the terrific maps of the Washington DC Metro, I sure wish the Paris Metropolitan would do the same.", "title": "Good Hotel", "user": "macca19", "date": "July 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 17782326}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "But, again, the hotel is great.
