We had an oceanfront room, which had a beautiful view of the pool area, the ocean, and Diamond Head. The nightly entertainment was very nice and relaxing. It was also very nice while eating dinner. If you enjoy swimming, it is a bother that the main pool closes when the entertainment begins. However, the ocean is great for swimming, and very fun if traveling with children. Side Note: the beach area to the left of the hotel (in front of the Royal Hawaiian) is the best area for relaxing and swimming. The room rate was VERY reasonable, trust me because I spent months researching hotels and their rates!! We also were very pleasantly greeted with lias upon our arrival to the hotel, which was a plus because we did not receive them at the airport!

However the beach services are in need of help. The Mai Tai cruise is a beatiful catamaran ocean trip, however the staff who sign you up made us feel as though we were in a 3rd world country, it felt like they were hustling as though they needed the money, and you HAD to buy photos from the photographer who was not the friendliest . The surfing with Hans Hedelamann was really fun. I had Evan who made sure we all were up and really surfing , but my friends went out with another guy Sergient and he seemed preoccupied, and a bit rude. Sushi at the Sheraton was great , but the the sushi at Yunagi is a must ! Also we drove to the north shore ,and that is definetly worth the whole trip. Over all the Sheraton I say thumbs up but the beach needs to be redone! The people who work the pool and beach could be a bit more relaxed and friendlier! We sometimes felt we were staying at their \"house\" instead of a warm and friendly aloha! So dont go here if you want white sandy beaches, its a bit more rough, touristy, and the people who live here seem a bit rude, like your lucky to be there! Most were from CA which we found interesting. The Hawaiins seem very proud of their island, but the bar tenders and and again beach crew need more aloha spirit! Sadly the beach is a bit dirty, cig butts, in front of Halekulani , Sheraton and Royal Hawaiin. That was a bummer, and there was lots of plastic cups, etc in the water. So if they could clean up the beach and the people who hustle all these surf lesson, boat rides, etc and it would truly be paradise.

I had read a wide range of reviews of this hotel in trip advisor and had some tripidations regarding dirty, old rooms with no view. Well, were we surprised upon arrival. We received a renovated oceanfront room with a view from the 20th floor. It was fabulous waking up each morning with the sun rising over Diamond Head and looking out into the Blue Hawaiian waters where the ocean meets the sky. The room on the lanai is generous enough to eat breakfast there each morning. You can stock up the refrigerator in the room by visiting one of the ubiquitous ABC stores for your supply of fruit, yogurt, drinks ... including beer, wine, and liquor. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. One early morning we had an emergency when one of us who is allergic to bees was stung. I called the front desk who immediately put us in contact with their \"sister\" hotel the Sheraton Princess where there is a \"Doctor on Call\". They came and picked us up, took us to the hotel to see the doctor, then drove us to a pharmacy to get a prescription filled, and returned us back to the Sheraton Waikiki. All was completed in a little over an hour. Don't be afraid to ask for anything. You can even get a late checkout the day of your departure if you have a late flight. We were able to extend until 9 PM for $100. We had a midnight flight so having our room until 9 PM allowed us to head to the beach and enjoy one last day of Waikiki knowing we had our room to shower and rest. One last note, be sure to do the snorkeling excursion on the Maita'i catamaran. We got to swim with a sea turtle while snorkeling ... it was awesome!
