There are blue and green wings, green is a bit more expensive but its got a nice view. The hotel is adjacent to the railway station and there are some restaurants within the complex.

Did not book in advance, but hey, its the offseason in Tallinn now, so it\u00b4s easy to get a room. GO hotel seems to be new and the prices are excellent, specially considering the location in the center. We got a room with the view towards the old town and the park, really great!
