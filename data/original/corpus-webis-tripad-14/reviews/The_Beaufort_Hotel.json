The charming hotel is in Knightsbridge on a quiet street but close to tube, bus, Harrod's and museums. A perfect location for the solo traveller---secure but not remote. What sets the Beaufort apart is the gracious staff who respond to every request---directions, recommendations, booking tours...whatever assistance is needed is immediately taken care of. I found them to be helpful by phone and email before I arrived and equally responsive while I was there.

Past visits have included stays at well rated hotels including the Draycott and Egerton, and our research on the Beaufort made us comfortable enough to book directly. Out total stay was to be eight nights, so we were concerned that the hotel and the service had to be to a standard which would make us comfortable without being overly fussy.

There were once three or four hotels on this cul-de-sac, but due to conversions to high end flats, there is only one remaining, and that is the Beaufort. All cabbies know where it is, so the location is proven and ideal. Another plus was the staff - they really worked hard to please us, but were not officious or affected in any way. Most of them \u2013 like almost all London hotels - are from Eastern Europe, and they are always trying to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. On more than one occasion, they obliged with a smile when asked if we could still have the complimentary afternoon tea with hot scones at 7:30 P.M. \u2013 together with complimentary champagne brought up to our room. While there is no restaurant, the hotel serves daily breakfasts in your room if you like, or in a small breakfast area in a nicely appointed below grade room that doubles as a meeting room and business centre. The lady who makes and delivers the breakfast has been doing so for over 12 years, so she has it down pretty pat \u2013 it is a nice offering with adequate variety at a reasonable price.", "title": "Excellent quiet location only yards from Harrods", "user": "x8mca", "date": "July 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 70260823}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I ended up booking this hotel online at the very last minute as the hotel I'd been booked at mysteriously failed to have my booking, were full and this was the only alternative that was walking distance from my office.", "title": "Really delightful", "user": "MatthewGreen", "date": "October 29, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 85242934}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Turns out that fate was on my side as it was completely charming.

We were offered tea & croissants in the lounge downstairs, where we relaxed for an hour or two until our room was ready (early, which, again, much appreciated). Our room was absolutely lovely - high ceilings, beautiful 12-foot windows which opened out on to a gorgeous little terrace. When we asked if staff could find us some chairs so we could sit on the balcony, they quickly did. The room was large (by European standards), brightly decorated and clean. Bathroom had a lovely deep tub, perfect for relaxing after a day of sightseeing. Breakfast is served in the rooms, and was varied and always on time, if not early. Staff was friendly, efficient and always went the extra mile, whether it was for ice or information. The 24-hour complimentary juice, water, soda, tea & coffee were also much appreciated. Loved the neighbourhood, near many pubs, shops, and restaurants, and within easy walking distance from both Knightsbrige & South Kensington tube stations.
