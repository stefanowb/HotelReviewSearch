I was extremely impressed with almost everything about the hotel, especially at the price we were paying. We managed to book the room around two months before for around \u00a350(75 euros) per night. The room was slightly smaller than I expected from the photos I had seen but it was by no means small. It was very clean upon our arrival and was cleaned every day we were there whilst we were out. Having read the reviews on trip asvisor I was worried about the noise and the staff, but the staff were very kind and would help with anything if you asked but I would say that if you make an effort to at least try and speak spanish then they tend to remember you and say hola when they see you, however they speak fluent english so it really isn't a problem. The noise was not a problem at all even though we had a room at the front with a balcony, I would say it was quite nice to wake up to the noise of the locals. The only bad thing about the hotel was the roadworks going on in front of it. It is based on a quiet street but the roadworks make it look ugly until you get inside. As for the city itself, it is beautiful. The pick-pocketting problem didn't affect us thankfully, but I would say as long as you're careful then it isn't a problem, so just take out what you need and leave the rest in the safe in your hotel room. The food tends to be rather expensive in most places on la ramblas and I found a few places where the drink prices were ridiculous but there are a few gems, however don't be fooled into going to the italian which offers a set menu for 6.50 euros, it was quite frankly the worst dining experience of my life. There best places we found to eat and drink where between the hotel and la carme st. Make sure you visit the cathedral nearby, and go to la sagrada familia which is just a quick metro journey away. I would say however that once you've been to barcelona and visited the sights it's not somewhere that I'd desparately want to go back to, but that's only because I've got a lot of other places I want to visit first!
