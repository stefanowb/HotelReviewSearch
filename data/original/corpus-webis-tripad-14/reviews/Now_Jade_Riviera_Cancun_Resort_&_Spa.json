The only problem we had there was no atmosphere like there was at the Barcelo, there were few decorations or Christmas music playing unlike the Barcelo had. There was no interactive entertainment, unlike the barcelo, which had mini golf etc in fact a few of the entertainers were cancelled like the casino night which I heard from others was disappointing. We also asked 6 staff members where the pool that had activities like bingo as we had my 83 year old mother with us and no one could tell us. Not really impressed. The other thing that seemed odd was at the Barcelo we saw numerous wild lizards, birds and other animals and not a single thing at the Now Jade. would have loved mom to see something.", "title": "The best vacation ever!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "richter211", "date": "January 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 93893741}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had upgraded to the preffered club when we booked, the private pool with no children running around was nice, the view from our room and the pool was amazing, to see cruise ships go by was great, the preffered lounge was the best Carlos was very attentive, and the free internet was nice, only in the preffered club and the food and drinks were fantastic.

I was blown away with the views right as I entered the lobby. My boyfriend and I opted for the Preferred Club so check in/out was so quick and simple. We used our jacuzzi only once but it was so nice to have that option. I loved having our own quiet pool just steps away from our suite. I did think it was a little nuts that I had to wake up so early to reserve a seat by the pool. The Preferred club was a great addition to our club with it's fully stocked bar and snacks. We were able to use the computers without any wait and the staff was there for you at beckon call. We tried every restaurant. The buffet was good, Spice and Cin Cin were at the bottom of my list. Capers and Tamarindo were my favorite and the French place was good too. We used the French place for breakfast (another perk of Preferred club). The room was clean and spacious, our view was amazing and the service was incredible. my only real complaint was that the beds were too firm for me but the rest of the room was great. Shower was large, living space was big as well. Every part of this resort was amazing and welcoming.
