The check in was smooth and quick, the lobby was pretty crowded, think they had a wedding going on. Our room was upgraded to a suite, which was clean, great bathrooms! The Hotel seems to have been renovated recently. We stayed there one night only since we were attending a wedding ourselves nearby. When we got back early the next morning, the valet was right there...pretty amazing. Check out next morning was smooth and actually very friendly.

The hotel is very impressive at first. The common areas are very refined, attractive, and impressive. I was excited. Then, I got to my room, and the excitement died out. The room was very small for this level of hotel, however it may have been an abnormally small room for this hotel since I bid on Priceline. The room appeared very \"three star\" to me. It was very spartan, bare, and did not match the style of the rest of the hotel. The bathroom was small, a bit scuffed up, and seemed utilitarian. If you like rather soft mattresses, you'll love the beds here. It was my favorite hotel mattress so far. The air conditioner is a loud old style window unit, which is unacceptable at this hotel class. Service did not meet my expectation for this star level. Sadly, it turns out I had food poisoning (not from the hotel). I was awakened in the middle of the night by getting ill, and needed my bed changed. Somebody brought me sheets, but wouldn't change them. He wasn't a housekeeper. I was giving him a twenty dollar bill since it was gross, and he declined it and just gave me the sheets. I was confused. The room couldn't be cleaned/mopped until the next day...despite...the unpleasantness. While this is normal at mid-level hotels, I would a expect a 3.5-4 star hotel to have 24 hour housekeeping. The location in downtown Morristown is great, and parking in the garage is free and easy. For my priceline bid, or if the room were paid for by an employer, I'd be content to return again. However, I've seen the rates at this hotel go into the 200-300 range. While it's a beautiful looking place in a great location, I just don't think the rooms and the service are in line with that cost in the suburbs.", "title": "A hotel with some style in a great location, but questionable service.", "user": "csj81", "date": "September 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118745971}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Having stayed at the Hyatt Morristown for an intensive 5 day meeting, this stay was restful and what one would expect for a Hyatt.
