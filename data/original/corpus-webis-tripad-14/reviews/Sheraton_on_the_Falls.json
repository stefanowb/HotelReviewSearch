I have been to the Falls before, but, my husband and 9 month old have never been there and we thought this would be a nice long weekend trip. We traveled with my brother-in-law and sister-in-law and my 5 year old nephew and 4 year old niece. When we arrived, we were placed on the 2nd floor. I was quite disappointed as I was told by the reservationist we would be able to see both falls and we were only able to see the American Falls. The stay went from bad to worse. My husband and brother-in-law were sitting on the couch in the one room and the feet on the couch suddenly collapsed and broke. A hotel employee came to fix it pretty quickly and we were compensated $50 for our trouble, but, for the money we were paying for the room, I certainly didn't expect the furniture to fall apart when someone sat on it. Apparently, there is an arcade below the 2nd floor of the hotel and it stays open until 1am. Needless to say, none of us got any sleep that night because of the loud music and noise from the arcade. The pictures on the walls of our room were actually rattling from the noise. Finally, at 12:30am I had enough and went to the front desk to complain. I inquired as to why the hotel would place 2 families with 3 children under the age of 6 right on top of the arcade. There was no explanation given, only a promise to move us the next day to a higher level. I was also given vouchers for breakfast. The next day we were moved to the 16th floor. The rooms were much nicer and we had a view of both falls. However, the room move wasn't without problems. Before we left to do some sight seeing in the morning, I inquired about when the rooms would be ready as my 9 month old would need to take a nap. At 10am that morning, I was told that both rooms were vacant and housekeeping was told to expedite cleaning to get us moved. However, when I returned at 1pm, I was told by another person at the front desk that the rooms were still occupied. When I repeated to her what I was told in the morning regarding the rooms, suddenly, 1 of the rooms was available. Coincidentally, when the rooms were being checked on, I saw a list of \"room moves\" for the day and there were no less than 5 other rooms from the 2nd floor that were being moved also. Wonder why???? Could it be the noise from the arcade??? So, we finally got our new room and we were told the luggage would be moved right away. Two hours later, I called the front desk and inquired about our luggage. The girl had no idea what I was talking about. It wasn't until I told her that I wanted my luggage brought to my new room that she said someone would be up in 15 minutes with the luggage. After that conversation, I was totally convinced that the employees of the hotel have absolutely no independent thought or initiative in assisting guests of the hotel. That evening was our only restful night at the hotel. The next evening, we were awakened at 3am with the noise of a fire alarm. How pleasant!! The lines for the elevator were always long. We had breakfast in the hotel two mornings. It was overpriced and not worth the money.

Could have been the direction of the wind. The pools are very small and my kids ages 13 and 15 passed. There was a thermostat in the room but it didn't matter what I set it on the room was cool, but not as cool as I prefer. There was wierd vents and things on the ceiling that seemed old. The bathroom was VERY small and the hairdryer was broken. The bed was GREAT!!!! The elevators are VERY VERY SLow and there was a line in the afternoon 20 people deep. You would not want to be in that building if thier was a fire, because I didn't even see any signs for stairs. I was told we had a balcony but actually it was a big sliding door with bars about chest high. The food was very expensive, so we walked far away from the hotel ended up at the OUTBACK-thier prices we what I would expect. The Perkins near our hotel was over $50 for breakfast and my two kids shared french toast and me and my husband had a normal breakfast (eggs/pancakes). We ended up eating a meal at the Casino next door they had a food court with fast food chains that offer a limited amount of menu choices--example Kentucky Fried Chicken had Chicken,Fries and Chicken Sandwich--that's it. We went on the Maid of the Mist Boat Ride. That was good, but the behind the falls walk was not worth it. When you're on the boat ride look over to the right of the falls and you'll see stairs and people standing getting soaked on a viewing platform. That's it! and that is all that you really see. Not worth it. There are tunnels that lead to nothing and then the platform. There are 2 Sheratons I think if I go back I would look into the other one, but I would probably stay at the Embassy Suites on the falls--it looks new and they must have a great view of the Canadian falls because they are located even with them. The Sheraton is even with the American Falls, but I was told that if we paid $50 more we'd be able to see the Canadian falls by going one floor up. We had trees from a park blocking the view. All in all we had an okay time and I really did enjoy watching and hearing the American Falls from our room. The TV didn't have hardly any channels and they charge alot for internet access, so thier was nothing else to do since I don't gamble at the casino.

It smelt as though the linen had been washed in fish water. It was so bad that I could not even finish my meal, which by the way was not worth what I paid for. My husband had the buffet, which at $32.95 should have included some decent food. The \"penne\" which resemble a mushy lasagna was horrible and if that is considered to be award winnng then my grandmother rest her soul would have rolled over in her italian grave. The next day we went for breakfast and the smell was somewhat gone, but again, the buffet was way overpriced and so was everything else on the menu. Charging $8.95 for a child's buffet was highway robbery especially if you have a family with a few children. I don't know about other families, but I certainly know that my two young children don't eat much and to charge them that is a crime. And don't expect to get much sympathy if you ask the waiter/waitress to allow you to share or split a meal from the regular menu, which I did the next morning with my one son, who by the way is autistic and doesn't eat much. The waitress may never come by your table again to refill your coffee cup. The food voucher is a greedy means of getting you into their restaurant only to take advantage of you once there. Also, if you do have children, don't expect to get a table by the window to view the falls, even when there are empty tables available. They just won't sit you there. They will make up some story about a group coming or some other lame excuse. Oh no, they will sit you as far away from the window and as far away from the main buffet as possible. I guess those noisy children don't deserve to sit by the lovely window to view the falls. Afterall, they are only children. I just want others to be very careful when booking these overly priced hotels that offer these meal deals. Be very careful and don't expect to get much for your money.

I read a lot of hotel reviews trying to choose the right hotel. We could not have been happier with our choice. The location of this hotel is excellent - walking distance to both falls yet in the middle of the tourist district close to all the attractions and restaurants. Our room was on the 17th floor - awesome view of the falls. The hotel is in great shape, rooms are clean and modern. The bed was super comfortable with lots of pillows. We had a tub and a stand-up shower. There was even a small tv in the bathroom! What impressed us the most was the hotel's stuff - excellent and quick service, very friendly and professional. Our second day there we decided to order breakfast to be delivered to our room when we realized that we were out of the order forms as we have already used it the night before. Not a big deal, we called the front desk and asked for another one. Not only were they there a minute later, they were so apologetic about it, they offered as a choice of $15 off our breakfast or a 2 pm checkout the next morning. Great overall experience. Will definitely recommend it, well worth the money spent!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "irinamosk", "date": "February 8, 2005", "id": 3169363}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2005", "text": "What a VIEW.....

I wish they had new blankets and towels as they were pretty nasty, and we are not that picky but it really needed to be cleaned. The hotels have Starbuck's in the lobby- Rainforest cafe'. Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, an incredible arcade (even has bumper cars) and an indoor waterpark not to be believed. Adults would love the waterpark too for its upper deck which allows you to see your kids while you relax. It is kept at summer temps. and has a bar!!
