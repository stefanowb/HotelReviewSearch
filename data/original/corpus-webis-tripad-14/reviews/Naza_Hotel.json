It was nice after a day exploring the heritage sites to be able to relax by the pool or stroll along the beach.

The price is reasonable compared to other overpriced hotels in Penang. Most of the hotels in Penang are in the town and jam-packed areas, this hotel is a refreshing one as it is not in the middle of town, just at the outskirt of the town. Thus you don't really have to listen to all the chaos, just peace and quiet. The location is good as it is still near to beaches and tourist spots. It is also near to malls and hawker stalls. If you love beaches, this is the place to stay as it is so near to the beach, and it has a large swimming pool as well. The breakfast buffet is moderate with different choices of food. However, I was expecting that the hotel would serve popular local food like char kuey teow, laksa penang and so forth. The room is clean and comfy. The front desk people were friendly. During the durian season, this hotel sells durian outside of the hotel to cater to local tourists' urge to have durians as they are not allowed in the hotel.
