The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I feel the cleaning was lax and mildew on the shower walls is not good for a 3 year old hotel. The breakfast and staff were great. However the toasters suck, and the one in Moncton put in a moving rack type much better. The AC in the room was very noisy and when I tried to get it fixed, I was told that just keep it above 72 and it would be quite.... that was not on at that point. I was offered another room on a floor with a wedding going on, nope, plus it was noisy too. I have stayed in dozens of Hampton Inns and this was lower on my list than most. The one in Moncton NB was fantastic, the attention to details made it shine. A door opening holder, breakfast mints, a letter welcoming us to the Moncton Hampton Inn. The Saint John Inn needs some work with overall cleaning and landscaping etc. But the staff #1.", "title": "Not the best Hampton Inn", "user": "Cam_Guy", "date": "October 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 81987234}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I stay at this property on a regular basis and although I usually only review hotels that I stay at on vacation, I felt I should give this place a shoutout. This hotel is very nice with modern rooms and very nice beds and linens. The breakfast is very good with a few hot items. Free internet (which is always consistently good) and free parking. Hilton Honors members get treated like gold, especially if you actually are \"gold\" or \"diamond\" level members. I am diamond and always get an upgrade if available without ever having to ask. The Junior King Suites are really worth the extra $$. Pam at the front desk is the best ever! She will go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need. I hope the management realizes what a gem they have with her. I have dealt with her at two different properties over the last decade and she is consistently awesome! You won't be dissappointed with this property. It is located very close to the best shopping and several restaurants. The property does not have PPV movies or a bar. This is unacceptable really nowadays in this calibre of hotel and the ownership really should get with the program and realize that they need to provide their clientele with what they want. I have addressed this with the staff already to no avail. They are leaving a lot of dollars on the table. Stay and enjoy.
