Breda Breen and her husband run this B & B and she runs a tight ship. It sits right on the river next to the bridge and it's in a gorgeous setting. I would highly recommend it. Very clean and she makes and serves the breakfast; traditional Irish farmhouse. You can tell she works very hard. Most people stay on the Ring of Kerry but the interior is very beautiful, too.

If one does, there are rewards of wonderful upland scenery -- mountains, including Ireland's highest, moorland, and vast sweeps of countryside that delight the eye. Perhaps twelve or thirteen miles from Killorglin, a town on the \"Ring\" route, off Caragh Lake, in the valley of the Caragh River at Blackstones Bridge is located the Blackstones House B&B. Without repeating the compliments of the previous reviewer, who caught the spirit and charm of the place just right, we would like to say that our stay there was one of the great highlights of an otherwise delightful 2-week visit to Western and Southwestern Ireland. The accommodations were spacious and comfortable, the breakfast copious and excellent, and the scenic surroundings superlative. We were given a warm welcome by Breda and her husband, and Scruffy the dog, and felt totally at home, rather than at some commercial establishment. There is a certain adventure in traveling to the place along some true Irish country roads but with the help of the top-notch Irish Ordnance Survey map we were able to navigate there without instructions. However, when contacting the place by e-mail or phone (as we did) it would be a good idea to ask for directions. We recommend Blackstones House enthusiastically!", "title": "A True Gem off the Beaten Path in County Kerry", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "melvinsen", "date": "June 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7925613, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The superb location off the beaten track, the high quality of the accommodations and the charming proprietors", "disliked": "\u2014 Bathroom was rather small."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "The famous \"Ring of Kerry\" on the Iveragh Peninsula gets vast hordes of visitors every year, especially in the summer.
