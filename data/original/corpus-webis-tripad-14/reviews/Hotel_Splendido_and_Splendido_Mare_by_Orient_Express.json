It is, indeed, a beautiful place. However, we had terrible service and little consideration on their part for mistakes. After our first courses, the waiter brought my husband another plate of the same dish he'd just eaten as his second course. After a minute, someone else took it away and a brusque \"sorry, confusion\" from the main waiter, we waited a good 20 or more minutes for the correct fish dish to be served. Meanwhile, I went ahead and ate my dish - there was no offer that would allow me to do otherwise. So, my husband sat without food while I ate. When he was finally served, the waitstaff let my plate sit empty on the table while my husband ate (trying to make it look less obvious?) Later, we finally had to ask for the check, for which we then waited another 10-15 minutes. For 3 glasses of wine, a bottle of water, a salad, 2 pasta dishes and a fish dish, the bill was 177 Euros ($220). Amazingly, included in this is a \"Coperto\" charge of 15 Euros - which is ostensibly the \"cover\" or, what is often called a \"Bread\" charge (usually 1 or 2 euros in other cafes and trattorias). The quality of the food was good, however no better than most restaurants we frequent. The service for a restaurant of this reputation was horrendous. If you think paying this much for the view is worth what they charge, you may enjoy Splendido.", "title": "Disappointing.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "neworleanstraveler55", "date": "May 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 131031783}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "One of the best hotel experiences I have had in all my travels.

Looking onto the the entrance to the port of Portofino with a spectacular rock outcrop with the historic Castel Brown perched regally on top. Charming room with THE best bathroom amenity tray I have seen in a hotel. (Even better than the Burj Al Arab) And of course even with this beautiful hotel and the fantastic view, it could all be ruined by bad service, BUT Everyone we encountered was so polite. They are not robots, but genuine fun truly engaging and elegant, all with unique and interesting character. The FANTASTIC concierge team who were all warm and very competent providing excellent information as well as well as the feeling that we would be well taken care of with not a worry. The dining and bar staff, so very efficient on top of being charming and elegant. A memorable moment was spending an evening in the piano lounge area with one of the most enjoyable entertainers I have had the pleasure to see. We sat with many other couples not talking but enthralled with his songs and very fun and creative patter. He was a character right out of a classic movie.

Our room category was \"double deluxe sea view with balcony.\" I think our room was actually larger than some in the same category by being on the 1st floor, as that floor extended out more and afforded us an extra indoor sitting area. Meals and service were great. The heated swimming pool is very nice, and means you can swim even when it is not particularly hot outside. Antonio serves great drinks, and also sings in the evening in the piano bar. Vladi is the pianist in the evening. We could have done without the guests singing in karaoke style, but many seemed to enjoy that aspect. Just not as much for us.

From the moment I set foot in the hotel, the warm embrace that greeted me was overwhelming and in true Italian style I was welcomed as one of the family. Thank you Johanna. With the fairy godmother at play, I was upgraded to a sea facing room which was beyond anything I could have dreamed up. The luxurious room, equipped with all the comforts fit for royalty, included a welcoming bottle of champagne to be relished with deliciously plump and juicy strawberries, and the bathroom, which is deserving of its own merits, due to its opulence, was equipped with Bulgari shower/bath accessories. Just when I thought that the experience could be alikened to what I imagined only heaven could hold, I was introduced to the view from the balcony. The gentle, soft pink and blue hues that reflected off the water in the Portofino Bay below were made that much more inviting by the beautiful yachts that had the privilege of resting in such a treasured place. Nothing can prepare you for the beauty that is Portofino and nothing can measure up to such a place as the beautiful Splendido Mare. I preferred the Splendido Mare to Splendido on the hill as it was part of the life of the village. Meeting the inhabitants, in particular Mariangela, who is Queen of the Focaccia, and sharing their passion and love for Portofino made me feel more welcome there. The concierge, receptionists and waiters of Splendido Mare were a wealth of information and their passion for the history of the hotel and the village coupled with their extensive knowledge made them a pleasure to speak to and made the experience so much more personal. The Splendido Mare took great care in knowing your likes and dislikes and made it their quest to ensure that your every like was met and your every dislike was never in your vicinity. The extreme joy with which the staff at Splendido Mare do their work is intoxicating and contagious and drew me back to the hotel every night for dinner or after dinner drinks. The evenings there are made that much richer with the masterful skills of the heartwarming Professor Maurizio Moro on the piano and the rich velvet voice of Luca, Maitre D'Hotel, whose skills at preparing fish are also to be admired. The chef at Splendido Mare would leave Michelin rated chefs green with envy and Santo, restaurant manager, ensures that the standards are continually met along with getting to know his patrons tastes. I feel it would not be fair to not mention Angelo, Nino, Mario who also waited on my every need and made every meal at Splendido Mare a cherished event. There are truly no words to describe Splendido Mare. It is truly worth every cent you spend and every person should have that experience at least once in their lives. Thank you so much for making the trip so unforgettable.
