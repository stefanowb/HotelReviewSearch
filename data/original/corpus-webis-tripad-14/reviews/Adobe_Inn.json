We had a king room and even though it faced the street, it was far enough from the main \"drag\" Ocean Avenue to remain fairly quiet. The room was very spacious and comfortable. It had a fireplace (probably not wood-burning), terry robes, a small refrigerator, Comcast Cable and free wireless in the room. Wonderful high-quality bed linens.

My family of four arrived at the inn last week around 12:00am. We had talked to the office about arriving this late and they had left the key with instructions for us under the door mat of the room. However, when we opened the door we discovered that instead of two queen beds, the room had only one king size bed. Something probably went wrong when I made the reservation online; the problem was that we could not all sleep in one bed and there were no extra blankets for one of us to sleep on the floor. Moreover, everything was closed and we were extremely tired after traveling for 4.5 hours from Santa Barbara. I had read the reviews about Sergio being very responsive so I decided to give him a call. Sure enough he responded right away. Although he lives 30 minutes away from the inn and it was 12:15am, Sergio came and opened for us a suite with two rooms and three queen beds. We were not charged for the bigger room even though we offered to pay the difference. This is customer service at the highest level and we greatly appreciate it. Thanks Sergio!
