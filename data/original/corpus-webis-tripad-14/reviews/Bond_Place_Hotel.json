The room was adequate, clean, and quiet as it was on a corner of the building. The hotel is very close to the Eaton Shopping Centre and subway, and the Airport Express shuttle stops right outside. There are many places to eat within a short walking distance and we ate breakfast in the restaurant one morning... omelet was greasy but the service was pleasant. It wasn't flashy but when you try to keep the expenses down some sacrifices need to be made!
