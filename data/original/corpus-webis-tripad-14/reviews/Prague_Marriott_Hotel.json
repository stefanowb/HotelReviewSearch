However, when we arrived we had to wait for several hours to get first a smoking room (we are no smokers) and then a room full of noise because they were maintaining something at the floor above. Every time the answer to my complains was \"sorry no other rooms available\". Finally, around noon I managed to track down a room myself and indicated it to the reception staff !!.

Porters at the hotel are like vultures looking for tips and generally harrass you rather than assist. We avoided them as much as we could, however the porter that showed us to our room refused to leave the room and coughed and carried on trying to get a tip out of us. Any chance he had of getting a tip disappeared with the routine he performed. Reception staff seemed disinterested and were generally abrupt and at times seemed disinterested. Our reservation made on the Marriott website 8 months before our arrival had not been put on the hotel's reservation system and we were initially told we did not have a reservation. Only after some seaching on the central reservations system did they find our reservation. Breakfast was good and the breakfast staff were polite, friendly and attentive as were the staff looking after the Concierge/Tour Desk in the middle of the foyer. Overall, the hotel was in a good location and was well equipped, however the porters tend to treat you more as a source of cash than a guest and you get the impression that the large number of tourists in Prague has eroded service standards a bit as the hotel is always busy and they aren't really concerned about people visiting again.", "title": "Good location, service needs work", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Tygaman", "date": "July 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8079876, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Aggressive porters and disinterested reception staff"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Nice, quiet, and centrally located", "text": "I just returned from a 3 day stay (June 25-27) at this property and highly recommend it.

It is in a fantastic location, 100 meters from where the Cedaz bus stops coming from the airport (Price: 90 CK but make sure you get in the right bus - go to the Cedaz desk first, as they also have buses for 470 CK...). The room was great (on the executive floor), relatively large for Europe, with king-sized bed and double comforters: below and on top of you. Lots of storage space for clothing, neutrogena bath products, iron and board, nightly turn-back service, excellent room service and wonderful fitness club. I took advantage of the fitness, jacuzzi and pool daily, found hotel personnel very friendly and helpful. If you book your Prague tours through the concierge, they just add it onto your bill. I highly recommend Thai Massages if you are going to Prague and want to relax after an exhausting day of either work or sightseeing. 5-10 minutes by foot from the hotel is Thai world; very good and reasonably priced which I found via the net before arriving. Check out Praguepost for insiders\u2019 information on Prague. Just downstairs from the hotel is a supermarket (Billa) so you don\u2019t need to buy costly meals if you prefer not to. If you feel like pampering yourself with some beauty treatments, in the shopping center next door is Monet where you can have facials, manicures, pedicures, etc. but they do not speak a lot of English. As for transport to the Airport, I opted for AAA Taxi, ordered in advance for about 400 CK as opposed to 650 CK standing out in front of the hotel . All in all, I had a great time in Prague, loved this Marriott, and will go back very soon! Oh, might I add that I don't truly consider this a full five-star hotel but who cares for the price I paid with Priceline!
