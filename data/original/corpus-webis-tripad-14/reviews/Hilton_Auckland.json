We stayed in two connecting rooms on the seventh floor looking back to the city. As other reviewers have noted, this is a sleek and modern hotel, well situated right at the wharf dock. It's definitely expensive but that's because it's the Auckland Hilton! First, the positives and then the negatives: we loved our rooms. (We got a king connecting to two twin beds.) They were well equipped, plush and very comfortable. The bathroom and shower were spacious and well designed. There's an interesting outdoor pool outside the small gym. One end of the pool is transparent and you can see the front check in area four floors below. Very cool! My wife got a massage on our deck and she said it was wonderful. The decks have an eye-popping view back towards the city, but as others have observed, if there's a cruise ship docked at the wharf, it not only obscures the view, it obliterates it. We were lucky there were no cruise ships docked there when we stayed at the Hilton, but I did take a picture at the beginning of our trip for the ferry to Devenport that clearly shows how even a relatively small ship can get in your way there. That being said, the Hilton is right on the water, right on the wharf and there are literally dozens of restaurants and a few shops close by. I was able to drop off our rental car at the front check in area and the concierge facilitated the rental car agency sending someone over to drive it away so I wouldn't have to do any more navigating on Auckland streets. Prior to our trip, the concierge desk was also able to arrange personalized transportation for our family from the Hilton back to the airport when it was time to leave. So, from that standpoint, our stay there went well. But there were two glaring exceptions: I had made these reservations almost eleven months in advance. (I had reserved CONNECTING rooms as described above.) But, on the day we were to check in, I called the Hilton's front desk to reconfirm the reservations for that night. One of our two reservations had been lost and the front desk staff seemed clueless as to how to fix my problem. (If I hadn't called, we would not have the room configuration I had confirmed 11 months earlier!) Finally, a front desk clerk was able to block out the room next to the room that still had an existing reservation. I found that really surprising. Neither room was ready at the 3pm time that other guests were allowed to check in, so we had to twiddle our thumbs. The other incident occured after checkout: when I got home to the U.S. I checked my Visa statements online to verify all of the charges we had incurred in New Zealand. I was shocked to see that, in addition to the room charges that had correctly been billed to my credit card, there was a \"mystery charge\" at the Hilton for almost $600 NZ. It took ten emails to Hilton's front desk to sort out that the problem stemmed from the front desk clerk swiping my card twice at check in! If I hadn't looked at my account online, I wouldn't have noticed the erroneous charge until actually getting the Visa bill in the mail. My pleasant stay at the Hilton was definitely tempered by bad memories of check in gone awry (lost confirmed reservations) and surprise to see additional charges erroneously added to my bill AFTER check out.", "title": "Unmatched location and views!", "user": "chezay", "date": "January 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12705461, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Waterfront, good value for money, spacious and conveniently located", "disliked": "\u2014 Definately housekeeping.
