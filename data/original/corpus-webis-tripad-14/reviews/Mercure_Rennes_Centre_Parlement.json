The property is located right in the center of town, great location on a quiet side street. You are able to walk to many resturants and shops. Near the Galleries Layfayette. The rooms were small, as most european rooms are, but very clean. The bathroom had a full tub and shower. The amenities were fine. The bed was not the most comfortable for me, but my husband slept fine. There was free wireless internet access during most hours. The daily breakfast, 10 euro consisted of various breads, cheese, fruit, meat (cold), boiled eggs, cereal. It was fine. There is primarily business clientale. There is a bar, but it is pretty quiet. The staff was very professional, not overly friendly, but efficient, and a quick check in and out. There is parking in the hotel garage, no fee for guest, but it fills up fast. We were able to park our car, leave it and walk through town. I was able to book the room for 88 euro per night, which was a great value for the room. I would definitely stay at the property again.", "title": "Nice, Quiet Hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "traveljo", "date": "February 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4412445}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "In a fine town for touring but without a surplus of charming tourist hotels, this business hotel offers a perfectly good option for tourists and its weekend specials are unbeatable.
