I finally had to put a bath towel in the space, God forbid I need to get out during an emergency. The TV quality was just okay, fuzzy and blurry cable I suppose, but the sets looked old. Probably the worst surprise at this la quinta (and I've stayed at quite a few) was the cleanliness of the bathroom. The tub was pretty din-gey, is that how you say it? How about just plain old dirty like a shower stall at an athletic club. Yes- I took pictures and I'll post 'em if anybody REALLY wants to see them.
