It was really cool. We didn't try to go to the pool, but apparently the pool is for the nightclub Drai's which is next door and they have pool parties every Sunday. So, I did hear that even if you are a W guest, you have to wait in line like everyone else to get to the pool. We didn't even want to try and thought that was kind of odd that a hotel guest would have to wait in line to use the hotel's pool. Our room was so pretty and modern, which comfortable beds/linens. The bathroom in our room had a see through wall out into the room, so it wouldn't be ideal if you traveled with friends. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends!
