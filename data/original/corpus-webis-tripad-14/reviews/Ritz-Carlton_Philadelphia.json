They sent us in a cab to the Courtyard by Marriott which was right around the corner, The cab driver was very irritated to only drive us a few blocks. He basically threw our luggage out of the trunk. Had we known we would have walked and gotten there a lot faster and with less stress! The Ritz did pay for our night at the Courtyard Marriott, but my husband was getting reimbursed as it was a work trip, so that didn't do much for us. Housekeeping was also not especially friendly, even though we left them a tip each day. I went to the spa and had a great massage with Jim. But there is no hot tub or anything of the kind which seems a bit odd for a spa not to have. They said it was because its a historical building and they can't have standing bodies of water. Huh?
