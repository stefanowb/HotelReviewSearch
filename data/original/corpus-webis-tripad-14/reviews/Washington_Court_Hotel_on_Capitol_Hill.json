The room was ok, the bed was comfortable, the pillows were normal hotel pillows (mushy), the sitting area was nice as an alternative to watching tv on the bed. I agree with the previous review that the bath mat on the bathroom floor was dangerous, I nearly slipped on it every night I was there! I did not have trouble with the tv remote or with noise from other rooms, so I guess I was lucky. The restaurant was pretty good, though I was less than impressed with the room service options (no chocolate ice cream, only rocky road!). We had catered meals for our meeting from the hotel and the food was ok for that too. The conference facilities were standard, though the ac was either cranked to 62 or off. My one complaint was with the concierge of the hotel. I had done research on what museums had evening hours during my stay so I could see some DC sights. When I asked for directions, the concierge told me the museum wasn't opened and when another lady at the desk offered to look online, she insisted it wasn't open. Needless to say, I walked over there using a map, and found the museum opened! I brought her a copy of the brouchure when I returned and she just huffed at me! Also, Capitol Hill doesn't have the greatest selection of restaurants nearby, though Senators in the Holiday Inn next door was good. Also, there are lots of places to eat in Union Station, though it was very loud! Finally, there is no plug in internet in the room, you need a wireless card.

They have some big problems. It was clean, and has a large lobby area, but those are the highlights. We got there early, and were told we could get in before the 4 pm. check-in. They kept our luggage, and told us to return at 2 pm. We returned at 2 and ended up sitting in the lobby for hours, and in fact, finally got our rooms after 4 pm. The \"sitting area\" that is shown on their website in a double room is very deceptive. There is no separate area, and we had one chair next to the bed, and an average writing desk in the corner. The \"Italian marble\" bathroom they claim amounts to the marble floor. Be careful, it's slippery when they put down a little rug with no backing, one in our party slipped and fell on it. We had two rooms on the fourteenth floor, and one (1406) was definitely nicer than the other (1411). Luck of the draw on if you get a nice room. In your room there is a nice little stand-up card that announces their Happy Hour....with Happy Hour Specials, and free appetizers, down in their lounge. When we got to the lounge and saw no indication of it, the bartender told us \"Oh, that was a long time ago...we don't have that any more.\" I believe they shouldn't advertise what they don't have. Also, pillows and beds were terrible. Very hard time trying to sleep between the poor beds and the doors slamming all night. The beds had feathers poking us during the night, sharp ends that poked right through the sheets. Pillows were also feathers and very poor for head support. Remote to the tv barely worked, the buttons stuck and wouldn't move the channels. We called on it, and a \"repairman\" came and said all the remotes were like that, because they were new. New remotes don't stick, old ones might. Front desk staff not very friendly or helpful. Good points were that our rooms were cleaned decently, and the proximity to Union Station is convenient.
