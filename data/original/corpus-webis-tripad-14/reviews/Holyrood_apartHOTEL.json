We then walked for around 15 mins to get to the hotel. Walking into room 406. there was a corridor with 4 rooms off it. A main bedroom with en-suite shower-room and toilet, a second double bedroom, a separate bathroom with bath and shower and a main living room/dining and kitchen area. The kitchen has a dishwasher, washing machine, fridge etc and is fully kitted out with all you need. The place was absolutely spotless. The service was fine, no complaints. There is free internet in the foyer with a printer to print off those plane-tickets for home. I only have 1 small complaint, the windows don't have proper seals, so you can hear outside noise, albeit you are in a quiet area and the floorboards creak, so you can hear people moving upstairs, but this did not spoil our stay.

The distance from the station is walkable in 10 mins or so, but the combination of luggage, a lunch booking and finding the hotel for the first time swayed us in favour of the taxi.

Shower was an electric mira sport, a decent make, and I would describe the water pressure as ok, though nothing to get excited about.

Our 2-bedroom apartment was absolutely spotless and larger than I thought it would be. It was a great place to unwind after sightseeing all day. For the space and amenities here, you can't beat the price compared to most other hotels in Edinburgh. I must say the employees are extremely patient and very helpful. Service with a smile always. We did not have a car and just walked everywhere. The Pizza Express next door was really good. We also ate at Worlds End, Deacon Brody's, Filling Station(all very good), The Balmoral (disappointing food and service IMO). Ordered out Chinese one night which I would not recommend, the Chinese food in Edinburgh is hard to come by and not very good. Took the train to St. Andrews for a day trip, saw Edinburgh Castle, St. Giles Cathedral, Greyfriars cemetary, went to the outdoor farmers market for lunch (only on Saturdays) nearby Edinburgh Castle, wandered around Grassmarket, and went to a Hibernians soccer/football game (very fun!)
