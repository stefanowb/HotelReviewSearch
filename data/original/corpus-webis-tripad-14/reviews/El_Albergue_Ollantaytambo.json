We had a wonderful time, the service was fantastic, our room was comfortable and clean, and the location was terrific! Unfortunately there was an agriculture strike while we were there. The staff helped us rearrange our travel plans to make sure we could get to Cusco before the strike. We stayed a couple of days longer in Cusco than planned so we could catch our flight to Quito on time. I can't say enough great things about the El Albergue manager who stayed late calling and rearranging our hotels in Aguas Calientes and Cusco, and rushed our laundry order since we had to leave earlier than planned. She continued to work on rearranging our trip even after she went home for the evening. Now that is excellent service! We also met one of the owners, he road the van with us to Cusco so he could get there before the strike too, since he had to catch a flight to Lima (very nice guy!).

Bring ear plugs for sure. The staff there is SO nice! Luke is wonderful and I can't remember the woman's name, but she is very accomodating too! They will also hold your luggage when you go to Machu Picchu b/c you can only take a small bag on the train. When I passed through the station again on my way back to Cusco they were standing there with my bag waiting for me exactly when the train pulled up, how nice since I only had a couple minutes to grab it and get back on the train. The food in the restaurant is good too. But the little sauna they advertise is like a closet sweatbox, I wouldn't recommend it.
