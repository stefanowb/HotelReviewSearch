There were a couple people in line ahead of us, and we waited only about 5 minutes. We were given our room, a map, and we were on our way. We got to our room and someones stuff was still in there. They obviously had not checked out. We went back downstairs and told them. They were surprised, of course, to find out that that room was still occupied. They didnt have any other rooms available with 2 beds. Would we take a 1 bed room? I said I would rather not, because I didnt think my teenager would want to sleep in the bed with me. So they offered a free roll away, which wasnt really acceptable either, but if thats all they had, then ok. She then offered to give us free dinner and free breakfast at the hotel restaurant.

The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful, and eager to provide directions to local restaurants and attractions. Disneyland was only a few minutes away, and mostly non-highway driving.
