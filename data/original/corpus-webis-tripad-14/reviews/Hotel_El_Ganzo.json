An earlier review mentioned being \"stuck\" at the hotel and that there isn't anything around....?? They must not have found the amazing Drunken Sailor just down the street. $2 tacos that will know your socks off. So good! Also, there's The Container a short stroll down the bike path, or a 5 minute cab ride. Best dinner!

All the staff goes out of their way to make sure you're taken care of, but not in an intrusive manner. Each were truly interested in chatting with us....not like at the Hilton where we ended our stay. The difference with the El Ganzo compared to a Hilton is the authentic Mexico charm. If you want tons of screaming kids coupled with a sterile \"this hotel could be in Arizona\" vibe then don't book the Ganzo. If you're looking to completely decompress and unwind, this is the place for you. The rooftop pool was so nice! We also loved the private beach. Best chicken quesadilla's are available at the private beach restaurant. We walked down to the small market (owned by Jesus, nicest guy!) and grabbed a $5 six pack for the beach each day....perfect way to spend a few hours. :)", "title": "El Ganzo Cabo", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jesseaf", "date": "July 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 169470784}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Also loved the artist vibe around the El Ganzo.
