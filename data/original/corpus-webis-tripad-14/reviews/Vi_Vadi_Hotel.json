Simple but spotlessly clean, well positioned hotel that represents great value for money. Hesitate to give it too good a review in case it gets booked up the next time I go there, but frankly the owners deserve it. Service was efficient and courteous, the room - while not large - was more than adequate for a few nights stay. And for even longer has a kitchenette and microwave if you want to pass up the delights of Bavarian cooking. Free wi-fi in the room (unlike some 5-star chains). Nice breakfast in the adjoining Italian restaurant. 5 mins walk equally from the main railway station and the Augustiner Bierkeller. The latter is a true bonus - forget the Hofbrauhaus tourist trap, this is where the locals go to sup Munich's finest beer.", "title": "A real find", "user": "Bluftut", "date": "July 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 33743172}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "best location in munich - just 2 minits walk from train station", "title": "Outstanding !!", "user": "AradRunner", "date": "June 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33074614}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled with family", "text": "recently renovated rooms with high standard , well equipped kitchennate", "title": "Covenient Hotel near main station: clean and safe", "user": "Richard_SW11", "date": "February 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 25087700}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Free Internet ,", "title": "Great Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "FietsRacer", "date": "December 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 22340945, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the location"}}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 17, "average": 58, "very good": 165, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 105}, "slim_ranking": 0.28125, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "For more than 20 years our VI VADI HOTEL has been a favoured place to refuge for guests who appreciate a particularly and obliging service.All rooms have been refurbished in 2009 and convince with it's warm coloured functional design, comfortable beds, top-quality-linen, 32\"LCD-TV, free Wifi, and convenient kitchenettes.The Hotel's Restaurant VI VADI serves authentic italien dishes and offers a large choice of corresponding wines.We are looking forward to welcoming you soon!"}
