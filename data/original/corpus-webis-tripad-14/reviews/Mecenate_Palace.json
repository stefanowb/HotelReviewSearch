The weather was wonderful, which made opening the windows a great choice. The rooms were nice. The breakfast buffet was typical and comparable to every European hotel I have stayed in (coming from Las Vegas, NV we are biased). The views on the rooftop were breathtaking. Best of all, we arrived at 8am in the morning and were automatically given a room....that started the whole trip off just right. The rooms are very quiet, if you keep the windows closed of course because the hotel is wedged between two streets and one round-about. If you are looking for a supermarket, there is one across the street in the basement of the department store. They have a great selection of everything and it is very crowded. On the corner from the hotel, there is this great cafe that is open from 5am to 2am every day and they have out of this world desserts. A few streets over there are some great restaurants. We would recommend this hotel to all if you want something close to everything but just far enough that you have to walk to the train station to catch the Metro or walk just to enjoy the great city of Rome.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 24, 2006", "id": 5205399}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006", "text": "Nice hotel from what we saw of our one night - but had to move for the following 3 nights because the hotel had cancelled our booking.

We contacted the hotel and in order to receive the upgrade we had to rebook directly with the hotel and cancel the reservation through the Golden Tulip system, but it was well worth doing and the hotel staff e-mailed to confirm the upgrade. For our 4-night stay we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the piazza and cathedral. The room was on the small side but beautifully furnished and maintained, with a separate dressing area and a very large marble bath with two sinks. Staff were efficient and helpful. The area was convenient to Termini but far enough away so that it wasn't seedy. The metro station is a couple of blocks down Via Carlo Alberto.

On arrival at the hotel, the receptionist was not very welcoming and was quite surly. We stayed in a superior room on the 5th floor overlooking the road, we did not find this noisy unless we had the window open. The room was nice, though a little chintzy, and small, which appears to be a common theme in city hotels. The breakfast was ok if you like continental, or you can have bacon/eggs etc, but these are quite expensive and probably not worth the money. The bathroom was quite small and the bath/shower leaked, so we had wet carpet near the front door. The hotel didnt provide an iron/board so I felt as if I was walking round very scruffily dressed as I had failed to iron my clothes before I left as I usually do it while I'm at the hotel. However, outside the hotel there were quite a few people alot scruffier than me!. The hotel is very convieniently situated, it is 10 mins away from the main train statiion which takes you to/ from the airport and 5 mins away from a metro station from which you can get to most places in Rome very cheaply. It is also within walking distance to some of the attractions if you like walking. The surrounding area is not the nicest of areas, it is rather scruffy with rubbish scattered and bins not emptied but it is a relatively safe place to walk at night, I didnt feel threatened or intimated at all. I was very disappointed with the restaurants/bars locally, the food was mediocre and often not very hot, we found ourselves travelling round to try to find decent food, but failed. Beware of the cafe on the corner of the hotel - Cafe Santa Maria - they charge 80c for a coffee if you sit inside and 4 euros if you sit outside. My husband had a coffee there one evening, I didnt want one, the coffee arrived with 1 euro coin change which was placed on the table. My husband complained that his coffee was cold so the waiter took away the coffee and the 1 euro coin and came back with a hotter cup of coffee - minus the 1 euro, my husband didnt want to make a fuss so didnt complain. I had an ice cream from there - not the nicest ones around!. If you go to the Vatican Museum - ignore what the guide books say - dont go early. The best time to go is after lunch, about 1.30pm, the queue will usually be about 30 minutes rather than 2 hours if you go in the morning. The best advice I could give a prospective traveller to Rome, chose your hotel location carefully, take very comfortable shoes and dont go if you are on a tight budget. I'm so glad we went, we had a great time, but would stay in a different area if we went back.", "title": "Convieniently situated for all attractions", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Karen48", "date": "June 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5338802}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lovely Place", "text": "My husband and I ended our Italian honeymoon with a four night stay at the Mecenate Palace. We made reservations on-line, and we reconfirmed those reservations before leaving as recommended by others on Tripadvisor. When we arrived, the manager was snobbish, but perhaps this is the norm? Despite the frosty reception, we were led to a spacious room on the fifth floor with a fantastic view of Santa Maria Maggiore. The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom was very modern and elegant. We especially enjoyed the bathrobes and the radio system which was accessible in the bathroom and bedroom. The other employees were all very helpful, and breakfast was better than average. Our biggest gripe: the outdoor terrace. While the terrace bar was supposedly open until midnight, each night we went upstairs to find it dark and deserted. Accordingly, on our last night there, we went upstairs armed with a bottle of prosecco, but as fate would have it, the terrace bar was open and they would not allow us to enjoy the prosecco on the terrace. Understandable, but frustrating, nonetheless. All in all, it was a wonderful place to stay at a very affordable price. Finally, I join the previous reviewers warning regarding the cafe on the corner -- my husband and I were not savvy enough to ask for an itemized bill and believe that they overcharged us for a late night dinner.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 9, 2006", "id": 5327909}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "We stayed at the Mecenate Palace over the May Bank Holiday.", "title": "Great Location and Stunning Views!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dusk", "date": "June 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5323972}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "The location (which I was worried about) was excellent you really can walk every where with no hassles.
