The Courtyard across the street's high speed internet is free. My room was clean and the furnishings were nice. The foam pillows are a little thin. However, the shower floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month. Send someone into my room with a scrubbrush, please - that dirty shower detracts from an otherwise good hotel room.
