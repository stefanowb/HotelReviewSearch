It was marginally clean. The room itself was okay but the bed covering had some kind of big stain that looked suspiciously like blood to me. The room was very dark and dingy; I had trouble seeing well enough to read. But the worst thing was how creepy the place felt. I was there with my dog and when I took her outside late in the evening, there were guys sitting on chairs outside of some of the rooms guzzling beers and smoking cigarettes. They just stared at me and when I nodded at them to acknowledge their presence, they just glowered and looked me up and down. The lock on the door didn't feel very secure and I was not able to sleep a wink the night I was there. I was supposed to stay for a week but I checked out after one night. It's cheap but still not worth it.", "title": "Never want to stay there again", "user": "crosswycke", "date": "July 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 166841800}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Longmont"}, "review_count": 1}
