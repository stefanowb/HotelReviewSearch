I really cannot say enough about the wonderful hospitality here. Dan, John and all the team are so friendly, pleasant and thoroughly professional. We had a beautiful room in the main house, all blues and creams, full to character, dinner that evening was first class and we then enjoyed drinks afterwards in the main reception area which had a cosy, welcoming fire and big comfortable sofas. We had a stroll around the gardens, where they grow all their own veggies, herbs and fruit and just never wanted to leave.

Once a convent, it has been converted into a beautiful inn, that also features amazing dinners and great breakfasts featuring fresh flavors picked from the kitchen gardens out behind the house. I hesitate to describe this place as a B&B, in case that conjures up images of someone renting out the spare bedroom down the hall. Not only is this a beautiful country estate home filled with interesting art and surrounded by spectacular grounds, gardens and paths, it also features great personal service in a relaxed (not stuffy) but very attentive style. As for the food, well there is good reason that folks come from miles around to dine here. The 4 course dinner was excellent, and featured a surprising number of choices to pick from. It was delicious, and served with that same great service that has you feeling at home despite the gracious surroundings.", "title": "Treat yourself to this place, your worth it!", "user": "CalgaryCdnCouple", "date": "August 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136678341}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic!", "text": "An absolutely superb place to go for a treat.
