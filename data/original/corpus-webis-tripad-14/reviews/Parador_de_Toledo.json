We were told that there were and the total additional cost was 130\u20ac, which we were happy to pay. On entering the (lovely) room and opening the doors to the balcony - wow, magnificent! We both agreed that the extra cost was worth every penny (sorry, cent).

There is a suspicion they live on their fantastic buildings and locations. Whatever else you might say about the Toledo Parador its location is incomparable and the building fits it appropriately. The hotel sits high above the loop in the Tagus which circles around the old city of Toledo. From the hotel you have a theatrical panorama which takes in the whole city with its key buildings, the Alcazar and Cathedral dominating. So perfect is the view that the hotel has a steady stream of casual visitors who sit with a drink on the terrace and a camera in hand with the view in front of them.
