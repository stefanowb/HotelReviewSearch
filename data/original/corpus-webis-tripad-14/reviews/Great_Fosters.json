Not difficult as couldn't fault it in any way. In fact I get a warm fuzzy feeling whenever I think of Great Fosters as my memories of it are so happy, always with family, always a wonderful experience. Came in June with my son who is at Royal Holloway, had the most beautiful meal sitting outside overlooking the water and all the blossoms were out. Then came again in July to the Taste of Summer day with my eldest son as a 21st birthday treat for him. First time I had been to one of their events and it was magical, despite the unpredictability of the weather and my son loved it too. The sun came out eventually and we got to swim in the pool which I had always yearned to do, and tickle the piglets!! The whole day was so special for both of us, all the staff were so wonderful. The third visit was last week for lunch when my sister was over from France and again, the food and service were superb. As to the comments I made in my previous review about the portion sizes, that appears to have been addressed, portion sizes have been fine on every visit since. I am so looking forward to the Christmas event which was recommended to me by people I met at the Taste of Summer day, I can't imagine a place that would be more festive and I am bringing my friends along this time. Well done to all the staff at Great Fosters, who really do justice to this truly remarkable place .

The room had a very comfortable queen size bed, where as our single friend's room, the \"Hansom\", had a full size bed in an unexpectedly cramped area - she would have gladly paid the difference for a double.

Set amongst 50 acres of gardens and parkland, the hotel is a Grade One listed building blessed with the grandeur of 16th century England and luxurious modern facilities. Its past is evident in the mullioned windows, tall chimneys, fireplaces and brick finials, while the Saxon moat, crossed by a Japanese bridge, surrounds three sides of the formal garden. All the suites and bedrooms are individually decorated. The bedrooms in the Main House are adorned with tapestries and antiques, whilst the bedrooms in The Cloisters are more contemporary in style. The Coach House, refurbished in 2008, offers luxurious accommodation with the latest plasma screens, i-pod docking stations and fabulous bathrooms. The hotel offers a choice of two restaurants, The Estate Grill and The Tudor Room at Great Fosters. The Estate Grill is less formal and serves a simple and seasonal menu with many of the dishes cooked on a Josper grill. The Tudor Room at Great Fosters is an intimate, more sophisticated dining experience with just 24 covers set in a lavishly decorated dining room."}
