The rooms we spacious and clean. Though my room had two single beds pushed together. However, this maybe a Dutch hotel thing as I've experienced this regularly in Holland. There are over 30 TV channels available in a number of languages. There are 3 restaurants to choose from, with differing styles of food and hence differing standards as well. The standard ranges from good to average. The staff are very friendly and helpful, though the service can be a bit slow. There is also access to a sports centre, which has a number of squash and tennis courts and regular fitness classes. The hotel can give you a special price for some of these. The hotel is located 5-10 minutes walk away from Emmen town centre and Zoo. I would say that in any other country this hotel would be regarded as average, but for Holland it is probably above average, mainly due to the politeness and friendliness of the staff.", "title": "Friendly service", "user": "Murph35", "date": "October 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6005155, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Slow service in restaurant"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled on business", "text": "We arrived late,on a hot summer night; the room was very stuffy and the first thing I did, was looking for the aircondition switch; well, it was not there: no aircondition in the room; so, next best thing: open a window: for some cool evening air:not a good idea, I soon realised, as the band was still enthousiastically playing downstairs, even though it was way past 11.00pm; well I may as well have a cool drink instead!

The hotel is strategically situated as the zoo is less than 1 km distance just like the shopping area and the tropical swimming pool. Did I mention that there is more than enough parking space that is also free of charge? Normally I mind childred in a hotel \"disturbing\" my restly moments during breakfast or dinner, but this hotel is child friendly that there are playgrounds inside the restaurants for the children or there are animators who take time for the children so that the adults can enjoy their meals.
