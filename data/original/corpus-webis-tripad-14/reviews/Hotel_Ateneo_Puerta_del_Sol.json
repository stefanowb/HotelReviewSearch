We stayed for two nights in late February and the hotel was excellent. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The rooms whilst not the biggest were fine and very clean. But what wins it for this hotel is the location, it a about a 2 minute walk to Puerta Del Sol square and metro. If you are prepared to walk for around 5 mins the bars are numerous and there is something for everyone, there are tapas and irish bars dotted up all the streets leading of the square. All in all if you are on a bit of a budget I recommend this hotel highly.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 27, 2006", "id": 4523984}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good value hotel in a \"hot\" street", "text": "We have stayed several times in the Ateneo .
