The public areas of the hotel are held in a very nice Bavarian style, with the check-in staff being very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant staff for dinner could have been friendlier, but the food was rather tasty at a good price. The breakfast buffet, which is included with the overnight stay, offers something for every tast and is of high quality. There is free wireless in the public area of the hotel. The furnishing of the rooms does not follow the Bavarian style and is a bit outdated. However, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel has a very nice indoor pool. Overall, this property is one I would recommend and it offers very good value for the price in a lovely region of Germany.", "title": "Enjoyable Bavarian Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "redwrangler8", "date": "June 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 17188044, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Home feel of Bavaria and friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Rooms are a bit outdated in style and do not fit Bavarian image"}}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 11, "average": 7, "very good": 16, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 4}, "slim_ranking": 0.8}
