The room was cleaned every day with clean towels and sheets and some days flowers on the bed. Speaking to other hotel guests the quality of the rooms do vary! The hotel is set in beautiful grounds with a little stream running though to the sea. The restaurant overlooked the beach which was a great way to start the day. Breakfast was a Turkish Buffet serving breads cheeses and olives along with eggs, omlettes and pancakes freshly made to order. Service throughout was excellent. All staff were welcoming and friendly. Nihat and his team looked after us expertly. The pool and beach can get busy but generally we always found enough sun loungers.

We had full use of the hotel facilities but with the benefit of an additional smaller pool. The room was good, (I loved the two balconies). The cooking facilites were perhaps a little basic but there are such lovely cafes and restaurants nearby that we wouldn't have used them anyway.

There is sauna and fitness available at no charge and massages can be booked for a fee. The hot tub was not functional during our stay, but that might change over time. Overall, the indoor wet areas were not in the best of shape and proper lighting for the pool was an issue, as the indoor pool was only illuminated by a standing lamp next to the pool, which seemed like a bit of a safety concern. The hotel has free wi-fi in the lobby area, and if you get a room close to the main building you might get access from there as well. There is small computer room with two machines where you can access the internet. The hotel has a little clothing store and mini-club (in season only). The beach has grey/yellow sand and is not very big. There are sun chairs available, but I can imagine it gets fairly crowded there during high season as the beach front is not very big. Due to the fact that the beach is located at the end of the bay, the water is very calm and shallow. This is ideal for kids. Some water sports, like surfing, tread boat rental and kanu are available for charge right at the beachfront of the hotel. The hotel also has a small playground in the beach vicinity. The nearby harbor offers boat cruises up the river delta and along the coast and small islands of the bay (not a hotel offering). Within a short walking distance you also find restaurants, little stores and Goekova park. It should be noted that there are a good number of free running cats and dogs in and around the hotel.
