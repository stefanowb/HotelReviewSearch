The reason it sounds so loud is that the window vents don't close properly and there is no insulation to dampen the noise coming in, so yes the helicopters, cars and train come through like they are in your room. The location is a bit off the strip, but plenty of shuttles and the walk does you good after big meals. There is a very good mall across the street with lots of good stores, a food court for snacks, and is a great cut though to the strip as well. Staff are very good, courteous, helpful and fun.

I just enjoyed 4 glorious days there and am having a hard time coming up with much to warn you about (haha). Check in/out was seamless & the staff was very accommodating and knowledgeable. The lobby is open, bright and very nice including the lobby lounge. I'm sure I had just a standard room, but the size, detail and cleanliness were amazing. Just the woodwork - an entire wall of casework - was beautiful. Although I didn't use it much, the kitchen features (small cook top, nice sized fridge, sink, a few kitchen items (corkscrew!!) were a nice addition. The bathroom was large, lovely and very well lit by Vegas standards! Housekeeping did a GREAT job getting to our room early & having everything stocked. The BEST part (for me anyway) was the proximity of the pool!!! No 20 minute hike to the pool (like many LV hotels) here! Get out on 2 and Voila...there's the pool! Nothing fancy - no \"lazy river\" or tricky shape - but large enough & great for lap swimming early! Service at the pool was a bit slow and unpredictable, and the drink prices were typical Las Vegas (high), but the FOOD at the pool cafe/deckside was REALLY good and the prices were so reasonable (that is NOT a sign to raise them, Mr. Trump!!). No kidding, the salads were beautiful and huge and fresh, the snacks were great, the sandwiches looked delish.....and all of it was priced like anywhere else for the same thing....even here in Indy! There is a Happy Hour in the lobby (I think every evening) with nice drink and appetizer specials....and the lounge is very comfy & nice (live jazz the evening we were there). Did not eat breakfast in the restaurant, but did stop in for dessert late one night. The decor is lovely, but cannot vouch for the food/service/price. As others have mentioned, there is a free shuttle to Wynn & Forum Shops @ Caesars which is really nice! We never waited for more than a couple of minutes....but for those who don't want to wait, cabs are plentiful!

I do wish, however, that the television in the bathroom had a guide, since the channels aren't the same as the television in the room. The bed was extremely comfortable and the kitchen was an excellent touch, though I must admit we did not use the appliances. All in all, the Trump is an amazing hotel, especially for those who want a quiet place to return to after those long Vegas nights. It is a bit of walking from the central strip (Bellagio, Caesars, etc) but it's a short cab ride and it was worth staying there as opposed to the Venetian which wanted $1400 for our trip dates.", "title": "Hotel was fabulous, just the right size!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "msshortee", "date": "January 5, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 52647305}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Stayed at this hotel in Dember 2009 and I would not stay at this hotel again for the following reasons:", "title": "Trump - You're Fired!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "CoronaBoy", "date": "January 5, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 52646650}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "1.

The hair dryer sits in a bag on a shelf under the vanity. I even liked the makeup mirror. I felt that the flat screen TV could have been bigger, in the main room. The sitting area was so so comfortable. I was also expecting a more comfortable bed. Ours had a hump in it. It was a King though. The worst problem was that there was a train that would blow its whistle every few hours and a very tacky museum was beneath our window. You could also hear the highway. This hotel has limited eating facilities and is designed for your own cooking with a glass cooktop with two burners or a microwave. Room service is also available 24 hours. The restaurant is very good for breakfast but as expected expensive. You will not find the cheap buffet here. It is very easy to walk across the street to Fashion Show Mall for snacks and shopping and to reach the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, or walk toward the east to experience the Encore and Wynn. We took taxi rides quite a bit and it averaged about $12 with tip. I seriously enjoyed getting away from the rat race of the strip and would stay here again.

However I am so glad we got it and I would stay here again without hesitation. We stayed here 3 nights. The first impression set the mood. The lobby is very elegant, classy and smells great and there is no casino so no smoke, no loud noises, no random people. Everyone was always more than eager to help. The doorman always opened the door with a \"Good morning\" or \"Welcome Back\". The valet was always prompt and courteous as well. We never waited more than 5 minutes for our car and our luggage was brought to our room immediatley. The woman who assisted in check in was very nice and helpful and of course offered the upgrade. We considered this even before we arrived (had read about it here) but in the heat of the moment we did something we hadnt planned...we upgraded to the 2 bedroom penthouse for one night. Sure it was a big splurge, but why not try something once. It was on the top floor, includes a foyer, 2 1/2 baths, full kitchen, living room, two bedrooms and amazing views. The master bathroom is AMAZING. There were alot of little perks such as spa products, slippers, toothbrush, sewing kits, etc. We ordered room service for dinner which was delivered in a timely manner. For the second and third nights they upgraded us from a regular room to a corner suite (I think as a \"bonus\" for staying in the penthouse the previous night). This room was just as nice as the penthouse except not as big. We probably would have been just as happy with this upgrade and saved on the penthouse. We had to call housekeeping for an extra blanket which arrived within 15 minutes. We also loved that the pool was quiet and relaxing. They even heat the water which is nice. Even though its very hot outside, swimming in freezing water is never fun. Loved there is no party atmosphere here. We had a excellent stay here. Everyone was pleasant and went out of their way to be professional and helpful. Having the location slightly off the strip was nice too. Made it seem even more upscale and not as \"commercial\". We walked across the street to Fashion Mall several times and found you can take shuttles/trams from hotel to hotel and eventually end up at the mall and then short walk to hotel.

The hotel has good points and bad points, but more good than bad. First, if you are going to this hotel, you have to realize that there is no casino, which is unusual for Vegas since there are slot machines in the airport. You also have to realize that this hotel is not on the strip....it's about a block back. Now, this could be something you are looking for if you want to get away from the craziness that is the strip but if you like being right there in the heart of the action, then this hotel may not be what you're looking for. This is just a hotel, no bells and whistles like the other Vegas hotels, no casino, no shows, no fountains, no volcanoes erupting, but also none of the hustle and crowds either. And it's smoke-free. Plus, no \"porn\" vendors outside the hotel either. On the strip, you can't spit without hitting one of these sleaze-peddlers. Trump offers you solace from that. However, don't despair, the hotel has shuttle buses that will take you right to Caesar's Palace and the Wynn, so you are only moments away. If you don't want to wait for the shuttle, the strip is only a 2 or 3 minute walk away. The hotel itself is beautiful. Marble floors, brass (gold) light fixtures, the woodwork around the walls and in the elevator reminded me of the boardroom on The Apprentice. The pool was great with lots of seats, warm water, clean towels, a bar nearby. This hotel also has a wonderful aroma. I have no idea what flowery smell it is but I have never commented on how a hotel smells unless it's bad. But this smell was great. It greets you immediately as you enter the lobby. At check-in, we were also offered the chance to upgrade our room for $50 more a night, which we declined. Quite frankly, it really didn't matter because the room we did get was one of the largest and best laid out hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. We were a bit confused as we approached our room when we saw two room numbers on one door (are we sharing a room with someone?). However, the first simply opens to an entryway. The two separate room doors were on the inside. Quick note here......your room has a doorbell!! Seriously. The bathroom I can only describe as huge. Standing in the door, the tub was on our left and was big enough for my girlfriend and myself to both fit in. A double sink on the far wall with a giant mirror, featuring a TV in the mirror. Several nights, we \"bubbled\" in the tub with the water jets going and watched TV. To the right behind glass doors was the shower....a shower big enough for both of us to walk around in. The toilet was also behind another glass door. Out in the room, we had a nice view of the Rio hotel and we could see the Mirage off to the left. However, right down below us we could also see Industrial Blvd featuring the Love Boutique. I won't comment on that......you can fill in your own blanks. King size bed was fantastic, plenty of closet space, counter space, we even had a stove, sink, refridgerator, utensils, in case we felt like cooking anything (we didn't). In front of the large window on the far wall was a couch which opened into another bed. Desk space was great and we had free internet (well, not really free....Trump hits you with something called a \"resort fee\" for $19.95 a day. Your internet is included in that fee). We did not eat in the DJT restaurant in the hotel, as it seemed a bit pricey. Now for some bad things, one other reviewer mentioned a train whistle. I would second that notion. We could see the train tracks from our room and a train did come by a couple times a day and was loud. 19th floor and we could hear it. However, growing up in a big city, I'm used to trains so it didn't bother me. Just be aware, you WILL hear the train. The earliest it came through was about 8am, the latest was about 11:30pm. We moved one of the chairs in the room and found a stain under the chair. Again, really didn't care.....I wasn't planning on eating off the floor anyway and afterall it was under a chair. However one point did bother me.....emphasis on the word \"point\". I was standing at the window one morning looking out over Vegas and I stepped on a carpet nail that was poking up through the rug. It did draw blood. Trump might want to get that fixed. I also noticed another carpet nail poking up near the entrance to the bathroom. So, be careful if you're walking around in bare feet. With that aside, I would still say this was one of the better hotels I have ever stayed in. I would highly recommend it and would certainly stay there again.", "title": "Trump does it right, off the strip", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tdornber", "date": "September 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 118781460}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Loved it, loved it all...We walked into Trump International after a hetic trip across the USA and fell in love instantly with this hotel and we were only in the lobby...We were invited to upgrade for only another $50 dollars a night which we accepted and our king room turned into a master king room..When we entered our room, I was laughing hysterically as I have never ever had a room as luxourious as this one nor have I ever had a view as beautiful as the one I had....My partner was blown away even though he did tell me to stop with the laughter but I couldn't...We had a large lounge area, kitcnenette, two bathrooms with the master bathroom bigger than places I have stayed in previously and the bedroom and bed were bliss....", "title": "Fantastic", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "cat0407", "date": "September 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118756438}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We heard the train at 3am but this did not worry us at all as after all, this was Las Vegas and a train passing through is far better than having a rowdy bachelor party next door which I have previoulsy experienced in Vegas.

We had people over for drinks and appetizers, it was easy as we had cocktail glasses, martini shaker, plates, flatware, and other items in the very nice kitchen. There were robes in the closet, and everything was top notch. Well, went back this weekend and things have gone downhill. No robes, even though their literature states that they are in the room, in the kitchen there were hardly any utensils, we had two forks, one butter knife, and one spoon which we discovered when we brought gelato back to snack on late one night. We had to share the spoon. We had one salad plate and one dinner plate, thank goodness we didn't plan on having anyone over or to eat anything in the room. We called down to housekeeping and asked for extra pillows, they came with no pillowcases. We had to chase down the guy and he then brought us the cases. There was a nice holder next to the phone for paper and pen, it was empty. Never did get filled. We had washcloths the 1st day then they took them and didn't replace them the 2nd day, we never did get any again. Bizarre. No napkins with the coffee fixings, which made the washcloth deficit even more noticeable as we could have at least used them as napkins in a pinch. The concierge couldn't have seemed more bothered when I stopped by to tell her that things just weren't up to snuff in our room. She said \"So, what? Do you want some robes?\" Then she asked if I wanted to have the day manager call me. I told her that I was leaving for the morning but he could call me in the afternoon. Guess who never called? Overall it was a big letdown compared to my first stay, and I'm not sure if I will come back. I do have to say the the valets and the doormen are AWESOME - they are so friendly and couldn't be nicer.
