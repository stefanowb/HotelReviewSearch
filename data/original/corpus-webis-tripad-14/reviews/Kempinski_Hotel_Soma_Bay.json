It seemed no better and no worse than other nice hotels I've stayed at in Egypt (Hyatts, Hiltons etc). Still, I had a great sea view and the patio was lovely for sitting out on in the evening. My only criticism was that housekeeping was a little poor. The room itself was kept lovely and clean, but when we used glasses they weren't ever replaced with clean ones.

The German chef had a slightly strange sense of humour but we forgave him after tasting some of the roast beef he served up. I ate everything you're not supposed to in Egypt - unpeeled vegetables, ice cream etc - and not a hint of any of the troubles you normally see. The buffet was pricey (came to about 100 euros per night for two of us and a bottle of wine) but it was clear that the food and the chef's skill were worth the money. The only slight downside was that the restaurant staff weren't that great ... they could be exceptionally slow at bringing you drinks and often we were completely ignored until we flagged a member of staff down.
