The hotel is modern and functional. The room was cleaned and towels changed everyday. Break fast was included and had something for all tastes(we are vegetarians and this was not a problem) Many reviews complain about the bed and the TV, but we didnt find this a problem. The bed was fine and as far as the TV is concerned, we only we there to sleep and not watch TV, which I expect is what most people will go to Barcelona for! The hotel is about 15 to 20 minutes walk to Placa Catalunya. La Sagrada familia is only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel. There are a few cafes and shops around the hotel. The area felt safe at all times of the day. Barcelona is built for pedestrians, we were impressed by the pavements in Barcelona which were in most cases wider than the roads!! Tetuan metro station is only 5 minutes from the hotel. The metro system in Barcelona is very cheap and convenient, but we walked to most places, which is the best way to see Barcelona and all its amazing buildings. Occasionally we took the metro in the evenings when we were tired. We bought a T-10 card which was sufficient for our entire 4 day stay: one T-10 card can be shared between any number of people.", "title": "Nice clean modern hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "desitraveller23", "date": "January 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 13029643, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean and modern, location", "disliked": "\u2014 Will have to ask for a double bed else wil be given a twin!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007", "text": "Be very wary of taking taxis from the Airport, they sometimes try to rip you off.

Some cold cuts, coffee, juices. When something runs out, girls that wait the counter took their time with refilling it. Location is about 25 minute walk from the center. We end up buying metro card (10 rides for 7 euros) and took subway back to the hotel which stops 4 small blocks from the hotel (5 minute walk).

Three of us had adjoining rooms on the 7th floor. The rooms were a bit small but the bathroom was large in comparison, There are wooden floors which are bit noisey but this is compensated by being in a quiet part of town, and the house maids are very efficient. The reception staff are very helpful and speak very good English. We used taxis quite a bit as we found them quite cheap. One tip though, if you have suitcases, make sure you load them in and out of the taxi otherwise the over eager drivers charge 6 Euro a case for loading them for you. We found the breakfasts too dear at 11 Euro a head, but for 8 Euros I bought a weeks supply of breakfasts from a supermarket 2 blocks away and ate in our rooms. The rooms had a reasonable good size safe in the closet. I was relieved of my wallet and contents the first day on Las Ramblas but unbelieveably retrieved it back within seconds fully in tact I suspect the timely arrival of two police officers on the beat just at that time assisted in the abandonment of the crime. What was a problem was we don't speak Spanish. We were advised that this would not be a problem as almost everybody there speaks English - Wrong - Very few people either don't speak English or can't be bothered if you can't speak Spanish and we found those people openly rude to us. Most taxi drivers are in this category. I would definately stay here again.
