The bathroom was large and had nightlights which was great for not walking into things. The hotel itself is outside of Dublin but you can catch the DART commuter train by making a right at the main street and walking down to the corner. Access to the city was quite simple. My wife and I bought a one week pass and used the train every day to get to the City Center. Travel to and from the airport was simple.
