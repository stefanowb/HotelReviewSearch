With the reduced rate offered for participants we chose to stay at the venue for the conference. Convenient, time saving, and excellent food and accommodation. But, there is a but. All guests are not alike. Especially not those who stay at the hotel by other reasons than holidays. We always like to see other parts of the country than a beach, a pool, or a restaurant. Therefore we wanted to go to Ubud, which was not so easy, when the bus system is difficult to use (because of language problems and unfamiliarity with foreign tourists). We therefore asked the hotel to arrange a car with driver for us. As we had a wish to see one specific place in Ubud, the driver took us there without any problem. That he happened to pass the Bali Orchid Garden twice was not something astonishing, but when we explained our wish to buy some spices where local consumers by them, strange things started to happen. We were not taken to any local markets or supermarkets, but to one of the very nice Bali Agrotourism sites where coffee, herbs and spices where demonstrated and packed \"as gifts from Bali\" to prices which no local inhabitant can afford. I can imagine foreign tourists staying at Kartika Plaza want this type of excursions, and as we were not protesting clearly enough, the driver probably thought he treated us well. When my wife saw a local shop with nice baskets, she wanted to stop. The driver neglected and said he knew a better place, which turned out to be another \"tourist trap\" with nothing like the local baskets we wanted to stop for. This time we started to be suspicious: Was this a sort of practise the hotel is encouraging? Has the driver commissions from the \"tourist markets\"? For us it was quite disappointing that we were not listened too, as we were the ones paying for the tour. For the hotel, it may be obvious that staff, including its drivers, have to understand that guests are different and would like to be treated differently. Especially not those who aren't staying at the hotel by their own choice, but at the recommendation by a conference host. To add further annoyance, my wife broke her wrist falling on the wet marble floor in the bathroom. There need to be at least some form of rubber mats for elderly people to avoid these type of accidents. In public areas warnings for wet floor were numerous, in bathrooms non existent. In preparing for check-out we had to repeat the same story three times (separate bill for the medical treatment, airport transfer priced in accordance with written agreement at booking). As a grand final, we found ourselves the Pasar Kuta (Kuta traditional market), where we could by the chilli we wanted in Ubud each morning between 5 and 9.", "title": "Luxury resort, if that is what you want", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ahi-nama", "date": "May 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130271666}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Very well presented & maintained property.

We were at the Discovery for 7 nights and in this time my girlfriend and I got engaged. The staff were very helpful in making arrangements for the night and all went very well. We ate in the hotel restaurants a number of times; the meals were very nice and reasonably priced. However if you want some of the best international cuisine you will ever have head next door to the back of the shopping mall (Atmosphere) or to Kuta beach (Rosso Vivo). Conclusion is the room rate is a little more expensive than some of the more remote locations (Nusa Dua) but they do not charge a fortune for drinks and food, also the service charges are all included.

Even the grass was swept clean everyday. Great mix of guests. Alot of Australians and Europeans. Don't let the hotel web site turn you away, it doesn't do it justice.
