It's just a matter of luck getting one of THE FEW rooms they have rennovated and they show you on internet. When me and my girlfirend arrived we were given an old, dark and small room at the ground floor not even in the main building ( you have to go out to get to the annex building). I complained with the receptionist saying that we had to stay there for a few days, had big suitcases and the room he gave us was not the one we were expecting but he didn't want to change us the room. Reason: fully booked. Weird because we were with a big group and the big part of it was arriving the day after us. At the time we arrived the hotel seemed empty. He just didn't want to spend time in making changes in his system!!! If we were on our own we surely would have changed hotel!!!!", "title": "Fake rennovated hotel", "user": "CarloMilano", "date": "September 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 20173345, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Room"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Almost Ripped Off", "text": "I stayed here for two nights..Hotel is fine.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "DAVEGeorgia", "date": "October 29, 2007", "id": 10427442}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled on business", "text": "But, one of the clerks tried to steal my credit card information.
