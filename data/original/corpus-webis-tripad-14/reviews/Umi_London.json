I chose this hotel because it was available with AA miles. The Bayswater location was excellent, in a great area surrounded by wonderful restaurants. Very comfortable walking about at night; and so close to the Tube and bus lines. The room I had (#108) was very noisy though, because it was above the office. I heard doors banging all night every night for four nights. The room was very dated, the furniture very shabby, but the bed was clean, the bathroom okay, and the price was right. I love the area and would probably stay at this hotel again, knowing that it is well located, but I would request a different room for sure.", "title": "Great location, a bit shabby", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "chissis", "date": "November 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120355659}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We left a lot of money in this hotel to get basically a really loud room where you can hear anyone passing by on the floor, a cleaning lady that storms at you in the morning without knocking, and receptionists who doesn`t tell you that you pay twice*", "title": "loud with incompetent staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Hello128", "date": "October 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119867887}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "*they block the total sum on your account at your check-in that won`t be available for 2 weeks after your check-out.
