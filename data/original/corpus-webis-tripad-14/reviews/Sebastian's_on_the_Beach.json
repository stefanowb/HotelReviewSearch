We went sailing twice and always made sure to stop by Sebastians for dinner and purchase their rum!We returned with friends 2 years ago, and they loved it , too.When we initially looked for a vacation spot, we did not want a 15 story hotel with 5 restaurants and 10 pools. We're glad we found this jewel on Apple Bay. It is low key and peaceful. Everyone was friendly, we loved our 2nd floor beach front room. We left the glass door open at night so we could listen to the surf as we went to sleep and woke up! We enjoyed our meals and spirits. If you want a little nightlife, head over to Quito's and dance to raggae music! Head to the Top of the World resaurant for a bite to eat and take in the breath taking view. We never went to the Surar Mill. We liked trying other small restaurants in the little side streets. Taxis were easily available and we also rented a jeep for a few days so we could explore the island and its beaches. Check out Smuggler's Cove. If you have never snorkled try it, you'll be hooked. You can make a day trip if you choose. Head to Jost Van Dyke and visit Foxy's. We hope to be back with more friends next year!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 14, 2006", "id": 4972775}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We got to the BVI late at night without our bags, obviously not the hotel's fault.

I was a little worried after reading some of the other reviews regarding the locals hanging out by the phone box, but that was not a problem and they were no problem at all. Nice restaurant, food was good. Staff were very friendy and helpful, never had any problem with that. It was a quick 10 minute drive to Cane Garden, where we ate nearly every night. Cane Garden is packed during the day with day trippers from the cruise ships, so we were glad to be at Sebastians to have some peace and quiet and a nearly empty beach.
