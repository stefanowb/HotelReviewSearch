We covered the bed with towels, but I still woke up with my leg covered in bug bites. As I said, the pool was nice. The location is great and we loved Capitola.

This place isn't horrible but its nothing like the cute pictures I seen of the rooms online. I had room 305 (I believe). It was dark & dank I don't know how else to put it. Once I walked in I was overwhelmed with the scent of cheap air freshener, that drives me crazy! It was seriously overwhelming, the person spraying must have thought the more they used the cleaner the room would appear to be. Again the room wasn't horrible just not the pleasant welcoming environment you want when you're on vacation. The other gross out factor was as I was getting into the shower there were a few black hairs left around the tub YIKES! They were obvious so I don't know how those were missed while cleaning up. So if you're looking to save a few bucks in a decent area go for it. Personally I like staying in a room where I don't feel I need to leave my sandals on while in the shower. If this is AFTER the renovation I would have hated to see the before.

Upon a stroll around the grounds, we discovered that the majority of lst floor rooms were uninhabitable (furniture piled into the rooms, trash on the decks) - they must know they cannot rent out those rooms.
