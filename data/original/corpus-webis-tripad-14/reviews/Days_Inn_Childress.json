Was disappointed to see the room up close. Was given a handicapped room, which was fine except the roll in shower was full of mildew on the floor and walls of shower. The shower wand had leaks all along the hose and sprayed paper all over the bathroom. The windows in two of the rooms had aleast 1/4 inch gaps around them where the wind and dust freely came in. There was a recliner in the room which was nice for relaxing in after a day of driving.", "title": "Mildewed shower", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Hanfordmom", "date": "May 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 7669358, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 large room", "disliked": "\u2014 cleanliness"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006, traveled solo", "text": "I have been happy with the Days Inn in Childress.
