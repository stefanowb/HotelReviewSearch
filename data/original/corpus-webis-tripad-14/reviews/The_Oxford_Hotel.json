The staff instantly greet you with a smile and a familiar greeting. Having room service is like being treated on a special occasion. I appreciate the Oxford's uniqueness --putting it miles ahead of the cookie-cutter look and feel of the chain hotels. The location is ideal. Easy walking to Coors Field and the myriad of restaurants and shops on the pedestrian mall. The surrounding blocks are filled with restaurants and bars that could suit many tastes.

Other staff coming and going around the reception area noticed guests waiting, but did not bother to assist. Breakfast was dull, served on dirty plates and accompanied by weak, machine-made coffee: I asked if it could be made stronger, but nothing was done to improve it.
