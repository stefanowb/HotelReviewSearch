The rooms were cold and there was no way to get warm. Someone broke into one of the rooms the first night and the explanation of staff was poor at best. There were no telephones in the room - so they could not even phone for help. the two ladies were very upset about the incident. We tried to follow the request of hanging up the towels after use to reuse them (to help conserve water). The staff however did not allow them to dry before folding them up for reuse - the result was that we had wet towels to use at the end of the day and by then they smelt not very good! The food was really disappointing. Next time we take a group Hippo Hollow will not be on our list of places to visit!
