The resort is very classy and located in a fabulous setting among the mountains. Spectacular views all around. The staff were all friendly and very helpful. Our room (Santa Lucia suite in in the Bluffs area) was spacious, with king bed, sofa, fireplace, huge bathroom and large deck). There was a small refrigerator which we used for snacks, etc. We enjoyed yoga at the River Ranch fitness, pool and tennis center. I played golf one day on site which my wife enjoyed the spa. The golf course is beautiful and very well maintained (although only 6200 yards from the tips). The ate dinner at the main restaurant twice. The food was good, but my steak one night was over-cooked.

There are deer, turkeys and other animals all over the place - almost like a zoo! I saw 11 deer on one golf hole alone. There are some trails around the property that we used extensively.

The public areas and accommodations in this all-suite resort are sophisticated contemporary, while inviting at the same time, with ebony-toned, wide-plank floors, sheered, native stone fireplaces and firepits, and thoughtfully intriguing paintings, framed photos, and sculpture. Check-in is brief and convenient with one of the friendly and personable staft, at one of two desks with guest chairs. Close-in parking is available and once parked, one uses the resort transportaion (surreyed golf cart-type trolleys from suite to lodge and motor coaches to outlying attractions and Carmel-By-The-Sea). The pushbutton, natural stone gas fireplaces in the suites compliment the leather furniture, dark plank flooring (again), stone-topped endtables, and bronze-fixtured floor and table lighting. The basket of nutritious treats in the suites and the bottled water everywhere are complimentary. The bathrooms in the suites are generously sized and conveniently appointed, with water-preserving fixtures that are generous in force and delivery and proprietary toiletries that are lavender and other herbs-infused.

After being couped up in a small manhattan apartment all winter long, what a joy it was to run free on the beautiful ranch. The entire resort was leash-free indoors and out with the exception of the restaurant which by all means completely understandable but get this, there are two round dining tables in the lobby lounge right outside the restaurant where the restaurant kindly accommodated us and our pooches. One of the best breakfasts I've ever had in a hotel, how much can toast, eggs, sausage, bacon and juice impress you ask? That's how good it was, and we're picky eaters, and that's just breakfast, lunch was good too. And to top it off, professional, friendly servers, great floor to ceiling views of the pool, dogs by my side, just perfect. The pet amenities in room were cute and the bag dispensers were super convenient.
