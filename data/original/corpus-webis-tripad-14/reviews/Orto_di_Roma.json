We had a lovely stay at Orto di Roma for 4 nights in a room with 3 single beds as we had requested. The room was immaculately clean, with air conditioning, flat screen TV, small fridge, comfortable beds and pillows. It had balcony, although no view. This was not important. The room was spotlessly cleaned everyday, shower was good with good pressure, no complaints at all about the room itself. Lift was available and that was nice for my mother and sister who needed some assistance. The room we were given, however, was above where they cooked the pizzas for the adjacent pizzaria, so we smelled bread baking very early on rising and sound from the restaurant carried somewhat. This was not really an issue. We did ask not to be placed directly above or near the restaurnat and I guess they honored that. Note to others: If not, it will be noisy. The staff was fantastic. Very helpful, especially with direction, advice, etc. The reception desk is always staffed. Any thing you want to know about, ask Paolo. He is your man, although they were all great. You can buy metro passes to get started in Rome from the hotel. They can also provide you with a pretty good free map, tell you which bus to use to get where etc. Breakfast bar was very good. Good variety and fresh. Coffee bar with a barista. Note: Both baristas are rather unfriendly, but who cares, you are in Rome. Location of hotel is all right. Takes 20-30 min by bus to get to the metro station Basilica di san paolo (line B) that then takes you anywhere else you want to go. so, give yourself plenty of time to get to places.
