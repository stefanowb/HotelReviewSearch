What a pleasant surprise. I went with my 3 children 17, 16 and 13 with his 14 year old friend. The staff and other holiday makers were very friendly and the site was virtually spotless. Evening entertainment was varied and enjoyable, with the indoor and outdoor pools keeping them active for most of the day. Perhaps my only gripe would be the daytime activities.... in the days when my lot were little, Haven provided a full programme of activities free of charge with just a few higher level activities which you paid a minimal extra cost for. Now it appears everything is pay as you go, with activity passes costing \u00a336 for 6 stamps. Bearing in mind certain activities such as bike hire are 2 stamps each, you could very quickly spend a small fortune, particularly with a larger family. All in all we had a fantastic weekend and the kids have begged to return. PS. perhaps one word of warning re: wifi access... I received an urgent work request and popped to the Mash & Barrel for the free wifi only to find their server blocked most of my sites such as Dropbox and email so very limited web access available.", "title": "Lovely weekend, will be returning", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "KatjaBandFamily", "date": "July 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 115239944}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We have been to the Ochards before and just use it as a base.
