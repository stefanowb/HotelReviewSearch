It was so easy to get into the city via bus (stop right out side the hotel, every 20mins during the day) and to travel to Weggis or Rigi by car (less than 30 mins). Hotel staff incredibly friendly and helpful, and even though we didn't eat at the restaurant we had after dinner drinks and desserts at the bistro/outside terrace. Buffet breakfasts were excellent - cheese, cold meats, fresh bread, eggs, fruit, yoghurt, cereals - all fresh and copious. Rooms were clean and modern, and the lack of aircon (common to all Swiss hotels) was easily solved by opening the windows during the night (no problem as it was out of town).
