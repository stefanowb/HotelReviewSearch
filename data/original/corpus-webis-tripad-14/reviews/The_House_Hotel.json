We did not have enough time here, but this hotel provided a great room with ample space and a very updated/modern bathroom that makes you feel like you are staying in a suite anywhere in America - very roomy with all the amenities you could want. As with all European hotels the elevators are smallish and there's a little bit of effort to get through doors/hallways to get to your room, but once there - perfect. The check-in staff, breakfast staff, afternoon reception - all great. If you are wanting an old school experience this is not for you, but I would highly recommend. Location is unbelievable as you can walk to every restaurant/bar/shopping/sight you would want to.
