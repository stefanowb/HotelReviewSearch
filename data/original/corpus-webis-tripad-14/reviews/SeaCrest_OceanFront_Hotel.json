Our rooms were spacious and clean, we had a ground floor room with a patio just overlooking the pool/sea area, if we went back we would pay extra for a Sea View as the scenery is amazing. The Beach area is good, though do be aware as there are a number of steps to go down if you have walking difficulties. From the beach you can walk into Pismo (around 20 mins) where there are plenty of restaurants and a couple of bars. We were lucky enough to see Dolphins in the sea and they swam fairly close to the shore line which was wonderful and the morning we were leaving we spotted Wales out in the distance. The pool area was very pretty with plenty of sun beds and fresh towels supplied, we also enjoyed the use of the jacuzzi's which were lovely and warm. We were told breakfast was continental so didn't expect too much, but were in for a great surprise, as there was a good choice of cereals, numerous breads and bagels, with both savoury and sweet fillings along with fruit and yoghurt, so something for everyone, you can also enjoy your breakfast out on the terrace where they had fire heaters dotted around to take the chill off. The only thing we though that let this hotel down was that there was no bar facilities, as we would have liked to have stayed in the hotel with a few drinks in the evening, so that we could soak up the beautiful surroundings, but the hotel staff pointed out there was a restaurant about a 10 minute walk down the road, which we went to overlooking the sea, we did go here and all had a lovely meal.
