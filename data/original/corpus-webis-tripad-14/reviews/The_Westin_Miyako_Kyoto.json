We completely lucked out and got a fantastic deal on Expedia so we only ended up paying about $112 a night and then when we checked in they had upgraded us to their newly renovtated deluxe rooms. It was awesome!! The rooms were large and the bathroom was huge! If you're looking for \"Western\" rooms in Japan, this is where to find them. We stayed here for 4 nights and could have easily stayed much longer. The grounds are beautiful, the hotel is HUGE and extremely well kept. The staff are very helpful. The only downfall is that the restaurants in the hotel were super expensive so we always had to walk somewhere else. It's quite easy to walk around Kyoto, the city itself is breathtaking. However, the hotel location is a fair distance from all the major areas. If you're up for a good walk, then you can reach anywhere by foot, we even walked to the Castle which is in the other end of town. The subway system is extremely easy to use and there is a station just down the street form the hotel.", "title": "Wonderful!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Janesse", "date": "April 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14921147}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled solo", "text": "If you're planning a trip to Kyoto, this is the place to stay!!", "title": "Good and Bad", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "RichardKelso", "date": "April 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 14878297}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled solo", "text": "This is such a difficult review to write; the hotel is OK and the area good.

I had picked the hotel based on reviews I had read. It didn't really live up to my expectations. As others have mentioned, the satellite check-in is very hard to find in Kyoto Station- go past the McDonalds and you will eventually see it on your right. We received an upgraded room upon check-in-- our room was pretty basic and it didn't seem to be worth the money. It was nothing special by any means. We had to pay for Internet. The place was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. However, the restaurants were ridiculously expensive at the Westin!! The food quality was poor and the prices were outrageous- after our 1st day, we made the decision not to pay for any more meals at the hotel (breakfast was included but got boring very quickly- I've had buffets in India and Thailand that put this buffet to shame) We liked that the hotel was right next to the subway and tried to use the subway as much as possible. In some ways it was nice to be out of the hustle and bustle of Kyoto at night, but it also can feel isolating and you end up being stuck with the hotel's dining options. We stopped to use the bathroom at the Hotel Okura in Kyoto and I was very impressed with that hotel, decor-wise and location-wise.
