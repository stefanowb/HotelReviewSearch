Called Erin at AmericInn and not only did she have one she had it set up and ready to go in the five muntjac from the time we took to get there after we called. She also unlocked the breakfast juice machine for us so we could get our little one to settle for bed. Everything else was awesome...great beds, clean, friendly. And bak fast had anything you could want in a breakfast buffet! I can't say enough about the end of our trip because the other two hotels on our trip left us feeling pretty upset in general and this hotel gave us faith back.
