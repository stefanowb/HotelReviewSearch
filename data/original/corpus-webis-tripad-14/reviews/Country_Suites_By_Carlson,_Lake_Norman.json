I recently had to travel to New Jersey to take care of my 97 year old mother-in-law, and I stayed in both Roanoke, VA (North bound) and Lake Norman, NC (South bound) on the way to and from Georgia to New Jersey (and back). Both the staff and the accommodations in both cities were beyond my expectations. The staff at both locations provided me with all kinds of information and directions to different restaurants and nearby attractions, and made sure that my stay was excellent.

In addition, they have in door pools, which means you can have fun even in the winter and when the weather is rainy. But to this specific trip and hotel. We were traveling and our van was running hot to the point that we had to get it repaired. We contacted them before we even got to the hotel and they were able to direct us to a couple of shops next to the hotel. Due to the time we got in, none of the repair shops were open and I had to take the van to the repair shop first thing in the morning. As expected, the repairs took much longer than expected. The staff at Country Suites was extremely accommodating and allowed us to stay up until 4 PM in the room until they said they would have to charge us a 1/2 day or we could pay for a full day and spend one more night. In addition, they offered to shuttle me back to the auto repair shop when the van was fixed. It was very nice to be treated kindly when we were in a bad situation and really did not want to pay for an additional nights stay. The room was clean and nice. Nothing was broken and no funny smells. A+++ in my book.", "title": "Perfect Night!

The staff here was very friendly and had great communication with reserving our dinner reservations as soon as I booked. The hotel was very beautiful and clean.

The noise continued, as did the cars parked taking up multiple spots and the general feeling that this reunion had taken up the entire hotel. Luckily we did have a suite which insulated us from the noise a bit. To Carlson's credit, they did respond immediately to my survey and comments so I am happy about that. Once the group left on our last day it was very quiet and we didn't have to fight crowds for breakfast and I assume that is what the hotel is like most days.
