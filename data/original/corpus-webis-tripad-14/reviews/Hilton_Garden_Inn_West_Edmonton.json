This hotel is a great location for anyone who wants to be close to West Edmonton Mall. It is literally a 5-7 minute drive to the mall. The front desk offered us cookies one day after we arrived back from shopping, and they were always courteous and polite!

We booked through a third party site and then called ahead to request 2 Double beds, which we were assured we would receive. Upon arrival we were told they only had a King available but we could move the next day to Doubles, but they had a cot for us. Once in our room the night desk person arrived with extra blankets & pillow stating he couldn't find a cot. The next morning my husband went down to the desk at 8am and happened by an open housekeeping closet with a clean cot it in. They gave us free breakfast for our troubles. Went out for the day and when we returned we had been moved. Only they had NOT moved our daughter's teddy bear. We called the desk and they told us we'd have to wait til AM housekeepers came in. In the morning we spoke to the desk again and no one had seen her bear. We left the next day without the teddy bear and it still hasn't turned up. I am very skeptical as to how an almost 12inch rainbow colored bear goes missing and cannot be found. It was very upsetting to our little one and we left feeling extremely disappointed with the lack of apologies from any staff. Sent an email once we were home and received no reply. Only got a reply when sent second email to GM. I'd understand if it was a small item that got lost in laundry, but this was not the case. Would NOT return, nor reccomend this hotel.", "title": "Could've been handled better....", "user": "Becks2468", "date": "August 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 136013934}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed as a couple and felt very welcomed right off the start.

I had booked on line, thru a hotel.com, which was where my call went when I phoned the Hilton Garden Inn. When we arrived at the Hilton Inn, our reservation had not been made, but they accommodated us nonetheless, for which we are very grateful. We were on the 6th floor and had a panoramic view of the city. This stay was equal to our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Ottawa (airport).
