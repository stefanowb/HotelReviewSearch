The rooms are basic and too crowded for the double beds but the staff will bring the missing chairs. You can squeeze them in or use them on the small balconies. The beds are good, getting hot water (or too hot/too cold/limited pressure) is a challenge. The floors are less than clean -- we tracked dirt from the shower to the bath mat on bare feet. Breakfasts are the usual Costa Rica country fare and the rest of the restaurant menu is limited but we heard good comments about the food. A great bet is across the road at Delucia, a fine dining restaurant with excellent food and good service.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 14, 2012", "id": 124578311}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The rooms were clean with two queen-size beds, which were a little too firm for us.

There was also, no heat or air conditioning but with the wind blowing constantly, we didn\u2019t need either.
