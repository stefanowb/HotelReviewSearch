It was very warm and there was no air conditioning. We opened the window and left it open all day and night, but it was unbearably hot at night even with just a sheet on the bed. The worst part of the whole experience was the noise all night long!! Trinity Capital Hotel is right over the top of a huge fire station that is busy all night. Because we had the window open it was impossible to sleep due to the noise. I am not sure that it would have been better to have a room on the other side of the hotel due to the traffic noise.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 8, 2006", "id": 5440047}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "We were not happy with the cleanliness of our rooms. The bedspread on our bed was so soiled (blood and dirt) that we took it off the bed. The bed and pillows were not comfortable and there was a strong smoke smell in our room. We had asked for a non-smoking room and didn't get it. We tried first thing in the morning to switch to a non-smoking room and were told to pack our things and by the time we got back to the room after sight-seeing we would be switched to our new room by the staff. When we returned we were told that because we had not packed our belongings the did not move us. They had made an error with the room numbers and got our room mixed up with my daughters!! And, of course at that point there were now no rooms available. Because we had left our keys in the room when we packed up they gave us a new key which didn't open the door. On the way back down to the desk I tried it in my daughters door and it opened that room. They still had the two rooms mixed up! I was very unimpressed with the management and staff.", "title": "Is this the noisiest hotel in Dublin?
