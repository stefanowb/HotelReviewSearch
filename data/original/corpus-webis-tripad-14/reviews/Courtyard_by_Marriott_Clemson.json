The staff is friendly and helpful. The interactive touch display in the lobby is really neat, and can be quite helpful. On the downside, the internet connection is slow and gets bogged down to unusable during peak hours. The cafe is quite good, have enjoyed the oatmeal and coffee. The complementary coffee isn't worth it, pay the $2 for the starbucks! The hot water at the complementary drink area tastes like coffee, so avoid tea. I know I'm just looking to pull out a couple of negatives, but this place is truly a nice place in a nice part of town.", "title": "Fantastic", "user": "nyteowl", "date": "May 12, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 63919647}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I really enjoyed staying at the Clemson Courtyard Marriott. It was very clean and has a great fitness facility. I had read a previous review that the pool was heated, but found that it was not heated at all... and it was way too cold to even think about getting in despite the warm weather. Loved the inviting lounge and outside fire pit. The bed was very comfortable and the only thing that could have been better was the linens were too thin. The air conditioner was too good, but had to watch it because it would get too cold. Loved the flat screen tv that turned to face the bed or couch.. very nice touch. The bathroom was very luxurious with the over-sized shower with seat. The breakfast food at the bistro was good, but had very few selections and seemed kinda pricey..but I did love getting my starbucks coffee in house. This would be an awesome hotel if the pool were indoors or at least heated and they had a free hot breakfast bar.

The parking lot is well lit, in a good location (kinda tucked away). My room was awesome. I had a mini-suite. It was quite comfy and the lay out was much different from other hotels.
