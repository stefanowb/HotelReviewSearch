Welcomed with fresh milk for our tea and coffee instead of the horrid long life stuff Isually get at higher rated establishments. Room large and airy. I never inspect the corners for mould and fluff, so if it's there I did not see it. Bed queen sized, very comfy, clean, choice of pillows but the ones on the bed were just fine.

We stayed in a room on the 4th floor with a queen bed and one single; the room was the right size for its bedding, the bathroom was great (walk-in shower, so no messing about with a clingy shower curtain) water pressure good - but people with young children will need to take care as the hot water temperature is scalding hot on its own rather than being limited to 50C. The furnishings are modern without being overwhelmingly or intimidatingly so; the colour scheme warm and inviting. The curtains are lined with proper blockout so the heat stays in and the sun doesn't wake you up. The carpets, to be sure, are probably nearing replacement stage - but this is the kind of investment that a GFC can delay by a year or two until things pick up again. The staff were uniformly authentically friendly, happy, gracious and obliging. I had my own wireless internet access so can't speak for that; but the TV was easy to work, the heater very efficient, the beds and bedding very comfortable. There's a big, free car park.

It is no dearer to get room service for breakfast (you select and pay for each item individually, rather than there being a set rate for the whole meal - and then it's $5 to have it brought to your room) than it is to go downstairs to the restaurant to eat, and the food is simply divine - I understand the chef is female and very dedicated. We stayed here both going down and returning from the Great Ocean Drive and on the second occasion had dinner in our rooms - dessert was \"Tunisian Citrus Samosas with Almond Ice-Cream and Citrus Salad\" - it was out of this world! All the food was good. Proper muesli for breakfast. The setting is lovely as they have a small and very pretty pool in the courtyard that the resturant looks out on.
