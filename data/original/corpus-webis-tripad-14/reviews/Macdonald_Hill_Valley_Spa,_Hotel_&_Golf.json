Firstly, the rooms whilst smallish, are nicely appointed. We had a ground floor feature room with a view across the golf course (and a small terrace). If the forecast is good I'd recommend you pay that little bit more for this room. They're South facing so it's nice to sit out in the sun with a drink watching the (golf) world pass by. We played both golf courses. The Emerald course is the better of the two - one of the nicest 'hotel' courses we've played. The other course, Sapphire, is more hilly and let down by perhaps four poor holes and lack of signage. Both courses are walkable but if you fancy a buggy one day use it on Sapphire. The Spa is good if not the best we've seen. The breakfast is excellent. Now for a few negatives. It's a modern red brick built hotel so if you like old fashioned stone country houses this isn't for you. We found the restaurant lacked charm. I'd liken it to Premier Inn. It's certainly not of the standard of some other McDonald Hotels we've stayed in. The evening meal matched the surroundings. Nothing wrong with it but nothing special. There were some nice touches: I liked the fact that the bread was carved freshly at the table. I'd have liked a better wine list (with lower price points). I'd also have liked the opportunity to take coffee in the lounge.", "user": "Tickandbash", "date": "May 6, 2013", "id": 159829288}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "A final niggle: after a round of golf I like a beer and some nuts or crisps.

The cooked breakfast was fairly simple but the cold buffet was amazing with everything you could possibly wish for. The lights in our room fused but they were repaired within minutes once we had reported it to reception so no complaints there. There was a good heater in the room and we could regulate the temperature to our needs.

Decided to rest up on our journey home and called in to this hotel, very late in the day. \u00a3168 for very basic room with breakfast. Very professional front of house manager-but that's about all I can say in favour of this place. Cold room-- faulty plumbing - wafer thin pillows --and no privacy nets on the ground to ceiling window( we were ground floor, so open for all to see with curtains open). Set in nice grounds with its own golf course, it is obviously well suited for the visiting golfers, who seemed predominantly male and in various sized groups, drinking the day away in their rooms. The restaurant was 'full' ( more staff would clearly help here). And so we were forced to eat in the bar area, surrounded by returning golfers, still wearing the majority of their outdoor clothing. Breakfast was a farce. They were again woefully understaffed, with the previous evenings staff clearly exhausted and some still wearing the same stained clothing from their previous evenings shift. Breakfast food itself was fine-but the service was again painfully slow due to lack of staff. 4 Star ??? -not in my book.
