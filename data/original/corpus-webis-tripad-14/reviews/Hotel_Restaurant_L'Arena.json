The hotel is very central, charming, clean, with huge rooms and a very comfortable king-size bed. Breakfast was fine. We ate in the hotel one night, as we had arrived late -- very sophisticated food, a tad expensive. Staff was helpful in showing us how to park our car in city lot at minimal expense. Driving the Cornice L'Esterel is highly recommended: spectacular ocean/cliff views, with fewer tourists than above Nice. Two minor complaints about hotel: our windows wouldn't open (noice-reducing inner windows -- they did work on the noise) and no free internet access.", "title": "Great location and feeling", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Genings", "date": "October 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10069055}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Sun, sea, sand and history", "text": "My wife and I plus our 3 years old daughter recently spent a week in this hotel. Lovely old property with a small pool and lots of greenery and flowers. We booked a triple room overlooking the pool and garden with views across Frejus to the mountains. To be honest we may as well have had a double room without the view and saved 40 euros per night as we were out most of the day and the room simply served as a place to wash and sleep. We skipped breakfast at 10 euros each and used the local boulangerie and cafe bars instead. The restaurant in the hotel is very expensive but apparently very good (beyond our budget I'm afraid).", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Donnietraveller", "date": "October 5, 2004", "id": 2620749}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very Good", "text": "This was only our second trip to France so I cannot comment on many other towns there but I cannot understand the negative comments regarding Frejus. It has a lovely beach (a fair walk), a marina complex (on the way to the beach) with bars and restaurants. A beautiful town square with a 13th century chapel and baptistry with small museum. A Roman amphitheatre. Twice weekly food markets with superb produce. Several quality restaurants with good value menus. Several bars and some of the finest bread and pastry shops I have encountered. After 3 or 4 days of this maybe you get itchy feet. No problem catch the TGV 5 minutes from the hotel to Nice, Cannes, Monaco, Marseille, Avignon or even Paris. You want to go to St Tropez catch the bus 10 minutes from the hotel. You want to do some serious walking then head for the Esterel flanking the whole coastline. If you cannot find enough to do here you are not trying hard enough.
