The setting of the hotel in the middle of Lake Pichola is quite dramatic even though the water level is lower than the norm. We were upgraded to a very attractive suite but I must point out that the upgrade occurred only after an emphatic protest over the size of the standard room. In fact, I would not recommend staying here unless you are guaranteed a suite. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and we very much enjoyed dining at the rooftop restaurant (although some variation in the menu from day-to-day would have been desirable). Breakfast was a very elaborate spread and the waffles were especially delicious. The pool was a bit small but quite attractive and very well-staffed.

I asked for a glass of bubbles and was given two to try (both Indian -- Marquise de Pompadour and Sula -- and both good, although I liked the former slightly better). The general practice when one orders wine is for the staff to bring out a bottle of what was ordered plus two others (in the same general category) and offer a taste of all of them. At first we thought it rather unnecessary, knowing what we like and what we don't like, and of course we assumed they were trying to sell us a higher priced glass, but in fact that wasn't the case.

Lake palace (taj) has my vote over udaivilas !! It was a close contest. We just spent 2 nights at the lake palace and enjoyed it thoroughly. Divya and I were there with our dear friends Dhruv and Shagun, as it was shagun's birthday. A few years ago we stayed at udaivilas and loved it. When there, we saw the lake palace from a distance, floating in the lake. Somehow it never appeared that attractive to me. Probably because I hate run down rajasthani palaces and from a distance I assumed that this was another one. Far from it. Its a hotel with tremendous character. Beautifully maintained. The old world charm is retained while the present day luxuries have been seamlessly integrated. A perfect blend. The palace grows on you. The arrival at the palace was nothing very special. The \"barge\" where the boat docks is ordinary. The reception area also ordinary. But somehow the place grows on you. For me it started with the welcome drink \u2013 a delicious mocktail of orange juice, cardamom and crushed almonds !! Understated, yet palacial. Hard to describe but magical. Of course it is endowed with an unbeatable location which others could never and will never be able to emulate. Because of the 360 degree water vistas that one gets to glance at every now and then, one feels sometimes as though this is a large luxury cruiseliner. The food is fantastic. Unlike udaivilas which has just one restaurant serving decent food, here there are 3 , all excellent. We didn't eat at the indian one, but had breakfast and a few other meals at the Jharokha coffee shop which were excellent. Loved the \"palace burger\" and \u201cchicken ceasar\u201d. The \"bhairo\" - fine dining restaurant is just amazing. it was shagun's birthday eve that we spent at \"bhairo\". It was like \"orient express\" at the taj palace in delhi. Only out doors, and overlooking the lake and the beautifully lit city palace. Undescribably beautiful view. Very romantic. Food was excellent too.
