The location on top of the hill overlooking Berchtesgaden is beautiful and their spa area with the outdoor pool right in between the mountains outstanding. The hotel staff was very friendly and the food was great. Only the room service took almost an hour and the internet in the rooms did not seem to work properly but when mentioned at the reception the extra charges for internet were taken off accordingly. The breakfast buffet is very good and they even have certaing things for people with gluten or milk allergies. It was a great stay and as activities I can really recommend the salt mine in the valley as well es the Enzian Schnaps Brewery tour.", "title": "Amazing Hotel", "user": "Nina B", "date": "November 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144739186}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled solo", "text": "I have stayed at, and reviewed, this hotel once before- a few years ago.", "title": "Another great stay at IC Berchtesgaden Resort", "user": "medic51vrf", "date": "October 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143978023}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Upon my check-in, I was told that I was greeted by the General Manager, personally, and he welcomed me back, asked if I was satisfied with everything (How could I not be?) and told me to contact him if there were any issues.
