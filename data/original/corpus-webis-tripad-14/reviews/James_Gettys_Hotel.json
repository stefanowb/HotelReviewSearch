It had a seperate bedroom and a living room/kitchenette area, in addition with a large private bathroom. The room was also exceptionally clean. The kitchenette was well stocked with dinnerware, glassware, and freshly ground coffee as well as some teas. The breakfast tray was pretty good but the one day I bit into a muffin and there was a pocket of salt or baking soda that wasn't mixed in so that was a bit disgusting but otherwise the breakfasts were okay. Nice big bathtub. The innkeeper, Katherine was really nice, talkative, and helpful. The room didn't have a safe, even though we didn't care I know that some people would have liked that.
