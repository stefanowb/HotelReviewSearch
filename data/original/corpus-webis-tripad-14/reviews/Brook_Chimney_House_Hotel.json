The room was large and clean and there were no real problems except a lack of a TV control and poor water pressure in the shower. The hotel is a nice building with good grounds but a lot more could have been made of the gardens. It was as if no one looked after the area with inadequate garden furniture - we never saw anyone with a responsibility for the grounds at all. Our dinner was disappointing, especially when you think that they must have qualified chefs. The starter pate was very drab, with slimy onion chutney and solid stale olive bread while in the main course, the breast of chicken was over cooked and hard. The tomato sauce which covered it was mass produced . The sweet course of apple pie probably came in a lorry that morning, and did not leave any lasting memories. Drinks at the table, the wine and the beer especially, were hideously over priced and nothing less than a rip off. All in all, the Chimney House flatters to deceive - it has a lot of potential but someone in charge needs to get a grip.", "title": "Review", "user": "midge43", "date": "June 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 67570047}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Reception staff both incoming and out going very helpful and pleasant.

We moved from another hotel to this one as the previous booking had no room service facilities and we knew we would be returning late each day. The hotel is pleasant and the staff very helpful and friendly. Due to work commitments I only ate breakfast which was fine. We returned late each night to find no room service available. We were promised some warm food (burgers) one night but it didn't happen. The bar had limited drinks available and the night porter didn't know how to change a barrel. We asked if we could watch the cricket in the bar one night but the tv wasn't working. As there are no other leisure facilities it was disappointing The worst thing about the hotel was my room. It was comfortable and clean enough but had a terrible smell. I couldn't decide if it was a smoking room that had never been properly cleaned or if it suffered from damp. There was an airfreshener ( empty) plugged in so the staff clearly recognised the problem. I didn't complain as my colleagues all had similar problems A great shame as the staff were great. A little more attention to detail and effort to accommodate our needs and we would have returned on our next trip. I'm sure the hotel can I'll afford to lose a booking of 15 or so guests over minor details.
