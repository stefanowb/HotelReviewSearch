I chose this one because of the tripadvisor reviews and it's location. Plus last time I got lumbered at another not nearly so good hotel on the outskirts of Leeds. Nothing much to complain about with this hotel.Very central, two minutes from the central station and overlooking city square. Check in was very quick and efficient. I got a room on the 4th floor overlooking the square and very close to the lifts. No problem with noise at all. The hotel as previous reviewers have mentioned is 'very' art deco, which is surprising as it was built in 1936 I believe but very nice in any case. My room was reasonable in size as was the bathroom. Looked as if the bathroom had been renovated not too long ago. Mind you the net curtains could have done with a wash and the window sill was dusty, just minor points. There was internet access although the hotel web site says you get two hours free, if it is then I could not find it, only had full payment options and hotels charging for internet access and local calls always loose points with me as I think in today's times it should be included. had dinner in the main restaurant and it was great. Staff were very good and attentive, food was excellent and prices very reasonable. The same restaurant is used for breakfast and the 'English' from the buffet was one of the best I have come across. I will definitely be using this hotel again on my next business visit in December.

I was between rented properties and needed a bed for the night, and I don't think I could have chosen one more comfortable! We didn't check in until around 5pm, and as we were going back out just an hour later, the staff were quite happy for us to park our car in the drop-off layby outside and keep an eye on it for us rather than taking it straight to the underground car-park. Our room was lovely, well-decorated and comfortable with a fantastic view of City Square. Despite our room being right opposite the lift shaft, there was no excessive noise, either from other guests or the lift itself, all that could be heard was the occassional 'whoosh' when stood in the bathroom! Although quite compact, the bathroom was gorgeous, with a super-powerful shower - which was welcomed after a day shifting boxes! I slept soundly - the bed was perfect - and the full English breakfast included in the room rate and served in the restaurant was very tasty. The staff were wonderfully attentive and friendly, and the hotel was immaculately decorated and furnished with more than a nod to its art-deco origins.
