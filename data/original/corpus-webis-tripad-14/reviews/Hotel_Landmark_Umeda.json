Hostel looking lobby. Very small room even for Japanese standard. They don't even have shower gel in the bathroom (tiny bar soap instead), and shampoo comes in a little packet. Wifi signal in the room can be inconsistent, but they do have a broadband outlet you can plug in your mobile modem. Staff is helpful though. However, the location is great. 5 min walk to the JR station (cut through the Osaka Front mall) or 3 min walk to the subway line. Good restaurant options if walking towards the Hankyu station/ Hep 5 mall area, which is less expensive than the JR station area.", "title": "Good location bare bone business hotel", "user": "AKLVancouver_Canada_", "date": "November 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 185044530}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I absolutely LOVE this hotel. It's about a block from the main train station (with JR lines) and the rooms were huge. They had wired internet access. The rooms were very clean and didn't have any odor.

When we showed up, they made me pay $40 USD extra for the second person. If I had known, I would have just checked in myself and had my wife show up later. You only get 1 key anyway. Anyway, even with the $40 it was still very inexpensive (about $105).
