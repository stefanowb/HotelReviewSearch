However, if I am to pay for a 4.5* hotel, I expect a bit more. The staff at recption was friendly and efficient. The rooms are well appointed but small. As I have a young child, I was annoyed that much of the shelf space in the room is taken up by the stuff for sale that was also within reach of my child. When I requested they be removed to afford more space in the room and less of an attractive nusiance, I was told there would be a $35 charge to do so. The room was mostly clean but a room needs to be FULLY clean. My child was playing on the floor and found a full vial of some type of single dose drug. When I brought it the front desk I was thanked for it. NOTHING FURTHER WAS DONE. Had I not seen my child pull up the mystery vial, I may have been taking a trip to the hospital. THIS REQUIRES MORE THAN A THANK YOU. Had the rooms been properly cleaned, I may have been more impressed with the rest of the place and less upset about the staff's inability to cope with a very upsetting customer experience but..... I might stay here again, but would never pay the standard rate as it is not worth the price. I question the current 4.5* rating. I stay in NYCa great number of nights each year and have had better experiences at a number of other less expensive alternatives.

The hotel faces the entrance to the memorial and be sure to sip at the lobby bar or even better, the outdoor balcony for a superb view of One WTC and the other upcoming WTC towers. Inspite of the the on going construction (which doesn't really bother me) the area is bustling with tourist and within minutes of Soho and lower east side. The WTC subway station is minutes away nearby century 21, or the Lexington line is a couple of blocks on broadway. The 5 th floor lobby is ideal and feels isolated from the main tourist traffic and 9/11 memorial crowd, unlike the other nearby hotels. The wonderful/spectacular rooms are fairly designed and seems normal with enclosed bathroom unlike some of the other Ws. We had a corner room facing south east. The service is just about average and somewhat 'cold' at the front desk, but that didn't really bother me since I'm not a high demanding guest and don't expect too much in terms of service and attention. However, some may find it to be rude and unattentive. At night, ther area tend to be on a quiet side after the memorial closes. Nevertheless, you could gawk at the brightly lighted 1WTC tower from the lobby bar balcony. The lobby has a good selection of costly drinks and nibbles. we we fortunate to have a package deal which offered complimentary drinks. Heading out to nearby soho is about a 15-20 min walk or a short subway ride. I give this 5* Just for the location and property but 4 * for the service. Would consider staying here again when in NYC.
