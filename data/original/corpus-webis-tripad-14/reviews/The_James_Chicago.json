We stayed at James Hotel and it was a wonderful experience. It was close to all the shoppings, resturants, the trains and buses. We only took a cab once to another area and other times, we either walked or hopped on the trains. The staff was wonderful, they cleaned our room at least twice a day. All the equipments at the gym were new and very clean. And you must try the David Burke Prime steak house. We went there on Sunday night and they have the Super Prime Sunday dinner for only $42 per person. It was a four course dinner and it was worth every penny of it. We couldnt even finish it. There is a mini bar in the room but it was pretty expensive. So i suggest you to buy drinks from cross the street where they have a Trader's joe and they have a great selection of wines too. There is also 7/11 on almost every corner. If you are travel by plane and with only couple of people, I don't suggest to rent a car since the parking in downtown is a pain and the parking in the hotel is very expensive. There is a train from the Ohare airport directly to the downtown area. We took the train from and to the airport and very conveninece and inexpensive.
