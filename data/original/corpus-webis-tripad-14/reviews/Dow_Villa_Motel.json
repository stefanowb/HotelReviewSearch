Although the motel is more modern (and more expensive) we like the olde worlde feel that the hotel building has, even though the rooms are rather small and a little basic. Everything was clean and worked well, although the plumbing is clearly elderly. The hotel has been refurbed and smartened up since our last visit. Helpful staff, charming old film memorabilia in the reception areas, a really nice outdoor pool (well fenced in for kids) and all set against the backdrop of snowcapped Sierra Nevada peaks.
