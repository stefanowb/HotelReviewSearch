Instead, our room was small, dark, dingy and it had a faint bad smell. Nor is the breakfast buffet the extrensive buffet the hotel claims. It was a pretty limited affair and we were very turned off by the filthy walls in the dining room by the breakfast area. Moreover, there's no elevator in the property meaning that you have to carry your luggage up the stairs into the hotel and then up to your floor. We could not recommend this hotel and our suggestion woulod be to stay at another property.", "title": "Stay somewhere else", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Coolcoops", "date": "October 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 20534879, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 It's location", "disliked": "\u2014 It's lack of cleanthiness"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "charming place to stay", "text": "If you like bland, characterless, multiple chain hotels, this is NOT for you.
