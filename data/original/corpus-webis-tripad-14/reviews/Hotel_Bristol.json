Power to the room is controlled by inserting your room key into a slot near the room door. There was plenty of closet space, desk area, and lamps for good lighting. Power outlets are also generously positioned throughout the room, and on both sides of the bed. We had a large comfortable double bed (not two beds joined together). The TV was the older tube type but worked fine, with numerous English channels. The balcony has a double glass door which helps to buffer the outside noise.

Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was outstanding, exceeding our expectations!

There are several grocery stores nearby. Some all night stores for snacks and sodas. It is easy to catch an underground train to any part of the city. Walk either direction and there is an underground train station. The nightlife is excellent here, the people were so warm and friendly despite my diverse ethnicity. The breakfast was excellent.
