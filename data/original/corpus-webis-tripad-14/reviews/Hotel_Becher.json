Mossimo (who speaks Italian, German, and English) and Anna at the front desk are the biggest asset to this hotel. Anna showed us 2 rooms at check-in and let us decide between a 3rd floor room or a 1st floor canal view room. After check-in we were given WiFi passwords, breakfast hours (breakfast is free), and scheduling for a free boat ride to the island of Murano. Breakfast has great pastries, salamies, cheeses, yogurts, fruits, and choices of juices and coffees. Hotel is centrally located in the San Marco region. Bathroom shower stall is a bit tight but clean and modernized. Beds are clean and very comfortable. Also the room has a mini fridge to store anything cold, such as waters for the next day's adventures. My wife and I love this place!", "title": "Excellent staff and great location", "user": "M0llyP00", "date": "August 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 138139010}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect Venice", "text": "We stayed at the Hotel Becher for three days from the 16th August 2012. We flew into Venice which was fantastic and then got a water taxi right to the landing of the hotel which was amazing. It was like being on a movie set. The water taxi driver played Italian music as we travelled through the canals to the hotel. The hosts at the hotel were so friendly and helpful and we felt like we were welcomed into Venice as friends and not tourists. We enjoyed our stay in the junior suite, which was a very large room with a balcony overlooking the canal. The landing is on a large canal which is a main canal on the gondoliers route. We enjoyed our Spumante, which was part of a deal in our booking, on the landing, watching the gondoliers pass by. The hotel is in a great position and it was an awesome experience staying here. The young man at the desk (regretfully we are not aware of his name) is so friendly and a great asset to the hotel. On our last day he made sure we had breakfast in the landing, which was very considerate.

However, it was great. Our room was on a second floor overlooking a canal which was awesome. The room itself was ok, nothing special, but it served us well for the 2 nights we spent exploring and enjoying Venice. The breakfast served was nice (although the dining room was so tiny that we felt a little cramped with just another family there), well, something that comes with a boutique hotel, I guess. The hotel location was great - a short, 10-minute walk to St. Mark's Square through a maze of unique narrow venetian streets - an adventure on its own! The hotel staff was very helpful and they gave us great, easy directions to the square. Word of caution - do not deviate from the directions, it's so easy to get lost in Venice .

Pay the extra for the canal view, it was one of our best memories from the trip! Sitting at the window watching gondolas go by, laying in bed listening to them sing in the morning! Ahhhh, Venice, you are amazing! This hotel was THE best location in Venice. In all the twists and tangles of the streets, it was great to have a hotel easy to find because it was pretty close to st. Marks. So if ever lost, follow signs to st. Marks and then you can find your way back! We did lots of hotel research and it paid off! Hardly ever would I want to go back to the same hotel on a vacation, I like to experience different places. But in this case, I would stay here over and over, if ever we find ourselves lucky enough to be in Venice again. Oh, and it was hot hot hot outside, so the cool air conditioning was such a retreat! One night we bought a bottle of Bellini and sat out on the hotels landing on the canal. So romantic! Nice staff too, we arrived way early from our overnight train. They said they would hold our bags, but I felt so gross after the heat and sleeping on the train. Checkin wasnt for another several hours. They let me use the bathroom to wash up a bit, but then thankfully told us our room was ready. I was so thankful that they let us checkin so early! If you are reading this I am jealous, because 1, you must be going to Venice soon, and 2, you are booking hotel Becher now! You will love it!
