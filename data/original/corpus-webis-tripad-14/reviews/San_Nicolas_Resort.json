We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the hotel and the rooms were above average - they were really big with two huge beds. The buffet breakfast on the Sunday was amazing and great value. You choose what food you want and watch the chef cook it. My boyfriend loved it and really made sure he got his value for money by going back for seconds...! The staff were extremely attentive and very friendly. The location is excellent - only a five minute walk to downtown Ensenada. We liked it that the hotel wasn't right in the centre as it would have been quite noisy if it was right in the middle of the bars etc. It is easy walking distance to downtown though and there is no need to get a taxi.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 29, 2005", "id": 3721472}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A fun Place to Visit", "text": "Although the hotel states it is a 'resort' and I guess by definition it is, since it has a pool, spa, restaurant and bar, we didn't feel that we'd like to stay at the hotel for our whole trip since there are much nicer restaurants downtown. Also, the pool was a little unclean and there were lots of noisy kids and very loud (awful) music playing during the day. The hotel was great for a place to sleep and eat breakfast but we wouldn't have been satisfied staying in the 'resort' the whole time. However, as it is so close to downtown, where there are lots of shops, bars and restaurants, it wasn't a problem. All in all, it was a pleasant stay and if we went to Ensenada again we'd happily stay there.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 10, 2004", "id": 2522421}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2004", "text": "The San Nicolas is one of the best places I have stayed in.

The room was clean and rather large. After reading the reveiws of the pool we did not know what to think, however it was clean and looked very well maintained. My wife was able to book a massage under the waterfall by the pool and said it was devine! We ate at the hotel cafe for breakfast and lunch and found it to be above average. The machaca burrito is not to be missed! The staff was very nice and eager to help. The hotel could stand a bit of touch up here and there, but they have done a great job keeping this vintage hotel looking classic.
