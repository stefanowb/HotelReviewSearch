The mini oven/grill looked older than my Grandma so we didn't dare touch that. We also noticed that there was no smoke alarms in the whole of the apartment. We thought we would get a double room but it was 2 single beds pushed together and they were rock hard - we slept on the sofa for 2 nights. The floors obviously hadn't been cleaned as there was hair and sand there from before we arrived. The TV was tiny and reception wasn't brilliant. There was also no wi-fi available. There was a computer available in the reception at a cost of 1 euro for 10 mins.
