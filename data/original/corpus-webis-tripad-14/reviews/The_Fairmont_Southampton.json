The hotel is upscale with a private beach, 2 nice pools and plenty of restaurants on site. Our room had an ocean view with a balcony and was wonderful to wake up to in the mornings. It was a large room with a large bathroom and walk-in closet. Check-in & out was fast and easy. The hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport and a $30 taxi ride. While the hotel is a little far removed from other restaurants/bars there are always taxi\u2019s pulling up and the taxi line moves fast. Most taxi rides were about $10. There is a private beach and tennis courts \u2013 you can hop on a shuttle to take you down there. It\u2019s less than a 5-min ride or an easy walk downhill \u2013 the shuttle is mostly useful for the walk back to the hotel. There is a golf course on site that I didn\u2019t use so I can\u2019t provide an opinion. The private beach is nice but if you ask how to get to Horseshoe bay it\u2019s a 3 min-walk from the private beach, much larger, better sand/water & great caves to explore \u2013 you\u2019d be doing yourself a disservice if you only check out the hotels private beach.

I used to visit family resident in Bermuda many years ago, and know what to expect. I also have the benefit of knowing how to get around and where to eat so I do advise finding out a few things beforehand. I truly love the island and chose the Fairmont because they let us book 2 adults and 2 kids in one room, and because I remember it being very pleasant years ago. It still is and is pretty well maintained in all areas. Its true the pool is small and not that clean looking, but what do you expect? with lots of kids running in, people eating around it and entering without showering. We would never go to Bermuda to use a hotel pool. Our room was very nice, with an upgrade to an ocean view. It was spectacular. Whilst the 2 double beds were too small for us (an issue I mentioned to management and I believe is being dealt with by the arrival of new queen beds), we managed with a rollaway. We go out all the time and just sleep in our hotel rooms so we had no major issues here. Cleaning was more than adequate, but the balcony was not touched during our stay. We did ask and I think it received a cursory sweep. Service can be a little variable, the concierges are overworked but many people spend hours at the desk, draining their time when they could find out a few simple things themselves. I always went when I knew there would be no queues. Afterall, this is a very large hotel. We booked some of our own restaurants but we always found the concierge desk very friendly and helpful. Same for front desk who rushed our check in as our little girl was exhausted and if I had a problem, I managed to resolve it, sometimes with a little persistence (a phone problem and a blocked bath took 2 days at least to sort out). Service was slow one night in Jasmine and the guest relations manager was very receptive to having a chat with me and offered a small gesture. Generally wait staff were very professional. Overall we were very happy with what we got for the price (breakfast package), the food we had - Waterlot is very nice and the setting of the Whaler is gorgeous - the universally kind staff and our stay in general which was memorable. The band in the evenings with Lance on drums was great. The beach is quite nice and I agree it is much more sheltered than Elbow. It gets crowded but we always managed to find a sunbed. You are right next to Horseshoe or you can try out Church for snorkelling or Astwood Cove area. They are all acessible. Insiders have told me that all Bermuda hotels can be a little up and down. I am sure this is true, and the Fairmont Southampton is still one of the better bets, unless you want a simple holiday( go self catering) or a romantic getaway (try boutique).", "title": "The Fairmont was Fine", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "DollyDreamer", "date": "August 30, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5728031, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Many facilities", "disliked": "\u2014 All ok for us"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "We are residents of Bermuda and recently indulged in a weekend at the Fairmont Southampton. The problems started at check-in which was chaotic at best. The lack of service and attention to detail and the general confusion on the part of the front desk staff caused us grave misgivings. Room service breakfast was incorrect and delivered an hour early. The housekeeping person was rude and totally disregarded the do not disturb sign. When calling switchboard to book tables in the hotel restaurants, spa treatments etc, we were placed on hold for long periods and in one instance told \"I'm busy\" and disconnected! The Willowstream Spa was overbooked, and despite charging a $29 admission to hotel guests, we were told no lockers were available. Following discussion we were provided with a locker in a lavatory cubicle located a distance from the spa. A broken coffee pot could not be replaced until other guests had checked out as there were no spares anywhere in the hotel. Checkout was as chaotic as check-in and our bill was grossly over-calculated to the tune of $996. This took ten days to resolve, necessitating repeated telephone calls and a visit to the hotel manager.

Additionally, the long wait times for service weren't really isolated...we experienced this a couple of times, and one would think with high food/drink costs perhaps it would be a little tighter and move a little quicker. Yes Bermuda is expensive and caters to a higher-end crowd, which I don't mind, but certainly some aspects of the resort feel like a cash grab.

I would say I consider myself and family very well travelled, routinely staying at luxury resorts (i.e., Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons) and I have to say we had a great experience from start to finish - very comparable to the other hotels mentioned. We arrived early (hours before check in) but were extremely pleased to find that both of our rooms were ready. I know some of the other reviews mentioned the poor room quality and cleanliness and I have to say our experience couldn't have been more different. Our rooms were beautiful - very big, very clean with an amazing view, I guess we were fortunate in getting one of the renovated rooms. In one of our rooms however, the air conditioning did not seem to be working too well, it was not nearly as cool as the one room and had a slightly musty smell to it. Fortunately, this was the kids room and they didn't seem to mind or complain. I also need to mention the hotel staff - everyone we came in contact with could not have been more friendly or more polite. From the housekeepers, to the pool and beach staff and the restaurant staff - they all went out of their way to be friendly and accomodating especially to our 2 small children ages 5 and 2. They made ourselves and children feel welcome and special. I was especialy impressed with the maitre'd at the Newport Room who went completely out of his way to get us reservations for the following day at the Waterlot when he found out our reservations got mixed up prior to arriving (the reservationist booked us at the Newport Room and Waterlot for the same night in error) leaving us with our last night with no reservations and no openings anywhere. The maitre'd made some phone calls while we were there and said he would get back to us by the end of the night to let us know if he was able to get us a reservation. Sure enough not an hour after we left the restaurant he called with the news that he was able to \"call in a favor\" to the Waterlot maitre'd and got us in at the time and place we wanted. Now that is what I call service! The food was very good at the Waterlot, excellent at the Newport room and fair to below average at Bacci. My only real complaint with the stay besides the food at Bacci, is it is difficult to find chairs and umbreallas at the beach and the pool - unless you are there really early or late is about the only time you'll get to be selective about where you sit. Our vacation at the Fairmont Southampton was extremely relaxing and enjoyable - they are very family friendly without it being or feeling like Disney World.

The lounge upstairs has a good comp. breakfast, lots of snacks in the afternoon and comp. beverages all day. Also 2 computers in the lounge for use. View from all rooms are spectacular on this floor.

The Fairmont Southampton (formerly The Southampton Princess) is a fantastic hotel. From when the bell captain meets you to when you walk into the lobby, you know you are at someplace special. Management has covered all bases. The food is great, the service is second to none, and the rooms a large and the mattress is very comfortable. Bermuda is a beautiful place. The locals are very helpful and understand the value of tourism. The concierge was exceptionally helpful answering all questions and making dinner reservation. They were very happy to make my stay go smoothly. I played golf for 3 days. If you want to play golf at Mid Ocean Club (a must for serious golfers), they allow non members to play on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I was told the concierge will set you up. I was lucky and played Mid Ocean but thru a golf connection. Be sure to join their \"President's Club\". That will get you complementary internet and no charge to the exercise room. I did use www.golfnow.com to make my tee times at Port Royal Golf Club. Port Royal is a beautiful place and the site of the Grand Slam of Golf this year. Needless to say, the course was in great condition and the greens were smooth and fast with no noticeable grain. GolfNow will get you a big discount on golf there. A fellow I shared the taxi with to the golf course made his tee time the same day and paid $100. I made my tee time 4 days early and my fee was $80. It all depends on the weather forecast. I would wait till 1 or 2 days before to make sure the weather is OK. I got caught out in the rain one day and got wet..
