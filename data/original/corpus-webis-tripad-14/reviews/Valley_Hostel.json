Only shared ones per level) but it was so clean & cosy that we didn't really mind.. What makes this hostel just absolutely perfect is the view. I would recommend this hostel to everyone!

The first thing that struck me was the hospitality of Susie (who probably owns the place, forgot to ask her). She makes you feel as if you have come back home. The hostel has a no shoes policy and you have to use slippers provided by them in the premises. Quite an innovative touch to keep the place clean and stink free. The hostel has a stunning view of the Staubach falls and the higher ridges of the Alps in the background. The trip to Murren, Schilthorn, Gimmelwald, Wengen (treks) are highly recommended, they give you uncountable breathtaking views. The hostel has a nice kitchen and dining room. The rooms are basic but very clean and cosy. We stayed in a 5 bed dormitory and it was ideal to relax.
