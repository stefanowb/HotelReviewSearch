The room was large and had a mini-fridge, which is always a nice feature. We didn't have a problem with the noise in this hotel but I could see it being a problem considering the hotel is built in a motel-style way. The pool was a disapointment. It was \"indoor/outdoor\", which ment that half of it was in a building and the other half was outside. Arcata is close to the ocean and doesn't get warm enough to use a pool outdoors, so why not inclose the entire thing and at least be able to use it? Other than that, it was about a five to ten minute drive to downtown Arcada, which is pretty central, and it has a nice continental breakfast. We would probably stay at this hotel again.", "title": "Fine, inexpensive hotel", "user": "dogbone1002000", "date": "August 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8510862, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Room, price and location", "disliked": "\u2014 Indoor/Outdoor pool"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "The rooms were clean and spacious, the complimentary breakfast was great, (lots of variety), but unfortunately, none of us got a wink of sleep.

While the others around it had rooms still. Dollar for dollar it cost more than the others but was nice and worth the extra money. Average BW I spend about $79 to $89 a night, this one was $109, but there is a University 1 exit up and I find that attractions drive $$'s. My room was a king suite with a jacuzzi tub, so I could relax in my room away from all the kids in the public hot tub! The public hot tub was actually hot! Unlike 99% of hotel hot tubs. I like hotels with outside entries so I can park by the door. I carry lots of equipment in my SUV since I am working and like to keep an eye on it! New BW don't build this way anymore (too bad). Unlike 99% of most hotels including this chain this BW had three diferent brews of coffee every morning! THANK YOU!

It reminded me of the hotels across the street from Disneyland. The rooms were decent-sized, and the queen-sized beds very comfortable. TV station selection was generous. The room we had was clean, but had a strong smell of room deodorizer or cleaner. The bathroom was a big disappointment--very tiny, with a closet-sized toilet/shower combination so small that one had to squeeze in to shut the door, or brush against the toilet. The bathroom did have a window, which is a nice feature. The sink was outside the bathroom, at the end of the room. So there was no room to put clean or dirty clothes in the room where you shower, except for the floor, and no privacy for changing clothes. The rollaway bed is VERY uncomfortable--thin wiry mattress on top of a bouncy, wiry cot--my 10-year-old could not get comfortable on the rollaway. The office staff was VERY courteous and helpful--very friendly, a nice touch. The maintenance man was also very visibly active and bright, keeping the grounds and rooms well-maintained. This hotel thoughtfully allows dogs. It is very close to a large strip mall, and I made a late-night run to the store for bottled water in about 10 minutes. Note that the room does NOT have a fridge nor does it have a microwave. Breakfast included coffee and real milk, tea, hot chocolate, instant oatmeal packets, toast, bagels and toaster waffles with butter, cream cheese, peanut butter and jelly. There were also bananas, fresh pears, and apples. I filled up at breakfast. There are trays for transporting breakfast to your room. The pool was a bit dark at night, but the kids had a nice time. Would have been nice to have an outdoor shower at the pool for rinsing off. The office staff offers extra towels at the lobby for pool use. With remodeled bathrooms, this place might be very nice. I actually do prefer the motel setup, as this allows you to park right outside your room. We slept with the window open a few inches; the windows do lock in this position. The hotel was quite full on a Sunday night.", "title": "Okay, except for the bathrooms", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Roadtrippinmom", "date": "October 5, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 2619805}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Found a gem!", "text": "We came to this motel after a bad experience with another one (read review).
