For under $200 in the heart of the CBD, I get a big bedroom, kitchen, comfy living area, laundry in the bathroom and a great balcony. If this were an hotel, I'd be paying $500 for this much space!! So, the reason there is no staff, no mini-bar, no room service, and no fancy foyers and fawning flunkies is that you pay for space not service. That's fine by me - the Oaks 212 is one of the better of these apartments if just a wee bit pricey.
