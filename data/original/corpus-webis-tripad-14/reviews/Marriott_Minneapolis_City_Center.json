The hotel was immaculate, common areas and the room itself! All of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly! The only downfall are the prices in the hotel bar and restaurant, very expensive! It's in a perfect location to walk to any shopping, restaurants, bars and of course the Metrodome! The Light Rail station which you can take to the airport or the Mall of America is only 2 blocks from the hotel and you're a 1/2 block from Nicollet mall! You won't need your car at all during your stay! I would suggest stopping in front of the hotel to drop off your luggage as once you park the car in the parking garage it is quite a walk even though the parking garage is right next door to the hotel. They do charge for parking, $20.00 per night weekdays, $8.00 weekends so remember to add that to your expected costs. They also charge for internet access, $15.00 per day. In the room it is NOT wireless but in the common areas it is. A lot of people like to stay here for the sporting events, Twins and Vikings games. We came for the State Fair concerts.
