The neighborhood is safe and the staff are extremely helpful with all details and excursion planning. One of our bags came late and the hotel picked it up from the airport and delivered it to our room. What a great surprise. The hotel is linked to 5 others and we were given a discount card that we could use at the related restaurants. We found this hotel on trip advisor and were not disappointed.
