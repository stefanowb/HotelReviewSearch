This small one-story motel has average sized rooms, with ac (won't need if you leave the windows open for that nice, cool mountain air), cable TV with lots of channels, and very gracious hosts. (Her flowers are glorious by the way!). However, do NOT expect room service, vending machines, or an ice machines. There are refrigerators in the rooms however. The bathroom is small, but super clean. Tiny cakes of soap are the only bath amenities, so bring your own lotion! Just up the road are a couple of local cafes -- try Jane's Country Cafe. She has great country food and warm, friendly service. Neat little country store next door to that as well.
