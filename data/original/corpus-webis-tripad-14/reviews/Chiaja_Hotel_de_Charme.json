The staff is wonderful and the hotel is interesting and perfectly located. We had a room overlooking the street which was great in the daytime, but unfortunately on a Saturday night is very noisy. If I were staying again (and I definitely would if in Naples again!), I would ask for something not on the street. There are hotels that are more luxurious, but not better located.

The location is perfect for grabbing a taxi to anywhere (such as the museums) or walking through the old center.

The staff members were very nice, helpful and friendly. The hotel promotes and participates in the Neapolitan cultural scene, e.g. hosting poetry readings in the lobby some afternoons, and the place has an intellectual/artsy feel. We loved Naples,which at this point is cleaner than New York City ! (though that's not saying much, admittedly ... ) The black stone streets are just awesome !! It is funky; in that it kind of reminds me of New York before it became fashionable, went yuppie, and was converted into a giant playpen for the super rich (boring). The Archeological Museum was fantastic, and the walk back (the long way) past the Duomo and through the old center on those black stone streets, stopping for lunch and at various churches, was thrilling and took my breath away. The food was also fantastic: best coffee, best pizza, best vongole (pasta smothered in delicious small clams), best baba rum I've ever tasted in my life.
