The people are very friendly and willing to help. It's just too bad these rooms need so much help.

For starters, the hotel is located on the northside of the St. John River, a fair distance from downtown. The hotel is somewhat older but in fairly good condition, likely kept this way by a noticeably attentive staff and dedicated maintenance team. At the hotel's center is a pool/courtyard area. In my own opinion, much of this space appears to be wasted on what appears to be past expectations. The hotel might be better to tear up much of the courtyard (including the pond?) in favor of expanding the pool/water amenities (water slide?). While the hotel makes mention of \"renovations\", it is apparent that they have made some updates to the bathroom vanities, bedding and some room amenities (TVs) but the decor of the hotel still remains to be that of a hotel of the late 1980s/1990s. While the rooms are clean and the bedding was spotless, there are subtle reminders of the hotels age such as the lighting, bath/shower and room climate control (or lack there of). The onsite conference rooms were clean, adequate and in a central location. The onsite restaurant \u201cThe Courtyard\u201d offers good food from a decent menu. If there was one thing that stood out, it was the exceptional staff: the front desk was very friendly (Jillian) and the staff supporting the conference area was quick and prompt. There were many positives but it is worth mentioning that I found the exterior noises to easily find their way into my room, such as kids in the courtyard/pool or a dog in the adjoining room. Aagain, perhaps better room climate control might help drowned out the noise. While I can recommend the hotel, it would be nice to see so additional renovations.", "title": "Fair Stay in Fredericton", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "StandingRoom", "date": "July 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 167398063}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were in an upgraded room and even had a plaque showing 'business class'.", "title": "Staff nice - location bad - hotel needs a lot of work!", "user": "Sarabara999", "date": "July 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 166570436}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel itself is outdated and needs a lot of renovations - seems to be more of a place that hockey teams/families will stay but not a place for couples looking for R&R.", "title": "Not that great", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SaintSparky", "date": "July 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 166497762}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The location is terrible - it is not hear anything but a gas station - you cannot walk anywhere.", "title": "Poor Experience", "user": "Jordyn T", "date": "June 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 165245994}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The staff were very nice and accomodating.
