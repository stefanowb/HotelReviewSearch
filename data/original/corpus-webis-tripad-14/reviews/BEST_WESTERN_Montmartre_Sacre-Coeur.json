The market further north up the BB is fanatastic and a great place to get a slice of Paris life.

Small rooms, we had one of the largest and inside I did not even have enough space to properly open my suitcase..the bathroom was even smaller in comparison, so small that there was no space for the bathroom tissue holder besides the WC and they had to put it BEHIND! Apart from that furniture was good and the room was clean. Breakfast was more than good and respected Best Western standards of full continental buffet. Service varies a lot, according to which receptionist you deal with it. We argued with some of them, while we had a very good treatment from Alexandre, very available and kind guy. The position is good, not in the very heart of Paris, but 10 min away by tube (station was 2 min on foot from hotel's entrance). The very bad thing was the neighborhood. This hotel is on the eastern side of Montmartre hill and this turned out to be one of the roughest places in Paris. We were afraid to stay out until late, so we always dined pretty early, despite our habits.
