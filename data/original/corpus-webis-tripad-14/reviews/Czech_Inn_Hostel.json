It does not feel like a hostel but more like a more expensive hotel or bed and breakfast. The staff is very accomodating and helpful with city information. The rooms are exquisitely designed and very comfortable. It is impeccably clean and has a feeling of freshness. While many would associate hostels with youth travelers, as a 40 ear-old traveler it was a very comfortable stay. The bar/cafe has 6 beers on tap and this is quite the exception for bars in Czech. Normally one only finds 2 choices and in many cases only one local brew is the offering. There are computers available with internet access for a very modest fee. Wi-fi is free for those with their own electronic devices. I would recommend the Czech Inn to all who are looking for an upscale stay, even if you are on a tight budget as the cost is well within the range of travelers with a frugal mind. Even if cost is no issue, this place is definitely worth staying.

We are actually trying to find similar showerheads for our shower back home! The bar downstairs was cute and when were we there they had a comedian performing (not that funny but still a fun night).
