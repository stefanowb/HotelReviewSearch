The hotel is a good value for the money but the location is not for everyone. It is down Soi 11 where there is a lot of nightlife. If you want to party while in BKK then this is the place to stay. I checked in here as a place to stay for a few hours as my flight left early in the AM and I wanted to stay at an inexpensive Starwood Property. I prefer the Four Points Sheraton on Soi 15 over this Aloft. The hotel is almost at the end of the street which makes the walk to the BTS longer than I would want if I was to stay here while exploring Bangkok.

Plug ins for everything and Nickelodeon and Disney channel for the kids - Yea! Most hotels have only cartoon network or nothing. Rooms and furnishings are very modern, clean and nice looking. Ours was also very quiet. They have a small quickie shop in lobby where you can but a drink or snack and go - restaurants I did not try but they looked great. They have a billiards room and Mac computers everywhere. A night club/bar as well. Room service was fast but menu is limited - especially for breakfast options. The hotel tuk tuk is easy and we never waited more than a few minutes. Had a few glitches with phone not working in room but staff couldn't have been more helpful and kind. Very impressed with staff quality and responsiveness. Very professional staff and just falling over themselves to help us with anything and everything - a rare thing any where these days - can't say enough about the service here.
