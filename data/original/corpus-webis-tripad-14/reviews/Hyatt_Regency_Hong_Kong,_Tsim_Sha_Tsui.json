The bathroom is spacious and has a nice assortment of toiletries. The room has great block-out curtains to ensure a sleep in and very effective air conditioning. The gym is obvisouly housed in what used to me a couple of rooms. It has a great assortment of new machines and space to do some floor exercises. There is an outdoor heated pool with a wonderful deck area. I ate dinner in Hugo's Restuarant (which was exceptional) had a drink in the bar (Chin Chin's) which has an excellent ambience and live band later at night and had breakfast which offered a nice buffet and eggs cooked to order. Above all the service was terrific. For example, when I went doen for dinner I was advised that the group I was meeting had gone down to the bar for a pre-dinner drink.
