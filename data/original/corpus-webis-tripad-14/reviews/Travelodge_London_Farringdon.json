This is a Travelodge. In Central London. It cost me \u00a359 on a flexible (cancellable) rate. You are not going to find a 4 star hotel at this price in this location. Ever. This hotel was perfect for what we needed: a place to crash after a Christmas party. We checked in on a Friday afternoon about half an hour before the official check-in time and at no extra cost. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were given Room 122 (first floor at the front of the building direclty opposite the lifts) which was clean. The bathroom was minuscule but I wasn't planning a night in with a relaxing bath so this wasn't a problem. We spent most of our time out so the room itself wasn't important. More important to me is the location; because of where the hotel is situated we were able to walk to and from everywhere we needed to get to including Clerkenwell, Russell Square, St Pancras and Euston. We were very late back so I don't know what night time noise was like but from about 8am I started to hear the lift noise and people talking outside the room but that's to be expected with a room directly opposite the lift. The traffic noise didn't bother me too much, neither did the slight rumbling from the tube. It's central London - what do you expect?
