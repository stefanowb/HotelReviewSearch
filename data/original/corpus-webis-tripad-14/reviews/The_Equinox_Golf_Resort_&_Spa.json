Really cute bar with some live acoustic music. We got up on Saturday and went skiing at Bromley which is about 10 minutes from the resort. Stratton is just a few minutes further. We then had dinner at the Reluctant Panther which is located next door. We had an amazing meal and a great waiter. On Sunday, we did the Land Rover Experience at the resort. We went on our tour with our guide, Rick who was very knowledgeable and friendly. It was a really neat experience for my husband and I and we would recommend it to others looking for something different to do. We also did some outlet shopping. There are some really great stores such as Theory, Kate Spade, J Crew, Giorgio Armani, etc and the shopping is only a couple minutes away. All and all, the service was top-notch and the hotel is beautiful. The remodeled rooms are very nice. We didn't think the beds were that comfortable and the down comforters seemed a little small (one of us was always cold). Small glitch in our trip, but otherwise fabulous.

Although there are plenty of places to eat within Manchester, the pub is worth a visit for a drink and maybe a nibble or two off the delicious, but very filling cheese plate. The service in the hotel is good - all the staff are pleasant and helpful. My only complaint is that we were placed in a room two floors above the air conditioning unit which could still be heard from the 2nd floor. We had originally been placed on the first floor and were moved to the 2nd after we complained. The hotel should look into finding a quieter air conditioning unit. Still, it wasn't such a distraction that it had an impact on the pleasure of our stay. If you are going to Manchester, the Equinox is the place to stay.

We had a large room (king bed) on the first floor overlooking the center \"backyard\" of the hotel. The bathroom was also very large with ample vanity space. Both rooms were clean and the bath well stocked with plenty of towels. We were right near the SPA building and there are several entrance/exit doors so access to other areas of the property is easy. The SPA is fantastic. If you stay here and don't take advantage of any services here, you are wasting your stay. At the hotel, The Marsh Tavern was nice (we just had drinks here) and breakfast in the Colonnade Room was good, nothing spectacular, but a great selection.

This was the case at the Equinox. Jerry, our porter, gave us an exceptionally warm and friendly welcome, but one star to the woman at the desk who explained we had been assigned from our original room to a \"nicer \" one! Not the case. Next to the elevator does NOT constitute a quiet location. Location DOES make a difference when staying at an old hotel. I would NOT recommend accepting rooms 108-140. Nearly every other guest in the hotel will have to walk by your room to get to theirs or the elevator, and it's very noisey! Even on a higher floor, we could hear the people on all sides of us much more clearly than was comfortable. If there are children in any adjacent room, immediately ask for a room change if you wish for a peaceful stay. The room was ordinary in size, but it was very clean with the necessary ammenities. The townhouses are larger with kitchens, but NO ambience. I saw no evidence of the dirty, run-down facility another reviewer mentioned. Everything was exceptionally well-cared for especially the grounds. No, the mirror ISN'T in the bathroom which means it doesn't fog up and allows the user privacy from someone using the water closet! This is, in my opinion, a good thing. This is not a hotel for city folk who want all the bells and whistles. It's old; it has charm, ambience, history, and some of the problems that are associated with an older hotel. There are lots of restaurants in the area, and I would recommend trying them. Food at Equinox did not impress. High-end outlet shopping is great, and the golf course is beautiful. There are some great experiences available such as the falconry school or Land Rover adventure, and there are many wonderful photo opportunities for shutterbugs.
