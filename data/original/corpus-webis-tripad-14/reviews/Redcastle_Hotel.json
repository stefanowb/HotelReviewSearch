This trip was with my 4 month old son. It was an ideal break for us with a few families about, so we felt comfortable with a baby. Pool was great, we went during kids hours so lively. My husband and I stayed here 7 years ago and enjoyed the pool and spa during the adult only hours. On this trip we still felt like we were in a spa hotel which comfortably allowed children. Our package included dinner which was very nice. Buffet breakfast was sufficient. Very nice walk along sea from moville to greencastle. Only complaint was no AC during very hot weather, but remote location allowed windows to be left open.", "title": "good for young family", "user": "caitni2000", "date": "July 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 168903810}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Recently stayed 1 night for a break with 2 friends midweek. We booked 1 night b&b with spa treatments & an evening meal which we were all really looking forward too. On booking my friend asked for a room for the 3 of us but was told they didn't have a room suitable but we could have a suite & an extra bed would be put in room for us. My friend did confirm that it would not be a camp bed, which the receptionist confirmed it was not. So we booked our spa treatments the week before, first treatment at 2pm but on arrival we were told we could not check in to our room until 3pm even though they knew we had treatments from 2pm and it was hardly busy. Hotel setting is lovely but there is very little to do in the area. We eventually got key for room at 2.45 which was large and looked recently decorated but surprise surprise there was a camp bed! Duty manager was sent up to meet us in the room after we complained to reception but his attitude was very unprofessional even though we pointed out that the bed was too small for an adult, not enough towels etc. The room was a bit grubby including bathroom shower tiles, toilet etc. Housekeeping staff were asked to sort out a decent bed by manager which they did with an attitude. As for the spa its not sound proofed so you can hear everything outside the treatment rooms including screaming children. We were given shabby, discoloured gowns that didn't fit any of us and when we went to use the pool/sauna area it was full of kids in for swimming lessons. Female changing room was packed with kids including young boys (7+), who to us were old enough to use male changing area. No privacy! Definitely not a spa hotel and apart from a few members, staff were very unprofessional, cheeky & over familiar. Evening meal was good & the waiter was lovely but the dinning room is shabby & dated. The bar area has no atmosphere & we ended up sitting in lobby with our drinks. Would not recommend this hotel for relaxing spa treatments & definitely not up to 4 star hotel standard.", "title": "Definitely not 4 star!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dacocobear", "date": "July 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 168623517}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a really lovely hotel, I think this is the third time we have stayed and I should think we will be back in the very near future.

There were quite a few families with young children but it was very quiet. The rooms are very comfortable and even though our room was on what they called 1st basement we still had a beautiful view of Lough Foyle.
