The weather is so nice there you could just walk right in, some nights the pool almost felt like a hot tub! Casita also has a TV & phone (the GB cottages don't).

Maybe I can do more after? As they'll best describe Casita. We were never too hot, it has 3 patio doors & numerous windows. The breezes were plentiful, we never used the ceiling fans either. Our stay was end of April, beginning of May. This also was a good time for no bugs. Mosquitoes love me & always find me, so I had 2 bites - but for a whole week, that's amazing for me. Their mosquitoes are about half the size of ours? Casita has a full kitchen, with a fabulous Oster beehive blender that we used nightly for icy fruity rum drinks (yum! :) The fridge has an ice maker & ice packs. We had a cooler to use - which was wonderful. 2 jugs of water were in our fridge when we arrived & we just kept refilling those with tap water, it taste fine & obviously safe to drink. I always travel with empty Gatorade bottles, love their easy drink tops. We filled those with drink crystal packets we brought from home & we'd be set for liquids for our days at the beach. Brought a bunch (20) granola bars from home & they helped a lot too. Made breakfasts in our Casita, enjoyed on our patio by the pool. Had a lunch or two & a couple dinners on our front patio with views of the ocean. The bread at the commissary made lovely french toast. We didn't buy milk, hey when the rum is cheaper, you go with it! There was some olive oil in our cupboard so I used that in the frying pan, so just bought the bread, eggs & syrup. The Casita is pretty much a foot ball throw to Mad Dogs, seriously THAT close! Meaning the Top of the Baths restaurant is also right there.
