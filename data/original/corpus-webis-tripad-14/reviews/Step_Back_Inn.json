At the time we really needed to stop for the night while exploring the Northwest corner of New Mexico. But while the reviewer found \"Victorian charm\", plate-sized danishes and interesting local history booklets, we found a mediocre-to-good motel experience barely surpassing the budget chains. The differences in opinion may be because the reviewer is a native of New Mexico. Could the mere inclusion of wallpaper have been enough to send her over the edge? Sure enough, it was practically the only wallpaper sighted in nearly 10 days of travel, so we can see why it might arouse curiosity and admiration.To us New Englanders, the vinyl-coated wallpaper seemed dingy and non-descript. It might have helped had they papered all four walls. The local history booklets were perfunctory at best and dog-eared. The reviewer also praised the Inn because it is an architect designed building, but again we were mystified.

Not only is it stepped back a little from the busy road, hence quiet, it is also a step back in time in the way it is presented. Although the building structure seems modern, the decor is tastefully period, with quality furnishings. I actually sampled 3 rooms as the wifi link doesn't reach all the way to the back, but the staff were excellent in the way they put themselves out to get this right for us.
