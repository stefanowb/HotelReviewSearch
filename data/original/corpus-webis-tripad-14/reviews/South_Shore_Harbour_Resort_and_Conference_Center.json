The resort itself, while clean was very dated and needs serious updating in the guest rooms. The hallway carpet has a very 1970's look to it in patterned aqua, puke yellow and puke green tones. The hallway walls a similar puke yellow color. When the elevator door opens to that.......yuch. Great balconies and view but no furniture to sit on the balcony. Old furniture, linens, tvs. Rooms very dimly lit. Thermostat was on 60 when we arrived and difficult to get to a normal temp - had to call the front desk and have someone come up.

The staff were very accommodatiing. Late Sunday evening while sitting in the lobby, it was apparent we were cold, a staff member on another task, stopped and ask if we needed a blanket. The breakfast served in the Paradise Reef was excellent and the waitress/staff were constantly tending to our needs. The pool was huge and rival those in Carribean Resorts.

I was worried because of so many negative reviews, but I didn't find anything wrong with the hotel. The front desk looked to be pretty busy when we checked in ( I snuck a peek at a clip board and could see there were several large parties/weddings going on that same night at the hotel) and they were very accomodating when I requested a room change a few minutes later because we wanted a King bed. Our room was nice, clean and spacious. The party we attended was in a nice sized space one floor down from the lobby right next to the pool area and was set up very nice. The finger-food spread was also very nicely displayed and tasty too. There was also a cash bar...but you had to first buy drink tickets and then walk those tickets 2 steps over to the bar to get your drink...I thought that was a little weird and unecessary, but I'm sure they have their reasons for that. Our room came with a complimentary breakfast buffet in the morning which was quite good. I chose to have an omelette at the omelette station...there were tons of igredients to choose from there. I also had some fruit and cheese from the buffet. Everything tasted really good and was set up in a fairly nice setting so I was completely satisfied with that. We did sit at the lobby bar for a bit after we checked in...bartender was very friendly and attentive to our group and the drinks were good!

The breakfast buffet eggs were disgusting - I don't think they were even real eggs. All the ketchup or hot sauce in the world couldn't make them taste even good enough to gag down and all together it was just overpriced. I tried to eat even a waffle with syrup and it didn't even taste good. Waste of $15. Yes, $15 for a breakfast buffet. The Hotel is NOT within walking distance from ANY restaurant or fast food joint. You have to call a cab (which takes 20 minutes just to pick you up) or get the shuttle to take you (up to a 45 minute wait). Walgreens was the closest thing to walk to, so we went & got protein bars & crackers to snack on. The second day we were there the only thing offered for lunch was a $12 buffet. You couldn't order anything ala carte and there are no other restaurants in the hotel to choose from. We were stuck. I ended up paying $12 for mashed potatoes and rolls (carb city!) That didn't include a drink either! The hotel bar is waaay overpriced for drinks & they close at 10 pm every night. One bartender, no waitresses or waiters. The hotel 'club' is upscale, pricey & also closes at 10 pm, so if you are having a good time, you should just pay for a cab to take you to kemah (about 10 mins away) and stay all night. I had to call maintenance the night we got in due to insufficient plumbing - I didn't even go #2 & it was starting to overflow. the maintenance guy was quick, but said there was a 'trick' to flushing and taught me how to do it. seriously. the 3 hour dinner cruise booked through the hotel was awful - buffet style food & they made us line up single file to get our food. 150 people being served on a hour cruise buffet style is not ok. There were people still eating when the cruise had already docked. internet access is $9.95 per 24-hour period and didn't work half the time we were there and the staff didn't care & we were not offered refunds. Overall, the location of this hotel is just not good if you are traveling without your own or a rental car. Do not depend on the shuttle to take you anywhere & cabs cost a fortune. At least one of the ladies in our group had her stuff 'rifled' through between the time she left to go get a 'to go' breakfast and the time she returned. none of the maid staff speaks english. The 'fitness center' was about 1/4 mile away & you had to pay $5 to use it every day. To me, the hotel is guilty of false advertising when it comes to their fitness center - it's not even at the hotel & having to pay for something they claim is part of the hotel is ridiculous.", "title": "Better than a hotel on the highway", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MsTexasTraveler", "date": "October 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 46569333}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Our High School Class held a reunion here on Sept. 4 & 5, 2009.
