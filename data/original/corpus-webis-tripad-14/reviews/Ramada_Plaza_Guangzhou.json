Lobby is very upscale with marbles and glass elevators. Rooms are clean and modern, not overly big [normal for big city, downtown hotels]. Free intenet access in room. One unique feature is the bathroom had a giant picture window looking into room [between room and bathroom]. I had never seen this before, if you sit in the room you could see everything happening in the bathroom, or if you sit on the toilet you could see the whole room. Not a big deal if you are solo in room. Of course there was a huge shade you could pull down for privacy, but maid always had it up.", "title": "Clean and Modern, Good for Business Stay", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "gtpatton", "date": "October 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6020631, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean and Modern, Internet Access", "disliked": "\u2014 No neighborhood to walk around in."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled on business", "text": "The biggest negative to this Hotel is the neighborhood, or lack of neighborhood. It is not \"downtown\" where you can walk around the neighborhood to shops, malls, tourist sights, etc. It is on very busy road/highway that cannot be crossed by foot, and backside is up against a hill, virtually no neighborhood. This is just fine for business travelers who's primary focus is to get to trade show or meeting, and come home and wind down. But for tourist, I would pick somewhere else in city.", "title": "Very good hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "DLM107", "date": "September 29, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5890654}], "location": {"country": "China", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Guangzhou"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 25, "very good": 95, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 38}, "aka": "Ramada Plaza Guangzhou Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.047619047619}
