Staff is very friendly, location is good. Walk of fame is in a walking distance and Universal City is 20min.away by metro which is very close to the hotel. We have seen most of the places by using public transportation and managed to go either by metro, bus or both. Plus the room was very very clean. We experineced only two drawbacks: First one is lack of beacon lamp in the room. There are two floor lamps in the room which were not enough to illuminate. Secondly, although i have requested to stay away from the jakuzzi and in the second floor, we have stayed right in front of the jakuzzi in the first floor and it was too noisy especially at nights. The engines of the mechanism to heat the jakuzzi makes too much of noise right in front of your room and adding the laughters, chats and making fun of people among each other does not help when trying to sleep or rest.", "title": "worth the money", "user": "nurcel", "date": "May 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 160264451}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here two nights for a family vacation prior to a cruise.

We had four rooms in total and each person was pleased with the hotel and would definatley stay there again. Also a nice pool area was a bonus. Two went to a Dodgers game and found that very easy to get to via a special bus that goes right to the stadium. The location was easy to visit tourist spots such as universal, stars walk of fame, etc. Starbucks and Ralphs grocery store were just a few steps away and the subway was the next street over. We called for a car service to get to us to the port and they sent two vans for us. The driver gave us such a great tour on our way to the port that we called her when we completed the cruise to take us to our hotel and then another tour! That wasd A-1Express Shuttle.
