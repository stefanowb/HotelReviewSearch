We went as a large family during Christmas season. This hotel may not be as impressive on the ouside as it shines on the inside. The hotel staff was quick to respond to any question or need. My kids needed more towels after swimming and in less than 2 minutes, they were in my hands. They have fresh water and towels in the front lobby for the early morning joggers. Shoe shine service when your shoes become dirty from city walking, and my children's favorite treat - bathrobes and water toys for the children. I was also immensely impressed with the phone reservation department and the manager.
