We always rent a car and take side streets to Disneyland but I understand they have a shuttle that will take you there.

First of all, I have stayed at this hotel before with my entire family and our pets. Yes, the hotel staff was nice enough to accomodate our needs, and they do allow pets! We stayed for 2 weeks while escrow was closing on our home. We felt completely comfortable, loved the buffet breakfast every morning, and enjoyed our room which was right next door to the (then) manager. He was a world traveler and the nicest man you could meet. We also enjoyed happy hour because they had snacks for the kids and a pool table. The lounge was comforting, relaxing and had plenty of room. All of the guests seem to be enjoying themselves, just like we were. We spent time at the pool which was perfectly heated, and also utilized the gym. It was never crowded.

I learned that he was no longer there, I was in some rude way, assisted by the night Supervisor named Jack [--] who had a sarcastic smirk I wanted to mop off of his face. He led me to \"the only room he had\" which was directly facing the freeway. I had informed him that I desperately needed sleep and I did not want to see or hear the freeway. He was quite robotic and cared nothing about what I needed or asked for. We quickly went back to the front desk where I had him double check to make sure he didn't have anything else. Without him even gazing at the computer, he told me no, then asked me to calm down. I was as calm as a cucumber, nevertheless, he called security. The security guard came over and looked as if he had no idea what he was needed for. I simply walked away with no need for security.

I asked the front desk, she said they dont have any available queen suites rooms left.

One elevator was broken 3 of the four days we were there, which made wait times long with no stairs in site. The rooms were just ok as well as breakfast.
