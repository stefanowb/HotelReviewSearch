Our experience was not as we expected. Our arrival time was 01.30am 21/11/11 but the The Sanctuary did not book us in until 2.30pm so there was a heated discussion about that which ended up with us being put into a garden view room which the porter expalined was a store room. Room would at best be classified as 2 star. Later in the day we asked to speak to the manager and was told to wait and she would see us in 15 minutes. After half an hour we left without seeing anyone. We received our prebooked room at about 2.00pm in the Sanctuary. Room was large enough but in the same decor as the storeroom we slept in the previous night. The beachfront room was more of a beach view room and if the large bush outside our room had leaves on it then that is all we would have seen. There was a dirty towel in the wardrobe when we arrived and was still there when we left. Room cleaniless was average not five star. Restaurants were average and the food was average. The grounds outside the rooms were overgrown with weeds and with soem cigarette butts and old rusty bottle tops around. Staff were friendly except the reception staff on our arrival who could not understand that an arrival time at 01.30am was just that and not the 2.00pm they said it meant.", "user": "BexJesse", "date": "December 5, 2011", "id": 121432348}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were unsure what to expect having read some not so positive reviews but by the end of our holiday we couldn't fault the hotel or the staff.
