We returned just last week and have had the best and most relaxing holiday anywhere. Yes, the hotel is on the main road that leads out of the town, and like every other road on the coast - has no pavement and is on a bend, and yes you have to be careful crossing to get to the pool. What an amazing pool though, meticulously clean, lovely service by Peppe, and you can get drinks and snacks from him, you don't need to go into town. The room we had was beautiful, with great air conditioning, much needed, and kept very clean by the lovely and friendly staff. The food was great, we were half board and had a 4 course meal every night. We got to know all the staff who treated us with affection and respect, and we had a giggle with them. The courtyard is a wonderful place for your pre dinner G&Ts. My only point would be, maybe avoid July, there's lots of weddings there which means you might be restricted some evenings in the restaurant and courtyard. And the rooms at the front aren't the quietest during the day due to the Vespas tooting their horns on the hairpin bends. But, so minor. I'd go back tomorrow.......", "title": "Wonderful wonderful Amalfi!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "sophieb", "date": "August 3, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3733692}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Our room was small but well-appointed, and stylishly decorated.

I was very excited, the website looked great. Amalfi itself is rather lovely. We arrived. We checked into our room, which was very plain but it faced out towards the sea (and the main road) so we felt it was OK. We changed, and decided to go down into Amalfi - a five minute walk down the main road outside the hotel - to get a newspaper. Standing outside, it became apparent that there was no pavement, just the road, which is barely wide enough for 2 cars. I went back up to reception and asked if there was any other way down into town - 'No' I was told, rudely. And then the nightmare began. My boyfriend, walking back up towards the hotel, found himself crushed between a truck and the railings on the side of the road, because the truck did not see him and drove into him as he was trying to get past a car coming the other way. My boyfriend screamed, I thought he had been cut in half. Cue blood everywhere, huge crowd, boyfriend on ground, Italian ambulance arrived, we were rushed to hospital. Stitches and xrays later (and very nice hospital staff) we were driven back to the hotel, boyf feeling very shaky.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "bilbaoboy", "date": "February 24, 2005", "id": 3228988}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A little Tired but then again, so is the Amalfi Coast", "text": "Police accompanied us and proceeded to tell the reception staff what had happend.

People, we are seasoned travellers. We are young. We look after ourselves.
