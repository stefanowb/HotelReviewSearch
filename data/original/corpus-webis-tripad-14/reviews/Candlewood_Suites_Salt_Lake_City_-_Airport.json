This hotel really needs some work, especially when it comes to serivce. Several things in the hotel did not work properly. We booked our trip through a last min vacation package service and the room came with 1 queen bed bed. I had called earlier in the day and asked if there was a room with 2 double beds available, she said yes there were plenty available and we should just ask for one at check in. Well of course when we got there the desk clerk said they could not change the room because it was pre-paid and there were just not enough double bed rooms to spare, or even a cot to spare. The hotel looked at most half full. Second, since this is a extended stay hotel ( which we didnt know) they do not do made service and will not even bring towels if you need extra. Even when I went to the front desk they gave me a hard time about extra towels, saying I should have hung them up. The second morning there was not hot water at all in the hotel. They said they had a mechanic on the way over, but gave no estimate of when they would be there. So had to go showerless most of that day since we were leaving early to go skiing. The remote control on the TV did not work, and they had no extras. One postive thing about this place were the kitchens and the size of the rooms. That at least made the space issue a little better. The rooms were clean enough when we got there as well. This hotel just needs to get alot better with customer service. I would advise trying one of the other many airport hotels around SLC.", "title": "Kinda Lousy....", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "icem2829", "date": "January 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6611097, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Kitchens in the rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 lack of service and hot water."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good value", "text": "Very clean, very comfortable rooms at a good price.

Since we function on opposite shifts, we got a 1 bedroom suite. The bedroom was a genuine room, with a door that shut! Bathroom was king-size! Appreciated the two TVs. The kitchen had everything we needed: full size fridge with icemaker, microwave, all utensils. There is a free laundromat on the premises. Another convenience is the Candlewood Cupboard, which offers snack and convenience foods on the honor system. The hide-a-bed in the livingroom had the typical thin mattress, so an air bed or foam pad on top of it would help. The hotel is easy to get to from I-80 and North Temple, and is close to the airport. We didn't notice a lot of airport noise. We'll definitely stay here when we visit Salt Lake!", "title": "Great value, plenty of room!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "IdahoPug", "date": "September 21, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3927172}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Salt Lake City"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 7, "very good": 23, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 22}, "aka": "Candlewood Suites Salt Lake City - Airport Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.526315789474, "description": "Come and experience our new Comforts of Home\u2122 Bedding Collection.
