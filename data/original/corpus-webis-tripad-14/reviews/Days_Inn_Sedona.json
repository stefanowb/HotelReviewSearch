Definitively a good deal. Sedona can be pretty expensive. The front desk lady was very helpful with information about were to go and what to do. We went to lunch at a 4 star hotel. Gallery at Oak Creek. The food was not interesting and extremely expensive for the very limited menu. After looking at the hotel we were glad we did not waist our money. Our pool at the Days Inn was nicer and larger but their setting was nicer and in down town. Stay away from this terrible 4 star restaurant. Definitively take both of the trolleys. We also took a balloon ride. Despite the pictures on the advertisement brochures they do not go into the mountains. They all go away from them. This is a bit of misleading advertisement.

I went down right after it began and there were about 20 people already there. There are only 4 small tables though, so I had no place to sit and ended up taking my breakfast back to the room.
