My room had an awesome view of the canal. The tram is right down the street and can take you anywhere in the city. The only negative part was the price of incidentals -- 100 euros for a week of internet access, six euros for a can of Pringles in the minibar, etc...the hotel seems to take advantage of the fact that it gets many business travelers with expense accounts, but it made it difficult for me traveling on my own dime. Nevertheless, it's a very luxurious place, with great service. I would definitely stay here again. I really enjoyed being in a more residential, quiet area of town, with easy access to the rest of the city.

The quality of the accommodation and furnishings is very good but unfortunately the service is not. One day I experienced a number of problems in a row and although in themselves they were not large, the attitude of Management and response was appalling. In essence, they felt they had not caused any of the problems and where they felt they fell down (very late room service) they believed that if they provide a meal free of charge, this resolves the situation. Most service people recognise that the solution is not a free meal but steps to ensure this does not happen again. In any case, a free meal is of no use to a traveller who wishes to eat before 9.30pm and go to sleep after a long day that started at 5am but was served after that time. In addition, re. the non-functioning TV, I was first accused of not knowing how to switch it on (after 8 months of stay) and then of causing the problem in the first place. Suffice to say, great hotel if you don't mind being insulted or offended.
