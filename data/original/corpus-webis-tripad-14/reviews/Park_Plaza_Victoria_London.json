Had lunch at Wetherspoons pub 2 minutes from hotel, service there was excellent, and food well priced. Then got taxi to Piccadilly which only cost \u00a39. Show was excellent and we finished up dining at the Michelin Star Criterion Restaurant in Piccadilly, \u00a324 pp for a 3 course meal from their set menu which was great value for money. Bus 38 back to Victoria station which is then a 3 minute walk to the hotel, a great day and night was had!
