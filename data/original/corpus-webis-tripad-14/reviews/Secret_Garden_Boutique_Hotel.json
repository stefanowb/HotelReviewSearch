On the subject of food we were more than pleasantly surprised by the quality of cooking but with hindsight given that much of the produce was very local it may be expected.

The hotel is set in breathtaking scenery in a traditional stone courtyard building in a rural village. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the building has been beautifully and sympathetically restored. You really feel in harmony with your surroundings, a visitor rather than a tourist. The view is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, and only a short walk from the river where you can take a raft or ride a bike - there is so much to see and do. The old village is surrounded by rice paddies and fish ponds with ducks, kumquat and pomelo orchards, rows of neatly planted vegetables, chilli bushes and fruit trees. The food at the hotel is fantastic, wonderful breakfasts with fresh ingredients and home cooking, and at night some of the most delicious Chinese food I have eaten, especially the spicy Sichuan dishes. The rooms themselves were tasteful, spacious and very comfortable, and toasty warm even though it was just a few degrees outside. The owner was so helpful in arranging taxis for us into nearby Yangshuo and in recommending places to walk and visit. We visited in the down season, when it was very cold, but we would love to return in warmer weather.
