Chipping Campden is spectacular and it looked and felt very splendid in the last good weekend of the Autumn. The hotel is lovely, sort of faded in places, but overall a very nice feeling. Our room was a little care-worn, but immaculately clean - a nice big bed! The evening meal was nice, served in a specially set-aside room for my birthday clebrations. The staff were very attentive and extremely helpful. Breakfast was quite nice, but not the best Full English I have eaten, Unfortunately the whole building very hot and we found it difficult to lower the temperature - we left our window open overnight , and being on the front of the building we suffered a lot of late night and very early morning noise. Parking arrangements are a bit stressful. Unfortunately a selfish guest parked across the entrance and my son ruined a brand new tyre negotiating a sharp pavement. The duty manager was very helpful and kindly offered a \u00a350 discound towards the cost of a replacement tyre: this was a very kind gesture.

The room was very pleasant with five star fixtures e,g. B&O TV, luxurious soaps and gels etc. However the water system was noisy and the decor beginning to get tired. First night we ate in The Grill as the restaurant was closed. The food was OK - somewhat \"fine dining\" - in other words fancy and small portions. Breakfast was a real disappointment on the first morning. Full English served with streaky bacon that was far from crisp! Second morning was a little better. The second evening we ate at the company's second hotel across the road - The Noel Arms. This was altogether a better dining experience.

Nice weather enabled us to enjoy a bottle of champagne sitting on the balcony (and indeed in the enormous bath!) before dinner at the Grill. Food was good and the restaurant staff attentive. Cleanliness was spot on and our bed was turned down each night with water replenished and towels checked.
