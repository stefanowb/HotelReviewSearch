As we checked in (having left the car in the Sofitel car park) we were told that we could park in the Novotel car park, which was convenient - and I don't recall being charged. The hotel is away from the City Centre, but the walk takes about 15 minutes. The Suitehotel/ Suite Novotel concept is one that not all guests will like. I quite like it - a spacious room with a double bed and a sofa bed with a fridge and microwave in the room. The wifi was free and worked perectly well. The hotel was not cheap, but the staff were pleasant and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was a slightly curious affair, but overall the stay was good.", "user": "Hampshire-resident", "date": "July 16, 2011", "id": 115428436}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Room for improvement", "text": "I stayed here for one night only in May 2011.

Breakfast was interesting. They come in small plastic tubs. Although they were very tasty, I didn't appreciate how environmentally unfriendly they were! That's the only complaint from me.
