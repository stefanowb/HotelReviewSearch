The room was very nice, the views stunning, the pool area nice and the hotel itself beautifully decorated. The town of La Bisbal is only a short drive away and well worth visiting as are the numerous villages scattered around (Monells, Corca, Peratallada, Pals to name just a few). The negatives were mainly due to the service. There were 2 weddings whilst we were staying, as the outdoor part of the restaurant had just been renovated so I think this was a new experience for the staff, and they found it difficult to cope with those and the other hotel guests. We had lunch without making a reservation (why would you when you're lounging by the pool) and we actually thought the waiter was going to refuse us initially! In general, they looked a bit flustered and things became a little slow, but maybe with more experience they'll cope better. to precis great hotel in a stunning location, with service that's needs a little bit of attention, especially considering the price", "title": "stunning views, great hotel, service a bit erratic", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cudders01", "date": "July 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 114923562}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed at Castel D'Emporda for fou nights in April.
