As a frequent visitor to Yellowstone, where Xanterra is also the exclusive concessionaire, I was not surprised by the un-frilly but clean and sufficient accommodations at Furnace Creek Ranch. The room was good-sized, and our nights there were quiet (thanks more to well-behaved neighbors rather than soundproof walls, I suspect). Our room had two queen beds, utilitarian d\u00e9cor, TV with HBO and other good channels (which mattered as I ended up spending a day in bed with indigestion, alas), and a few undistinguished framed photos of Death Valley scenes on the walls that would not hang straight no matter what. The bathroom had a tub, hot water on demand, plenty of big towels, a hair dryer, and little shampoo and hand cream provided: nothing royal, but perfectly comfortable. There was also a dorm-sized fridge, very nice for chilling Cokes and orange juice, and the usual little coffee pot with foil packets of lousy coffee. In late March-early April the ceiling fan provided all the ventilation and cooling we needed (the weather was delicious the whole time we were there). We also had a nice balcony with a view of mountains and huge trees that mostly blocked the view of the golf course beyond. My only complaint about the room was that one of the beds had those trick sheets with the shot elastic that look fine when you pull back the cover but as soon as you lie on the bed all four corners roll off of the mattress and within seconds you\u2019re entirely tangled up in a ball of sheets, bed-pad, and covers. This was miserable during my moments of queasiness (due either to lunch at Del Taco in Baker, or the spaghetti and meat ball dinner at the Forty-niner Caf\u00e9 at Furnace Creek, we\u2019ll never know which).", "title": "Furnace Creek Ranch - Just What We Needed", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "YellowstoneGal", "date": "April 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 15013221, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location!", "disliked": "\u2014 No major complaints"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled solo", "text": "The one annoying thing about this property (but by no means unique to it) is the disingenuous card on the bed that says \u201cWe are committed to pampering you but\u2026are concerned about our natural resources\u2026.Would you like fresh towels?
