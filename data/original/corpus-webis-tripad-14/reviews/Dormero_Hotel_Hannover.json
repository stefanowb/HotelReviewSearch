Even trying to forget the fact that upon arrival (I had no reservation) I've been told a price for the room and 5 minutes later another woman at the reception tried to sell me the same room at a higher price, I cannot rate positively this hotel. Maybe because of an ongoing fair, but the price of the room was extremely high (345\u20ac) and didn't include the breakfast (+19\u20ac). Well, in a nice hotel in the city centre you can expect that the rates are high, but... but this could have been valid 20 years ago! Except for the LCD tv in front of the bed everything looked very old, some lamps were out of order and, terrible surprise after a long flight, the soap dispenser in the bathroom was almost empty and anyway broken. Only two positive facts: the room was quiet although the hotel was almost full and it was clean.", "title": "Beautiful hotel... 20 years ago!", "user": "SoLLeOne", "date": "September 22, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 5826121}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "In conclusion, a place where I wouldn't stay again, unless they cut their prices by 70%.", "title": "Maritim Stadthotel, Hannover", "user": "sidnsan", "date": "June 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5331874}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "I really enjoyed my stay at the Dormero. The hotel is very new and clean. The staff are all excellent. Very polite and spoke excellent English. The breakfast is excellent. A very nice selection of fruit and breads. I found the beds very comfortable. It is in easy walking distance to the 'new' town hall. The Ubahn station is about a one minute walk from the hotel and on the same street. You can turn left or right from the hotel to enter the Ubahn station from either end. You go two stops and you are in the heart of Hannover. The rooms are a very good size. The shower is really big. The internet is free. You have one screen on the wall for the televison and one screen for the internet. They have all kinds of funky lights in the room. You can select the brightness and the color of the lights. A tip, if the window is open the air conditioning will not operate. Even when it did it did not cool the room very well. It was rather disappointing considering the age of the hotel. There is parking attached to the hotel (surcharge).", "title": "Excellent hotel in an excellent location", "user": "DeanCalgary_Alberta", "date": "July 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115460130}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Really enjoyed this hotel.
