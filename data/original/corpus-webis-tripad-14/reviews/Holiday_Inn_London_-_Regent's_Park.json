We went there for breakfast every day (much cheaper than in hotel) and to get provisions for the plane ride home (pastries, breads, etc.) Anyway, the hotel is very new inside, the staff very helpful, and our room was very spacious for London. The bathroom was fine although the water pressure left something to be desired. Overall, I'd stay here again and again because of the reasonable price and the nice location. Do be aware that the nearest subway stop, Great Portland St., closes fairly early at night.", "title": "Great hotel in a great location", "user": "pepoling", "date": "February 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4446714}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2005", "text": "Both husband and I are regular visitors to London, and we have stayed at this hotel on several occasions.

We requested a renovated room, and while it was small (by American standards), it was very clean and comfortable. The location is excellent and is literally a 2 minute walk from 2 tube stops (Portland Street and Regent's Park), however, we rarely took the tube to those stops and opted for Oxford Circus instead (which is more central and is also only a 10 minute walk). Travelers should note that the area around this hotel is VERY sleepy. I.e. there is very little to no street or foot traffic when we would leave in the morning and return at night. However, the neighborhood is quite nice and is well situated and safe. The only downside that we experienced was the concierge was not so helpful or knowledgeable - 2 examples: 1) when asked where to go for breakfast he recommended Starbucks. When we said we wanted a place with hot breakfast he had no recommendations (incidentally, Villandry around the corner is very nice as is Cafe Meze next to the Great Portland Street tube stop); 2) when we booked the Original Tour Bus with the Concierge he gave us incorrect information as to where to pick up the bus.

The heat didn't work, and after fruitless discussions with the desk clerk I went out and bought a small electric heater, then demanded the hotel reduce my bill by the cost (about $30). There were noticeable clanking, banging, and thudding noises 24 hours a day: I guess because it's a '70's vintage concrete UK building and all the mechanical noises like elevators etc. resonate throughout. The hallways are really the worse for wear, and the rooms were pretty small. The whole thing felt claustrophobic to me. The rates were graciously jacked up to around $300 per night because of the tight availability--I wonder why all the other Holiday Inns were filled but this one still had availability? I usually stay the the Holiday Inn at King's Cross, which is much nicer. The only advantage to the Regent's Park is its proximity to lots of things, but I will never stay there again.
