This motel was a good choice.. When I booked the room on their website, I asked for a room on the ground level & a room with a frig. We did not get a room on the ground level, but did get a room with a mid-sized frig. The front desk staff was very friendly; in fact one of the nicest I have ever had at a motel. Said there was always someone there at the front desk. The room was on the second floor (no elevator, although there was a handicap ramp to the 2nd level). The rooms are not connected to the motel office. You have to go outside to get coffee or brreakfast. The room had a small round table with 2 chairs, low dresser which the tv was on & a mirror over the dresser. Bathroom had sink, toilet & good shower. The room was one of the cleanest we have been in. Small shampoo & conditioner provided, hair dryer & in-room coffee pot, clock & mid size refrigerator. We had a room with 2 double beds. Wall A/C, which was a bit noisy, but I didn't mind the noise. There was an information rack in the motel lobby. There were also large containers of flavored coffees available all the time. That was a nice plus in the morning, as I like vanilla flavored coffee. The breakfast was nothing special - donuts, microwave oatmeal & cold cereals. The 1st morning we went for breakfast across the street to Grandma's Pancake & Steak House. Do not go there unless you are really desperate. The food was terrible. There is also a KFC across the street. The next morning we went to Peter's Pancakes & Waffles. You have to drive there, but worth the drive. Go straight through the light in front of the motel on 441N about 1 1/2 miles up the road on the right. Delicious breakfast. Nothing fancy, but it was good. The motel is within walking distance to downtown . Not much there but souvenir shops. I do remember a Pizza Hut & a Subway. We did not go to the casino, but did pass it. Also near Museum of the Cherkee Indian & the Oconaluftee Indian Village. We enjoyed our stay here & will return next year.", "title": "Will Stay Here Again", "user": "loves NC", "date": "June 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17167929, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly front desk staff; clean room", "disliked": "\u2014 We had a room on the second floor"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Love the location of this Lodge.", "title": "Location, Location, and location", "user": "chalo_7", "date": "October 12, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10070714, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Felt like we couldn't get any closer to the heart of Cherokee, NC.", "title": "As good as anything in Cherokee", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "brainman73", "date": "September 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8671033}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The two rooms we booked were nice and clean, the night clerk was readily available when we arrived (late around 11:00 PM) , just an all around good experience.

At the very last minute, we decided to visit Cherokee instead. Almost every hotel, motel, and inn was completely booked for the weekend; this Econo Lodge was almost the only place left with rooms. The rates for the Labor Day weekend ($117/night after AAA discount) were apparently much higher than the normal rate. The hotel, it turns out, was centrally located--at the intersections of the two main roads running through Cherokee. About one mile down one road was Harrah's Casino, and one mile down the other road were most of the significant Native American historical sites.
