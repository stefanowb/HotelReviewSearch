The warmth of the welcome from Mrs Pattin (the owner) was great, and we were helpfully escorted to our room in the Pinnacles, the modern annexe to the hotel which is about 100 yards from the main building. Our labrador was made specially welcome with her own doggy-paws rug, bonios and bowl (and most thoughtfully poo-bags provided!). The room was large (room 23) with what proved to be a marvellous view when the mists/snow cleared by day 5!!! The ground floor rooms in the Pinnacles all have small patios with table and chairs which would be lovely when the weather is good. The Vi-Spring 6 foot bed was superbly comfortable, the shower was really powerful and the bath large enough for a good long soak. The rooms are all individually designed, no \"one size fits all\" here. The little touches that make this hotel special were the provision of binoculars in each front-facing room, and an \"emergency kit\" of all the things one might have forgotten or suddenly need.

The wine list is quite amazing, I have never seen such an extensive one (more than 500 wines) and it made a really informative read.

I had requested a room with a view as it was our wedding anniversary and we got our wish, the view from the first floor room ( room 7) was stunning as was the room itself. The furniture was old fashioned but in keeping with the style of the room, everything you could possibly need was provided for us, including an emerging box of sewing bits and ladies essentials, bottled water and ample tea/coffee/hot chocolate. It really felt like a home from home. The bathroom was lovely with a huge bath and power shower, and gorgeous toiletries provided.everything was spotlessly clean. We ate at the hotel restaurant on the first night and very much enjoyed our meal, I had the hake with curried mussels - yum! And the hubby had the venison which went down very well, but the highlight of the meal was the soup starter OMG who knew that beet root soup could taste so good. Hubby followed with the large cheese board which he thought was a little overpriced at \u00a311.95. Breakfast was ample, my only gripe would be that it would be nice to have the option of vegetarian sausage. The service by the restaurant staff was faultless. It's a shame the weather turned and we never saw the view after our initial glimpse, but the gesture was appreciated and we still enjoyed a fabulous weekend at cottage in the woods.
