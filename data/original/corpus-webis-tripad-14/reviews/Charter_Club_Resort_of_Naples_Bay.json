Great location. Close to beach, downtown and Naples Bay. You can tell this was a premium resort many years ago. It is still nice but not a 5 star by any means. The pool area is small but ended up being a great place for our 4 and 6 year olds. The Tiki bar is pricey but we were told by one of the workers it is non-profit...which if this is true made us feel better. The staff was great and mostly accommodating. Free bikes, beach chairs, umbrellas and toys. I wish they catered more to families but it seems most of their clients are over 70 years old. Naples is pricey but with a little research you can find inexpensive outings and things for kids. Great zoo, great beaches and enough other things (mini golf, dolphin tours) to keep you busy for a week. The dolphin tour was well worth the money. We stayed in 11A. Two bedrooms, great screened in porch, decent kitchen and most modern conveniences. The bathrooms, especially the master, were too small and you could tell they were built in the 70's. They were also a tad rundown if not a little dirty when we arrived. However, we didn't spend our time in the condo and the cooking and sleeping accommodations were more than acceptable. My suggestions would be to update (at least 11a) a little bit and offer more for families if not just more information.
