I have read a great deal of other peoples reviews on this property, both positive and negative. I have also found the owner/operator\u2019s responses interesting and occasionally revealing. My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend in April 2013. The location is very good, right in the French Quarter but far enough off of Bourbon Street to keep you out of the mayhem when you need a break from reverie. Easy walking distance to pretty much everything you\u2019d want to see in the city. An inexperienced traveller might not make note of the fact that this is not a typical hotel, but rather more like a vacation rental. I didn\u2019t really know this up front ( We booked through a 3P site ) but I read everything provided carefully and pretty much knew what to expect. What does it all mean? Well, there is no daily room service ( but you can get clean towels daily ). Things like soap and shampoo are not necessarily provided ( although a slippery half travel sized bottle of some one\u2019s shampoo was left for us ). At the end you will be expected to do the bulk of the work in cleaning up after yourself. It\u2019s much like staying with someone in their spare room. On the face of it, the place was pretty tidy but certainly did not have the feeling of being professionally cleaned. The bed was just okay and the linens are strictly grandma\u2019s garage sale material. As I said, you are away from the nightly cacophony of Bourbon, but deliveries and other truck related activities begin very early so don\u2019t bank on a late morning lie-in. There is more or less a full kitchen set up which with so many amazing restaurants in the area you\u2019ll likely not need it, but I always appreciate a fridge. This one was big. I suppose the main question is value. We came unbeknownst to us, on a busy weekend and we all know rates rise and fall based on demand. My personal opinion is; stack this up against any hotel that charges over $330.00 per night and the value just isn\u2019t there at the St. Philip\u2019s. That kind of money gets you a great deal more almost anywhere else, and that is just a fact.

Got glass in our feet, it sucked (were Canadian so without thinking take our shoes off when we go indoors, oops). Toilet paper etc. was scarce (again due to lack of staff) and there was zero concierge for ideas and tips while in town.
