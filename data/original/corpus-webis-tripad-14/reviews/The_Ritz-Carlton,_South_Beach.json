It's very classy with great service. The location is great - it's right on the beach. Our room was clean, large and had a large bathroom. The pool is wonderful (the hot tub wasn't working during our visit) and the pool area has many amenities - including a \"Tanning Butler\" and a host to cover your chair with a towel and serve you overpriced food and drink. The spa at the Ritz is more expensive than other spas - cheapest massage was around $150 BUT you can use the spa area even if you don't book a treatment. So you can enjoy the sauna, steam-room and lounge for free & at any time. The nightlife nearby is easily accessible - don't expect the Ritz to draw any crowds so it's quiet at your hotel and you can party elsewhere.

I am single parent travelling with one child. We booked at the conference rate as I was in town on business. Didn't realize until too late that the room block called for rooms with no view and no balcony. By the time I noticed it in the paperwork, it was too late. All other rooms were sold out. At check-in, I asked to be wait listed for a better room, but no opportunity availed. Should've known the $179 rate per night was too good to be true. We were arriving at the Ritz from the Wynn in Vegas and so, the bar had been set for us. Neverthess, our room was a bit cramped - one king, writing desk tucked in the only open corner and so close to the wall that the sheet rock was peeling and cracking on the floor from the number of times the desk chair had rubbed the wall. Window views were to the rooftop with no visibility to the streets or the ocean. Electrical outlets incredibly spare. Luckily, my child was small and agile enough to have crawled under the desk to the wall behind it and plug in our laptop. Couldn't figure out the alarm clock operation despite the notes on the night stand. Never found a phone book in the room or any information about dining or shopping in the immediate area. Instead, there were magazines about the history of the property, a model-esque publication touting expensive outfits and swimwear. Food prices were high, in my opinion, except for the kid's meals. One kudos to the Ritz South Beach...the Ritz Kids program was a huge help and convenience. My only suggestion regarding the program would be to offer an evening option upon request that might be less expensive that the referrals to outside groups. We were referred to Nanny Poppinz (spelled with a \"z\"; otherwise you ge the Boston branch) and, although they were extremely accomodating and able to locate a nanny for us, use of the two services together - Ritz Kids Camp from 9-4 and Nanny Poppinz from 4-8 - cost right at $240 a day and still caused me to miss 8am meetings and the 9am shuttle. I still would recommend both services highly to anyone not bothered by the expense. We'll be better prepared next time. One other note about the Camp...my daughter spilled something on her pants soon after arriving there for the day. Our baggage was lost in transition by the airline and so she didn't have a change of clothes. Not only did the camp counselors have her clothes dry cleaned, but they also went to Macy's and bought her a new outfit. I was floored. This is obviously above and beyond anything that I would have expected. As you other parents know, kid's spill things and ruin clothes daily and, well, we salvage what we can and call the rest \"play clothes\".

Despite heavy doors, noise from someone running the hallway awoke me one night. Another night, the laughing and talking from the room next door, didn't stop until I finally gave in and called Guest Services/Security at 3:14am. They were prompt in handling the issue and I was back asleep. The a/c operates well above a whisper, so if you're used to TV or radio to fall asleep, you'll be adjusting the volume each time the a/c unit comes on and again when it goes off. The in-room coffee maker - 1 cup at a time - featured a nice coffee and was easy to use and quick to make. The mini bar was well stocked, but we skipped the expense and bought water and sundries from the Walgreens immediately across the street. Walgreens also had deli sandwiches, fresh fruits and Krispy Kreme doughnuts! I heard that Barton G's is a popular place to eat, but being busy, we never made it. Housekeeping was very attentive, but be forewarned that they don't start until late in the day. If you leave early and arrive back before lunch time, your room will be the same way you left it. So, if you drink all of the coffee first thing in the morning, it'll be evening before you get some fresh water and coffee packets. Ritz has BVLGARI brand soap, shampoo, etc. which is very nice. I think most folks who care about name-brand perfumed toiletries usually bring their own (at least we do). I'd prefer that the Ritz offer their own momogramed slippers to wear on those cold marble restroom floors or else provide a 3-prong extension cord to make up for limited outlets or else put a telephone directory and/or reference page of nearby eating and shopping in each room. The front desk staff was cordial and helpful - both directly and when I called from the room. Loved how they stepped from behind the counter when handing over the room key in order to point us in the right direction. Certainly not a necessary action, but an impressive one nonetheless. Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed with concierge. One of the reps at the concierge desk was always engrossed in private conversation when we arrived and the conversation didn't end just because a waiting client was standing there. Both times, we eventually gave up and walked away. I both loved and resented the need to present a room key at the elevator to get upstairs. What a wonderful, added measure of security - when you can scrounge around your purse and get to the room key easily.
