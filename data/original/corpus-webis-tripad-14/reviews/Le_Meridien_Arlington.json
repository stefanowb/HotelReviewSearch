This is a beautiful hotel - clean and elegant. It has a pleasant spa-like aroma so you instantly feel calmed upon entering it. It's centrally located to Georgetown, the Metro, businesses, food trucks for weekday lunch, bike trails, etc. There's a 24-hour gym, which I should have used more. I only experienced the restaurant, Amuse, in the morning for a light and healthy continental breakfast. In the evening, from 5-6pm, they offer a wine hour that is nice for networking. The staff was incredibly helpful and responsive, particularly Acey and Mohammed, who offered stellar customer service.

It shares the building with a condominium, whose residents also use the hotel's gym - and parking. The rooms are small in the hotel, but well done. The bathroom was adequate, but not finished as nicely as the rest of the room (small cosmetic details such as cheap looking tile). Rooms are quiet and the staff is professional. The parking garage is also used by the condo and apparently also for monthly parkers working in the area. As the lot was full when I came back during an afternoon I had to valet park, which is more expensive.

I cannot say enough about the EXCEPTIONAL service we received during our 3 night stay at Le Meridien in Arlington. Our suite was beautiful (fabulous tub, great shower, wonderful layout, super clean).

The staff was friendly, outgoing, helpful and caring - - from the staff at the front desk, to housekeeping to bell services. No one was too busy to answer questions and go the extra mile (and traveling with a 12 year old on this trip presented some special needs for us!). A special thank you to Bill who went out of his way to make sure our trip was the best it could be.... for going all the way to the bottom level of the parking garage to retrieve our luggage when we arrived before check-in, for securing our transportation for us several times, for answering our multitude of questions and even helping me find a local McDonalds when my 12 year old tired of \"hotel food\" (which was GREAT)...
