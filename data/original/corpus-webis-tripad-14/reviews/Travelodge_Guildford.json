This one was supposed to be a new hotel, looks like they bought used furniture from other hotels because everything was worn out. No phone, no toileteries, one towel ( if you ask for more you'll get one towel), the bed had a dip in the center so I had no choice but to keep rolling down into this dip, I ended up sleeping on the couch. Do not order the internet ahead of time... Mine never worked and the hotel has no control of it so they have to argue with this IT company, They finally called to try to fix the problem after I had already checked out of the hotel, so not only did I waste the money but I ended up going downstairs and paying for the use of the computer in the lobby.", "title": "Don't stay here if you are travelling without a cell phone", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "nitsdestin", "date": "October 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 46359991}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "The place stunk really bad, not sure what the putrid smell was but the hallways are separted by doors and it just happened to be that I was in the section where the smell was the worst!!
