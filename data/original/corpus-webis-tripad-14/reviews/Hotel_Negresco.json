It was a \"pooey\" brown colour and was \"sticky\" underfoot. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillow was a large square shape not much thicker than a tablemat. The bedcover was something you would normally find in a grotty guesthouse. The wall covering was silk however it was so faded. The curtains were like something sold in Ikea, thin.
