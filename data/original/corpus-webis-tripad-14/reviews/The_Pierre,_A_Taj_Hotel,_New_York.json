I reserved a King Deluxe Room. Upon arrival I was greeted promptly, and escorted to the front desk. Even though check in was at 3pm, they had my room ready for me at noon. The staff is what makes this hotel so nice, they are genuine and care about the guests needs and requests. Rooms are classical style, with black and white marble baths. I was in room #1435 which didn't have much of a view, but it was quiet and immaculate. Turndown service was great, they go the extra mile to make sure you're room is turned down before you arrive back to the hotel. In short this is a great luxury hotel, very expensive at $500 a night, but if you have the cash, then a stay at the Pierre gives you the true New York experience.", "user": "Dudega1", "date": "April 10, 2006", "id": 4957334}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006, traveled on business", "text": "Spent a night at the Pierre during business trip.

While the place still looks nice from the outside, the little details are all gone. The carpets are dirty, there are dusty fake plants in the public bathrooms, fixtures that are chipped, chaulking that needs to be redone. They're cutting corners and prices are still high. The high tea service, for $42, advertises loose tea, but instead you get a tea bag in your tea pot, albeit a big tea bag, but still, it doesn't steep as well. Little things matter at this price point.
