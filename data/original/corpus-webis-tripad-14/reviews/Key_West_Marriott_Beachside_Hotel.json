Only a few of the rooms actually look out on the water.. ours happened to allow us to stare directly into another set of buildings in the next door complex -- not good. You should call them and try to get the view you want when you book. Also -- the beach (as in Marriott Beachside) is not really a beach but rather trucked in sand and the area where you can enter the water is very small and would be crowded if 10 guests tried to get sun there. We weren't looking for that but you should be aware. Our biggest disappointment was the lack of wireless internet in the rooms. I'm ok paying for internet at a Marriott (I guess) but if you have a MacBook Air, IPAD, or Smartphone you'll be out of luck because they only have a wired ethernet connection. I asked about this and they said the buildings were hurricane proof so site-wide wireless was impossible although they do have it in the lobby building. I think for the price of the room, they could afford a simple router or mifi device in each room --- even if they wanted to charge a fee for use. It just doesn't make sense in todays technological age.... again if this matters to you then you might want to book where they do have wifi in the room -- we wanted to be able to check mail especially around the holiday season. The hotel is located on Key West just as you arrive on the island so it is easy to find.
