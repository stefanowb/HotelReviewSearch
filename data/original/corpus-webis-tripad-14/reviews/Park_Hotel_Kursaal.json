The hotel was absolutely perfect!!- just across the road from the beautiful well kept beach and only about 300 yards or so along to the main centre. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful...special thanks to Brigette who was great at answering all our questions about the surrounding area! the hotel was extremely clean, from the rooms to the pool, very impressed. We only stayed B&B but the buffet breakfast was fantastic! This hotel is only a 40 minute walk to the Misano world circuit and was ideal, you can get a shuttle there but we decided to walk! We cant wait to go back next year and do you know one of the best things??......not one time share seller in site!!!! ha ha!! If you go to misano...you will not be disappointed with this hotel!
