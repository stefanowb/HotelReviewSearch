We were robbed on Day 6 of our 2 week holiday. Entry appears to have been gained into our room by key, there was no other means of gaining entry, and no damage to our room door, and the 24 hour camera surveillance, keypad entry door, and double locked door, was no deterrant. The room was secure when we left it, no open windows, everything locked up. In fact, no evidence of the break in was found anywhere!! We asked the Management about the 'surveillance footage', and were first told this had been 'checked through but nothing was found'. On request that we viewed it, there were excuses every day, for not being able to see it. The locks were never changed, which suggests that this could happen again if you get our room number, or another one who's key was left outside the building in an unmarked box for at least two days when we returned it to them personally. You won't get support from anyone, except the Reception Staff if this happens to you. It might also be worth checking the crime statistics for the area, as this appears to be happening frequently in Puerto Pollenca and for obvious reasons, the travel industry are not highlighting it to tourists. Knowing what we do now and being left to sort things out for the next 7 days of our holiday, we would never return to this hotel again in the future. Please avoid any heartache and stay somewhere else. It has destroyed our holiday, we have lost some valuable personal items, and now come home to pick up the pieces for our Travel Insurers and Banks. But hey, they might offer you a free meal for your inconvenience!", "title": "We were robbed!

Yes, as the other review states, do not accept one of the apartments on the 4th floor; they are indeed like caves. Watch too if you are on the third floor because at least one of these apartments was badly flooded and stinks of damp with mould and black marks throughout. I will repeat the message that you have to go to the Hostal Bahia, 800m away, to collect your keys on arrival or if you need to speak to reception staff. They are not quiet - the area is nice and quiet but there is no soundproofing between apartments and some have adjoining doors - bad luck if you are stuck between screaming kids (forget a romantic breakfast/lunch/dinner/drink on your balcony) or under folk who like to rearrange the furniture at night. There is also a constant mechanical/electrical hum all day and night which might keep you awake or drive you nuts.", "title": "Our third visit but definitely our last - jaded & worn", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Fiona_and_Ian", "date": "May 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 106878056}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The linen and towels whilst clean and refreshed are thin and worn and the beds sagging.", "title": "Beware the fourth floor!!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HOLIDAYSRUS1", "date": "October 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 83606721}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "It needs some money, not much, spent on it to refresh it and make it more comfortable but having stayed in three different apartmements in the block in one week, we will not be back to an old favourite.

Looking forward to staying in an apartment as shown in the brochure and on the web site. However, we were in one of two apartments on the 4th fllor. It is like being in a cave!!! Right at the top of the building, no window in the bedroom only a velux. When sitting on the balcony all you can see is the wall in front of you and behind you are the air condtioning motors for other apartments! There was never any mention of some apartments being like this. We complained at the Hotel Bahia and were eventually moved for the last 2 nights. The receptionist at the hotel did all she could to help us and seemed embarrased at our plight. The apartments on the other floors are lovely so just make sure you dont get the 4th floor!", "title": "Ideal base", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CJFluff", "date": "May 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 64289015}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent a week here in a one bedroom apartment and loved it.
