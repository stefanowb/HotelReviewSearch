Overall, the hotel is very nice and clean...highly recommended! The housekeeping staff were not very friendly and many of them ignored us as we passed them by in the hallway. The front desk staff were very friendly though and made sure we had everything we needed. My only concern was SAFETY. On the first night I arrived, the bell hop/valet was \"running off\" 4 young females from the front lobby who looked as though they were ready to offer \"a good time\" to someone. They yelled and cursed at the bell hop as they left the property. He called them \"----\" and told them to \"go back to the projects where they belong\". He then yelled at them, telling them not to come back or he would call the police. The other problem during my stay was that a housekeeper let a mentally handicapped girl into my colleague's hotel room while we were in a meeting downstairs. My colleague returned to her room to find the girl laying in her bed, eating her snacks and watching TV. My colleague immediately called the front desk, only to learn that this girl was lost and her caregiver (and the police) had been searching for her for 2 hours! The scary thing is that the housekeeper let this girl into my colleague's room without asking any questions. It was obvious the girl had a mental impairment and she was lost. When she told the housekeeper, \"this is my room\", the housekeeper just let her in... no questions, no ID... nothing... ?! So... beware of your safety... the housekeepers might let someone into your room without any questions asked. The manager was notifed of this incident and he met privately with the housekeeper (not sure if she was fired?). Hopefully the hotel manager will make sure the housekeepers will never let someone into a room without sending them to the front desk for ID verification. This is very concerning and has prompted me to be more cautious at all hotels I stay at!!! One final tip about this hotel... use the valet parking. The valet staff are very friendly and accommodating. It's must easier to let them park your car for you ... and worth the few extra dollars!
