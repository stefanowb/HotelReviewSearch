As i had to work over xmas we decided to treat ourselves to what we thought was going to be a luxury well deserved new year eve break. How wrong and disappointed were we. The hotel was very drab and dark with no real decorations to say it was christmas. This really disappointed me as the Ritz and the Meridian nearby were all decked out. (Only 2 small trees on the first floor which unless you went up there you wouldn't see.) Our room was obviously designed by a man as it had no dressing table to get ready or do your hair at. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom but nowhere to plug a hair straightener into near a mirror as the only mirror was in the bathroom. On the first night i discovered our bedspread as having what appeared to be stains on it when i unfolded it and as it was late i left it on the floor and reported it to reception the following morning only to find it back on our bed the following night. This was really disgusting. The shower head fell off when i tried to adjust it and to top the stay off when we ordered breakfast in bed on our final morning hoping it would make ammends for our terrible stay it arrived with no toast, no fruit salad and wait for this, two of the preserve pots had been opened and used !!! This was the final straw. Nearly \u00a350 for breakfast that was only half a breakfast and appeared to be someones left overs !!! I think the previous review of the hotel only really making an effort with the excecutve guests is very true. So unless you have money to throw away go elsewhere.
