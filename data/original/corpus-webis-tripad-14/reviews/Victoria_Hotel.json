Couldn't have been more pleased with the Hotel Victoria, my late check-in only took about one minute and staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms are small but efficient, very clean, all renovated in modern decor. Breakfast buffet very nice and great start to a busy day. What I was most pleased with is the breakfast that was made for me when I checked out; I had to be at the airport at 5am and front desk ordered a taxi for me for 4:30am. I did not expect a breakfast that early in the morning at the hotel (usually served from 7-11am). When I came downstairs to check out, the front staff told us that he's preparing a breakfast for the two of us to take along. He had put fruit, juice and cereal bar in a lunch bag and gave us bread with a selection of jams, honey, cheese and cold cuts to make a sandwich and wrap it up. He also prepared a coffee for me.

We were 2 people on this trip and booked a triple room which was the same price as a twin room at the time. The room was spacious and the bathroom very clean. The only drawback was the busy street outside the hotel. Nothing earplugs can't fix.

The staff was very helpful and nice - they were very happy to offer suggestions on restaurants, shopping and getting around town. They had a nice complimentary breakfast buffet that may have seemed like an odd combination of foods - seafood salad, salami, smoked salmon, soft boiled eggs and lots of breads... also cereal, yogurt and fruit.", "title": "you get what you paid for", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "beirut2005", "date": "June 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5396497}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Frankfurt"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 43, "very good": 116, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 53}, "aka": "Victoria Hotel Frankfurt", "slim_ranking": 0.169811320755, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}}
