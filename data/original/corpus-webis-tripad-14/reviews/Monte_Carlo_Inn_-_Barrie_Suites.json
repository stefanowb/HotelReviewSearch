Simple , but tasty and just plain and simple good food with a creative flare , the chocolate salmon is delicious , and the lemon shortcake yummy. breakfast is a well run affair although i noticed a little different set up which seems a little confusing and awkward for guests and staff to move around as the space is smaller for a dining room but feasable for the hotel size . Being a previous visitor I found this visit breakfast seemed a little awkward as I said before , but none the less it was good and comparable when you think that some places you would pay $10 bucks for the same items at another hotel in Barrie.

The hotel gives you free breakfast but we didn't use it since we were out the door at 7am and just came back right before check out to clean up and pack.

It is very plush and clean and we really overall had a great time here. The front desk staff were very proficient and friendly. Check in and check out was quick. Our room was immaculate when we went in, and very plush and inviting. The suites include everything you could ask for, two tv, microwave, coffee maker, fridge, safe, fireplace, two nice chairs and table, comfy bed. The salt water pool is nice, however a little small for our liking. The fitness room although small as well, was great. Everything was in excellent working condition. The restaurant there is not very big so a good idea to go early for breakfast, but the food quality at breakfast is very good there. We had a five minute wait for a table, which was great. We had the deluxe continental breakfast and it was excellent. We had the smallest suite called the Sunrise suite and it is the smallest suite they offer, but it was large enough and very nice. Quite ample for a couple. Our room overlooked the 400 highway and it was noisy at night, however we left the jacuzzi fan on to block out the noise. Also some ladies came in at three am and were yelling and screaming, woke me up from a peaceful sleep, so I called front desk and they went immediately and dealt with the situation. So very good service that way. There are shears and drapes in the room, but the drapes are only decorative and you can't pull them to shut off the light from outside. Now that didn't bother us too much, but I have heard others talk about that as well. They might benefit from putting some drapes on that do pull shut. We purchased the Strawberry and fine wine special that included the hot breakfast, and we felt that was very good value.
