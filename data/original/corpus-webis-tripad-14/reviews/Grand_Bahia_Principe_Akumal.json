All in all we were 4 adults, three 15 year old boys, one 13 year old boy, and our 9 year old daughter. Yes the hotel is big, but it never felt crowded although the hotel was sold out. Service is courteous and mostly fast. In those rare occasions when it took a little longer than I would have preferred to either get a ride or a drink I was gently reminded that I was on vacation...what's the hurry. Those waits never exceeded 5 minutes for a drink or 10 minutes for a ride and hotel transportation schedules are clearly posted. I was dissapointed that although I booked the vacation more than 4 months in advance and I e-mailed the hotel at least 3 times prior to leaving the US to remind them of my preferences (building 47 or 48, top floor, king size beds) neither of those requests was granted. We were in building 81, bottom floor, single beds. So...we walked and it wasn't bad. At $5 a day the room safe is a necessary evil and should be included in the \"all inclusive\" plan. You'll need one unless you are really good at hiding your money (our son was not and he paid dearly when someone took his $85) The buffett is fantastic with something for everyone. The restaurants are a big dissapointment. Not worth making reservations and wearing long pants to eat basically the same food available at the buffet. Drinks are watered down but if you want to drink yourself to stupor you just have to drink more and eventually you'll get there. Yes the beach is rocky in places, but it is also smooth in others. If you enjoy snorkeling bring your own gear. Close to shore the rocks are home to quite a few fish but the coral is dead. Further out the coral is alive but there are lots of nasty sea urchins and the area is \"off-limits\" unless you pay a fee to tour with a guide (forget that and just be carefull where you step and don't touch the coral or you'll kill it). Take the colectivo (a van) from the entrance to the Hotel to anywhere you want to go for $2 per person rather than a taxi for $20. Xel-Ha is great but don't buy the \"all inclusive\" for $75. Catch the bus for $2 per person and buy the all inclusive when you get to Xel-Ha for $54 and keep the $20 per person to buy fake Oakleys in Playa del Carmen. All in all it was a great place for the kids with the 24 hour availability of hamburguers, softdrinks and fries at the Snack Bar, clean huge pools, and a million other things to see and do. Could have been better? Of course. For instance: having to carry regular keys with your room number STAMPED on them is not only a bad idea but also quite inconvenient. Same thing with the towel cards, what's up with that! The concert hall/auditorium needs air conditioning - heck everything should be air-conditioned. Good place to visit. Glad we went, but I am willing to bet that it is probably not the best \"all inclusive\" in the Riviera Maya.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 7, 2004", "id": 2282326}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Absolutely beautiful resort", "text": "Mayan Riviera is a beautiful laid back area of Mexico.

A couple words of advice........if you want to go to Xel-Ha don't book through the hotel or travel guides. Take a cab there, pay your way in yourself and it will save you over 50.00 a person. Also.....if you want to go into Cancun don't take a cab. Go stand on the side of the road and wait for the white vans. It will cost you 2.00 to go to Cancun. A cab ride will cost you about 60.00.

I'm writing for those of you that are already booked to go to the Bahia and for those of you that may be thinking about it. Our experience at the airport on arrival was quick and and easy. Just watch for the men trying to carry your bags and keep your eyes peeled for the people in the floral Apple vacation shirts. The van ride was not the greatest. The AC was not working great and the check engine light was lit the whole trip. The driver also packed 11 people in a 8 passenger van. Be prepared for a long ride. Upon arrival, our hotel check-in was very smooth but we realized that the lobby didn't have AC. Being that the temp. was in the 90's and after a long van ride we were not very happy or comfortable. One of our rooms was not ready so we took all our bags to our son's room. The room were very nice and after we got the AC blasting we were quite comfortable. About the rooms. The hair dryer worked great but if you have anything to plug in bring an extension cord because none of the outlets in the bedroom are close to the mirror. Also we had trouble with any that had a large plug so an extension cord solves that problem. No other problem with our rooms but be warned that this hotel does not have air conditioned restaurants. Only the Don Pablo has air. The buffet and other restaurants all only have large windows that open and ceiling fans. At 90 degrees plus, it is very very hot and humid. The main bar and theater are not air conditioned either. so be prepared to be very hot and sticky. The food was only average, lots to eat if you are not picky but not of high quality. The drinks are watered down so ask for top shelf liquor and they will accomodate. Best place for breakfast and lunch was the Tortuga, same as the main buffet but cooler and a better breeze. Pools and grounds are beautiful . Take insulated cups for the pool or you will never have a cold drink for very long. The beach was great and not as rocky as expected in certain spots. Go to the pier with rolls or bananas and feed the fish. They come right up to you. The shows at night were very low quality and the theater is very hot. At night be sure to wear lots of bug spray or you will eaten alive. We had three 16 year olds in our group. They made the most of things because most of the kids were much younger or older. Also they were given alcoholic drinks very readily so watch out for that. Also being from the US we were not accustomed to topless sunbathing and we saw alot of that. Not just at the beach but at the pools also. So be forewarned. Now to the worst part of the trip. My husband got very sick. Vomiting and diarrhea. so bad that he had to see the doctor and stayed in bed for 2 days. We think it was the chicken in the paella at the pool. He wasn't using the water so we don't think it was that. The boys did drink water at the resort but other than more than normal bathroom runs they were not sick and neither were the other adults. But we did watch that we didn't eat raw vegetables or fruit with skin. Because of my husband we didn't take the Apple van back to the airport, we booked our own ride with another van service. Cost was $95 but we had a nice cool van and only an hour trip to the airport with no stops along the way. The Apple people at the resort were no help in arranging any alternative transportation. So if you have a trip booked you can look forward to beautiful beaches and grounds. And mostly friendly staff especially the entertainment staff. If you are looking for a place to go, remember no AC and very average food and drinks.

He should have been at the sister hotel \"Tulum\" but was not there and also left out two consecutive appointments. This meant however to get used to the shuttle service within the enormous three-hotel complex. After this discouraging start the excellent buffet rewarded us with really amazing choice of good food. Room in Villa 50 was good and well equipped with coffee maker and ironing board. View not spectacular, but room quiet even if located near the main building. The sea-side is partially inaccessible due to rocks, and after an artificial sandy beach where water is about 1 m deep, certainly not a highlight, it was said that a natural beach is adjacent (Tulum part of the Hotel). At Tulum part there is a daily dolphin show. Otherwise, there are swimming pools with animation i.e. loud music etc. at the Akumal, as well as a beautiful swimming pool without animation, we only discovered after four days. There is a \"Hacienda de Dona Isabel\" within the complex, a replica of a Mexican town centre, all rather expensive souvenir shops and restaurants, also some apparently genuine artefacts for sale. There are shows at the Hacienda every evening, including a Fiesta Mexicana once per week (we missed). At the Akumal there is also a daily show in the evening with some professional artists, the most guests, as they were always addressed by the show master, came from Spain, UK, Canada, Mexico, Portugal and few from US. Be aware if you don't like to be on stage, as they always pulled participants out of the audience to \"act\" on stage, but they respect if you refuse. Back to the hotel ground. The shuttles circulate quite frequently and they are flexible and helpful to bring you to the place you want to go. There are snack bars where you can eat and drink (I believe) 24 h per day. Even though we didn't spot anyone exaggerating. While we always took the buffet option in the main building, we did not choose the speciality restaurants, but others said they were very good.

Second would be there is a lot of rude people, not staff it's hotel guests who have ridiculous expectations and attitudes. Now to discuss the great- We tried 3 ala cartes (Brazilian, le gourmet and fruites del mer) all had great food. We chose not to use our final a la carte as we enjoyed the buffet much. Almost too much selection, do a lap before you start taking food! We went to the Coba buffet as well, it was also good but pretty much the same food as Akumal. - the rooms were very nice. Didn't try the jacuzzi tub but others did and they enjoyed it. Check where your shower head is pointed before you turn it on! The beds are very very hard, however never did I feel sore when I woke up or have any trouble sleeping. We tried to make sure we tipped the cleaning lady (thank you Julia) and the guy who restocked the fridge every day. If we forgot it didn't make a difference everything was well done we left a note in our fridge requesting only diet soda and that's what we got all week. - The grounds are very well maintained, and you can see a lot of animals! Tequila boom booms are still as powerful as just tequila so watch out. The bartenders are for the most part great, you'll just learn which ones pour heavy or light. The tram drivers are the greatest and will save your feet after a long day or help you make your a la carte in time. I'm sure there's more I could add but just know its a great place.
