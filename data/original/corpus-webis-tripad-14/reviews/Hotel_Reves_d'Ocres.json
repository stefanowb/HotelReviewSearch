The room wasn't too bad, and I had a balcony which was nice at night for sitting (during the day, it faces the sun so is too hot), but the room is pretty basic. My main complaint is that the hotel advertises A/C, but my room did not have any. It was broken, in fact, but at least there was a fan or I would have died. When I asked the owner about the A/C, as I saw a unit in the corner of the room, he said it was broken and he was awaiting parts. While the owners seemed nice enough, I suspect they have never actually stayed in the hotel as he kept saying, oh, just open the \"windows\" to cool the room. Well, there were no windows, just one French door (and they had blocked half of it for some odd reason, so only one side opened. But the situation of the hotel with the balcony just meant there was no cross-ventilation at all and the room never cooled down at night. Sure, it was lovely outside, downright refreshing, but the room remained very very hot. I don't think the owners understand that just because it is cool outside does not mean the room will cool down if the outside air cannot enter.", "title": "This Hotel was cheap and so were the owners...the only disappointing aspect of Roussillon!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lavenderladies", "date": "July 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 71000258}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "It was clean and had some cute style within the budget, so wasn't bad for two nights. I didn't eat there, I don't eat breakfast. And I give them a big plus for free parking in a lot right across the road, and it is on a main road out of town. So it is a good location with a car. I wanted a place to walk to restaurants and it was great for that, also, which is why this hotel satisfied me. The owners were a little cheaper than necessary in some unusual regard, though, I was surprised. For example, there are virtually no bathroom amenities (okay, I bring my own mostly) except for bath gel/soap. That was provided in a small glass vial. I'm sure they filled it up themself, which is fine. But the first day there were two vials. I took a bath and used up 1-1/2 of them. The second day, they did not even replace them and I was left with only 1/2 vial of soap.
