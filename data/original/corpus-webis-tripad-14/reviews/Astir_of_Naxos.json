We found the distance of 20-30 minutes walk to be a bonus. You may find the hotel lacks a bit in charm because of its newness. There is a grocery store very near by where you can buy wine and honey cheaper than in the tourist areas. The pool is beautiful and its hours of operation are somewhat limited as a courtesy to the guests who sleep late or go to bed early. I believe most rooms have a view of the pool as well as a balcony. There is also a fridge but it was so well hidden we didn\u2019t find it until the last day. The breakfast is above average (all the hotels in Greece overcook the scrambled eggs, undercook the bacon, and the orange juice is really orange drink). Marusha (sp?) was a most helpful front desk person and recommended some great restaurants.

The grounds are well manicured, vegetable gardens on one side, a small grape vineyard on the other, flower and cactus plantings all around.
