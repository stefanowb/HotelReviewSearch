What I found was a very large property with meeting and conference rooms, fabulous onsite restaurant (Bistro 79), coffee bar, little sundry store, out of this world great service and very nice rooms. and NO airplane noise that was directly across the street from MOA. I can;t say enough how great it was to spent a few nights there for meetings (OH and the catered meals were AMAZING). I usually hate Marriotts but I LOVED this one!! Only down side was there was no battled water in the room and the in room coffee was yucky. The shuttles ran until midnight too to the mall:) The hotel said they updated 2 years ago but it looked like it had been done last week. Great for couples and business travelers but it might a bit tight for parents with kids in one standard room.", "title": "Exceeded Expectation", "user": "cayennev8", "date": "April 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 156519236}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel has issues. In fact, as a loyal Marriott customer who has stayed at many different Marriott hotels at all the different levels of luxury, this is the worst of the bunch. While the staff was super friendly and outstanding, the hotel is in desperate need of renovation. The wear and tear in hallways and elevators is bad. I can accept the fact that it\u2019s an older hotel and the rooms are smaller. What I could not accept is that our room was not very clean\u2014especially the bathroom. The first thing I noticed walking into the bathroom was the dirty top cover behind the toilet. It hadn\u2019t been cleaned in a long time. YUCK! The second thing I noticed was a large toothpaste stain on the counter. Double YUCK! And of course, there were many hairs in the tub and on the floor. That\u2019s just plain gross. The room needed vacuuming. There was dust on the coffee maker. The beds were O.k. but worn so that your body rolled to the middle. Honestly, this hotel is a black eye to the Marriott chain! While it\u2019s great that you can get a free shuttle ride to the very close Mall of America and Airport, I now understand why the nearby Fairfield Inn is so much more expensive.
