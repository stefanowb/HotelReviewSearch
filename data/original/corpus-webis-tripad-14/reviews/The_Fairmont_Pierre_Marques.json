This was our second visit in 5 years. Our room was in one of the main buidlings on the second floor and we overlooked the pool and the Pacific. Our room was very clean and well kept the whole time. Every staff member was friendly and accomodating to the best of their ability (sometimes hampered by the language barrier)The pool is very nice and it is a plus to be able to have access to the Princess facilities as well. Their workout room is nicer than the Pierre's, for instance.I would definitely stay there again. I like the relaxed feel of the hotel. There are no loud deejays barking out comments and playing music by the pool to entertain the guests.

Our room was about midway between the party and the farthest point away and the band sounded like it was on our balcony- no kidding.
