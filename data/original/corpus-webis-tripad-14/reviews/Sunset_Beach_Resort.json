The beach located by the resort was MUCH nicer than the area after the resort (there are rocks/trees separating our beach and the other stretch which was filthy). It's very closely situated along the main road, with a Happy Mart (convenience store) 3minutes away where we rent our motorbikes (be careful about the hot engine, I got a nasty burn on my thigh). The Thai food next to Happy Mart has delicious TomYam.
