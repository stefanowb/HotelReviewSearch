He looked to be a bellman but he walked up and then walked away with out saying one word. DIDNT offer to carry my bag which was not a rolling bag and raced across the stone LARGE DARK courtyard with not a single word. When I awoke and needed to iron my clothes I was told you had to go to an iron room, they do not provide irons. The gym was a joke and they don't provide towels although they have a sign for dirty towels. The woman at the front dest said I had to bring it from my room. well for the two of us they only give you two large towels and 2 towels that are more like a dish cloth for your hands.

Also regarding staff the barman was very friendly and kept me topped up with a great variety of free snacks both hot and cold for as long as I was in there.
