Other than the thrill of staying at an old palace and the convenience of staying right next to the city's main tourist attraction, the city palace, I have absolutely nothing good to say about this place. For US$160 a night, I got a room with smudged, knicked and dented walls and filthy lampshades that were covered in dust and greasy fingerprints. The \"dressing area\" and bathroom had charming flourescent lighting, complete with exposed bulbs. The toilet had one of those flimsy plastic seats, like the kind you find in public toilets. The tub was plastic and had some dust in it when I checked in, plus some stranger's pubic hair. The sheets were threadbare and they must not wash the blankets too often because I could smell two different perfumes on it. The list could go on. The room we got was actually better than the original one they tried to put us into, which had no windows in the bedroom!! (that was room no. 23) The public spaces weren't much better. This hotel needs a a major overhaul and new management. Service was well-meaning for the most part, but slow and English comprehension was often not so good. I called customer relations twice during our stay, both times I had to be passed on to three different people because the first two weren't fluent enough in English. During our first morning, I called was to complain about a loud horn and drum that started up in the courtyard just before 8 am and continued for an hour. I was told this was for a \"VIP welcome.\" Apparently, when VIPs come, it doesn't matter whether or not guests feel like sleeping. Then the second night I called about some loud hammering and sawing that had been going on for two hours. They gave some ridiculous excuse about \"emergency pipework\" when I could see with my own eyes that it was clearly not that. They did offer to change rooms but seeing as how we were already in bed, trying to sleep and preparing to wake up in just a few hours for a very early flight, that hardly seemed an option. They did not apologize. HRH Group, the group that runs the place, obviously doesn't believe in maintenance and seems pretty clueless about service. I'm sure the more expensive rooms are nicer, but if you're going to spend that amount you're much better off taking your hard-earned money elsewhere, like the Oberoi. Otherwise, save your money and stay at one of the smaller hotels by the water. They're a lot cheaper and the nicer onces probably have comparable facilities.", "title": "First class rates, third rate hotel", "user": "esheng", "date": "January 22, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4370294}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "Stayed here for 2 nights as part of our holiday.", "title": "Needs a good hotel chain to sort it out", "user": "je2005", "date": "January 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4319685}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2003, traveled on business", "text": "Unfortunately we couldn't quite work this hotel out.

We think the room hasn't been used since as it was very dusty & dated. We had a huge domed bedroom, sitting room, dressing romm & bathroom. Our minibar consisted of a huge fridge containing none less than two bottles of pepsi & two bottles of water. The air conditioning was by portable units & the most modern item was an LCD TV. We had a fantastic view of the lake though. We found a tariff that stated our room was $750 if that is per night I wouldn't pay that amount for what you get.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 8, 2004", "id": 2518038}], "location": {"country": "India", "region": "Rajasthan", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Udaipur"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 18, "very good": 43, "terrible": 14, "excellent": 91}, "aka": "Shiv Niwas Palace Udaipur", "slim_ranking": 0.174311926606, "description": "Shiv Niwas Palace offers beautiful, yet differing suites and rooms to choose from 17 individually decorated suites carry original furniture and portraits that have been with the royal family for generations.
