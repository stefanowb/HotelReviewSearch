The lobby door is very understated and we drove right past it. When we arrived around 12:30 on Saturday afternoon there was no valet nor bellman to be found. Our biggest complaint, however, was the high stakes required to play craps. $15 and $25 were the only denominations offered on Sat., 2/4 and Sun., 2/5. (Even Atlantic City offers at least one $10 table!!!) Early Sunday morning, it was the same pricing. As a result we were very disappointed not to be able to play our favorite game!

This was my first time there. I was very suprised at how large the casino was. Most of the slot machines were in banks of four and very spacious. You really should walk around at first to take in all the different machines they have. Of course, I started with the slots as soon as I walked in and settled on the area near the entrance doors. They have many of the newer slots and that's why it's a good idea to walk around and find the ones you like most. The Casino is clean and even though smoking is allowed, the place is so large it really doesn't affect you. They have a food court, a few of Emeril's places and the Carnige Deli, where we had a wonderful \"early dinner special\" for $15 which included a starter, a sandwhich and a dessert.

We had a King room.....We had a smoking room, and I will say, as soon as you came off the elevator, you could smell that you were on a smoking floor. The room is spacious and the bed was sooooo comfortable, I would ask for extra pillows though. Ice machines are at the end of the hallway on every floor, so it is convenient. There is room service and it is average price wise. The hotel does not look like it is done yet. Elevator service was quick, You really always need to remeber to have room keys with you everywhere. To get to the rooms, you have to have your key. The hotel provides a free continental breakfast, buffet style, in a room overlooking the massive grounds of Bethlehem steel . I rated the hotel four instead of five. To get to the casino you have to walk through a large, two level shopping plaza and then through the Marketplace food court. We don't mind walking, but since the mall just recently opened, most of the storefronts are empty. It just gave a negative impression. I would not be able to bring my aging mother here to stay, becasue of the long walk. I thought the person at check in just seemed like we were bothering her which is not a way to be when you have a new hotel and are trying to get said hotel off the ground. Lots of choices to eat, but everything even quick food was really pricey.One thing I will say, I don't know if I would pay their full price for a room. It is just a little pricey for the basically only staff you see is the front desk.

We stayed in a king room. It is a large room with a dresser/desk, bed, and two chairs. It looks like they intended the room to have a small table and chairs in the corner but decided not to do it. It's just a big empty spot... sort of looks strange. The dresser/desk combo has a door that looks like it would have a mini fridge in it but again, looks like they changed their minds. When you open the door, it's an empty spot. Some of the higher priced rooms do have the mini fridge. Why would they skimp on the fridges? Even the cheap motels have them. The bathroom is big and has a nice shower in it with lots of room but the sink area is outside of the bathroom and very small. There's no way two people could get ready at the same time in the sink area. We didn't use the pool or the exercise equipment but it looked pretty standard. The check in area has desks rather than a counter. It's a nice touch. They do have an express check in kiosk but it wasn't working when we arrived. They also have a free continental breakfast but it is pretty skimpy. They room it is located in doesn't have near enough room to handle all of the people. As a result, lots of people were eating standing up or sitting on the floor in the hall! These types of things would never happen in Vegas but they have a captured audience here. The hotel is connected to a high end outlet mall. Most of the shops are still empty as it was just completed but it looks like it will be pretty nice once more stores move in.
