From the moment I checked in to check out problems occured which did not reflect the high standard the Ritz Carlton promises its guests. As a Marriott Platnum Guest I arrived at 3:15 PM for check in which at this property 3 PM is the appointed check in time to find my room was not ready. The front desk then tried to assign me another room keeping me at the front desk area for over 35 mintues! In addition to the time they asked me countless questions regarding my preferences etc which are all included in my Marriott Profile and reservation. The result was a standard room assignment on the 8th floor, keep in mind my preferences are a high floor, upgrade along with other requests but none delivered. The front desk staff recongnized my displeasure and sent a cheese plate up which was a nice touch, however this process was unacceptable. The room was standard and the housekeeping service spotty at best with no replenishment of items such as shampoo, conditioner, soap etc. Also on one of the days upon my return I found my room door with the dead bolt engaged and door open !! This security violation is totally unacceptable, and glad to report I had no items missing. I have complained to Marriott and would not recommend this property you can do much better at one of the other hotels such as the Westin Peachtree across the street!
