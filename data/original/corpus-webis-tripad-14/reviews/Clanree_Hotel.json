On checking in I saw a guy get turned away as there were a lot of tours in, and the hotel was full. Thankfully I had been pre booked. The room was quite large, but the view was awful. Another of those rooms at the back overlooking a flat roof with ducting all over the place which obscured everything else. The entrance hallway in the room had no light, so it was hard to see the air con controls positioned just inside the door. There was a couch at the far side of the room from the tv so you need good eyesight. The bed was very comfortable. The window didn't open much. \u20ac4.10 for a Smitwicks isn't bad value.The food was very good value with an early bird 3 course steak dinner for \u20ac25, and the B&B rate I got was \u20ac63. Back to the food, the portions were quite big, but they missed out on the fresh grated parmesan on the caesar salad starter. The steak was a nice size (10oz rib eye) and cooked to perfection, very tender. The only downside with the food was that I found there were too many flavours on the main plate. The sauces were a little overpowering, and the onions seemed to have been sauteed in another very strong flavour. The bar got very busy after dinner with the tour groups, who I found to be quite clannish. The music was good, but I felt he should have waited until the semi final of the Euros were over (Spain V Portugal, I know it went to extra time but it was kind of surreal watching a match with old time waltzes being blasted out). Breakfast was disappointing, they need to provide fresh fruit, and yogurts in pots. Cereal choice was limited. One more thing, they need to put the lights on in Reception, it was very gloomy when I arrived at 5pm. Some signage to show the way to the bar and breakfast wouldn't go astray either. All in all, I enjoyed they stay, and would stay again.", "title": "Group on deal", "user": "186470joe", "date": "June 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132642948}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Looks great from outside, modern hotel.", "title": "Better Standards at a B&B", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "gapthunt", "date": "July 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 134277214}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "When walk through the door it like going back in time to the early 1960's.
