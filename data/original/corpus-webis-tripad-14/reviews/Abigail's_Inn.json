From the moment we pulled up, we were taken care of by Beth and Kip. They clearly put their hearts and souls in to their business and it shows by the carefully appointed rooms and knowledge of the Camden community. Beth gave us a list of activities to do on Saturday and each recommendation was perfect. The Lobster Roll at the Bayview was outstanding as was the Clam Chowder at Cappy's. Abigail's Inn is located right in front of Mt Batie, which upon reaching the top will wash away all your stress.
