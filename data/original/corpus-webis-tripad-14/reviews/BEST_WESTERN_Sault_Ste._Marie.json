The hotel prices in Mackinaw City & St Ignace are well over $100 per night. I booked this hotel and got a much better rate. Even the extra drive to catch the island ferries did not add enough expense to warrant staying in Mackinaw or St Ignace. The hotel is great with clean rooms and helpful, friendly staff. They have a nice breakfast area with a more than adequate selection & it is attended by nice lady assigned to the area and not by front desk personnel as is the case at many places.
