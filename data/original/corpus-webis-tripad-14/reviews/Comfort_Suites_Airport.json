The furnished refrigerator was a nice size. The included breakfast was way above average -- waffles, fruit, yogurt as well as a selection of pastries. Fruit and delicious gourmet coffee was available in the lobby 24/7. The 24 hour shuttle service to the airport terminals was prompt and very convenient.

Each time had first floor with \"runway view.\" I actually thought it was just another road till I realized that the wooshing sound wasn't the wind, but a Boeing every now and then. A really good job of soundproofing, but it was very nice outside for late August/Early September and I would've liked being able to crack the window open for some fresh air. Hotel room was clean and smelled good though. Mini-fridge is always a plus for me so I can keep some \"beverages\" handy. Room is set up to how many other Choice Hotels' junior suites are. I especially like Comfort Suites size for a longer stay than just a night or two. I specifically remember that they had a vending machine on the 2nd (or 3rd) floor that dispensed juice cans! That is very rare these days to find actual 100% juice versus the sugar-y carbonated water that people call refreshment. A big plus for me because, again, I like to keep \"beverages\" handy.
