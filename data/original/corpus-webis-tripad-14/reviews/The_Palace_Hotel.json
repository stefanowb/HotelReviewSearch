First of all after putting me on hold several times and transferring me to a few different people they eventually confirmed that they'd misread the intial internet booking so only had me booked in for 1 night instead of 2 but that it was all sorted now. When I mentioned reviews about the hotel rooms and enquired about the type of room we'd be staying in, I was told that we were booked into a standard room and that there were plenty of reviews on the internet about how good the hotel was too! I didnt bother getting into it with her any more but was a bit nervous when we arrived at the hotel. We were very impressed upon entry into the hotel. The concierge on reception was friendly enough but failed to put my mind at rest as to why he was adding a further \u00a3100 onto the agreed price which he was swiping onto my Visa.

I admit that the decor was a little dated but it was spotless and there was absolutely nothing that we could have complained about. Once we got our bearings, we had no trouble finding our way in and out of the hotel from our room and although the corridors were long, I wouldn't describe them as dark like I had read about in some other reviews.
