We also decided to upgrade to a nicer room for $9 a night which was a great deal. There was a long hallway leading into our room and we had a corner room so it was quite spacious. We had a nice view of palm trees and a balcony that overlooked the street. Brian at the front desk was most helpful with recommending restaurants to visit in Brickell and South Beach. The beds were very comfortable and we had no problems sleeping. The hotel is situated between South Beach and Virginia Key/Coral Gables, so it's a good location if you want to visit both. There were many nice touches such as the huge towels and the high quality toiletries which come in large bottles and cut down on waste. The pool on the 15th floor is quite memorable and it's worth lounging at and getting a drink. Club 50 has spectacular views and drink specials are good on certain nights if you go early. It was also a nice touch that you can use a laptop in the lobby for free. The staff are superb and the room is gorgeous and feels like a high class apartment. However, if you are traveling with your girlfriend, you must be comfortable with the open bathroom layout (the toilet has a door at least)!

So far I have enjoyed it very much but this last time I was able to explore the hotel a little bit more. The place is extremely well done, the Gym-SPA is very good and staff is very helpful. Also there are three different outdoor pools one with hot water which was surprising taking into consideration that Miami weather is typically hot (although last week was a little cold for Miami standards). The restaurant on the 15 floor is also good and the staff there very helpful. If you are traveling through Miami and want a nice place for a good price this is the moment to go since this hotel will not remain at this low prices for long. Once the economy rebounds this will be a very pricey location. One annoying thing was that the rooms are all with free WIFI and the hotel gives guests free laptops to use but something happened since my first stay back in January and now you have to use the laptop in the lobby which is not very helpful if you need to work. This should be corrected, I usually do not travel with my laptop to avoid airport security problems so having a courtesy laptop is high on my list but then only providing it for lobby use is not very business friendly.
