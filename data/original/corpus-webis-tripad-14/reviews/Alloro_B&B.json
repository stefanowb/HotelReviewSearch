If you stay in this B&B, just make sure you are booked in, because we weren't!! I booked 4 nights for early November back in July by contacting the hotel direct and received a confirmation email from Cristian to say it was all booked. I emailed him again a few months before the trip to tell him we might get there after 5pm (when they leave) and got a friendly response saying 'fine, no problem'. When I read the reviews saying about the Burchianti hotel I thought I'd just double check that we weren't going to be put there, and also to book tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia through Alloro. I did this 2 days before our trip to Florence. Cristian responded a day later saying that he was very sorry but our reservation had never been put into the system, so he had booked us into the Hotel Accademia instead. As this was a special trip and I spent hours trawling through tripadvisor I was not very pleased, so I cancelled. Luckily I found the excellent Hotel Perseo which had a free trip to Siena and Chianti county thrown in, so it all worked out brilliantly in the end. Cristian was apologetic, accepted all responsibilty and did find us an alternative, but they are obviously pretty disorganised.

At the Accademia the staff was very friendly, the rooms were cold and noisy but ok...however the staff charged us the price we got for the Alloro booking. That was too much.
