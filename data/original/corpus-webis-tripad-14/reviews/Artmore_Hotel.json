Breakfast is also varied with various hot dishes, grits, cereal on real ceramic plates and cups!

We came to Atlanta this time simply to get away from the city in which we live and to get away from the kids and the Christmas rush. We went to two special exhibits at the High Museum, we had two great meals at South City and Nan and we spent an afternoon with a great bartender at Article 14.", "title": "If You Are Ever In Atlanta, You Will Want to Stay Here!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MegtheHealer", "date": "December 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188154797}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled on business", "text": "We will come back to the Artmore. I highly recommend the loft suite rooms that are on the third floor but then the bedroom is on another floor above. It was such a nice, cozy place to hang out with my spouse. When it rains, you can hear the patter on the attic windows. I really love the energy that is in the public spaces at this hotel but I love the coziness of the rooms. The hotel is VERY clean and the staff is very friendly. The location simply cannot be beat if you are looking for great restaurants and entertainment. We parked our car on Friday evening and didn\u2019t touch it again until we left on Sunday morning.
