Not only the hotel but the whole blue mountain experience. I felt like I was far from home and we were only 2 hours away. My family and I went on a hot week and you would think that the mosquitoes would be out but we did not even get 1 bite. My children LOVED the hotel, playground, pool, plunge.....everything!!! The Westin was everything I expected, definitely a 5 star hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room had a balcony facing the pond and it was nice to relax and enjoy the stars and music in the village while my kids are asleep. The only thing was that the restaurants in the resort was very appetizing and delicious, but I found them a bit expensive.", "title": "Awesome....we are definitely coming back", "user": "Jazna", "date": "July 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115688599}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Just got back from wkend stay (July 15-17)...it started off iffy at check in as lady who started to check us in got caught up w/ a guest behind us that referred to her as \"Jodie Foster\" and eased his way to being serviced before us and she left me staring at a wall with 4 children eager to get their stay going. Not impressed by lack of professionalism \"Jodie\"! She literally giggled away w/ this man who flattered her. LUCKILY...everyone and every experience after that was wonderful. We were there as a huge group celebrating a reunion/ birthday and it was exceptional. Housekeeping was great. The room great. Our request for a room w/ a village view...PERFECT! Loved it!
