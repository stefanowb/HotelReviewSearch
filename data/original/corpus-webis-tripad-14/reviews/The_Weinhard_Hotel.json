Our host at the desk seemed not sure about believing us, and then said the \"we are training a new girl.\" A minor thing but how things are handled matters. Most disappointing was breakfast, which basically consisted of cereal and muffins on a serving board, with the rest in a fridge. Weak coffee is served, but a stronger brew must be must be purchased. While many inns and hotels sell odds and ends, there seemed to be just a hint of excess in this area. Such a lovely place should try to be sure that what guests receive matches the impressions given by the building and its history, which is beautifully written and presented in a booklet in each room.
