The establishment does not have facilities for children or pets, which is a bonus as far as we were concerned. Also take-aways and booze are not allowed in the rooms - again a good feature, as who wants to have the stale smell and residue of other peoples food in their bedrooms?

We were only staying in Hunstanton for one night as we were attending a concert at the theatre there so thought we'd give the Sunset a try and so glad we did.

On finding that my husband is not very mobile, the proprietor instantly prepared a different, more accessible room for us with just a few stairs and carried our bags up. The room was lovely, obviously furnished with care and taste, spotlessly clean, great shower and a seaview, couldn't fault it. We were very comfortable and after having a good nights sleep (even though we were on the front of the hotel by the road it was unbelievably quiet,didn't hear any traffic at all) we were treated to a great breakfast (hope you've got a good appetite!) which set us up for the day.
