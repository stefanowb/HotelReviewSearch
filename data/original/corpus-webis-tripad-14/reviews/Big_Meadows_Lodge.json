Later I graduated to backpacking and have returned again and again to cover the trails and sleep in the backcountry. Many times I've passed through Big Meadows area.

Finally, after 23 years of marriage, I broke down and decided to make a reservation at Big Meadows Lodge in order to share this gorgeous park with my husband. We pulled up to the lovely main inn on a Friday night after traveling 20 white-knuckle miles on the Skyline Drive through rain and thick, thick fog. Know that if you have rain in the valley as you approach the mountains, those very rain clouds will be sitting directly on the mountain road when you drive up. It was impossible to see more than a few feet ahead of us in the dense fog. When we finally reached the lodge, it was a very welcome sight. This pretty stone lodge was nestled in the trees, warm lights gleaming through the windows. Our check-in was prompt and friendly. We parked and walked a short way to our room in the Rapidan Building. While the building itself is not very attractive, looking something like a painted cinder-block motel from the 1970's, the room was recently remodeled, with lovely wood floors, and new, bright furnishings of a rustic style. There was a cathedral ceiling, and the walls and ceiling were covered in beautiful paneling. There was no phone, which was wonderful for me. We did have a new television with cable connection for a few channels. We watched it briefly each day to get weather reports and some news. We also had a/c and heat, but this particular weekend was on the chilly side, so no a/c was noted. We had a lovely little balcony with standard plastic chairs and plastic table, as well. The bathroom was clean, though a bit dated. I also have to say that the walls were a bit thin in this building. We could hear our neighbors muffled conversations, but that wasn't too bothersome.", "title": "Great atmosphere and scenery", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "thaylii", "date": "August 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8514742, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The views, the ambiance and atmosphere, the rustic quality", "disliked": "\u2014 The restaurant"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We admired our room briefly and then quickly headed back to the main lodge to get some food after our long trip. Unfortunately, we arrived near 9:00 p.m., and the dining room was closing. But the \"Tap Room\" was open downstairs for light fair and entertainment. The room itself reminded me of my parents \"rumpus room\" in our basement growing up. Paneling, dropped ceilings, nondescript government issue tables and chairs. But the atmosphere was friendly and festive. Three park rangers were providing excellent music, some of which was produced on an amazing 77-year-old steel guitar with old-fashioned modulator. Our bartender, Debbie, got into the act, as well, belting out Patsy Cline songs like nobody's business! We also enjoyed delicious bowls of chili, and some good bourbon, as well.

The rooms have been renovated since last year and were a pleasant surprise. We have stayed here a number of times in the past and the upgrades made the stay more enjoyable. The following were all new: wooden floors, knotty pine type beds, mattresses, combination dresser/closet, chairs, cable television (not that you should spend much time in the room). Another new addition are the window heater/airconditioners (in the past, there was no air conditioners that we remember). There are no telephones in the rooms, but who needs them. You must remember that you are staying in a National Park and should not expect five star accomodations; comfortable rooms are what you do get. We have stayed in a number of lodgings in our National Parks and this compares favorable to them (it is not quite the Ahwanee in Yosemite, though). The food is average and what you would expect in a National Park restaurant. The food is okay and the price is on the high side but you have to consider the alternatives: eat at another restaurant, Skyland Lodge, which is in the park, bring your own food (which we did the first night there as we had gotten campsites to cook our food on a charcoal fire) or eat in Luray or Front Royal which are both outside Shenandoah National Park.", "title": "Remodeled motel rooms were great", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "yellowstone1", "date": "July 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8127599, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 They had been renovated from last year.", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "In the daytime the gnats were a little bothersome so bring an insect spray or wipes that contain an insect repellant.
