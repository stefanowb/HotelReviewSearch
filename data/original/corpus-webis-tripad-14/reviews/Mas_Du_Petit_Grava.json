We loved having the space. Ike and Jim really make you feel at home. We loved being visited by their lively dogs and from the cottage we had a lovely view of their vegetable gardens. We met some very pleasant people at breakfast and shared travel stories.

What a lucky, lucky find. Stay at this place and you'll see why everyone goes gaga over this part of the world This inn is situated on a lovely property surrounded by fruit trees and a beautifully landscaped pool. The inn itself was built in the 1700s - a stone farmhouse surrounded by neighboring stone farmhouses - that was lovingly restored. It is modestly luxurious, but more importantly, authentic in its design. It really feels like you are somewhere different, like you are in Provence, when you are staying there. But the best part of our stay were our hosts, Jim and Ike, who went out of their way to make sure you were spending your day well, heading to the right restaurant, etc. And they set a wonderful tone that enables you to easily meet all of the other guests in the inn either during their lovely breakfast or at cocktail hour.
