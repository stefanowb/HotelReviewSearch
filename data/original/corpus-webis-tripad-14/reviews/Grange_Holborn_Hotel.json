I have stayed at the Clareneden which is also part of the Grange chain and my room there was tiny! We used the leisure facilities which were great. The hotel is in a fantastic location for the West End, there is no need to rely on the tubes if this is the area you are wanting to explore, everything is in walking distance. I have come back from my visit and reccommended the hotel to so many of my friends. Initially before we booked we couldn't decide between Holborn or St Pauls - Holborn all the way for location, we went down to St Pauls and yes it looks like a 5* hotel but Holborn gave us everything that we needed.

Noticeable improvement in the very comfortable lobby lounge area where servers actually seemed to notice you and provide very attentive service. It was like the entire hotel had had a giant attitude adjustment! When you combine this with really large rooms and well stocked bathrooms and a great location withing walking distance to covent garden and the west end and very reasonable rates this place is a winner!!
