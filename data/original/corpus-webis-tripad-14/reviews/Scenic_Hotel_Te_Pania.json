Initially we were told we could not move, but when I asked if there were any rooms to upgrade to, they suddenly found one on the third floor, right at the end of the corridor, which are fabulous rooms as they have windows on two walls with a view down the Marine Parade. In the end they did not charge us extra, and we had a lovely stay. The location is excellent for roaming around Napier, and a good base for visiting Hawkes Bay vineyards.
