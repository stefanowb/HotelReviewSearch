Our travel agent booked rooms at the Holiday Inn Express in Seabrook. When we went to our rooms after checking in mine had a strong terrible smell making any thought of actually sleeping impossible. My colleague's room had a large cockroach. When we asked the front desk to please move us to different rooms, they refused and made rude statements to us. We were too stunned to be outraged that a National chain like Hoiiday Inn could treat their customers so rudely. We went elsewhere and decided to fight the battle of getting a refund even though they made it clear they wouldn't offer any.", "title": "Stay away from this place", "user": "CJMN", "date": "December 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 22595241, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Really nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 Rude service"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for two nights in July..
