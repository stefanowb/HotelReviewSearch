There was a line of 4 customers waiting to check in, 3 staff behind the desk but no communication between the two groups. The desk staff were either on the telephone, urgently flicking through sheets of print outs, or banging the automated check-in machines by the desk in a vain and misguided attempt to fix them. After 15 minutes eventually it became clear that their computer system was down, so they had lost details of all bookings. Customers were asked to score out their names on a piece of paper, and then advise the desk staff of the room rate. The man who checked in before me re-appeared at the front desk 2 minutes after being given his keycard to complain that his room had already been allocated to someone else - someone else who he had just walked in on! The receptionists response? 'I know'! Incredible.

The location is excellent for East London and the City, but quite a way from the West End if that's where you're headed. They had a jug of water out on the check in desk for when you came in in the evening (it was a very hot day) which did impress me. Average room with little or no decoration and no bed side tables (this is becoming standard in travelodges apparently...). Lots of noise from the building directly opposite first thing in the morning and of course it being so hot, we had no choice but to have the window open as there was no fan.
