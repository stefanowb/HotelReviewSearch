The hotel itself is dated and located next to two airport rental car wash facilities. The furniture in our suite was stained, old and frayed. The sofa bed was so old and tired that I had to request a rollaway bed for one of my kids. My biggest problem was a safety concern. For the first time in my life, I fell in a bathtub. As I fell,I was able to grab the shower curtain and a safety bar to break my fall. I still ended up with a very bruised thigh. I am a 45 year old male in good health. One my teenagers also reported to me that she slipped and nearly fell. If this had happened to an elderly person, it could have had very serious consequences. I reported the incident to the front desk manager. She apologized and filled out an incident report. Later that day, the hotel staff placed a safety mat in the tub. This could not have been the first time an incident like this happened at this hotel. I am a fairly regular business and casual traveler and try to stay at Embassy Suites hotels.

June 29th- July 2nd. I did not want to pay center city prices. Since we are avid users of the T, we wanted to be close to a T stop. The made to order included breakfast and the nightly manager's reception was a definite plus. We are Hilton honors members and usuallly gravitate to Embassy Suites. As pointed out by other reviewers there are some differences at this Embassy Suites. You do not have the large atrium with all of the rooms coming off of it. Your room opens onto a hall instead. This eliminates one of my pet peeves found in most Embassy Suites. That is the 3 AM door slam which tends to reverberate throughout the cavernous atrium. If you are sleeping on the pullout, this is something you can't miss. The rooms are a little smaller, but not to the extent that it causes a problem. They have at least 4 shuttle busses. (I counted) They are very close to the airport. Our view overlooked the Dollar rent a car lot with the airport in the backround. If you have kids who love planes, you can look out the windows and watch the planes take off. You also overlook the new astroturffed ball fields. Bring your soccer ball and enjoy. The new T station is a very short walk from the hotel. You simply come out the main entrance, cross the street, walk around the fields to the left, and run right into the T station. If you are in Boston for a few days and plan to use the T for your travels, get the 7 day link pass for only 12 dollars. The T is an experience in itself. Lots of people watching and always a station convenient to your destination. Boston is a walking city, and the T helps you to do that. The hotel has a business center with computers for your use. There is a small gym with a couple of treadmills and a few other machines. The pool was mainly frequented by children nonstop. There was supposed to be adult supervision, but I rarely saw any. So if you are an adult looking for a little relaxation in the hot tub, this is not the place for it. I don't fault the hotel for this situation though. Just a product of the me generation. To sum it up, I would use this hotel again in a heartbeat when visiting Boston. P.S. There is a kiosk located by the front desk for you to print out your boarding passes.
