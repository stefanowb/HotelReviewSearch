They were serving spaghetti for dinner but already planned to eat at PF Changs at Crabtree Valley Mall which was adjacent to the hotel. Make sure you get Colin to be your server. He was great and made us laugh often. I still can't get over the size of the gas fireplace in the lobby, it must have been 8 feet wide and 5 feet high. Breakfast was delicious. They served scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuits, gravy, belgian waffles (cook yourself), cereal, juices, coffee and yogurt. The front desk staff was friendly and so were the nice ladies clearing the dishes from our table as soon as we finished with them. $224 might have been a bit high for one night but felt we saved money by eating the free breakfast and enjoying the manager's reception last night.
