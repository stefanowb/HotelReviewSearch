The carpet was suppose to be blue, but 85 percent of it was more like an off white color. The bed was not all that comfortable and the furniture was really dirty and worn out (no handle on the dresser). There were so many stains on the wallpaper that I lost count, and some parts of the wallpaper were peeling off. The bathroom was pretty nice, except for the wallpaper stains and hairs in the tub. The kicker was when we decided to open up the pull out sofa the second night. It was disgusting!!! There were two huge basketball size yellow stains!! We called housekeeping at 2AM and they came right up with a wheel away bed. The housekeeping person was awesome.
