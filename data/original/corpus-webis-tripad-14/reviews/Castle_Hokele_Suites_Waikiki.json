The biggest drawback as far as aesthetics is concerned is that it is old. The one review that you will read about dirty bathrooms is actually incorrect. The tile in the showers has been resurfaced and is peeling, not dirty. The drapes were new, as was the upholstery on the sofa and dinette chairs. It was, as I said, ok. My only complaint is that the walls are thin; one of our neighbors, whose room adjoined our bedroom, had children who were up at the crack of dawn wanting water and cartoons. This was unpleasant.
