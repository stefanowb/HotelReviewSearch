Two friends and I met in New York April 26-May 5 for our semi-annual girls' week. Mount Morris House is a beutiful brownstone in a gorgeous area. We had the Terracotta Suite, which looked across the street at Marcus Garvey Park. The woodwork and finishes throughout the house are just spectacular; the chandeliers are extraordinary, and it is magnificently furnished and decorated perfectly for this historic home. Demitri is an excellent host and made us feel right at home. The room was lovely in every way, and we had so much space with the dressing room and large bathroom with rainfall showerhead..", "title": "Mount Morris House is Awesome", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "chissis", "date": "May 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 160722406}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The neighborhood has everything you would want - a wonderful coffee shop for my caramel latte's just two blocks away.

We first had a six day stay, and after two days in an appalling apartment, we fled back for another nine nights to the comfort of Mount Morris House. The owners took a great deal of trouble to accommodate us, and to make us welcome once more. They are courteous, responsive, generous and helpful exactly when you need help. They are not obtrusive, nor do they interrupt your privacy. Our room was large, comfortable, and kept scrupulously clean by the excellent housekeeper, the linen is high quality, the complimentary toiletries are high quality too, from New Zealand (the \"Manuka\" line), and although there is no formal breakfast, there is tea and coffee available together with freshly baked cake and other confections available 24 hours a day in the pristine little kitchen. On a couple of nights, we brought food home from Zabar's and Fairway and had a feast sitting up at the small counter table in the kitchen. We made sure that we cleaned up after ourselves properly. The house is meticulously run, and it benefits enormously from this. Guests are asked not to have food in the elegant living room, and not to keep open food in the bedrooms. There is a refrigerator for guests' use in the kitchen. The guests all recognise what a jewel this place is, and respect the house and its gently-expressed rules, accordingly. It is conveniently located, we walked at all hours in complete safety, it is quiet, and a delightful place to return to after a hurly-burly day in a great metropolis.

The open library on the ground floor is a spectacular room which provided a delightful space one evening whilst sheltering from the storm. European visitors should understand that the Mount Morris is more 'serviced rooms' than bed and breakfast. Breakfast (and other meals) can be taken at one of the local coffee shops or caf\u00e9s - although fresh coffee, a wide range of tea and biscuits are always available in the galley kitchen. Vasili was a charming and helpful host, discrete but available if needed. Harlem proved to be fascinating. We followed the house suggestions and visited 'Il Cafe Latte' for breakfast, with highlights at the 'Red Rooster' and 'Lenox Lounge'.
