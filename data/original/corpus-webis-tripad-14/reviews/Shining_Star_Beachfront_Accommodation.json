This time it was sunny and what a difference the weather makes. We stayed in a beachfront chalet and it was superb. The glow worm cave is just across the road, the beach is out the front, but it's not a swimming beach, it's a wild beach strewen with driftwood and ruggedly beautful. The chalet was quiet, as was the camping ground it's located on. Small kitchenette with everything you need. Clean, spacious, cosy and new. We even got a little note to remind us that it was daylight saving time and remember to adjust the clocks. Hokitika is the place for buying jade with lots of outlets in the main shopping town. Stock up with groceries at the local New World and you are set for dinner and breakfast. Wireless internet was reasonably priced. While at Hokitika make a trip out to the Hokitika gorge, but don't forget the spray for the sand flies. Beautiful gorge. You can loop back but the road alongside the lake is gravel part of the way and some hire car leasing arrangements don't allow driving off the bitumen.", "title": "Beachfront bliss", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "2011travel54", "date": "May 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 110302862}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Shining Star provides \"caravan park\" accommodation of exceptional quality.

A short walk across the dune and you arrive at a wild and windswept black sand beach, where you can amble for hours exploring the driftwood and pebbles washed up on the tides. It's about a 20 min walk along the beach into town - which to be honest was a little dreary. It's very much a working town, with a few gemstone and souvenir shops thrown in. Although we did have some lovely meals at a French style cafe. The rooms at the property are large spacious and up to date, very clean and always have the sound of the sea in the background. It's also a short walk to a glo worm dell and a petting zoo behind the property. Staff were pleasant and we highly recommend a trip back into the hinterland to visit the Hokitki Gorge - amazing powdery blue water. A sunset meal of fish and chips out at the point was another highlight for us.", "title": "Spend a bit more and enjoy the Beachfront Chalets!", "user": "OscarTosca", "date": "April 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 105194711}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "I can't recommend Shining Star enough.
