The rooms were very generous in size and had a fridge. The baths in both rooms were a tad dimmer than I prefer, but very clean. If you need a room in or near Soap Lake, this works very well!

We enjoyed the location next to the beach and the lodge was ok but we did have some issues. For example, the room was very spacious but old fashioned and a little musty with mold in the shower. There was a group of several families in the room across from ours who sat on their balcony most of the evening and were very noisy singing and drinking wine. Although that isn't the resort's fault, the noise came right through the uninsulated wood walls and the office closes at 5:00 pm so there wasn't anyone to report it to to try to change rooms. Also, we were in an adjoining unit and every time someone walked in the room next to us, our room seemed to vibrate. When we called to make the reservation, we upgraded rooms as we were told ours would have a King bed. When we arrived, it was only a queen.
