Monorail right outside the door and train station 2 blocks away - what more could you want. We booked an executive room with access to executive lounge for breakfast and night time nibbles and drinks. Check in on arrival was fast and effiecient. The room was on the 19th floor and very quiet and had everything that is expected. The breakfast at the executive lounge was more than adequate with selection of drinks, toast, cereals, fruit, pastries etc.......and appears they have taken on board a previous review re waiting for cutlery etc as it is now on the table ready and waiting. The nibbles and drinks were also nice (although the first night the lounge was full - but we were directed straight down to the lobby bar, where on our arrival we were greeted and given drinks of our choice and nibbles). This was a good place to sit and people watch.......so we did not mind at all. The staff in all departments are friendly and the taxi we ordered the night before for a very early morning pick-up arrived on time.", "title": "Pretty poor and expensive!

On our own we figured out the transportation. There is even a free bus that runs during the day. The staff were clueless in recommending restaurants. locations of major sights and where to buy certain items. I asked for a quiet room on a high floor. We most likely got the noisiest room in the hotel on a low floor. Their floor numbering is deceiving. It starts at 10, when in actuality this is the first floor. If you get a room on Pitt St it is directly across the street from a night club that stays open on the weekend until 2:30AM. People were screaming and hanging out the windows and the music was so loud it shook the windows. When I called the desk at 12:30AM to see if we could change roooms his reply was \"you can come down for some earplugs!\". This hotel caters to airline personnel and I'm sure they are placed in a quiet section, if there is one. The self laundry has a dryer that isn't vented, so your clothers never get dried and the whole room is wet from the steam. Sydney is a beautiful city and there are many good hotels.
