The rooms were GREAT! Clean, no smoking smell, good temparature. Bathroom has drop acoustical ceiling tile which is king of funky. The indoor and outdoor pools are small and COLD. Jacuzzi was nice. All are kept clean. The free shuttle was a LIFE SAVER. Shuttle drivers are an asset t o the property. Made some great recommendations for dining in the area and were spot on every time. The food in the bar was above average, the breakfast in the dining room was below average. Besides the overall cleanliness of the room and the pools, this property is very tired and in need of some upgrades. Hallways, low ceilings, and vending/ice areas show much wear and tear. For the price, you can't beat it. It's a decent place to lay your head at night. I'd stay there again for a couple of nights.

I was a little taken back because there were maybe 8 cars in the parking lot. I made nice with the clerk, smiled and what do you know, an upgraded room!
