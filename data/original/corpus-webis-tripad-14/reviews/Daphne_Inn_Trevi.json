We were married in Italy, and had lots to worry about before ever arriving in Rome -- Sandra and Elyssa helped us plan our trip months in advance, and provided possible itineraries, of which worked fabulously! Everything was arranged for -- transportation from the airport, to the train station, etc...we had nothing to worry about, and when there was a glitch with my train schedule, one of the staff took her personal time to walk my husband to the travel agent, and sit with him until the matter was resolved. But, then there's all the small touches that meant the world -- flowers in the room, capuccino in the morning, packed breakfast for days that we left early, unbelievably comfortable beds, and as always -- the friendly staff :-)", "user": "MindyHZ", "date": "April 25, 2005", "id": 3414251}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Yet another positive review!", "text": "We're already thinking of planning our next Roman Holiday.", "user": "dm16tor", "date": "April 24, 2005", "id": 3402226}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "We spent 3 nights at the Daphne Trevi at the end of June.
