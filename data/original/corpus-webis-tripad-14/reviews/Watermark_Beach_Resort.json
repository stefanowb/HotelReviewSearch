This hotel is conveniently located next to a great restaurant called Breeze and walking distance to a nice little deli called Dolci Deli...(make sure you have thier \"black bread\"). As well there is a Super value right next door to the Watermark which came in so handy as we bought our grocery the day after we got there and were able to bar BQ right out on the patio.

Location is tough to beat and the whole place says quality. They are still working out a few kinks in terms of staffing ie the service on the patio was very slow but its a lovely location if you have to sit and wait. I was also impressed with the maintenance staff - attentive and experienced. The only real downside I can say is that this resort really works for families with small children but if you don't have any, you are hard pressed to find a quiet corner anywhere in the pool area. Also, no poolside service for drinks which must really reduce yield. The Cove up the lake made more money from us last year just for that reason.
