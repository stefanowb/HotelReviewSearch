The food was generally good & varied with a good choice of restaurants - shame only 1 a la carte but food quality in the buffet restaurants made up for it overall. Local drinks were a little dubious, but that seems par for the course in Sharm! Pluses were some nice additional touches including a pancake station & coffee shop - (we only found the ice cream in the coffee shop at the end of the week - don't miss out!!).", "title": "Something for everyone", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Holidayqueen33", "date": "March 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153805378}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "For a week's relaxation in the sun, this hit the spot perfectly, would definitely recommend.", "title": "Amazing!!!!!!!!!!", "user": "Holly_Louu", "date": "March 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153791855}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "This was our first time in egypt, was totally amazed by this hotel, was the best hotel and holiday we have ever had by far!

First day spent at the spa, amazing time and got the price knocked down. Had a problem with the electricity in the room being cut of and found reception staff unhelpful. Called at 8.30 am and was still waiting two hours later. After many calls and trips to reception it was sorted. Found that at reception you get ignored unless you actually stand up for yourself and speak, of you don't, you would be standing there a long time. Also the reception staff seem to pass the buck with issues. Was surprised on checking out that we were also charged for playing billiards however on collecting the balls for the game,this wasn't voiced, 71 Egyptian pounds for an hour which is a little steap! However! Food was good, always found to be hot and plenty of choice, pools were fab but a little cold, the sea was actually a lot warmer! Deffonalt take the time to go snorkling, great experience!

We contacted reception and asked if we could move to a ground floor room - we had requested this when we booked, as it is easier with a toddler. We were told we had to go back to reception, when we explained that we had bags, buggy and child and would have to negotiate the steps again, so could we meet someone at another room - they were not interested. We went back to reception and I explained to the person who had initially checked us in. He didn't speak to me, just changed the room number on our envelope and recoded the key. It just so happened it was the room below the one we had just left, so I asked if there was another way to get there, so we didnt have to negotiate all the steps again.
