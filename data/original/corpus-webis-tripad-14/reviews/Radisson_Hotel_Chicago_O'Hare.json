I wanted an airport hotel with an outside pool and after checking reviews on tripadvisor felt confident in booking the raddisson. The shuttle arrived after a 15 to 20 min wait at shuttle stop 3. I had left my cardigan on the bus and he brought it in to me which was great as it was new. On booking through a third party I had requested an earlier check in than 3 pm as we were arriving at chicago at 1 after a long flight and when we checked in @ 2pm our room was ready. There is a luggage cart but no bellman and when the manager saw us struggling with our luggage he helped and got an employee to bring it to our room which was great as it was quite a hike from reception and we had a lot of heavy luggage. The room was comfortable 2 big beds , fridge, microwave, coffee maker no kettle but this is us standard. toiletries in bathroom, so no complaints whatsoever. After having something to eat we went to the pool which had plenty sunbeds and towels. We were tired after the journey, having been up early and the 6 hour time difference we went back to our room about 6pm made a few phone calls and at @6.45 pm went to bed. I always wear ear plugs when travelling and could hear a loud noise which apparently were planes taking off. I went to the window drew back the curtains to make sure the window was shut. I couldn't believe it, I had read the reviews and nobody mentioned the noise from the planes. I have stayed in a few airport hotels previously and because of soundproofing never heard anything maybe we were just unlucky where our room was. I couldn't go through having to change rooms and lugging luggage so I took one of my mothers sleeping tablets after an hour so I don't know how long this went on for. I asked for a wake up call which I got. Breakfast next morning was good with hot and cold choices. Before checking out I rang reception to see if someone could help with the luggage and was told someone would be up to help and after waiting and nobody arriving I told my mum to stay in the room and I would check out and see if someone was going to help. I asked the receptionist who said he was alone and went on the walkie talkies to ask someone from housekeeping to assist. I asked when the next shuttle was due and was told 14 minutes, so sat in the lobby waiting, getting a bit agitated that we would miss our flight so I approached reception to ask them to ring the room when I saw the luggage trolley. panic over. The young man brought the luggage to the front of the hotel and with that the shuttle pulled up. Would I stay again? I would have said yes as I had a good feel about the hotel, but the noise from the planes would make me hesitate, I really cannot understand it as nobody else mentioned it so maybe it depends where your room is, with efforts to make my flight I forgot to mention it on check out and I wasn't asked if I enjoyed my stay and I wish they had a bellman, otherwise a convenient, comfortable hotel.", "title": "Long wait for shuttle bus", "user": "Carol1906", "date": "September 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176884146}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Had higher expectations", "text": "Radisson is usually known as a good hotel but that was not the case with this one.
