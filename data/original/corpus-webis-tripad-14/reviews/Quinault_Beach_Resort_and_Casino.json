Really. We went for a conference and the rooms were a little less than normal as a result. BUT the beach is one that people drive on, so don't plan to build sandcastles unless you don't mind people speeding by your children as they build. AND if you are a nonsmoker, expect to cough your way through everything - although the nonsmoking room did not smell too bad. The food at the restaurants was fine although most of the cheaper places had very few non fried options. The staff was friendly enough and helped get us some milk for our son because we couldn't find a restaurant that had any - strange. The games were fine, I didn't play alot.", "title": "Great if you're a smoker-nonsmokers and families beware!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Kvacances", "date": "September 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 5782765}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "All in all not a place I would choose to go again with a child, or if I didn't have lots of extra clothes so I could change out of the smoky ones often.", "title": "Nice and Relaxing", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Cfritz75", "date": "August 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 5543190, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Room size, comfort, and the view", "disliked": "\u2014 had to drive to get to town, shopping, stores, other restaurants"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006", "text": "New post of an old vacation.....new to Trip Advisor", "title": "Great Resort on the Beach", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Mass_Matt", "date": "July 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5432207}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Rooms . . . shoddy casino!", "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Quinault last year for our anniversary April 2005. We had no problems checking in early, at noon instead of 3. Our room had a gas fire place, a seperate seating area with a view of the ocean. It was clean, big, comfortable, and nice. We didn't spend any time in the casino since we are neither smokers or gamblers. The casino is noticeably smokey...but hey it's a casino. We ate at the restaurant the first night and we still talk about the crab cakes!! They were huge and served with a marmalade sauce! Best I've ever had. In fact we ordered them room service for lunch on the last night of our stay. The restaurant offers a buffet on Saturdays which looked alright...but awfully crowded since it's served in the reception/bar area in front of the restaurant. Didn't bother us once we were seated. The bar had a cover band playing that night too.

The front desk needs better mgmt. as they seem somewhat disorganized. I recommend the queen bed room as having the better view. The king has the bed behind the fireplace, so you can't see the water. There seems to be more deferred maintenance on this trip ( having stayed there several times). The plastic shower head should be replaced. The toilet ran in my room and tub faucet leaked. Make sure you bring along your confirmation w/ rates as the front desk may not have your correct rate.

On one bank of machines, our experience was that any time we hit the \"bonus round\", the machine would display a \"call attendant\" message. The attendant would come, open up the machine, and - upon clearing the message - the machine would default to the lowest payout amount, skipping the bonus round for the player. This happened repeatedly - four times in one hour, on three different machines. Call us stupid for letting it happen more than twice, but this is obviously outright fraud on their part. When I called their attention to this and asked for an explanation, they didn't seem to see any problem with the sitution. Needless to say, we did see a problem!

After that we had no problems, in fact when we went to get one piece of pizza cut in half they exchanged it for a larger piece. We ate at Emily's one night. Big mistake.
