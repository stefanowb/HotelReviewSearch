As others have stated, the hotel is very nice. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfy. Staff were all friendly, and check-in and parking were a breeze. Location could not be better for proximity to Buckhead restaurants and malls. We had a few minor annoyances during our stay, such as an elevator problem the last morning we were there, but that stuff happens and the hotel had repair personnel on the scene quick. The breakfast buffett on the weekends does get crowded but it is not unbearable. We got an Advance Purchase option for $89/night which is a great value for the Buckhead area. We recommend this hotel to anyone seeking 4-star quality at a 2-star price!!!", "title": "Great value hotel for Buckhead area!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "KROG7", "date": "September 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 79421349}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Checking in we were put in a room where someone had smoked.

Pond in the lobby with huge koi. Typical Embassy Suites room layout, although the room seemed more modern in decor than many Embassy Suites. It was clean, staff helpful, etc. For the morning breakfast there was usually only one person preparing the hot food (eggs, etc). He was very effecient but this often resulted in people having to line up and wait. In other Embassy Suites it's more of a buffet set up and you only wait in line for omelets. Coffee was horrible. There were times it was very crowded and difficult to find a place to sit during breakfast and during the nightly manager's reception (bartenders were all very friendly). The business center consisted of 2 computers, a fax and a broken printer (broken the entire stay). I had an urgent email attachment to print (regarding an employment offer). The front desk staff let me forward the email to them and they printed it for me which was great. No pens in the business center. 2 computers really isn't sufficient for a hotel with over 300 rooms. Often had to wait quite a while for one to be available. Self parking with in/out availability $18 per day which is probably on the reasonable side for Atlanta. WiFi in the room $10 per day and at this point hotels really need to stop charging for WiFi in the rooms. Location was great for our purposes to see the city.
