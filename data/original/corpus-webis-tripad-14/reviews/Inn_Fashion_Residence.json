Hotel has been recently renovated so everything is very modern and the bath had a jacuzzi function which is great for your feet after a day of walking around this huge city. Had a nice LCD TV and great air con system. Only a 5 min stroll from Barrio Alto so great for that drunken stumble home and also close to all the other major sights in Lisbon.", "title": "Brilliant hotel in a fantastic location!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "charlenedj", "date": "June 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 67794013}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Estremadura", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Lisbon"}, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 3, "very good": 7, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 0.789915966387}
