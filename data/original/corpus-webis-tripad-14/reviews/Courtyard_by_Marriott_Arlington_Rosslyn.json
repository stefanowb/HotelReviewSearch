My husband and I stayed at this hotel in Arlington rather than staying in DC. We found it to be clean and easy to get to. It is on a one way street, so if you miss it, you have to go around the block and come back. Once we found (and we were doing this in dark) it was a cinch to get in. They have an underground parking garage, which was nice and very secure. You had to have a room key to get in from the outside whether you were driving in or going down via the elevator, so we felt comfortable leaving our car there. The hotel is close to a number of restaurants. For breakfast we found a great little store/restaurant about 1/2 a block away. And there is also a Starbucks close by. We found a Greenberry's coffee place not too far away too. I also highly recommend it if you're not into Starbucks. It's a little further away, but still within walking distance. For dinner one night, we at Ireland's Four Corners. Surprisingly the hotel did not have it listed as being within walking distance, but I'll bet it didn't take us 15 minutes to walk there, and it was well worth the walk. The hotel is within 1/2 a block from the metro station. The directions we received from the front desk to get to the metro were not that great but we still managed to find it very easily. We were surprised at how easy the metro was to navigate and how clean the station and the trains were. It made it very easy to get around - definitely better than driving.
