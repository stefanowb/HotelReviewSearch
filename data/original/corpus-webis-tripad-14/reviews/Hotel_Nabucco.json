We had a room on the side of the railway so had to buy ear plugs to try to blot out the sound of the continuous hooting & tooting of the trains as they left the station. The room was adequate for resting our weary bodies after a long day sightseeing but a tea/coffee machine would have been greatly appreciated(we believed there would be one). Trams are close by but the centre is much further than was suggested on the hotels web site. The dining room was pleasant,although a little sparsley decorated. the breakfast was good- continental style but the hot drinks came from a self service machine which is not the same as smelling freshly brewed coffeee. We also believed there was a restaurant in the hotel but that isn't the case,however there are several close by. Lots of renovation work was being carried out while we were there,our early evenings were punctuated by an abseiling painter outside our room window. The hotel has potential.....! The canopy above the front door shows four stars, the hotel is definately not four star which is what we really wanted.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "mj08", "date": "January 4, 2005", "id": 2974794}], "location": {"country": "Czech Republic", "region": "Bohemia", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Prague"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 17, "average": 37, "very good": 100, "terrible": 11, "excellent": 59}, "aka": "Nabucco Hotel Prague", "slim_ranking": 0.456845238095, "description": "Hotel Nabucco pays homage to the life and work of Giuseppe Verdi, extraodrinary Italian composer.
