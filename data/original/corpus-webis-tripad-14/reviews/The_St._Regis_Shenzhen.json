You have no problem locating this establishment, as it is the tallest building in town, the thirds tallest hotel in China, and the eighth highest hotel in the world. The building is 441 meters tall. I must confess, part of my anticipation of staying at this hotel was pure adventure, I wanted the experience. Not that I am a particular enthusiast of tall buildings, having my own home in Finland firmly at ground level. With this on my mind, arrival by taxi from the Shenzhen airport was smooth as silk. I was greeted and shown to the lift which brought me to the hotel lobby on the 95th floor in a little over 14 seconds. The lobby can take your breath away, it is so well designed, as if the view and the interior are one. Check in was equally efficient, with a smile, and then by way of a second series of lifts I was shown to my room on the 82nd floor. Again, the room and its view was superb. I was greeted with an automated welcome, complementing the kind service of the hotel butler who accompanied me there from the reception.

I remember walking into the restaurant and seeing those astounding white scultpure chairs with the big faces on the back. Unexpected! Fun! Usually I associated St regis is low key elegance, this one really blew me away with the design. And of course the views.
