The restaurant and ambience are lovely but the service is not great. We waited 25 mins for the waitress to even take our drinks order. After a delicious starter our mains arrived, mine rubbery and my husband's cold (he had to send it back to the kitchen to be re-heated), nevertheless our son's steak and chips was the best he had ever tasted (apparently). The wine list is very reasonably priced, unlike the main menu, however the maitre d, a consummate professional, refunded the cost of my husband's meal without question (after some confusion). However we left without eating dessert and feeling a tad disappointed. We had a much more enjoyable meal in the Harbour Inn round the corner the evening before at a fraction of the cost.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "DebbyLit", "date": "May 30, 2013", "id": 162391467}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed herewith my wife, for her birthday, very comfortable bed, good view of the river/sea, short walk into town.
