The sunbeds were also very comfortable and quite well spaced apart.The location is lovely and whilst you can walk to Elounda which we tried, its along a road with no pavements and is quite busy, it takes about 45 mins unless you're a marathon walker (see other reviews) we used taxis 7e each way. We also took a trip to Spinalonga which we booked in Elounda itself much cheaper than Thomson. The island is very interesting to wander around but you only get an hour there as they seem to like a steady flow of visitors.
