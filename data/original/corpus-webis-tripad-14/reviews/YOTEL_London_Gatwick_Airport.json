The plus I suppose is that outside the elevator there is an internet machine you can use for 10p per minute and the fact that it is in the airport so you have lots of choice for meals. As others have said it is not signposted at all, and you shouldn't follow the signs for hotels...look for the Costa coffee shop and the Yotel is tucked by the side.
