We spent two nights in the Village room, which overlooks Lower Green. It is tasteful and spacious, with a comfortable sofa and armchair. In many more cramped hotel rooms, the bed dominates the room, making it impossible to truly relax, but that is not the case here. The first night we ate in the restaurant, the second in the bar, and both meals were not only excellent, but good value. The selction of wines is also good. My only quibble would be our bed, which was a bit too firm for my taste, and it would be better to have natural duvet fillings rather than artificial, which can get too hot.", "title": "None better", "user": "Ruffinit", "date": "May 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162094943}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent a long weekend at the Howard Arms which is in the charming village of Ilmington (well worth exploring the little lanes and pathways throughout the village).
