We spent our first 4 nights there and then a 5th night before our flight back to the States. Unfortunately, it was our first nights in Italy and Stefano spoiled us for the other B&B\u2019s that we stayed at. His breakfast was the best, rooms were the cleanest, and not to mention Stefano was the friendliest. He made us feel like old time friends right away. All of his recommendations on where to go and where not to go were all spot on. He has maps available and will point out what bus to take, when to go, places to eat, etc. The pizza place about 3 blocks away was delicious. ATM located right around the corner and bus access a block away. On our next trip to Rome, we will definitely be staying with Stefano.", "title": "Fabulous stay.
