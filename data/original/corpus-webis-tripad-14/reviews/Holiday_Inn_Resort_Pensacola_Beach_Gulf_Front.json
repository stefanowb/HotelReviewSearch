There's a \"lazy river\" in the pool, along with mock pirate battles. The deepest the pool gets is about 5 feet. There's also a small indoor \"pool\" (which is about 15 feet square).

We are priority rewards members through Holiday Inn. We only had enough points to do a points plus cash night and then we bought a couple of extra nights. I dont think they could have made it anymore difficult because for whatever reason they wouldnt let me do it online. I called the 1800 number and so the lady helped me book the 2 nights we were paying full price for and then assured me I could then go back online and do the priority points night on my own. And of course that didnt happen because the weekend we went you had to book at least 2 nights in a row, which i was trying to do but i had to book my stay with two seperate reservations. After being on the phone for a minimum of an hour, it was finally figured out. The only other bad experience was, we accidently left a bag in the room. After multiple phone calls I finally got a hold of the housekeeping manager and was able to pick up my bag, but instead of my brand new chuck taylors being in the bag, they were replaced with some funking joe boxer flipflops....at least everything else was in the bag, just a little weird! Now for the GOOD STUFF! This hotel is AMAZING! My three kids had an awesome time at the pool! For my two boys, Pirates came out everyday and interacted with the kids, there was sword fighting and a treasure hunt! For my daughter there was a mermaid that swam with kids and she would do their makeup! The lazy river was very relaxing and there were plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas to go around! If you felt like having a drink, the bar was steps away....a little pricey though! We ate at the restaurant and the food was awesome! They had the best salsa! The best part was that the kids ate free. The hotel staff was nice and the room was amazing! We had a corner room and we had an almost panaramic view of the island. I have some awesome pics!

I was a bit disappointed that the room was 2 queen beds instead of a king but the view was so great it made up for it. The room was nice and clean. The only issue we had with the room was with the wi-fi...it was incredibly slow and actually rarely worked at all. Thankfully we had our iPad and iPhones with 3G so that we were able to look up menus and make restaurant reservations. We didn't spend a lot of time at the pool, just a short time in the hot tub but it was enjoyable. The outdoor bar was very nice and the bartenders were great.

We called to ask for toothpaste the first night and I don't think it took more than 90 seconds for them to knock on our door with it. Elevators are slow and hard to get sometimes, especially since housekeeping uses the one on the far left. I really think they should have had their own elevator built somewhere else into the building because I can't tell you how many times we had to miss an elevator because that one was full of housekeeping staff and supplies, then wait even longer for another elevator to even stop at our floor. But that's small potatoes relative to everything else. The staff is friendly and welcoming. There is a pirate show and a mermaid that comes out to interact with the kids at the pool. The pool itself is wonderful with the lazy river. They do not make people vacate the pool when bad weather is moving in, which I did find to be a safety concern, but I was also smart enough to get out of and away from the pool.
