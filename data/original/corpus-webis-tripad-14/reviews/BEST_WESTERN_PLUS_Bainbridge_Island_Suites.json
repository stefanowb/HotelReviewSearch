The hotel is located across the street from Safeway (a grocery store) and many small restaurants/cafes. We actually went to the Mexican restaurant for a quick lunch, and it was quite tasty. The only downfall for the hotel was the continental breakfast. They had the usual toast, donuts, cereal, and fruit, but it seemed a little skimpy.

We were not quite ready for the BIG city life yet, but we were very pleased with the accommodations we did find. The Bainbridge Island Suites was clean and comfortable. Located in the center of town and across the street from a shopping center. It was nice to have such a great hotel location. I do have an especially favorite thing to share with you all here at Tripadvisor that I must mention. I met the General Manager Linda Thurrott, who was most helpful when we expressed interest in the local casino for gaming, dinner and entertainment. Linda obviously had connections because she arranged to have the casino pick us up and drop us off. We even came \"home\" to the hotel with a couple extra bucks. After traveling the fantastic Pacific Northwest and seeing nature at it's best, it was fun to have a couple days to regroup and adjust back to city life thanks to the assistance of Linda, her staff and the nice room at the beautiful Bainbridge Island Suites.
