One of the great things about this hotel is the free internet. You can tell the hotel is a tad dated, but is kept up very well. Another great thing is the mall which is next door and has a TGIFridays and Rainforest Cafe inside the mall. On the opposite end of the mall is a Bahama Breeze which is one of my favorites. You have to walk through the mall and through the parking garage to get there, but it is an easy walk. The bed was very comfortable and I had absolutely no problems at all during my stay.

Upon my arival at the bar I was forced to request menus, a circumstance that was due to the tender's inability to pay attention to myself and the rest of my party. After tossing the menus at us, an action which is unacceptable under any circumstance, we proceeded to order; now I must say, the food was wonderful, it was a highlight of the weekend. When it came time to pay the tender told us that \"oh by the way, there is a special on Killian's Red today, $2 bottles.\" Well, thanks for the update!! So I did what any sensible person would have done, asked if he could charge us for Killian's rather than the beers we drank? You would have thought that I asked this guy to part the Red Sea: \"Sir we are limited in the number of Killian's we have available for the special, and these are counted by my Manager.\" Dude, its beer, it grows on trees. Ok fine, I will accept his response, but does that mean that your manager would approve of you telling us about a special after we have paid? Is it that hard to use your noggin??

She more or less told me that I was wrong, and my story was inconsitent with her own, well no [--] there are inconsistencies, there are about 355 inconsistencies.
