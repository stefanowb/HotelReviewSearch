I was very excited when I booked this place because it seemed like a great location and cute and cozy. NONE OF THE ABOVE! I rented the suite up at the top. It's the one when you go all the way up the stairs to the left. Don't get me wrong I understand these places are old but this was way too much.. When we got up to our room there was cobwebs all over. The smell inside smelled like burnt flesh if that is even a smell. I had to call them 3 times to come and see about the smell because it was THAT bad. They had to put \"air\" cleaners in the room. They had 3 hooked up. They said we could keep them the entire weekend if we wanted, because that is a relaxing vacation. The air didn't work, it was HOT AND STICKY. The bathroom was DISGUSTING. There was hair all over the counter and the towels were stained and nasty. Let me go to the bed. It STUNK so bad that I refused to lay in it. I was actually scared that the sheets were not even clean. LONG story short, I was planning on staying here for 3 days and after 5 hours there I checked out and went to the HILTON, where I had a clean room and NICE people. BTW, did I mention that when I explained to the lady that I wanted to check out because of all these reasons she REFUSED and said I was LYING. I still had to pay 300 dollars because she said now they wont have a chance of getting anyone in the room and I caused them to LOOSE money.

The location is fabulous; in a quieter part of the Quarter but within walking distance of it all and close to Faubourg Marigny. A cinch to get in and out of by car and the free (AAA) parking was very appreciated. I felt well cared for by all of the staff, from the front desk to the valets and maids. Everyone was just plain nice and kind to me, even when I could tell they were having a hectic day. Breakfast was more than adequate. The muffins and danish fresh and warm; the coffee and juice delicious. Donna, who brought it to us every morning is a real sweetie. Our room was upstairs in the interior courtyard (overlooking a nice pool) and was quiet except for our neighbors who partied a tad bit hard one night. But, they were young and apologetic about it so we just smiled, remembering those days ourselves. Our room was very clean and well appointed with the \"worn around the edges charm\" of the Quarter. There is a refrigerator which came in handy and the beds were unbelievably comfortable. I would avoid the street rooms, though, as I would think them to be noisy.

This place is not one of them. We booked a \"double\" room, the room was ultra small. There was only one key when we checked in, which made me wonder who had the other one and if the lock had been changed since it was lost... Front desk was very non chalant about it and did not really think it was a big deal and was rude. The sink backed up, there is no shelf in the bathroom to put anything. Carpeting old and smelled. The heat was on in the entire hotel. It was close to 80 degees in our room. We slept with the door open and the shower running with cold water, as did our neighbors. which I am sure made the rats we saw very happy. We were told there were no fans available and there was no way the heat would be shut off. There were no windows to open. Front desk did not really care or ask how our stay was when we checked out.
