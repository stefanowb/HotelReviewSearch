The villas are spacious, clean and the views are incredible! We had afternoon entertainment from our deck each day watching people jump from the cliffs at Pirates Cave. The gounds are extremely plush, well maintained and beautiful. The staff were all very polite, soft spoken and friendly. We travel a lot and this was by far the most relaxing vacation we have ever taken. This resort would not be for everyone. If you are looking for a place with the large resort atmosphere and amminities, skip this hotel. If you are looking for a place to unwind, relax and enjoy your surroundings, by all means, this is the place for you. The water and hotel are everything you see on their web site - amazing! We knew the showers are open air but we didn't know the toliet was also open air. At first we were concerned about bugs in the bathroom, but we didn't see a single ant or bug the enire time we were there. We weren't bothered by any mosquitos as some people in past reviews. Another thing that was a pleasant surpise was the vendors were nothing like we have read about. If you simply tell them no thank you, they leave you alone. We spent a few days at the beach and found the same there. Plus, there were not nearly as many as we expected and they were very polite. We took the Southcoast Tour with Kenney Tours one day and we would highly recommend it. You get a real feel for Jamaica and it's people by exploring and our guide (Michael) was great. If I had one complaint, it would be that they need to update their on line menu. The food is the same but the prices are higher than they state. We did enjoy the food but I feel they should have a few simple items on the dinner menu also. If you have younger people with you, I am sure they might like a burger or sandwich as an option. We have read that many people enjoyed the food at Pirates Cave, and Sips and Bites but we didn't find it to be good at all. We also ate at Rick's one day and found it to be \"ok\" but not great.

Transportation is great, Kenny from Kenny Tours met us at the airport, and always had a driver at the front desk. For some activities I recommend taking a snorkel trip with Famous Vincent El Vira. He took my girlfriend and I out to the reef which was about a 25 minute boat ride. He then snorkeled with us, pointing out some amazing fish, and gave us food to feed the fish. It was nice to have our own private guide, as we were getting in the water a catamaran called the \"wild thing\" was dropping off about 35 people into the water which didnt look like much fun. The drinks at the hotel are awesome, watch out for Shane, he has a heavy hand when it comes to rum drinks. The SPA is amazing, we got a double 90 minute massage which was awesome.
