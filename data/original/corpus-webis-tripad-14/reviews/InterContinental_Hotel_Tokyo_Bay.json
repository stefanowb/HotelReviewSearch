Booked a \"city view\" (rather than the more expensive Bay View room), and got a pleasant view of the city and the river. Expedia rate wasnearly twice as much, so we knew we were getting a good deal. Room was large (for Japanese standards), with two double beds. Had we not been jetlagged, we might have asked for one queen bed (which was what we had requested), but we are both skinny so we just used one bed. Bed linens were gorgeous and bed heavenly. Bathrobes were provides, as were Elemis bath products. The huge (for Japan standards) bathroom contained both a shower and a lovely deep bathtub. Free internet upstairs in the \"business center\"; there were only two computers but we never had to wait. Room service at what appeared to be reasonable prices available at all ours. Faultless staff. Hotel was ten minutes' walk to the Hammamatsucho JR station; two minutes walk to the Takeshiba station. Area was close to the water nd not at all crowded. Overall, a GREAT deal. especially for the deeply discounted rate. Of course, a cheaper business hotel or tourist class hotel would have been cheaper, but it was wonderful yo have such luxury by paying just a bit more.", "title": "I wish I could live at the Intercontinental Tokyo Bay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PT1976", "date": "July 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34281781}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Positive:", "title": "Japanese exquisite service", "user": "magoulet", "date": "June 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 32323444}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006, traveled on business", "text": "Rooms are normally sized, the bathroom is excellent.
