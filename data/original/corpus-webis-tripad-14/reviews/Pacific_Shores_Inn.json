I made reservations in January and called twice before we arrived to make sure they could accommodate my second floor request as far away from the main road and closer towards the beach as possible. We checked in around 2 p.m. on Tuesday and were told our room was on the first floor. I reminded the clerk, who was extremely friendly, that I had requested otherwise. She then offered us a room on the second floor - but it was on the end right next to the road. She stated this was all they had available. I was quite disappointed and respectfully asked why my request hadn't been granted. She went to the back and spoke with someone and then offered to upgrade us. We were put on the 2nd floor about 2/3 the way down from the road. The room was very nice! Quite large with cathedral ceiling, lovely color scheme, comfortable beds, new flatscreen tv, floor to ceiling glass doors of which the ocean could be seen. The shower stall was exactly as reported on this web site; new but only half enclosed by glass and yes the water did spray all over the floor after showering.

As you stroll down the boardwalk, you will find ocean front shops and restaurants as well as the famous Belmont Park in Mission Beach.
