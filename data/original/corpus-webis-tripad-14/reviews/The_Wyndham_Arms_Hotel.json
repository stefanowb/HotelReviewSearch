The atmosphere downstairs was relaxed and homely. We were going to sit in the restaurant but changed our minds to sit in the bar as it is not your typical pub bar, but is warm and inviting. The food was AMAZING! One of the best meals I have ever eaten.

The staff were friendly and the food was great - although we couldn't manage three courses every night and a little too much Rock Salt was used. The atmosphere in the bar was lovely and i'm sure even better in the Winter with the fire going. Breakfast was the best we've had for ages, delicious bacon and sausages that were so packed full of meat - no gristle or added water. There was a problem with the timing of meals on one night due to a problem in the kitchen, but staff did their best and even offered a free drink. The road outside was also being resurfaced, but to be honest you didn't notice it other then to come and go from the hotel when you had to pick your route carefully.
