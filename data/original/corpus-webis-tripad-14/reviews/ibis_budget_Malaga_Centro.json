Only downfall is being so far away from the beach as this was the main puropse of our stay but you could still walk there in approx 20mins. The city centre was only approx 5 mins walk away. Was a little disappointed that you had to pay for wifi as a lot of other etap hotels have free access. The breakfast was also a little expensive for what you get so we just went to the supermarket down the road and got our own juice and crossionts for breakfast each morning.
