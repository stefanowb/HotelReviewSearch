The good news is that the location is wonderful. We walked everwhere from there: Covent Garden, Picadilly, Green Park, Hyde Park, Harrod's, St. Paul's, Tate Modern. Also good bus service to the South Bank (10 min. ride). It's also a wonderfully quiet street. Our room (#9) is on the 2nd floor (2 flights up) overlooking the back garden. Lovely tree facing our window. When we arrived (6 Oct), someone had left the heat on. It was stifling. We turned it off and went for a walk. No more heat problems. Weather in London was perfect during our visit. Now for the bad news. This hotel is very tired. We were looking forward to a charming B&B. Not this place. Don't confuse shabby with charming. It's inconsistent, actually. The carpet on the twisty, winding, steep staircase is newish and decent. The desk staff is helpful and nice. The room was small. The bed (a double) was small, the mattress thin, the box springs soiled and worn. The bedspread had seen better days. The tiny wardrobe doors were warped and hard to close. The hair dryer was from 1956, and the air stream on its highest setting wouldn't have harmed small insects. The dressing table was Formica and tarnished chrome. Tacky. The bathroom was definitely from Fawlty Towers: a step up took you into a room about 30\"x30\" including the toilet and a sink the size of a large saucer. The shower was pretty comical, maybe 21\" square tops. Don't drop the soap; the only way you'll retrieve it is to get out of the stall !! My wife and I are not large people, but for those who are, be warned to soap up well before you get in, so in case you get firmly wedged, there\u2019s some hope of exiting without help from the fire brigade. The door to the bathroom was on a spring-loaded hinge, and there was no way to keep it open, which one very much wanted to do to air it out after even a brief shower turned it into a Turkish bath. This is London from 50 years ago is all I can say. The breakfast was tasty: scrambled eggs with either smoked salmon or a mix of grilled breakfast meats. Of course the toast comes on that most wonderful of English inventions: the toast rack, designed, it would seem, to maximize the speed with which the contents are cooled. (Can the same race that designed this also have given us Radar and Shakespeare? It is one of the great mysteries of our western civilization.) The breakfast room is nice, even if the floor is pretty tippy on one side. The service staff, however, is also from Fawlty Towers: the lady in charge is sour and charmless, and don't dare ask for anything extra if want to avoid her icy glare and ill-concealed contempt. My wife and I couldn't wait to finish breakfast and leave. It is a very inhospitable environment, and made worse by the fact that the small crowded kitchen is open and in full view of the guests. It needs to be somewhere else. This isn't a lovely trendy sushi bar in the Ginza; it's an old stove and crowded counter with three unhappy people working in it and spreading their gloom throughout the premises. The owners are lovely; they should fire the kitchen staff lock, stock, and 2 smoking barrels. Their sour dispositions are reason enough to avoid The Thanet, or at the very least, breakfast there. I'm afraid I would not return. They need to spend a few thousand pounds on updating the furnishings and bathrooms, providing help with luggage on those miserable stairs, and hiring a kitchen staff that don\u2019t make the guests feel like inmates. They could spend it wisely, making visitors feel like it mattered to the owners that their guests were cozy and comfortable. (Basil, where are you when we need you?) My wife and I would gladly pay \u00a320 or \u00a330 more per night for an improved model. (Our room was \u00a3100.) That would still be a London lodging bargain. There are several hotels in Bedford Place. My guess is at least one of them is an improvement over The Thanet. You can do worse, but you can probably do better for not much more.
