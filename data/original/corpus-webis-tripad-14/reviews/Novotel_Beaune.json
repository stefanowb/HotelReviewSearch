However, a Cote de Boeuf at Eur 8 supplement was over the top and the restaurant staff were ignorant of the wines they were serving and how - which right next door to some of the finest Burgundy wine growers is inexcusable!! I can only assume staff training is lacking on the finer points of restaurant service - however, the chef is to be recommended and the meal I had was excellent, though perhaps a little rushed? Reception was first class and the desk staff helpful. I don't know how good their English was but hopefully OK. I'm not entirely convinced I'd stay there again for just one night as the room and meals cost me Eur 210, which in French francs is 1373 !! The Burgundy I asked for was dreary and very ordinary at Eur 24 and no better than a carafe table wine - I think its probably this that has left me with a slightly negative impression, but as a Hotel it was fine.
