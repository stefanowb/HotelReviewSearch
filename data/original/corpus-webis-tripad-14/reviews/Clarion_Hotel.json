It's a little tricky to find (especially if you're following your GPS) but there is a sign by the main road and the hotel sits in the back. I was surprised at the front of the hotel and my apprehension waned a little at seeing it. (It looks nice from the front!) My friend checked us in (so I don't know what the lobby looks or smells like) but then our instructions were to drive around to the back door (door #5). That is when my apprehensions returned.... The parking lot is very poorly lit and weeds growing in it, and wooded in the back (I wouldn't want to be out there alone at night!). We got to the door we were instructed to go to in and tried swiping our card at the \"security box\" only to find that our key wasn't working... well, the door wasn't locked and there is no \"security\" which is why our key wasn't working. The appearance inside was average but the elevator was scary.... It creeks and pops all the way up (where they usually display the license in the elevator there was a sign that said the license was available to view on file in the office - or something to that effect). Somehow our room was on the \"business class\" level of the hotel. (It left a lot to be desired if this was an upgrade!!) The room appeared clean but is in desperate need of upgrades (which is not a big deal). I'm sure it was a very nice room in the 80's.... The shower has a jacuzzi tub that cannot be used (the \"on/off\" switch was gone) - not that I'd want to use it! The center of the tub was raised, possibly water has gotten between the floor and the actual tub? I was content with the room until the next morning when I opened the curtains and noticed the wallpaper around the window is peeling and there was mold all the way around the window. I later learned that the window was open a crack and WILL NOT shut - which is probably the cause of the mold. I think if this hotel was properly cared for it could be a nice hotel despite the needed upgrades, but in it's current condition I would not recommend this hotel to anyone (unless they were getting it SUPER CHEAP!!)

The first sign of a problem is after you pay and get into your car to drive to the guest parking area. The area was formerly gated, but the gate arms were removed and all of the signs and electronic equipment was left out there to let you know that at least there was formerly security.

Same with the card entry into the building - after swiping my card a few times I realized that the security thing didn't even work and you could just open the door and walk in.
