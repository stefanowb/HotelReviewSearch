Tucked away from the busy Roman streets, our room was the perfect sanctuary after a long day of exploring. All rooms face an open courtyard, which really reduces noise levels and makes you feel like you are a local, rather than a tourist. The room was very pleasant and decently sized for Europe. We had a full bathroom and two beds. Everything was meticulously cleaned. When we woke up in the mornings, the breakfast would be laid out for us: several kinds of toast and pastry, spreads such as patte and peanut butter, espresso and juice. It always kept us going until lunch! The room-keeper, Tom, was very helpful with directions and good restaurants. Also, the B&B was in an excellent location: a few blocks from the Termini, right around the corner from a metro station, and about a 15-minute walk to the Coliseum and Forum. For around \u20ac120 per night for a triple room, it met all of our requirements and more. We would definitely stay here again.", "title": "Fantastic B&B", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "dogbone1002000", "date": "April 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7291782, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, cleanliness, price", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "New but nice", "text": "Still working out some kincks but has good potential.
