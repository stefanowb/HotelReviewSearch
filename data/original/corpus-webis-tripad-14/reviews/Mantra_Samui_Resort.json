We were grossly disappointed with this hotel (and I almost never write scathing reviews) and was the WORST hotel we stayed at in Thailand. First, this is NOT a five or four star resort but a three-star budget hotel frequented by tour groups who I assume get a really good deal on the price- have no delusions this is a high end luxury resort. Yes the hotel has great views of the bay but as previously reported it is high on a hill- this provides a scary ( and I mean scary) incline at >85 degrees on the property requiring buggy rides to go up and down; The incline is so severe that we both almost fell off the buggy while coming up which is quite frankly dangerous-i doubt this hotel would have been approved in for safety in the US. The food at the restaurant is okay and service there was decent though when we asked for water we got the \"cheeky\" reply of \"Its over there you can get up and get it yourself\" though this was done with a smile! The spa is a good value and the staff was quite nice. The rooms are cheap and tatty- desperately trying to be a high end hotel like the Standard or Mondrian in LA but fall grossly below those standards. The bathroom becomes completely wet after a shower since there is no proper door to the shower only a glass wall.", "title": "Cheeky with love, means Rude with an Excuse......", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "sguntupalli", "date": "August 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 170402746}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel offers some nice free amenities such as Wi-Fi and calls to anywhere in the world BUT charges you for in room coffee/snacks which are free at other properties.", "title": "Wonderful Resort", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "michael c", "date": "August 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 170362388}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The worst part however was the rude and abnoxious, \"cheeky\" front office staff (if you can call it that as it an open air room without a real front desk).
