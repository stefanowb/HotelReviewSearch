If you are traveling with someone, the small room may not suffice. However the rooms, even the small one are chic and super clean. The gym is small too but adequate and very clean. The most impressive part of my stay was by far the staff. First class and professional and well trained. Sig the manager is walking the property often and you can see the positive results.
