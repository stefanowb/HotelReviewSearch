We booked which was good because the place was packed (and we had to park 5 minutes walk away). Reservations were handled well and we got a table where we could see the steaks being cooked. My husband was disappointed with the range of beers on tap and the only wine I liked the sound of was $11/glass (and it wasn't really to my liking when I tasted it). We queued up to order our steaks. The line was quite long but moved fast. It is always great to be able to see the cuts of meat in the window; so to an extent you know what you are getting. All steaks come with choice of sauce, salad and potato and bread roll. Despite the number of steaks being cooked, the meals arrived in reasonable time. My steak was cooked as requested but my husband says his was a little rarer than medium-rare. Perhaps it was the cut we chose (both had rib fillet), but we were disappointed as the steaks were nothig to rave about; especially considering the price we paid. We wouldn't visit again.", "title": "slightly disappointed", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MarjofromBrissie", "date": "December 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 121335109}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Magnificent Steaks", "text": "Eating in the new eatery created from the ashes of the old bottleshop, we had the chance to enjoy pure meat lovers heaven. While the side salad was enjoyable and the baked spuds great, words couldn't do justice to the taste and texture of our steaks. Two rumps and two rib fillets were cooked to perfection (no mean feat as the requests ranged from well done to medium-rare). The melt in your mouth texture was superb and the flavour of the beef was unbelievable. Without a doubt the best steaks in Brisbane by the proverbial country mile.

Varioius cuts are on offer i.e. Rump, Rib Fillet, Eye, T Bone. The Norman is about 5kms from the CBD on the southside. It has a large outdoor dining area and is frequented mainly by locals. All steaks come with salad, baked potato and a bread roll. No fuss good quality food. Being a hotel it also has an extensive range of beers, wine and spirits.
