I recall fairly specifically being advised that both offered \"parking\". As a previous writer has stated this is not on site and is an NCP car park a couple of hundred yards away. Leave your cases in reception before parking. Our only gripe has to be the noise caused by people leaving a nearby pub or club, we were on the second floor facing the street and were disturbed every night. The lack of double glazing does not help. If you are a sound sleeper or use earplugs then you should have no worries about the hotel, the staff are excellent, the bar and lounge areas are very pleasant and the food very good (although the eat as much as you like breakfast buffet could be a bit more appetising). Our room was a large double with a comfortable bed and pleasant and relaxing lounge area.", "title": "Shame about the noise", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "joniUk", "date": "April 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 15502789, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendliness of staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Noise"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed here with two friends while in Aberdeen for a gig.
