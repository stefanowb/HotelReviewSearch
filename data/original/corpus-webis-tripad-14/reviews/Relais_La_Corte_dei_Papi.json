We stayed in one of the cottages, which had it's own little front patio, perfect for drinking wine in the afternoon. Also, the restaurant is an experience not to be missed. We had three delicious dinners there - the highlight being the tagliata. And we highly recommend the cooking class - a very fun experience and a great introduction to Tuscan cuisine.

David was a wonderful host, very friendly and helpful. He worked tirelessly to make our experience special. We ate one night in the restaurant on the property and the food was delicious and the wine list was long and diverse. For sure order the pasta, and the chocolate dessert was to die for. The second night, we wanted casual so David suggested the local pizza restaurant which was a short taxi away. It was fabulous and full of local families enjoying a night out. Breakfast at Corte dei Papi consisted of fresh baked breads, yogurts, granola, cheeses, salamis, and fruit and of course lots and lots of cappuccino. The town of Cortona was a 5 minute car ride away and we loved walking the narrow cobble stone streets and ducking in and out of wine shops and cafes. Our bike ride from Corte dei Papi to Tuoro and back was challenging but gorgeous...I would do it again in a heartbeat.
