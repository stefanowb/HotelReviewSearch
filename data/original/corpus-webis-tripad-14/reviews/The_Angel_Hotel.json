Our car being parked for us by the porter was a great start. We had pre-lunch drinks in the stunning lounge area, which had several different extremely comfortable and beautifully furnished areas to choose from. We had a lovely table in the restaurant and our 3-course set menu meal was fabulous - can't fault a thing. The service was friendly and professional and the whole experience has made me want to go back there and stay rather than just having a long, luxurious, leisurely lunch! 10 out of 10!", "title": "Lunch at The Angel", "user": "Frostipops", "date": "October 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 142565314}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Great time here from check in to check out.

Then we saw here and 2 other colleagues walk in with a birthday cake for guest sthat had dined, which again we had no problem with which they sang Happy Birthday to and then cut the cake.Eventually the lady returned ( this was now 15 minutes after she 1st spoke to us) and asked if we were guests or had dined there. We advised no. She advised as neither she could not serve us as it was to busy!!!! I asked why did she not ask this in the 1st instance and it was no longer busy as many tables and chairs were now empty.
