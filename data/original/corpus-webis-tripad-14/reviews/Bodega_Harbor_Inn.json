A couple weeks later, we got a call saying that they had double booked, and we would be staying at the Harbor House instead. Of course, this was ok, as it was an upgrade. Unfortunately, the evening before we set out to Bodega Bay, we got another call saying they had to move us again, this time to Pelican House. They assured us that it was the same value, which we assumed was \"Pelican 2.\" When we arrived, we learned that in fact they had downgraded us, and placed us in \"Pelican 1\" which was listed as a cost of $135. No apologies on their part. When we went to our room, it had a musty smell... and it was really nothing to write home about. The room was separated from \"Pelican 2\" with a paper thin wall. We tried to watch a movie that night, but the DVD player didn't work correctly (we played the DVD when we got home and it worked fine). At about midnight or so, the power went off completely, and stayed off until we checked out. When we went to complain the morning about having been downgraded from a private cottage to a house that had very little privacy, the manager was quite rude to us and tried to justify her actions by saying that we hadn't complained when we had been \"upgraded\" (funny, because I don't consider it an upgrade when we don't have a choice in the matter). Further, no apologies or politeness about the lack of power was offered. Basically, we found the staff to be incredibly rude, and unprofessional, and the room to be very plain, and far overpriced. What would have been an otherwise very nice trip to the area, and a lovely gift in the form of a stay at a cottage, was ruined by a staff that was rude and dishonest.", "title": "Don't even think about it", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "tadanoryokosha", "date": "April 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 28369953}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The woman that owns and runs the inn, couldn't have been nicer!

I stopped by the Inn office the next morning to obtain the phone number and was advised that the phones are being removed next week and she no longer had the phone number for that house. She said that if someone needed to reach us, they could call the Inn and she would walk a message down to us, a block away. (They have limited office hours and when we arrived at 7:30PM, the office was closed so I knew this could be a problem).
