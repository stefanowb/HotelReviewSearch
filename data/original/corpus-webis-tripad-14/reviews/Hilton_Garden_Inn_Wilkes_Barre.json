They also gave us vouchers for the casino as well. The room wasn't huge, but it was perfect for my boyfriend and I. We didn't take advantage of the breakfast in bed deal or even the breakfast but it looked good, next time we come down we'll have to try it. We walked over to the arena from the hotel, about a 5 minute walk. There is also a sushi/hibachi restaurant right next to the hotel that was an amazing dinner. There are also several other restaurants, liquor store, Walmart...basically anything you might need within walking distance from the hotel.

We originally went to the Holiday Inn Express but the hotel was booked with wedding guests. This turned out to be our good fortune. The Hilton Garden Inn is an awesome hotel. As the reviews state, the hotel is centrally located, right off the I81 with a variety of restaurants and shopping in the close vicinity. The rooms are large bright and clean with very comfortable beds. One night turned into two nights due to unfortunate stomach upset but that also turned into out in our favor. After calling the front desk to book an additional night and resting until 12 pm, my husband and I ventured out for some lunch. The hotel has a wonderful patio out front and since it was such a beautiful day, we soaked up the sun and enjoyed the wonderful mountain view. I then decided to take a swim in the pool. The pool was clean and had none of that strong chlorine smell that is found so often in indoor hotel pools. The coffee and fresh baked cookies in the lobby were wonderful. There was a number of staff that we met over the two days and all were friendly and very accommodating. We loved the hotel so much that we decided to return on our way back to Canada two weeks later. The front desk clerk remembered us and welcomed us back to the hotel. Very impressive. We will definitely make this hotel a place to stop on our trips down south.
