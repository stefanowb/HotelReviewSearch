Instead she was lavished with attention and fuss and was even taken of our hands so we could enjoy our main course in peace. One night when she had had enough they even brought dessert up to our room so our monster could nibble my cheese board. Deciding what to eat at dinner was a serious deliberation, if I could of stayed longer to try all the meals I would of. The menu was extraordinary and every bite full of flavours and taste. I am no expert but I KNOW it was that good! Our hosts were lovely the service made you feel like a lottery winner and the room was a comfy warm delight. Also for those with children you could pop 50 yards to the right of the building to tire the little one out at the lovely park, stroll though the village with all its shops and cafes or hop on the bus and abandon the car to get everywhere!

On the following day we again departed for a days walking and on return was confronted by the hotel owner who, in front of other guests started to berate us for not returning in time for dinner. Again I stated that we had not booked for dinner, bed & breakfast but that did not seem to satisfy him as he continued to berate us in front of the other guests. It was at this point that we stated that there was obviously a mistake in the booking and we would sort it out in the morning as it was now late and we were both tired for the day out.", "title": "Three night break", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Ros J", "date": "April 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 156702294}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 12, "very good": 64, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 356}, "aka": "Oak Bank Grasmere", "slim_ranking": 0.166666666667, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Nestled in Grasmere Village in the heart of the English Lake District, Oak Bank Hotel is perfectly placed to explore the surrounding lakes, fells and tarns.
