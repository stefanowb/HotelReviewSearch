Loved the walk-in wardrobe and really appreciated the lovely closet that contained a fridge and 2 hob cooker with kettle. Hob little slow to boil kettle so put on before you have shower. Bedroom really nice. T.V. is enclosed in lovely cabinet that matches headboard. Bathroom really clean and looks like it has been refurbished very recently. Weather hot while we were there but our room AC was excellent. Really nice Deli nearby . We will go back to the Bedford again. Grand Central Station two minutes away.
