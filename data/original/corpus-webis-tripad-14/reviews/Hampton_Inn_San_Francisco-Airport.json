The front desk staff were just great and very personable with us. We did appreciate the food offered for breakfast as it was quick and light. There is a nice area for seating to eat or to just read the newspaper. The room was a little larger than the typical offerings at other Hampton Inns around the country. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone flying in or out of San Francisco as a jumping off point for other cities you may be travelling to. I have seen a few of the other reviews of the hotel with regard to needing renovation, in my case however, the room was very clean, the entry was exceptional. Having been here before, I even asked if I could be next to the elevator in this hotel-I know, who does that? But you cannot hear the elevator at all as it moves and having doors opening with sound etc. The sound-proofing is the best, so don't be afraid to ask for a room next to them if you would like to have really easy access to in and out of the place.
