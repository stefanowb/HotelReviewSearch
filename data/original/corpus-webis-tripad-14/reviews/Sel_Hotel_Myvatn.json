I went in Feb. 2007 with my husband and his parents and we had the time of our life. The people at the hotel are INCREDIBLY helpful with anything you can think of. The package I booked included breakfast and dinner. Breakfast consisted of a buffet and dinner was a preset 3 course menu. All the meals were wonderful and in fact the trout was the best I have ever tasted. If you have dietary restrictions, I am sure they could accomodate. As with all things in iceland .. things are expensive. Their are a number of excursions you can book through the hotel. In fact you do yourself a diservice if you do not get out and explore. We took Nordic horses accross the frozen lake, took a super jeep out to a remote section of the island to see waterfalls, took a tour around the lake to see the bubbling sulphur pots, bore holes and lava fields. Another thing not to miss is the Mytvatn nature baths, a geothermal pool outside in the mountain side. We stayed at the hotel for about 3 days which is enough to take everything in. We were lucky to catch the northern lights by taking a quick walk away from the hotel lights. The hotel is def. not a five star by US standards, but the rooms are big enough, the beds are comfortable. The only downside was the mini size sink in the bathroom and the small stand up shower. The bathroom floors however are heated and there are heated towel racks which are a bonus.", "title": "Love Sel Hotel Myvatn", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "vicky95", "date": "February 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6821448, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The surroundings and food", "disliked": "\u2014 Expensive"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Nice hotel over looking the Pseudo craters.
