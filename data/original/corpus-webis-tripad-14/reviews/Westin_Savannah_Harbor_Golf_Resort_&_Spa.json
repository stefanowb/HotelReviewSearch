This hotel makes an amazing first impression. The exterior is grand, the lobby is gorgeous and the grounds are perfectly kept. The riverfront location can't be beat - we loved watching the huge cargo ships going up and down the river all day. This hotel is located across the river from downtown Savannah so you must take a ferry to get to most things. The ferry runs on a prompt schedule so it's really not a hassle.", "user": "thechandlers", "date": "March 10, 2011", "id": 99605951}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great location and views!", "text": "I say this hotel lacks service because during my stay I got sick with a 24 hour stomach flu. I spent the first day of my vacation in bed, unable to eat anything. We made several calls to room service thoughout the day to order Gatorade and water. We let them know I was sick and needed these items quickly. They didn't care - one order took an hour and 45 minutes - for a drink. There is just no excuse for that. I understand they have other guests they are trying to take care of, but when a guest teels you they are in bed sick and they need a drink, it shouldn't take that long.", "user": "Sarah4898", "date": "March 8, 2011", "id": 99395095}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Westin-You can't go wrong!", "text": "Thankfully on the second day of our vacation I felt much better and we were able to sightsee.

We got a great deal on the room since there were no conventions in town. The location is great and the views from the hotel are amazing. The water taxi to River Street is a great feature. The hotel was nice and quiet, and we didn't hear other guests the entire time we were there. The hotel is fairly new, and the rooms and bathrooms are nice. The only negative is that the employees don't know when the water taxi comes. We were given several different answers, and finally got a printed schedule from the 3rd employee we talked to. He however did not tell us the correct place to catch the taxi, so we had to wait for the next one.
