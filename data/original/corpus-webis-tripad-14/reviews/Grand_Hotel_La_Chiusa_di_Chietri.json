We chose this hotel as it looked tas if it had a traditional and modren combination. We were taken in by the lovely photos showing traditional houses of the area. The reality was quite different. The first room we were given was the most depressing hotel room I have ever been in. In was on the first floor of the modern block, it was furnished in dark red and gold cheap looking furnishing and horrible cheap looking furniture the walls were bare . The curtains (and horrible nets ) were drawn so on a lovely day it was so gloomy . The view was a concrete wall opposite. We asked to be moved and were given the same room , same furnishings with a small dirty balcony over looking a building site where a pack of wild dogs procreated . We decided to check out the following morning and loose the cost of the second night already paid. We discussed this with reception who were disinterested . As it was late and we were tired we ate in the hotel and were pleasantly suprised the food was good and the outdoor dining space was pretty. The outdoor swimming pool was nice . Breakfast was served in what can only be described as a windowless conference room with false lighting the breakfast was dreadful and the room was shocking for a hotel of this standard . We could have been anywhere there was no sense of Italy and it really felt like a impersonal hotel. In the morning there were buisiness people meeting in the hotel and the public area was taken over with this.", "title": "We booked for 2 nights and stayed for one", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "AnnaSussex", "date": "July 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 34420907}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We moved, on after one night the following 3 hotels we stayed in were of similar cost but a far more positive experience .", "title": "Trulli fine !", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "caro103", "date": "June 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 32544556}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at this hotel as clients of Page & Moy and were in the main, pleased with our choice.", "title": "Very disappointing and with poor service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NorthSomersetMike", "date": "May 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 29959295}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with family", "text": "As we were out almost every day of our stay on pre-booked coach excursions we were not duly bothered by the site of the hotel which is isolated but in beautiful countryside some 4 km. from Alberobello.

On route to the coast to the hotels private beach location in Capitolo near Monopoli. The place is called PelleRossa, well this has changing facilities, bar, loungers and a restaurant with fresh pasta and ice cold drinks. There are plenty of places to visit and soak up the Puglian lifestyle - Ostuni with its historic white town pearched on the top of the hill, Fasano with the Zoo Safari (my children enjoyed the visit and the dolphin show) and then the breath taking town of Poligniano a Mare. Back to the hotel every afternoon to enjoy the pool and round sun sunbeds, enjoyed with a Aperol Spritz cocktail mixed at the bar. Dinner was great with a choice from an A la Carte menu, fresh pasta each night followed by a selection of Meat or Fish then fruit or a Italian dessert. Each night we ate outside in the courtyard with live soft music and candle light. The staff were very helpfull but on a Sunday its a bit more hectic with the Puglian buffet instead of the normal A la Carte. The hotel also has a small trulli village which you can stay in too.

It is a very large hotel but so well designed that you don't feel it. All the rooms for our tour were first rate, and had balconies looking over the landscape. The food was first rate, interesting, and the service good, particularly considering the number of people being served. A lot of people came there for dinner just because it was self-evidently good. I guess it might be expensive for individuals, but as we were within a tour, we were not aware of that nor did we feel we had a particularly restricted menu. They also catered for weddings in a different part of the hotel and which did not impinge at all on ones sleep etc. I can only speak for the part of the hotel we were in.
