I was impressed with this hotel from day one. It was easy to deal with the Director of Sales, Gagan. He made this event a pleasure. For beginners they had put all our rooms close together, they even had directions printed to our venue, and he even let our girls use the banquet area for a pizza party for free, he helped us get discounted rates on pizza. The staff was very friendly , cheerful, and efficient. We had all our keys ready and waiting for us at the front desk, the express checkin helped our teams reach their competition on time.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "NewjerseyWright", "date": "June 28, 2006", "id": 5397933}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Shabby, they didn't want my business", "text": "The hotel was well maintained, the rooms were clean, and modest the indoor pool was in working order.

The last room, -again no heat, but the staff realized the whole bottom floor had no heat- there was heat on the 2nd floor, but no rooms rented out due to new carpet being installed (constant banging all night). Ants were still there, but they did give us some bug spray to use! A fellow visitor had 5 children get sick from the lack of heat, and requested her $$ back as well.
