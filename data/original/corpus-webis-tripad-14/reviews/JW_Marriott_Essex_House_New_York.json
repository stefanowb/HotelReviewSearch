In recent trips we've stayed at the Parker Meridien, the Michaelangelo and the Soho Grand, and liked them all. At the Essex House, my husband and I stayed in a park view King on the 14th floor and our kids stayed in a two-queen bedded interior room on the 14th floor, not connecting. Both rooms had been redone nicely, although the kids' room (1425) had a nicer and larger bathroom than ours (1405). Our king room was small as compared to the Michaelangelo, but not compared to the Parker Meridien. We borrowed the hotel's four complimentary, first-come, first-served bicycles to tour Central Park. This was great, even though two of the bikes were a little small for our boys. The location of the hotel on Central Park South between 6th and 7th makes it ideal for exploring or running in the park. We found all the staff to be friendly. We enjoyed the expensive but very nice breakfast buffet ($37). We enjoyed the bar with views right onto Central Park South. Only negatives: there is quite a space under the hotel room doors so when drunken partiers come in at 3 am you get to enjoy their conversation as the pass by your door, and our kids room was right next to an elevator, which did emit some mechanical noises. This is tough for me, a light sleeper, but never bothered our kids. Final negative is that it seems as though there was more of a line at the front desk than there should have been for a property at this price point. However, I must say that our kids' room was really large for NY and with two queens and a large bathroom, a great option for people sharing a room. They had three large windows that looked out onto nothing, but which brought the light in. Apparently, the highest floor on which these two queen rooms are available is the 14th floor.

Our requests for ice, extra glasses etc. were taken care of in minutes and the lady giving the wake up call in the morning even mentioned the weather (it's snowing outside). Very impressive. The Lobby is grand and the rooms are stunning. I especially loved the extra comfy beds and large mirrors in the room. Having Central Park right outside just adds to the fantastic value. We had a romantic dinner once in their restaurant (which is quite hidden). Food and service was great, couldn't have asked for more.
