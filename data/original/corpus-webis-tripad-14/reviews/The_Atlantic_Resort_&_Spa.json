Lauderdale instead of the Ritz right down the street. I was less than overwhelmed to say the least. The front desk girl was less than interested to have us there and was just doing her job checking us in. I admit that we arrived early and they gave us a room but, make me feel like you care. We stayed in an oceanfront suite and it was nice but, not what I read about. The wallpaper was peeling off of the walls in the bathroom, there was only one robe for two people and there was water pouring in from the room upstairs into the bathtub. Engineering came to look at it and after going upstairs to see what the issue was, the light above the bathtub was left apart. Needless to say, she did not use the tub. The shower was excellent and the hotel staff did leave us with a very nice birthday surprise of cupcakes. The concierge, through our travel agent, was supposed to make reservations at Casa DeAngelos but, when we arrived, there was none. (Excellent restaurant by the way). Finally, we booked through our Virtuoso travel agent which gave us a free breakfast and $100 spa credit. I had to ask for it when checking in and was told the $100 would be credited to my bill at checkout. It was not and as for the continental breakfast, it was horrible. The breads were stale and the eggs were sitting there forever and tasted as such.

We looked forward to the stay all week after booking one of the hotel's more expensive King Oceanfront suites. While the room, bathroom, and view were all lovely, we found it difficult to enjoy them. When we checked in the front desk staff did not inform us the pool would be closed at 3pm on both Friday AND Saturday due to private events. They also neglected to inform us the private events were weddings, including DJs and sound systems, taking place on the pool deck just a few floors below the room and balcony we spent quite a bit of money to enjoy. Rather than leaving the sliders open to enjoy the fresh air and ocean sounds we had to close them dull the noise from below both nights until 10-11pm. It's outrageous that a hotel would not notify guests of the situation and give them the option of moving to a room in another location. In addition to the noise below our room, we had a door adjoining the room next door that provided absolutely no soundproofing. We could clearly hear the loud conversations of the three or four 20-something young ladies both during the day (even from the bathtub) as well as at 2:00am when they returned from a night of drinking at the bars. We called to complain about both of these issues and were told the hotel was booked and we could not be moved. We certainly were not offered any other type of compensation and our stay at The Atlantic was a disappointing one. We certainly did not get the romantic and relaxing experience we paid for.", "title": "Not the romantic getaway we hoped for...", "user": "galsolo", "date": "November 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120599898}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I enjoyed a quick get away for our anniversary at the Atlantic and loved it! We stayed in an ocean front room, the room was quite large and very comfortable. As others have noted the bathroom was gorgeous with quite possibly the greatest shower that I have ever experienced in my life. We also enjoyed the balcony which looked out upon the beach and the ocean across the street. I also have to mention the staff, as they were among the friendliest and most pleasant that we have ever encountered. So after all these accolades you may be wondering why I only rated the Atlantic very good instead of excellent, it is due to the pigeons in the pool area. Never have I seen such aggressive birds, one went so far as to try and land on a man's shoulder while he ate lunch at the pool bar. You had to be careful not to sit or lean on bird poop when sitting by the bar (I learned this the hard way). Also the birds were landing in the pool as well as on the surfaces in the food prep areas. Not sure if there is anything that a hotel can do about pigeons in an outdoor area but it ruined the pool bar for us. We were planning on enjoying happy hour there on our last night but couldn't take the birds literally landing on the bar right next to us. Only other complaint would be that we found the breakfast to be pricey (it is the only meal that we ate in the hotel restaurant) but loved the hotel bar in the evening. Again, great staff and service (thanks Helen!) and a delicious appitizer (Butternut Squash Wontons). We would not hesitate to go back to the Atlantic and will probably make it our first choice when planning our next trip to Ft. Lauderdale but will not eat at the pool if the birds are still a problem.", "title": "Great spot, great service, great hotel!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BKPSlope", "date": "November 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120335838}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed at the Atlantic Hotel for our honeymoon and all we can say is wow!
