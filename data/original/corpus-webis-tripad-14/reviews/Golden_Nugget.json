I told them we had a 5pm dinner reservation and asked if there was anything they could do. They gave us a double bed room instead of the king we wanted. We had no choice. He wasn't sure how long we would have to wait for a king... And being it was already 4:05- time was right. Don't assume that you will get your room at 4pm when it's check in time.
