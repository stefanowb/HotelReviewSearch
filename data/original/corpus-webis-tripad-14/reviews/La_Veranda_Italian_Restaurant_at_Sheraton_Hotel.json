Unfortunately La Veranda cannot be rated in the same way. I had one brunch and one dinner over there, and did not find anything to impress me, on the other hand, was both times quite disappointed. There is a huge turn over of personnel in Doha hotels, so I guess that things will get better when they will change the people currently taking care of the restaurant. Last note: yes, Italian restaurant...but not really that much. Not extremely expensive.", "user": "Fabio_NY", "date": "February 24, 2012", "id": 125130043}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited December 2011", "text": "Menu, gual\u0131ty and serv\u0131ce was perfect,", "title": "HAR\u0130KA YEMEK,HAR\u0130KA MANZARA", "user": "jale34", "date": "January 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 123543358}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited January 2012", "text": "We celebrated my granddoughters b\u0131rth day and enjoyed a lot,", "title": "The spartan appearance deceives ...
