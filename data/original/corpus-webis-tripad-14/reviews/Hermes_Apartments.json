The included air con in the room was a godsend and along with the cleanliness of the room and ease to get to local beaches it made for a very enjoyable holiday. The water taxi nearby was a great way to get into Skiathos town and the restuarants that we visited were all of a very good standard. A boat cruise around the island is a nice leisurely way to see everything and if you are more adventurous a day trip to Athens is worth it. I would recommend these apartments and Skiathos as a great relaxing holiday.

It is a lovely hotel, clean, friendly, great food. The location is great, you have three beaches to choose from all are really lovely with a taverna on each beach offering traditional Greek food all day. It is easy to get into town by bus but try to avoid traveling between 7 & 8 as they are really busy, but the water taxi is only a 10 min walk and only cost 3 euros it's a much nicer way to travel in to town. The bus back runs late and only takes 10 mins. The hotel is so well located the you can travel to all the other great beaches on the island on the bus taking between 2 and 10 mins. My 2 children aged 6 and 3 had such a wonderful time on this beautiful island everything from the hotel to the tavernas and resturants were really child friendly. The Sea at all the beaches shelves down slowly enough for the children to enjoy swimming or just splashing about and the snorkling was good fun. Everyone we met had a great time at this hotel and i can't recommend it enough the staff are excellent and there were families and couples both young and old. I think you would find it hard to beat this island it is beautiful and the whole island is easily to get around. Alot of Greek people choose to holiday here so i think it speaks for itself. Skiathos town is lovely to travel into in the evening with lots of resturants and bars. The Windmill is a great place to eat with fantastic views.", "title": "Lovely Hotel, Beautiful Island", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "BrightonDeRossi", "date": "September 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8706087, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, Food, Cleanliness, Freindly", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned from one week staying at the Hermes in Skiathos. The apartments are spotless and the air con a godsend. It operates automatically whenever you are in the room and is essential in July and August with temps in the 90's. Food is really good at the taverna/restaurant offering greek food at reasonable prices. The supermarket is handy with everything you would need. The location is ideal for a beach based holiday with easy access into Skiathos Town. There are 3 beaches within easy walking distance but the best in our opinion is Kolios Beach at this time of year. Vrolominmos is too crowded in July/Aug. Getting into town is a problem by bus between 6 and 8 as the buses are full with people returning from Koukinaries Beach. However the Water Taxi is only a 10 min walk away and a good way to get into town for 3 euros. Bus is fine to return before 1.00am.
