We had a nice time but there were some kinks in this trip. The first kink we experienced was using the magic express service with an 8:20p.m. arrival time. Nobody suggested to us that this was a mistake but we soon figured this out. The shuttle to the hotel was excellent with no wait time. However, the bags take 2-3 hours to arrive. This would have worked fine if it had been a daytime arrival but with little tired children this was a disaster. We had no clothes, no toothbrushes, toothpaste(thanks to new airline restrictions), or pajamas. To top it off we were given a room that had dead batteries in the doorlock so we were locked out of our room for over an hour while my husband stayed with crying children and I walked back and forth through the maze of buildings in the dark for each of three different sets of keys, none of which worked. They finally sent a repair man to the room who fixed it very quickly but it was now midnight. We shut the door and 5 minutes later after we had tucked the kids to bed in their clothes the bags arrived. Riverside did give us our first night free because of all the trouble, which I greatly appreciated. The shuttle system was VERY slow. It would take up to 40 minutes at times during the day to get a shuttle to the park, and we went during an off peak time. At the park we would watch bus after bus roll up and have to stop to load disabled scooter bound folks on the bus. This took approximately 20 minutes per scooter and on one day I watched as four scooters piled up in a line waiting for a bus. This caused huge delays. Disney shuttle service has never been this slow and I believe it is due to the increase in the use of these motorized scooters. I hope they will tweak their system to accomodate more disabled people travelling to their parks. Right now it is a disaster for all. If I came again I would stay at a park directly serviced by monorails or I would rent a car. The shuttle service at the end of a busy funfilled day sucks the magic right out of it. I also would not recommend using the Disney express if you have a flight time after 4pm with little children with early bedtimes. We also chose the dining program which is very nice but you have to book all your dinners well in advance because you will find nothing available anywhere when you get there. We found that the dining plan has filled up all the restaurants, even some of the ones that used to be empty like Tony's in Disney. All in all the kids had a fabulous time and the parks itself are as always wonderful.", "title": "shuttle system not what it used to be", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "lauridale", "date": "September 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 5880961, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 nice clean room", "disliked": "\u2014 layout very spread out, long walk to lobby and bustop"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We just returned from a three-night stay at the Port Orleans Riverside.

This was our very first Disney World Trip. We have children 13, 9, 6, and 3, and they had a blast. We drove from Texas, which took forever and stayed in a two off site hotels for the first 3 nights. And what a awesome change..The off sites were HOJO's, the first of which was totally disgusting(Enchanted), the second was as hotels/motels go, but way better than the first. But I digress. POR was great. From the time we checked in, till the day we checked out. The staff was very helpful with answering questions a first timer had and housekeeping was great. We didn't get any special towel animals or anything, but we always came back from the parks to a very clean room and made beds. Now being a mother of four, when someone else makes your bed, you're just soooo happy!!! The kids collected the little soaps and shampoos, and they were replaced the next day. The pool was eh, a pool to relax at. The kids enjoyed it. As for the food court, well, it wasn't four star dining, but it worked just fine. We ate there twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner. For us it was a bit pricey, but it was Disney. We walked around the premises(when we weren't too tired), took the boat to Downtown Disney, and just took it all in. The bus system worked out greaaaattt!! Since we drove our own car, it saved alot on gas for us. But the wait wasn't long and I think the longest we waited for a bus was coming back from an Extra Magic Hour night which was only about 10 mins. Being a slightly big family, we would let others get on the bus and just wait for the next one. It wasn't a big deal, while waiting the kids would just talk about the parks and rides. My son(3 now), was more excited about riding the bus than anything else(well except for Pluto). We booked the POR thru the military hotel \"overflow\" and got a great deal, we paid about $124 a night.

It is charming and the rooms and the property is clean. Holding true to its namesake, this is exactly what you would expect in an earlier era visiting new orleans. From the way the staff dressed, to the large water mill and the design and decor of the buildigs. Delicious breakfast in the morning. Definitely try their french toast...it is to die for. If you have a chance, take the relaxing boat ride down the river to down town disney. The only complaint I have about this hotel is that what was supposed to be a waterview room was not. Simply because I had to leave my room and go out on the public corridor/porch to see the water, which was one of the quiet pools. Also I wish they had more kind size beds. What kind of hotel these days have mostly double rooms anyway???? Don't pay more for a waterview room. We rode on the bus with another couple who did not pay for a waterview room, but got one when they checked in. Why would you pay for something you can get for free??? Apart from that, the staff was nice and very accommodating. Marilyn, a waitress at boatrights, got my fiance a cake with a candle in it for his birthday. The bus transportation is great especially that magical express from/to the airport...although the process at the airport could be a little faster checking onto the bus.
