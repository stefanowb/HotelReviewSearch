The Oberoi Seminyak is more traditional and conventional than some of the more design hotels on the beach -- which I usually prefer. But what I do like about this hotel is its absolue lack of pretention, the simplicity and classic elegance. It's light yet simple d\u00e9cor focuses on quality and comfort, which is perfect after a long flight. it is also on the end of a stretch of very crowded, popular beach, and has the best beach chairs and umbrellas. I loved it. Sure, Bulgari and Nusa Dua and others are down the beach, and I checked them all out. I love a good hotel and am happy to splurge on my holidays. But this has a particular steady charm the others dont. If I want to stay at a trendy property, I would stay at my own private villa in town (I found one, but won't tell you where), which comes with its own private pool. Now THAT's cool. But if I want to be pampered on the beach, this is the hotel. I always kick off my stay at this hotel which provides a reliable \"soft landing\".

When we asked to see/smell another room, she then replied that all of the rooms would smell the same as the same cleaning products were used. Finally she and my wife went off to look for other rooms, but my wife was sent back 30 minutes later having not seen any other rooms. We gave up and went for lunch outside of the hotel. Luckily when we came back they had found another room for us that didn't smell. The decor of the room wasn't spectacular either. While the bathroom was beautiful with a sunken tub and a shower that opened to the outside, the bedroom itself was a bit tatty. It had a woven, rattan like ceiling and furniture made from thick bamboo. Very Balinese, but not luxurious. The last straw for us was the food. The food and drink prices in the hotel are extremely high - higher than one would pay next door at Ku De Ta, and much higher than one would pay at other establishments in Bali. Given the reputation of the hotel, and the prices, we expected the food to be outstanding. It wasn't. Despite a full hotel, there was only one table occupied in the formal dining restaurant. We took this as a sign and instead went for a casual meal in the bar. We went for standard hotel fare - a pizza, a club sandwich, salad and a soup. Unfortunately it was worse than what you'd get a business hotel in other parts of Asia. After one spoonful of soup, my wife stopped eating it. The pizza was essentially a frozen pizza.

Therefore the resort can afford to spread itself out far more than the newer neighbors, more space = more peace. Second, the resort is built of timeless natural materials that look better with age.

We loved our ocean-view lanai, which felt luxurious by U.S. standards and had an incredibly wonderful, peaceful, romantic feel to it. One tiny quibble was that the wifi/internet was expensive, and not that easy to use, but who really wants to surf the net when you're in Bali? The Oberoi pool and beachfront is fantastic -- the kind of place you can lie for hours (we did) and enjoy their drinks and food. The Oberoi sits on one of Bali's most fabled beaches, and it is quite spectacular. Definintely try to attend one of the dances or performances they put on -- they're well-done and fun. We also took advantage of the Oberoi Spa for a couple of treatments and a yoga class, and used the gym there as well. All were first-rate. We also booked a tour of Ubud through the hotel which wasn't that great; next time, we'll book our own cab and explore on our own. The restaurant was excellent too, especially the breakfasts and lunches, although don't forget to walk around Seminyak to try some of the other places.
