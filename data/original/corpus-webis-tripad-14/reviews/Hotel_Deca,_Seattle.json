Rooms come equipped with flat screen TVs, and iPod clock radios (bring your own iPod). Everything was clean and tidy overall. The hotel throws in free parking with your room, so considering the usual hotel parking rates of $20 or more, it's an excellent throw-in. They also include a complimentary continental breakfast served in large room near the lounge. Good basic fixings - hot and cold cereal, toast, bagels, danishes, apples, bananas, coffee, tea. The one drawback may be the university district neighbourhood. There is almost no street life around the hotel, not much in way of shops or restaurants. There's a Tully's in the lobby that closes by 6 pm, a Safeway a few blocks away that's open late, and a movie theatre. But the area is quiet at night, not neccessarily in a good way.
