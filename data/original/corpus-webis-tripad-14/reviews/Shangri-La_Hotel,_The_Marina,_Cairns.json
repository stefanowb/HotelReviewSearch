Cairns is an interesting place for a short stay and I have been here some three times in recent years - it is a good place for a short stay before moving further up the far North Queensland coast to Palm Cove, Port Douglas, Mossman and the Daintree. Cairns is a good starting point to visit the Great Barrier Reef, explore the hinterland and the Atherton Tablelands, plus do local visits to fish and explore the waterways. This was my first stay at the Shangri-La - one has many choices of accommodationist cairns to suit all budgets with this hotel being at he upper end of the price range, classed as a 5 star hotel. The position out adjacent the Marina area is fantastic and if you can book a room overlooking the water you will not be disappointed. The views are spectacular. The hotel itself however is a little tired and worn. The rooms are spacious but frankly housekeeping and cleaning (for my room at least) was not their forte. Furniture is a little battered, stains abound and the mattress (a foam affair) is far from comfortable, likewise the pillows. If you burn up your energy during the day you will sleep well but the bed is certainly not the most comfortable. Staff are obliging and friendly, there is a huge choice of adjacent restaurants to sample various cuisines. The pool area is beautiful and caters to all age groups.

She was very efficient and did all the research and bookings for us. The breakfasts in the hotel were served in a restaurant just outside the hotel, which i thought was a bit weird. OK food, nothing to write home about. The hotel pool was gorgeous, but unfortuntely the weather had cooled off so we couldn't swim. The girl serving at the pool bar was new, from South America, and very friendly. She had no idea how to make any cocktails + I payed $9 for a terrible iced chocolate made on water. They should have trained her before allowing her to work.
