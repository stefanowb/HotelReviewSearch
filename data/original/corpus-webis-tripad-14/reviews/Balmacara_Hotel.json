Nice choice of starters and main courses and a nice view from the restaurant of the nearby loch. My starter was a little bland (hot crab, could have done with a kick of flavour, lemon etc...) but main (steak) was tasty. My 2 travelling companions really enjoyed their meals. Service was a little slow but only 2 staff on, the veg could have come out a bit quicker with the main meals.
