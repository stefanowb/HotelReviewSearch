We did have one minor housekeeping issue but that was fixed within 30mins of me talking to front desk. Our package included parking but if your package doesn't include it the cost is $14 a night.

They really pumped this place up. I had some pretty high expectations despite some of the reviews I read. Well, I'm sad to say I was disappointed. We called to see if we could check in a little early and was told by Tatiana that it would be a $50 charge. Because we had driven through the night and were exhausted, we were willing to pay. After some time on hold she informed us that there were no rooms open. Checkin is at 4pm. We showed up 2 hours before check in ayways and they let us check in with no issues. Interesting. We get the keys to our room and when we arrived in our room, we quickly noticed it was not the room we reserved and prepaid for. We reserved a room with a king bed and daybed. What we got was a crusty sofa bed. When I called the front desk Tatiana answered again. I informed her of the mixup up and she let me know that we were in the right room. I asked her what her definition of daybed was because clearly it was a pull out sofabed! We were so tired that we were just going to stay in the room. However when we tried to pull out the SOFABED it banged against the wall! It was too big. Not only would it not open all the way, but it completely blocked the pathway the bathroom. You couldnt get to the bathroom without climbing on the bed and crawling over. Not good. I was forced to walk over to the front desk and inform them of the situation. Thankfully, Matt was there and quickly resolved the situation. He \"upgraded\" us to a small suite in another part of the property. It came with a queen bed and guess what? A real daybed... The one we paid for! So there were daybeds in this place! Unfortunately I had to sacrifice a king bed to get it. We arrived and there was either a chocolate stain or blood stain on the duvet. I'm telling myself it was chocolate because the latter is just plain disgusting! We had to call the front desk for the 3rd time in 10 minutes!

Our experience was just ok. It sounds like from other reviews that some rooms have been renovated and some have not, I don't think we were in a renovated room. I will say that the staff was all wonderful - no complaints there. Check in was a breeze and went really quick. The first room we were in was a Casitas suite. It was spacious - king bed, tv, desk and pull out couch in one room and a queen bed and tv in the other. There was only one bathroom which made it awkward for our neice who was sleeping in the room without the bathroom - she had to walk through our room to use it in the night. Not a huge deal. There were stains on the carpet and stains on the couch wich kind of grossed me out but was willing to put up with it for what we paid. One of us went to take a shower that night and the bathtub leaked so the whole bathroom flooded. There also was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. I will say that the bathroom was beautiful, that looked newly remodled. After the bathroom flooded we had them switch us to a kid's suite which we were happy with for the most part. It looked newer than the other room we were in. It had hard wood floors, one room with bunk beds, one room with a day bed and tv, and the main room had a queen bed, tv and desk. Again only one bathroom. The bed was horribly uncomfortable. We have yet to sleep on a hotel bed we like though. The floors and walls are paper thin. One night we called the front dest three times to complain that the people above us were jumping or something and making alot of noise around midnight but realized the next day that the floors are just so thin that you can hear everything. That kept us up for alot of the night and we weren't very happy about that. Our neice could hear every word the neighbors were saying from her room with the day bed - that kept her up alot of the night as well.

I went in with an open mind and so here is my experience with them. First of all, they offered me a military rate, something Disney also does but it was still about $100 cheaper per night at the Anabella. I traveled with my wife and my three teenagers so we booked a Hacienda suite which gave us four sleeping areas. We arrived early (check-in time is 3pm) so they could not let us have the suite but did store our bags so we could sight see without the loot in the SUV. They were supposed to call me when the room was ready but never did. When we arrived, they had trouble finding one bag but eventually did. We got our keys but when we entered the room discovered that they gave me a kid's suite. (one queen, one day bed, one bunk bed) Like I said my kids are all grown and I specifically arranged the bigger suite with the front desk 2 months before we came. We had to stay in this suite for one night and then were given the proper suite for the next 6 nights. We were never given an explanation or apology or anything from management. I guess they figured that since I got the military I should be happy. I will say that the rest of the staff throughout the hotel (motel) were very nice and attentive. The proper room was adequate but nothing to write home about. ( you get what you pay for) The breakfast in the Tangerine Grill was good but the wait staff was just so-so. Here are some of the cons; it\u2019s a good 3/4 mile hike to the park even though it's just across Katella Blvd from DCA. We knew this but it is still rough for tired feet and legs. It cost 4 bucks a day per person to ride the shuttle. It would be nice if the hotel would pick up that tab. They also charge 10 bucks a day to park your car. We knew this also and most fine hotels charge for parking, but this is an economy hotel. The showers must have been installed by a midget plumber. The water hit me between my chest and stomach. I'm tall but these are still way too low. Also there is no vent fan in the bathroom which makes a steamy mess with each shower. It would be nice if the sink was out side the bathroom. With five of us getting ready each day it took a long time. Wireless connection costs $10/day which is a bit steep. They will not change out your towels unless you ask. I did and they complied each day. It was a bit noisy like other people have already written about. There are only wood slat blinds on the front window which makes privacy kind of iffy. So we saved some coin by staying here and we survived. If you are not too worried about being comfortable this is not a bad place to stay.
