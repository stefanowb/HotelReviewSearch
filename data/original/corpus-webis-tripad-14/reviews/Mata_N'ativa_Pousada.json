The place is calm, beautiful, confortable and perfectly integrated into the surrounding forest. The staff is courteous and efficient; they made us feel at home all the time. Breakfast is delicious and enough to let us spend the whole day on they beach without lunch. Although there is a lot of mosquitos, ants and other insects around, we could easily sleep without any incident. I would not go there without protection though, specially if one is alergic to insect bites. We stayed at \"Jequitiba\" room and it was perfect for a couple, with a nice jacuzzi.

But still, the tranquility, the sightseeing and the long, almost deserted beaches are worth the visit.

For us, this was convenient since we prefer to be close to the beach than to the buzzle of bars and restaurants. The only inconvenience was that we had to walk uphill every night in order to eat something, since the pousada serves only breakfast and some sandwiches at night. Besides being a steep uphill, the path to Quadrado was really dark and a bit scary at night. The locals say that there is no danger but we witnessed a robery one night and once we had to change our places on the beach because of a couple of suspicious guys that insisted on staring at us. I was born and raised in Brazil and my wife has been there many times so we don't tend to be scared without reason; my advise is, relax and enjoy but be aware that your spending might be worth a year's salary of a local family.", "title": "Really, really lovely Pousada", "user": "JaneandOtis", "date": "January 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 12730293, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The tranquility", "disliked": "\u2014 The small balcony"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "After spending some time reviewing the options of staying either in the quadrado OR by the beach, we found Mata N'ativa.

Triage of products, recycling, solar panels and energy system control, are part of our initiatives to lessen our impact on nature. Charming ambiances and attention to details are also key elements. The owners always around will welcome you in person. We organize trips in kayaks, bicycles, horseback ridings, etc."}
