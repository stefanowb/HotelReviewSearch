First impressions were ok, the pool and spa look absolutely nothing like they do in the pictures, but then you've got to admire the photographer! We were told at reception that there would be someone on the desk 24 hours a day if we needed anything at all and shown to our room. We were given a free upgrade to an Executive room as we were staying 5 nights which we were thankful for.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ZeusnGoose", "date": "February 14, 2009", "id": 24547807}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled solo", "text": "We went out to explore a bit of Christchurch centre, and came back at about 9.30pm, quite hungry after our walk and our flight. We thought we'd just grab something off the 24 hour snack menu. So we went to the bar to be told by a pretty rude older guy that we could have a toasted sandwich but he'd \"have to get someone to watch the bar\". The kitchen is located directly behind the bar, the bar itself is about 1.5 metres long, and there were 2 other people in the bar itself (both of whom seemed to be friendly with the guy, ie...his mates). We thought, fine, what's the problem then? He didn't seem to want to shift so instead we went back out to find something. Unfortunately everything seems to shut pretty early in Christchurch on a Sunday...it's more like a village than a city! We thought we'd get a quick burger from Burger King across the road considering nothing else was open, alas, by then it was 10pm and that too was shut.", "title": "Central Location and service with a smile!!", "user": "RebeccaHAustralia", "date": "January 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23711805, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 How welcome you were made to feel.", "disliked": "\u2014 The weather!!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We ended up going to bed with nothing to eat and no help from the \"24 hour\" room service/snack menu.", "title": "Affordadable and convenient, can't ask for more", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "seamountain", "date": "December 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 11265510, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location and value", "disliked": "\u2014 hotel restaurant structured for group tours, must submit meal order before seating"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Modern and stark", "text": "We decided that we wouldn't eat in the hotel after this experience, other than for the free \"continental\" breakfast which came as part of the deal.
