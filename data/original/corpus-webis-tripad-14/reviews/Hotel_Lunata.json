I wanted to do some last minute shopping so it was a perfect spot. My husband and I had dinner together at a fantastic Italian rooftop place (Ula Gua?!).

In fact one couple did change from their hotel to the Lunata. The breakfast is a continental style breakfast with rolls, toast and/or cereal, two juices and coffee - plenty to get you started for the day and if you like a bigger breakfast the staff is always there to help you find a nice place.

We like it because it is located in the heart of Playa del Carmen but is very quiet. It is a short walk to restaurants, shops, the beach, an ATM and the bus station. It is a small hotel with 10 rooms that are very beautifully appointed. It is kept clean but we found on this trip that the room we stayed in before had some minor repairs that needed tending to. The hot water faucet didn't work and the door to the balcony didn't lock. The faucet was promptly fixed but the lock was looked at and not repaired in the week we were there, however a broom handle was given to us to wedge in the door. Security in this case would not have been an issue considering it was a third floor balcony. We also noticed that the linens have a lot of stains which we didn't notice the time before but other than that they are clean. The staff is excellent, helpful and friendly.
