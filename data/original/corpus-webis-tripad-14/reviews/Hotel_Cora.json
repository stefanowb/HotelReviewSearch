Fairly modern, bathroom was tile/marble modern and clean, carpeting was new and clean; amenities basic. Had 1 hour free wireless internet in room, and for 10 euros I purchased 10 hours [they had other options]. Front desk and service was great; had basic breakfast included and ate one night at their hotel restaurant and meal was once again perfectly adequate. Convenient location right off of SS36. Air Conditioning worked. Was clean and I felt comfortable. So, can recommend to others.", "title": "Perfectly Adequate; 2-Day Business Sleepover", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "gtpatton", "date": "April 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 104912753}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lombardy", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 8, "very good": 4, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
