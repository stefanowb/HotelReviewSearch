The rooms are of average size and a bit non-descript however all very clean and well appointed. The lobby is very attractively decorated with an internal courtyard all in Moorish style. Staff all speak excellent english and very professional. There is also internet access in the lobby. This hotel states that it has private parking beneath the hotel, which it does, however just because you book a room it does not mean you will also get a parking space. If they do happen to have an available space you still have to pay extra for it (c. 12.50 euros p/n) however, these are severely limited. We specifically chose this hotel because of parking - which is an absolute nightmare within all of the old Andalucian towns/cities - and were told that it was unavailable. We drove back out over one of the bridges and parked across the river. Reception staff can recommend the best places to find free parking in Cordoba. Despite parking difficulties, this is a great hotel, superb location, great service and very clean. Extra bonus is that they offer online discounts if you book online on the day you intend to arrive.", "title": "Pleasant brief visit.", "user": "Friskies80", "date": "August 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 38152409}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "I stayed at Maimonides with some friends (two double rooms) for one night; breakfast was not included and we didn't ask for it either.", "title": "Good and central", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "paulolisb", "date": "August 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 37295032}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "The hotel is very central, just opposite the Mezquita.
