On this trip, we decided to book the hotel and were very excited about staying there based on reviews, and the location. First, I will say that the location is excellent, right on the canal in Petite France. Other than that, though, the hotel was a tremendous disappointment. We booked the hotel for 3 nights. When we arrived, the person at check-in was pleasant but not very friendly. I had expected the service to be very good, so it seemed odd. When we arrived at our room, I was surprised to see how starkly furnished the room was. There was nothing comforting about the look of the room. Very little furniture, almost no artwork. It reminded me of an addition to a house that has not yet been decorated, but has some furniture. The windows werre open when we arrived, but it was still very warm in the room (80's F). We were very tired, but decied to go out to get something to eat before unpacking, so we closed the windows and turned the A/C on. When we returned to our room 90 minutes later, it was just as hot, and very stuffy. The AC clearly was not working. When we spoke to the Front desk about this, they casually remarked that they were having some work done to the HVAC system and that the A/C would be out for the rest of the week. There was no apology, as if this was completely normal. We asked if there were other rooms in the hotel which might be cooler (ours was on the top floor) and were informed that the hotel was completely booked. At this point we were incensed and started to demand something be done. In the end, the staff made arrangements for us at their sister hotel - Cour Corbeau. This was done grudgingly. There was one person who was, in fact, very helpful, polite, and apologetic, I believe his name was Guillaume, and he was a Bellman. He had an awareness of the sitution, and tried to do everything he could to help. I can't for the life of me understand how this hotel gets such high ratings. The rooms were not at all well decorated, or nicely furnished, and the service was poor.
