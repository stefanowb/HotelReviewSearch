This hotel is about 40 minutes from Romes Port and 15 minutes from Romes Flulmincino Airport,in a stright line onA12 the autostrada.(be prepaed for outrageous Taxi fare from the port to the hoel was 160Euros or 190.00 US. The next day we went to the aairport and the fare was 35 Euros. So the best bet is to find a bus from the port to the airport if u want to save money, The owner Mr Costi and his waitress in the restaurant were very helpfull in suggesting that for 12Euros each a bus and train ticket could be purchased for the day. We the spent our las tday in Rome very Inexpenseivlly.(NO TAXI) Also the room was a nice size and ver clean. Again thank u Mr Costi a verry nice ending to my 25 ays in Italy.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 24, 2006", "id": 5205843}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lazio", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 10, "very good": 24, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 8}, "aka": "Motel Corsi Rome/Fiumicino", "slim_ranking": 0.75, "description": "Welcome to Motel Corsi from 40 years Motel Corsi offers its services to those who reach Rome for a journey of pleasure or for work situated in Via Aurelia Km 27,700.
