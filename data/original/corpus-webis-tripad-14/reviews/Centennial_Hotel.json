This is one of the finest boutique hotels we have experienced, at any price in any location. Our room was very comfortable, and the things we really care about (bed, linens, bathroom, towels, etc. - who really cares about the drapes?) were first rate. Our room was huge, and well equipped for both business and leisure travel, with a ceiling fan that was exceptionally quiet. The bathroom was well appointed in a funky, post-modern style with tumbled marble tile, a granite vanity top and free-standing basin sink with a slick faucet mechanism. There was a nifty cutout in the glass shower enclosure for the shower controls so you could turn on the water without getting splashed. Our room was located near the top of the stairs from the hotel lobby and restaurant, and we were initially concerned that it might be noisy, but found that it was extremely quiet. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area for business or pleasure, particularly if innovative New American dining is on the priority list - Granite is easily one of the best restaurants in New Hampshire, and a great reason to choose the Centennial Inn.
