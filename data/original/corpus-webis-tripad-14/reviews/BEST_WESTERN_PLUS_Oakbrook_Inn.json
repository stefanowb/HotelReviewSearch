The room was decent sized and very clean. The breakfast was good with a nice variety of options. The staff all went out of their way to say hello or good morning. The other hotels in this area are hilton garden inn, marriott, etc and I can't see paying around $40 a night more for these when this place has it all.", "title": "Surprisingly nice, surprisingly affordable", "user": "badwaiter", "date": "March 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 154628749}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We been making 3 - 4 trips yearly these past years and have always stayed elsewhere thinking in the price range every accommodation was going to be pretty much the same.

We can't recommend it enough without hesitation, knowing any visitor they accommodate is in the very best hands. Thank You so much and don't hesitate to reserve a room with Best Western Plus Oakbrook.
