The parking is right outside your room, a bit of a tiny lot, but you can get around. In the middle is a lawn area with some chairs and table, plus a nice fountain that runs all night. Our room was super clean, which appeared to have been recently remodeled. I understand that not all rooms are the same, but we had a queen bed plus a seperate kitchen room. The kitchen had table and chairs, stove/range, microwave, and medium size refrigerator. Off the kitchen was a totally private patio with a lounge chair, table and another chair. Small, but perfect for just sitting outside. The bathroom was not huge, big enough for one person. Ammenities were fine, although they had shampoo but no conditioner. Shower was fine, towels were okay.", "title": "So adorable!
