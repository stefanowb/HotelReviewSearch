The hotel itself is on a busy street about a 10 min at most walk from the main Train Station which was convenient for us because we didn't want to do a taxi and could walk there. Even though located on a busy street, our room was extremely quiet and we heard no street noise or noice from any other room - it was very quiet. The room was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was of a very nice size. The bathtub/shower is quite high and a bit hard to step up into and out of, but that wasn't a problem for us. You need to buzz in at the street level to have them let you in and I was a little concerned about that prior to going on our trip because some other travelers found that to be inconvenient, but we found just the opposite. We were let in immediately, and it made me feel very safe to have that extra measure of locked door. The staff was helpful in suggesting dinner and the breakfast was wonderful: pretty little setting and white linens with great cappuchino, fresh hard rolls and italian salami and with a couple different cheeses, along with cereal, apples, fresh juices, yogurts, and pastry. It was a great way to start the day of managing to get around the city. The staff who greeted us spoke very good english and that was a very nice little bonus for us. We used the bus that went right by the front doors to get to the Vatican and used the subway that was about a block away to get to the Colliseum area, but we had no trouble walking back from either of them as it is probably a couple miles to walk it - but not a problem for us.
