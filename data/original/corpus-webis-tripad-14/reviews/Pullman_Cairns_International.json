Very pleasant hotel, light and airy with that famously impressive lobby. Even the upper corridors were light and spacious. Room and bathrom a good size and well maintained although no really splashy extras. Nice little balacony - although the wind kept us indoors. Walking distance to the terminal for the day cruises and plenty of restaurants on the harbour, these are located in the ground floors of Harbourlights and Shangri La. Friendly and helpful staff on reception, concierge and tour desks. Very extensive buffet breakfasts hot and cold, although like all hotel breakfast buffets quite expensive, there is alille coffee shop next door that serves breakfast if you want a cheaper option.
