Close to Westbourne Grove, a short walk to Kensington Gardens and with literally a 2 minute walk to the Queensway or Bayswater Tube stations, you can be anywhere in London easily.

For one thing the level of inconsistency regarding the maid service is annoying. Every day they missed something, either not replacing the water (which happened most days) and mini bar items, to leaving dirty cups and glasses from the night before. Mixing up the lotion and conditioner bottles so one ends up washing ones hair with body lotion.

We arrived ~1.5 hrs before check-in time & were told there were no twin bedded rooms left. I understand things happen, but when asked if we really needed separate beds, I responded a quizzical \"I guess not\" because I really wasn't sure what my answer was supposed to be. My friend & I are not a couple & obviously wanted different beds which is why we were booked that room in advance - a good month & a half in advance. The woman also mentioned that she would have to speak with her boss, but said they might just upgrade us because of the inconvenience. My friend returned to the hotel before I did, to find our bags had been brought to our room (#38), a double-bedded room that barely fit us, let alone our bags. When we returned from dinner, we spoke with Ava, explained the situation, for which she was quite apologetic, & switched us to room 21, which definitely gave us more room. I am extremely thankful for people like her - her kind intentions were greatly appreciated (she even came back to the room with another person to pull out and make the bed). The next day, when arriving back to the room late afternoon, we noticed most of our belongings were re-arranged or moved. The make-up I left in the bar area, was moved; clothing hanging in the closet were taken out & left on the chair by the door; all of our toiletries in the bathroom left on the counter were IN the sink; my friend's ruck sack in the bedside table drawer, was removed & put on top of my suitcase on the table by the door. Sadly, this was my last hotel stay of a 17-day trip around Europe & it left a sour taste in my mouth, so to speak. In room 21, the rug was SO uncomfortable I had to wear shoes - they did provide flip-flops/tongs, but they were enormous. The bathroom was the best, with a heated marble floor, but the shower glass partition was quite short in length, soaking most of the bathroom; even my friend who's British was surprised. The fold out couch/bed was EXTREMELY uncomfortable - it was not straight across - there was a huge dip going down the middle; a staff member should lay down on this and test it out; but the bedding was nice. The idea of the aesthetics of the hotel is a good idea, as is the small boutique hotel feel, private outdoor area & fabulously convenient location (1 block from the Bayswater tube stop & 2 blocks from Kensington Gardens). The biggest disappointment is that I have yet to get a reply from the hotel's General Manager whom I emailed May 4th (it's been 9 days).", "title": "Nice boutique hotel in theory", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dmac72", "date": "May 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 160609985}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "La Suite West is very handy for Central London - only a few stops on a bus away from Oxford Street and only 100 yards from Hyde Park.
