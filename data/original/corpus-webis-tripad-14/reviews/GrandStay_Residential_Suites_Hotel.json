I absolutely loved it! This would be my second favorite hotel after the Woodfin in San Diego.I am a huge fan of tripadvisor so whenever we go on vacation I always check the reviews on hotels here first before booking a room. I wanted to stay in Santa Barbara but most of the rooms were booked so the closest city with available rooms was in Oxnard. If you are on a budget I would say that this hotel would be a good base but driving to Santa Barbara would be about 30-40 minutes. But this hotel is a great value ! I only paid $129 plus tax for a Saturday stay (AAA rate). I got a queen bedroom suite which had a kitchen and seperate living room, 2 tv's ( one in bedroom and other in livingroom) and a sofa bed. Having a kitchen is so important when you have kids because they get hungry and thirsty at all times of the day and night. The room seemed spotless. I did not feel that the bed was very comfortable though. I have stayed at other hotels with better beds. And the bedsheets weren't as nice and soft as other hotels that I have been at. That was probably the only 2 things I did not like. The room was a decent size. In the back of the hotel you will find a small rectangle pool (nothing special)with jacuzzi, a half size basketball court and a wooden playset (just basic). The playset would be for older kids though not for toddlers. And on one side of the hotel is a Gold's Gym and on the other is a 7-11 Gas station, across the street and in back are just businesses. You can just walk over to 7-11 if you need to buy anything although the hotel did have a small pantry where you can also purchase items like sundries, snacks, drinks, ice cream and some frozen food. Oh, and they also had a continental breakfast in the morning ( very basic). The hotel is also situated right in the middle of a business district so it's a pretty boring area but they do have shops within driving distance. It's an easy freeway access. And for those with kids there is a Chuck E, Cheese about a 5-10 min drive on the freeway. You can take the kids there at night when there's nothing else to do. I was very pleased with my stay up until midnight when my car alarm went off. I went to my window to look outside and saw an extremely noisy car with a loud muffler had pulled in right next to mine. There was 2 drunk men and 1 drunk woman in it as well. I was really concerned that they might do something to my car so I just sat at my window waiting to see what it is that they were going to do. They spent about 20 minutes in the car from what I can see was taking photos because I kept seeing flashes. Finally they got out of the car and was extremely noisy. Other guests must have called the front desk to complain because I know I must not have been the only guest that was woken up by them. They had entered the hotel and about 10 minutes later they were back out with a hotel staff yelling at them to leave the property and made them aware that the cops have been called. They left and as soon as they reved their engine my car alarm once again went off but I was so relieved that they were gone. I was not able to go back to sleep until 4AM because if my sleep is disturbed then I have a hard time going back to sleep.The hotel staff did an excellent job of immediately removing them from the property and letting them know that they are not welcomed here. I am sure that this was just one of those rare instances because like I said this hotel is in a business district so I don't think it would attract people like that. The next morning I found out from the front desk that those people had damaged some hotel property before leaving. The girl had kicked in the air conditioner and the 2 men did some other damage as well because they were told to leave. I did hear police sirens last night and the front desk told me that as soon as those people got in their car the police was had caught them. I am so glad because they were driving drunk and they can do some harm to others. Also this hotel seems to get alot of late night NOISY arrivals at least the night that I had stayed. I saw many people arriving after midnight up to probably about 2:30AM. You may want to get a room in the back of the hotel if you do not want to be disturbed by people arriving in the middle of the night. If I should visit Santa Barbara again in the future I will definitely stay here again for it's value and great room! I would highly recommend this hotel especially for people with kids !

We found one at the GrandStay & were anxious to try a new place. It was very disappointing. Primarily, the rooms were small. The bedrooms in particular were very small - in the 2nd bedroom one had to walk sideways between the bed and the wall to exit the room. There was no desk in the unit - the kitchen counter had to suffice (no room). In this 2 bedroom unit there was one bar of soap - all had to share for showering and general washing up purposes. The plastic cups were so thin that it was hard to hold one with water in it without crushing it. There was no grab bar in the shower, the tub was slippery, and there was no bathroom fan. To top it all off, the free internet came with a 15 minute limit after which you had to sign on again. This hotel was clean and the lobby was nicely decorated, but the room was cramped and there was an obvious effort to build it as inexpensively as possible.
