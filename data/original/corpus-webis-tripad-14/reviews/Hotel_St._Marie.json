We particularly enjoyed the balconies -- both those facing the street and those facing the inner courtyard. Also, the pool was very clean and refreshing. From past experience, I know that a French Quarter boutique hotel can be very iffy in terms of cleanliness and upkeep! Actually, it was not my first choice to stay in the French Quarter for just this very reason. While I did appreciate the condition of the hotel, every single room had a pervasive odor of disinfectant. As the hotel is within a block of Bourbon Street let's just say that I can appreciate the hotel's regular need for strong cleaning agents and would rather they be used than not. One other thing . . . while my room faced the courtyard and was very quiet, those rooms which faced the street were loud for much of the night.

The Hotel St. Marie was very clean and nice and the entire staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. Our only negative was the dining room being closed for construction. The complimentary sweet rolls and juice were appreciated but after a day or two we'd much rather have a real breakfast to start the day of non stop activities.There is so much to do in New Orleans and we felt so welcome by all who work and live there. Thank you for such a wonderful mini vacation and we will definitely return to the Hotel St. Marie.", "title": "We loved it and can't wait to go back!!", "user": "valandjohn", "date": "April 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15416030, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The whole package - very historic and homey at the same time...", "disliked": "\u2014 The restaurant is being renovated, but the continental breakfast was great"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "New Orleans"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 77, "average": 150, "very good": 442, "terrible": 36, "excellent": 405}, "aka": "St Marie Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.4, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Intimate French Quarter Hotel situated 1/2 block off Bourbon Street & 5 minutes from central business district."}
