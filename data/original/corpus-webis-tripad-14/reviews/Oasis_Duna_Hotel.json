For families it is a beautiful, clean and safe resort with no large groups of clubbers or larger louts in sight, yet, it still has plenty to do to keep you occupied with the kids. The beaches are out of this world and clearly match any carribean beach I have visited in my time. Try to ensure that you visit the magnificant beach at the dunes as a trip to this resort wld be wasted without it. Due to the fact we love beach life, we visited the dunes 3 out of 7 days. The actual complex is very good, with an excellant pool, probably one of the more larger freeforms I have seen, and the gardens are kept clean. There are lots of children at this complex so older couples and younger couples with no kids seeking peace and quiet should go elsewhere. Oasis Dunas are the best complex in the resort for kids and also the best laid out, the pools alone are worth it and they are very clean. Only downside is the Apartments themselves inside, they are very basic and could do with a refurb, we found them to be very stuffy so rent a fan, but they are cleaned almost every day and are very clean, but because the complex is so lovely it kind of takes the focus off the basic apartments. Eating out is great as almost all of the restaurants are fantastic, I rarely hear anyone complain about the food in this resort and there is a lot of competition but here are my faves... For great Seafood and fresh Fish try any of the restaurants in the harbour, they are all good and you can sit outside and gaze across the sea, For Steak, Pasta or Pizza Don Camillos in the main strip is gorgeous !! The best Chinese is Slow Boat 2, which is in the plaza and trust me, there is a lot of Slow Boat restaurants in the resort but none of them are as good as this one and if you like an Indian, ALL the three Indians in the resort are very good, they are all authentic and freshly prepared.", "title": "Beautiful Fuerteventura", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "BelfastBlue", "date": "September 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 8825733, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The pools, cleanliness, gardens, location, kids entertainment", "disliked": "\u2014 The basic apartment interior and lack of air conditioning"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "There is a great Mexican in the old town which you will need directions for, dont try the one in the Plaza as this is expensive and not very good at all !!

We used to get a taxi from outside the Rock Bar after dinner up to the park most nights to keep our 3 yr old happy. There are rides, bouncys, playgrounds and adventure experiences for all ages. There is also the \"Hotel Del Terror\", which is a walk through haunted house experience and I challenge anyone not to find this terrifying, not for the faint hearted but it is brilliant and would put the haunted house experience in Disneyland to shame !

My girlfriend and I booked online with Panorama as a last-minute holiday and then we checked the reviews- some were quite worrying but as we found out, our worries were totally unfounded! The check-in staff were courteous and efficent and the reception area gave a great first impression. We were given a printed map of the complex on arrival and the receptionist circled the apartment on it. Our apartment was on the first floor so we had a nice view of the cactus gardens which were really cool! Inside the apartment it was spotlessly clean there. We had a bedroom (of course!), kitchenette, livingroom with a pullout sofa bed, bathroom and a furnished balcony. One major piece of advice is that you get a fan from reception as it gets really hot there. We didn't spend a huge amount of time in the complex apart from an hour or so by the pool on the second day as we prefered to get out and see what Corralejo has to offer but from what we could see the kids had good craic with the entertainment both day and night and there was plenty for the adults to do- a few bars, sport on TV in one bar. Looking out from the front of the reception building there's an unmissable view of the volcano which just proved to be too much temptation on Friday afternoon! There is also a laundry room in the complex which only costs \u20ac3 per machine and they take quite a large load but you have to get the token from reception and book a time so there won't be queues- make sure you bring washing powder youself though so save having to go back and forth to get some, yes, I made the mistake!
