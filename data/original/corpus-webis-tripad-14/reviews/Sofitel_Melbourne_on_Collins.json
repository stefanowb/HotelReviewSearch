It was a corner room facing out to MCG and over the Yarra. The view was just superb. The room was well equiped with full mini bar, great bed, dvd,flat screen tv, lounge area was spacious,lots of reading material, and a great writing desk. We had a bath and shower and everything was spotless. Checkin and out was a breeze with very friendly staff. We went for drinks in the bar, and were served nibblies whilst having a drink which was a nice treat. Also dined in the newly renovated restaurant no. 35. We had the taster menu and it was simply superb. Nice to try some different food. We had buffet breakfast the next morning and I will say the selection was limited but the quality of the food is fantastic. We had an advantage plus card which I would definetly recommend puchasing before visiting hotel as it cuts your food bill in 1/2 when 2 people dining.Over all I would give the hotel 10 out of 10 and recommend as a great spurge.

Each of the individual beds had sunk in the middle due to their extreme softness, leaving us with a bizarre W-shaped bed to suffer through. The pillows at least could be firmed up with a choice from the pillow menu.
