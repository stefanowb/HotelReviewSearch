This farm on the edge of Bodmin Moor has converted all of its stone outbuildings into a collection of very attractive cottage-style barns. Ours had two bedrooms, a living room/kitchen and bathroom. The barns are well equippped so that self-catering is easy and comfortaable, but there is also a resident chef who will supply meals in the main farmhouse (closed for renovation during our stay) or direct to each barn.", "user": "Blackstone", "date": "April 6, 2010", "id": 60529265}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic", "text": "Barns can be booked by the night (with a minimum of two nights' stay I think). We stayed for three and also booked the optional gastro package which included cream tea on arrival, two breakfast packs, one evening meal delivered to the barn for us to re-heat and one meal of five \"taster\" courses served to us by chef Richard Nicholls. His cooking is excellent (we would say the equivalent of at least two AA rosettes) and can be highly recommended.", "user": "NatalieandJon", "date": "April 3, 2010", "id": 60229223}], "location": {}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 2, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 100}, "aka": "Trevenna Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Self-catering with hotel style and services, contemporary furnishings and state-of-the-art mod-cons within restored stone barns set in 142 acres of private grounds.
