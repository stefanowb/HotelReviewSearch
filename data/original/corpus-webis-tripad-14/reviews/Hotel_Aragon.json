The room was a good size but we had a superior room according to the booking so cant comment on other rooms. The bathroom was a great size with his/her taps! The room also had a small toilet room with sofa and chairs. Bed was comfortable and curtains were good and prevented light streaming in. The breakfast consisted of fruit, breads, cold meats, youghurts and boiled eggs which was good. The hotel is located around the corner from the market sq and I can say the street is very quiet with good restaurants and bars nearby. MY COMPLAINT - may have been a communication error but I still found it incredibly unprofessional and not something you would expect when you are paying $130 euro a night. We had presumed check out was at 12 (like most hotels around the world) as check in is at 3pm which is quite late however following breakfast we decided to have a snooze as hate a lateish night and in the middle of our nap, we were woken up by knocking on the door at 11.15 by a cleaner who asked us when we were leaving ?? (which in itself is not how the situation should be handled), we say 12 and she told us check out was at 11 - we apologised and said we would be out in 15 minutes (as we then had to shower, pack & get ourselves together. Over 5 minutes later the phone rang and it was reception who once again asked us when we were leaving and we apologised and said we thought check out was at 12 and we would be out soon. She said that was fine and we assured we would be out by 12 (it was now 11.25ish). 5 minutes later we had another knock on the door and this time the cleaner shouted at us to get out of the room to which I stood in complete shock at the behavior of this person. That of course put the nail in the coffin of my partner who thengot very irritated. As we left the room the cleaner was then waiting outside and apologised and pointed to her watch ??!! I had presumed she had heard my partners rant ! There were no apologises from reception. I would have recommended this hotel highly an hour before our departure but they need to make you aware of check out time and they didnt actually tell us when breakfast was as we had to ask and there was no hotel brochure in the room which normally details this information. I would not stay here again as no mater how late someone is checking out (within reason) I dont expect some cleaner to come shouting at my door .", "title": "Nice Hotel, Great Location, Shame About Staff And Unprofessional Behaviour", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sin-7", "date": "May 19, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7645124, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 NICE COMFORTABLE ROOM AND GOOD LOCATION", "disliked": "\u2014 CLEANING STAFF"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The recent bank holiday May weekend made a Eurostar package trip to Bruges a pleasant change of scenery.

Certainly from our experience it well deserves that rating. Booking for 4 nights we automatically received an upgrade to an executive room - which as previous reviewers have identified are well worth considering. However, on arrival we were advised that we had been transferred to an apartment in a block just round the corner from the hotel. It was fabulous and ideal for our needs. I guess larger again than an executive room it had a small kitchen with microwave and cooker. For us this was ideal as we like to do a bit of self-catering - and considering the cost of eating out in Bruges (and the somewhat repetitive menus on offer) was ideal on this occasion. Particularly as on our very first walk around the city we discovered a small food shop off the beaten track - very popular with locals - selling freshly prepared meals for the microwave. As a result of this discovery and the facilities we now had available, an evening meal for two was prepared afora total cost of 10 euros! Returning to the hotel the service was exceptional as was the cleanliness and the short stroll to breakfast in the morning well worth the effort.

We werent disappointed! This is a lovely hotel situated just a short walk from the main market square. Our room was actually an apartment, with a small kitchen, sitting area, very comfortable bed, tv, mini bar, large bathroom with bath and shower, and safety deposit box in the wardrobe (key available at reception). The bed was very comfortable with lovely soft pillows and extra quilt if needed. Also there was a good air conditioning unit in the room that acts to both heat and cool down. We didnt have a great view from the back of the hotel, however there were two large windows that made the room feel very bright. The only downside was the three flights of very narrow stairs, but there was a lift that would accept one person at a time! The hotel itself is well decorated and modern. On the first night we had a complimentary welcome drink in the bar. The hotel doesnt have a restaurant in the evening, however with so many to choose from just a short walking distance this certainly wasnt a problem! Breakfast was continental with a good variety of cheese, meat, fresh fruit, cereals etc, the dining room again very clean and tastefully decorated. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. You can store your luggage in a special room, but this isnt kept locked. Eating in Bruges is a calorific affair, chips with everything, waffles and beer - over 1100 of them and of course chocolate!! I made the mistake of asking for my steak cooked 'medium'. Be warned, here it is taken that if you want medium it is medium rare! If you like your steak to have seen a frying pan, then best ask for well done! All chips are served with mayonnaise unless you specify tomato sauce, but also be warned you can get charged for this - we had 1 euro added to a lunch bill for a dollop of sauce!! There are many chocolate shops to choose from, all selling very similar things but at different prices, so check a few out before buying! The boat tour is very good value at around half an hour for 7.60 euros, a good way to see some of the city sights. The best way however is on foot, the pony and trap rides very expensive unless several of you share - 35 euros, and the city bus tour at 14.50 euros for 50 mins would suit the less agile. Most of the streets are cobbled so good footwear is essential, and beware the taxi drivers and pony and traps, they show no mercy for a tourist who steps in their way!! The main square and the sights around it were very crowded, even at 10.30am, so we got off the beaten track a little, and walked through some of the very pretty residential areas down towards the windmills at the perimeter of the city, it is definitely worth venturing further afield to escape all the other tourists. An excellent trip, with good rail links from Bruges to Brussels within an hour.
