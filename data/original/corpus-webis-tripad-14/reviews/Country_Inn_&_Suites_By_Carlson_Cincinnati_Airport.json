The beds were comfortable, the breakfast was delicious and loved the toiletry items (pantene pro-v). We stayed four nights and never had a problem. If I had to point out a problem it would be that the pool area smelled really bad of chlorine, they need a little better ventilation system in there. We stayed there to go to Creation Museum (a must do). We ate at a little restaurant called Mr. Herbs, very delicious and had a to-die-for pecan pie!

All the suites had a sofa bed, small dining table, kitchenette, very large bathroom and a separate bedroom with 2 queen size beds.

We stayed two nights, and both nights there were shrill screeching screaming children in the pool well past 10 pm. Other than that, this is a well-appointed property, for a very reasonable price. However, the last reviewer is correct, there are no nearby restaurants, but it is very close to the airport, maybe five minutes away. Jet noise was never a problem, just the screaming kids in the indoor pool. Breakfast was excellent. The entire property is very clean. I would definitely stay here again.
