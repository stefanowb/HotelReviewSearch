The Torre is medieval but has been recently renovated in a very hip design style while retaining the solid timber ceilings. It was really the highlight of our trip to Italy: breakfast with beautiful Northern Italy cheeses and different local pastries, wonderfully attentive service and the ability to sit in the hot pool on the roof terrace and overlook Imperial Rome. But the Torre is not for people who want the trappings of a large business hotel - it is very firmly in the boutique and personal space with much personality.", "title": "Amazing experience in Torre Colonna", "user": "LorenzoBC", "date": "July 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 36110301}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled solo", "text": "Torre Colonna has the \"WOW\" factor. The pictures are accurate - mine was the yellow one pictured on the website. Each floor of this restored and updated old tower is a tasteful small suite. My colorful one had a walk-in closet and a very spacious, fully equipped bathroom with hydromassage tub. The sleeping area wasn't particularly large, but the walls in the room and throughout the tower were covered with original modern art. The bed was perfectly comfortable after a long day of walking. Although Torre Colonna is on a busy street, the windows are double-glazed and the room was quite quiet. An included continental breakfast is offered on the top (6th) floor. Free high speed internet is via ethernet cable only - they will provide one for you if don't have one. The staff is minimal, so this accomodation really is for those who don't mind self-sufficiency. It is not an overly expensive place for Rome. Of course, you can find cheaper and maybe/maybe not more spacious, but not such a unique residence with a wonderful, intimate one-of-a-kind designer appeal and perfect location at the very edge of the ancient ruins. From the roof terrace, you realize how compact historical Rome is because you can see the Colosseum, the Palatine, Vittorio Emmanuele, Trajan's Column (literally around the corner), the top of the Pantheon, and St. Peter's. To get there, take the #64 bus from Termini to Piazza Venezia (major transfer point) for 1 euro and walk back up the route around the corner 2 or 3 blocks (under 5 minutes). Avoid taxis at Termini at all costs - it's a 10 minute ride at worst. If you have lots of luggage and you must use one, if someone gives you a song and dance about not using the meter for whatever reason (it's all dishonest BS), move on to another taxi and also threaten to call the Tourist Police. The maximum fare should not be more than 15 euros.", "title": "I should probably keep this place to myself :)", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Massimo1", "date": "December 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 51163452}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you want somewhere small, individual and unique to stay in Rome, try the Torre Colonna.
