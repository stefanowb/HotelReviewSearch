First of all it was a rip-off about - $260/room (TimeSqure is a possibility with that kind of money). The unspeakably unprofessional (and uncivilized) staff was very rude and was treating guests as if they were doing a favor lending rooms to them. When asked about a refrigerator that their web site promised, and was a necessity with kids, the owner insisted I pay extra for this and hung up on me when I was persistent. When confronted at front desk, he threatened me with eviction. He backed off when after threatening to call the cops myself.

This is where u stay when your not looking to spend too much money. i dont know what people expect to see but it was fine to us considering the amount we payed. We expected worse believe it or not. But the place was VERY clean and the staff was very professional(2005). Electronic locks on the door, cable tv, clean bathroom, very roomy, we even had a balcony. There are only 3 things that i felt normal people might not like about the lodge...1st is the Continental breakfast. mini muffins, and milk. 2nd we stayed at the lodge in the summer. And on the balcony there is a light that we were unable to turn off so it attracted ALOT of bugs....so what we did was take a shoebox and coverd the light and ...i know this is gonna sound a bit extreme ...lol... but i took my wifes hairspray and a lighter and torched the bugs out of there. Didnt have no problems after that cause the light was blocked. But now that u are reading this review i will save u time and tell u to just buy OFF deck and patio. 3rd the lodge is on the new york side...all the attractions of niagara falls are on the canadian side. its about 3 miles away so its alot of walking. i would recommend STAYING ON THE CANADIAN SIDE!

Because I intended to use choice stamps (part of Choice Hotels \"loyalty\" program) for one of my nights on this stay, I subsequently called the Choice reservation number to find out what I had to do to use the stamps. I was told to just present them at check-in for a $50 credit towards the room rate that I had booked on-line. When I went to check -in for the stay, the desk clerk told me they couldn't honor the stamps because \"it was not showing up in the computer reservation that I was intending to use them.\" I also was told that they were no longer giving out stamps for stays either, and that a Choice representative came to the property and took all the stamps. After spending about 50 minutes on the telephone with Choice and having them call the hotel, I was then told by the desk clerk that the manager had OK'd the use of the $50 stamps, but only toward the hotel RACK RATE, which was almost $10 higher after taxes. The desk clerk kept telling me that the manager would be in, but I did not ever see him to discuss the matter. As far as the room goes, I had problems getting into the room with the key card. I used it a couple times immediately after checking in, but later in the day, and during the next day I had problems getting in. The same desk clerk told me that it was probably due to the weather. This didn't make much sense because although it was about 35 degrees with a slight drizzle of rain, the weather is much worse during more than a few months there. So I guess this kind of problem I had with the key card must happen pretty much all winter. The desk clerk had to reissue a key card a couple times in order for it to work. The heater in the room would keep going off on me, even though I had it adjusted to a low heat CONSTANT setting. I would wake up cold and have to turn it on again. This happened six or seven times during my two day stay. The room was clean and quiet enough (I think because there were only three or four rooms occupied from the looks of the parking lot at night). The TV had cable, but they didn't even have ESPN on it, let alone ESPN2. Since I mainly watch sports on TV, this was a big negative for me. They did have three or four channels geared toward the Indian (Asian) population, and since they had a restaurant, or at least a sign for an Indian restaurant, I guess they cater to an Indian crowd. Bottom line: I spent a lot of time, and a very uncomfortable first night in this hotel because the hotel simply didn't want to follow the rules of the hotel chain. And had to pay a rate higher than what I was suppose to be guaranteed by Choice Hotels. Would never stay here again, and am intending to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau on the area.", "user": "cindydb", "date": "October 7, 2007", "id": 10050858}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you are going to the falls I would Rec staying on the Canada side.

The lot was incredibly small -- maybe 20 car capacity at most -- and also catered to a busy Indian restaurant in the building. The clerk suggested that if we couldn't find a space, we pay $5.00 down the street at the public lot. The common spaces (elevator, stairwells, hallways) were dirty and smelled it. Our room was unbearably small (there wasn't room for all the furniture), dirty and smelled of after shave even after the window had been wide open for 2 hours.
