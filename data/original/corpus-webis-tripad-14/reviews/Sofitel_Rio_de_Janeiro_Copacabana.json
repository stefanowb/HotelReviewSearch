Right between Copacabana and Ipanema Beaches. There is a good choice of restaurants and bars - not at the cutting edge of the city, but perfectly adequate. The rooms are recently renovated and offer, smart, if not unmemorable decor. A good design feature is that due to the small bathrooms, they have ditched having a tub and opted for a large, walk in shower. This is also complimented by lovely L'Occetiane amenities. There is WiFi (which you have to pay for) and as with all Sofitels, a sumptuous breakfast buffet and wonderful selection of fresh pastries. Breakfast can also be taken on the terrace, which has spectacular views of the city, beach and Sugar Loaf Mountain. The staff are friendly and helpful - however, the Front Door Staff push the over priced hotel car, rather than calling you a taxi a little too often (insist on the latter). Overall, the hotel is a little tired - but a good option, based on price and location.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Globaladventure", "date": "August 25, 2012", "id": 138325174}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Having in mind that ALL accomodation in Rio is highly overpriced, the Sofitel is a nice surprise.

Check in was efficient and staff were very friendly, it was so obvious that they were well trained by a professional outfit. The room whilst on the small side and not overly modern, suddenly became very attractive when I saw the balcony and view of the beach and sugar loaf, it was stunning, no other words to describe. The only negative comment I have is that my room had a musty smell that was unpleasant when you first walked in.
