Our room came with a queen size bed, sofa, coffee table, small writing desk and a chair, breakfast table and chairs for two, TV, small refrigerator, microwave and a coffee maker. There is free WiFi available from your room. The bathroom was stocked with some shampoo packets and small bar soaps along with three sets of bath towel, hand towel and wash clothes. The room is not fancy, but everything is kept neat and clean. Our room was facing a highway, and we could hear some truck noise, but not enough to bother us. There is a restraunt next to the front office which is only open for dinner. With tax and everything, we paid about $70 per night. You pay for the entire stay up front when you check in.", "title": "No frill, but clean motel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Fortwood", "date": "October 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 84233570}], "location": {"country": "Canada", "city": "Chase"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667}
