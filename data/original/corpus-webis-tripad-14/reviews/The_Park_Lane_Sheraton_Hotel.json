I make at least one trip a year to this great city and usually stay within the West End of London. As a recent SPG member I thought of staying here considering the great location. But, right from the word go it was quite bad. The day I arrived after a very long and delayed flight, the weather in London was extremely stormy. The taxi from Paddington dropped me on the main road, i.e., Piccadilly. I did not find any doorman to welcome me. Nor there was any proper reception within the hotel through the front entrance. Instead to my utter dismay I found myself into a casual dining area where people were having drinks and eats, some of them stared at me while I was struggling with a suitcase, laptop and a hand bag. After sometime a hotel staff came forward and guided me to the reception at the back of the ground floor. I then discovered that the main entrance was in a small lane off the main road where there was no arrow or sign showing the right way. I booked an executive room with high expectations. But, I was allotted a room without a view and very stuffy. When asked for a change I was refused. Afterwards I spoke to the Duty Manager and insisted in a change of room as I found it to be absolutely suffocating. Hence, it would not be possible to spend two full days and night there. Anyway, after much insistence he obliged and allocated a better room with good view. However, I found hotel staff in every area were quite stiff and unfriendly. The hotel was not of Sheraton class or standard and appeared highly neglected. The front entrance area leading to the dining hall stinks. The aircon controls in room did not work at all, hence, I had to keep my window open throughout the night. Even the towels in the bathroom did not have the desired freshness.
