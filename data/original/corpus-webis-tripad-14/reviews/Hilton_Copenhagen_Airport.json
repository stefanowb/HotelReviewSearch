In itself it is not bad but the finer details you would expect from a top hotel are missing. The room we had (1213) on one of the executive floors was OK but the carpet, chair and footstool were all stained. The quilt cover was threadbare and a magnifying mirror in the bathroom was lacking the glass part. Several calls were needed to get a response from housekeeping who changed the quilt but claimed the stains were candle wax and could not be removed. The mirror was ignored. We were offered a new room but the first room should never have been allowed to get into that state. The bathroom was ok but nothing special.", "title": "Not The Best??", "user": "Globe-spanner", "date": "September 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 44257134}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled solo", "text": "In the main reception the table tops were all badly stained (glasses and bottles).
