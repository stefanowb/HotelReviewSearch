While our overall impression and experience was very good, a few small details marred the otherwise excellent experience. We chose it for the location, which allowed us to walk to many of the attractions we had come to see. We also enjoyed the view from our top floor room, as well as from the \"executive lounge\" where we enjoyed the nightly happy hour. The happy hour boasted excellent wine and a good selection of appetizers; people with small appetites could actually make a meal of these offerings. We also appreciated the indoor lap pool; due to cool weather, the outdoor pool was closed during our stay. The in-room promotional video talks about a wine bar in the lobby; this was nonexistent at the time of our stay. In addition, restaurant hours mentioned in the video were not the same as the actual hours at the time of our stay. And the bathroom could have been cleaner on the day we checked in; on subsequent days, this was corrected.", "title": "The devil is in the details.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "akexpat", "date": "October 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142767760}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I would say that is one of the better hotels in DF area.

At the same time, if you are on business, this location is not right next door to the areas where most corporate offices are, so on busy days you may experience some traffic. For some travelers this is compensated by this hotel's relative proximity to the airport, especially if you have an early AM flight on your departure date. One thing you should not miss: one of Mexico City's most outstanding restaurants serving authentic traditional regional dishes for breakfast / brunch / and lunch is located right adjacent to the hotel lobby. It is called \"El Cardenal\", and is independently owned and operated with a long tradition that pre-dates the hotel. People come from all over Mexico to savor the menu, and there are often long waiting lines. As a guest at the hotel you have a tremendous advantage in being able to set up dining times in advance or being able to spot last-minute opportunities to get a table.
