Yes, it's far from everything except Sea World, but you know that before you book so it can't be complained about. Yes, it's a little bit expensive, but it is a gorgeous resort and well worth the money you spend on the nightly rate. Pool bar service was good and the bartenders were wonderful. Food was also good. I found the employees to be very courteous and helpful. Overall, this is one of my favorite resorts in Orlando, but on this trip several things bothered me. To charge $12.00 per night for self parking is insane as you are already paying $200 plus per night for the room. We needed to use our laptop the first day we were there for about an hour for business purposes. We never used it again after that and yet we were charged 13.00 for each day we were there (6). We didn't even bother trying to work it out with the front desk because they stilled owed us $104.00 credit from the last time we were there. When we questioned them about that (and yes, we had our receipt from our last stay) they told us to call accounting. After explaining to them that we had been trying to reach accounting for many months, they gave us the credit. The resort itself is outstanding, but they do have some service issues that could be improved. Would I return? Definitely...love that pool!!!", "user": "lvgiants10", "date": "August 8, 2007", "id": 8371076}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "3rd year in a fow - fantastic", "text": "We stayed at the JW Marriott for the 3rd year in a row for my son's birthday.

All I can say is WOW! What a beautiful resort! I didn't want to leave. I was so impressed with the friendly staff that was very willing to accomodate us in every way. They did forget to place a crib in our room for our twins BUT when my husband called for the crib they said they would send one right up but decided the sleeper sofa was fine and they brought up linens/blankets for the kids right away. The staff was walking about eager to please to guests and asked if we wanted our picture taken *as a family* which I thought was very nice. I felt very well taken care of there!as did my husband. The very well manicured grounds were impeccable. The room was beautiful. It was a deluxe garden view room with down feather bedding and duvets........beds were turned down in the evening (after a long day out at Disney)and had soft nature type music playing on the radio when we returned to our room. A nice touch was also mints left on the bed with the weather for tomorrow on a small card which was \"sweet'. Loved the place. I did rave about it to an Asian girl we encountered at checkout at the desk and told her it was so much better than the Omni.She really had no expression and seemed very hurried and not very customer service oriented.

Everything was perfect. The hotel and rooms where immaculate, the lobby beautiful (better than the ritz if you ask me), the gardens enchanting and the pool area was the best hotel pool I'd ever been (lazy river was so cool, lol). The location was great, not being too far from all the attractions and theme parks, but detached enough to feel like you're in your own private resort away from Orlando. The grounds the whole resort is set in was beautiful and you could easily get lost and just simply be mesmerized by the gardens Spanish architecture and sheer beauty and grandeur of the hotel. There are times when you really feel like you are in a Spanish castle set in paradise ( I recommend on teh first day of your rip to just wander around and get lost in the resort to just explore whats what and where everything is). The spa is world class and has an excellent hi-tech gym. There were several restaurant we visited. We went to Quench which has superbly large portions of food (great caeser salad), Primo which has divine food in very classic surroundings, and Citron which has fabulous breakfast buffets and THE best lunch buffets in the world (didn't have time to go to the dinner) , with incredibly affordable prices (being a Londoner where everything cost at least triple, it was an excellent bonus). The rooms were tastefuly furnished which good entertainment systems. The beds were very comfortable and the turndown service was lovely. The best part of the room was the bathroom. Its very spacious with bath and separate shower and the soap they supply is best smelling soap ever! However, the best thing about the hotel was the amazing service they provided us. Service was very rapid in all circumstances. Every member of staff would greet us without fail which was very nice. There were a few people who really helped us out, and one lady was Sherry, she was very sweet. Also at the concierge there was a lady whos' name I have forgotten, but worked on the left most desk. Not only was she genuinely funny, but she also gave definitive, unparalled advice on what to do and where to go and answered all our questions as best as possible, so if you got any questions go to her! I really do struggle to pick a fault with the hotel, the only problem I encountered was that the beauty of the hotel and its abundance of attractions and facilities distracted me from actually visiting alot of Orlando's attractions lol.

The kids are always happy with the food and I enjoy being able to stay in my poolside chair and still have food & beverage service. The only problem with Quench is if it rains they close early AND on regular nights they close around sunset (NOT at dark, but sunset). Quench does all you to open a bar/food tab poolside and they will keep it open all day for you & you have the same server. We loved Courtney and Austin! Fabulous servers! The pool is the main source of entertainment for our kids (12 & 15), but they also have a pool table set up, outdoor chess, volleyball, & a game room.

The room decor and size are excellent, but a bit less sophisticated than the Ritz-Carlton next door (which we stayed at last year for our tenth anniversary). We have three small children, whom we love of course, but really did not want to have alot of children running around on the property. While the resort bills itself as kid-friendly, it has nowhere near the child population density of the Disney and Universal resorts. If you want to eat breakfast on the property, definately pay an extra 20 per night to get breakfast for four at the Citron Cafe (two adults and two children under 12)...great deal, as the \"Le Grande\" buffet is 22 bucks a pop. Great resort for a romantic getaway...highly recommended.", "title": "Exquisite", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Barry B", "date": "February 6, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3166362}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved JW Marriott!", "text": "Beautiful rooms and excellent service.

It is beautiful, equipped with an open, elegant atmosphere. The marbled floors and pillars, the fountains, candles and bouquets of fresh flowers certainly make this hotel stand out from all the rest. Two factors which stand out most significantly for me are the lazy river pool area and the breakfast buffet at the Citron restaurant. The lazy river is a spectacular change from the routine hotel pool. Not only is it fully heated, it is lavishly landscaped and truly beautiful. My only disappointments were that it was rather difficult as a parent to keep an eye on or follow your child through the maze of water and that only once was someone available to give me a towel from the \"hut\" located in the pool area. Every other time either no one was working or there were no towels available. As for the breakfast buffet...it is something to behold! Everything imaginable is available from fresh fruit to quiche to oatmeal and everything in between. There are also two chefs on staff who cook up made-to-order omelettes and Belgian waffles. Happily this buffet was included with my room since the bill for two adults and two children came to $99.00! As for the room, it was classically decorated. The beds were comfortable with down bedding and many down pillows, however, for the price, I expected the room to be larger. The marble floored bathroom included a glass shower with separate tub, but it was probably half the size of the entire room. We did request a refrigerator and a small dorm-size one was brought in but the only area it could be placed was at the end of one of the beds, which made it stick out quite a bit and very awkward to get around. As for the staff, I found them to be top-notch--friendly and hardworking. All in all, I'm glad we experienced the JW Marriott, but do not feel the $250/night + parking is worth a return visit.", "title": "Truly Beautiful!", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "GooChick", "date": "January 9, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2990753}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Best", "text": "Stayed five times in 2004 and twice in 2005 already!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Paul_Ream_T2", "date": "January 8, 2005", "id": 2990082}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Beautiful Hotel - Weak Service", "text": "Lovely landscaping, design and decoration.", "user": "frequentrvlr", "date": "July 23, 2007", "id": 8223834}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Absolutely fabulous!", "text": "The service I would rate a 2 out of 5.

Bedding was gorgeous, room was gorgeous, flat screen tv's . The bathroom was also gigantic......wonderful bath products. The staff was very accommodating and very sweet....I asked our maid if she would mind leaving additional bath products since there were 2 of us sharing them, and every day I would find 4 shampoos, conditioners, lotions, soaps....4 of each thing left for us...along with extra big, fluffy towels.

I had scheduled a nail appt in the salon for a pink/white fill while I was there....very expensive and not up to par with my usual manicurist, (my manicurist was of course appalled....\"they charged you how much?? For this??? lol!! ) loved the pedicure though. One thing I didn't care for was the big push after your massage to sell you the products that were used in your massage. Don't comment to your masseuse that you like anything....because you will find a bag full of everything you mentioned at the front desk ready to ring up with your massage (they certainly aren't giving it to you for free...) I thought it might be a fluke the first time, (maybe I DID tell her I was interested? Didn't recall saying anything) and sure enough...on the 2nd stay, same thing. another bag waiting for me at checkout......
