However what we rec'd is not the photo of the room we saw online. Our room was opposite the elevator in the older/refurbished section. The room was small...about 12 x 13 ft and there is only one desk chair to sit in. So one of us had to lie on the bed at all times. The headboard takes up the entire wall. No luggage rack, so we stacked them atop one another on the floor. The towel heater in bath didn't work. If you like shampoo, bring your own as the soap is from a liquid dispenser. The room is clean and I am not one to ask to be moved once I've been given a room---I just write a review of my experience. If you stay here and need parking, make sure you reserve a space as I think there are about 8 spaces in their garage. Also, make sure you have an up to date GPS or specific driving directions from the hotel as it is tricky to find because of one way streets and barricades. Dinner / breakfast were adequate.
