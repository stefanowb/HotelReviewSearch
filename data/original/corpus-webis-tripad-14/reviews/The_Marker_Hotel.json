We booked late in the week and with a rugby match in town we payed what I consider 'a lot' for bed and breakfast. \u20ac309. Check in is after 3pm so if you're staying for one night this is pretty late. We were on a night away in town away from the early starts one has with children. However, our room was at the end of a corridor and right beside a large extractor fan which kicked into action at approx 6am. Our sleep was interrupted and our sleep-in well and truly over. At check out we made our feelings known and at first were told that maintenance would be made aware of the issue with the noise (brush off in my opinion, maintenance will never be able to do anything about that noise, it is what it is and might I add the receptionist knew exactly what we were referring to when we told her our room number). At this I added that this wasn't acceptable when you pay this type of money for a night away of uninterrupted sleep. She then went to discuss it with her manager whose response was to give us a refund on two glasses of wine we had had with lunch and the tip totalling \u20ac18.50. I can tell you my nights sleep was worth a lot more to me than \u20ac18.50. I made no further complaint as I considered this an insult.
