We stayed on 3 top hotels in the Andaman sea area now in October (Layana, The Racha, Twinpalms) but this is definitely my favourite.

Ko Lanta is a quiet island off season, but I would like to add here that the hotel offers you a variety of things to do at reasonable prices like the mountainbike tour (highly recommended) and the sunset cruise, kajaking, crab fishing etc. They also have a nice choice of DVDs in the library for the evenings, after the bar closes. You won t be bored. Restaurant is excellent, service the best ever, rooms very nice and clean, design great.

The menu in the restaurant is good as well for diner and lunch, the price quality of the food is good, the wine is more expensive but that's the case in most of the better hotels.
