There were at least four 'front of house' people checking us in, and dazzling us with helpfulness and much conversation. We were overwhlemed. This distraction must have been the reason why they took my credit card details twice in the tiny quaint room behind the front desk. We did find our room particularly small, and crowded. The food, both dinner and breakfast were satisfactory. However the final bill which was taken from my credit card, included an extra amount of over \u00a33000; this was taken out of my account on three ocassions during the week when I was on the Orient Express. This I was informed was a mistake, which caused me great stress and consternation, not to mind loosing time at work and money ringing International numbers in order to sort the mess out. That type of mistake is not 5 star administration, nor is the casual way in which they handled the matter.

As a birthday splurge for myself - I wanted an old elegant hotel with some history. The Goring did not disappoint. In fact - my stay at the Goring was by far the most wonderful hotel experience I've ever had in my life. The hotel itself is beautiful, the beds are a dream, there are towel warmers in the bathrooms and Afternoon Tea is delicious. But the service is second to none. I've never had such service; they were always anticipating my needs before I realized them myself. I mentioned in passing to the concierge one morning that I was thinking about visiting Hampton Court. When I returned to the front desk later to get my key - they had printed out maps and visitor information for Hampton Court. Another morning - while having breakfast in their gorgeous dining room - I saw one of the wait staff approaching me from across the room, unfolding a napkin. I thought that was odd since I already had a napkin. Then I glanced down and noticed that my napkin had fallen to the floor. I hadn't even realized it. But the wait staff had noticed before I did and was bringing me another one! Seriously! Who does that? That is the kind of attention you can expect at The Goring. And the location was perfect. If one turns left out the hotel and travels about a block - you'll soon see Victoria Station. If one turns right and goes to the end of the street - you'll be walking along the walls of Buckingham Palace. It was so easy to get every where. I wish everyone could experience The Goring.

I was greeted warmly at the front door and to my pleasant suprise I was given a room right away and I was taking a nap by 7:15am.

The warm bathroom floor and warming rack for the towels was a great touch.
