I brought up our disappointment with reception when we checked out, I then sent an email when we got home. We had a reply very quickly acknowledging that there was a problem with the restaurant on the night we ate, we were offered an upgrade to a Q Star room if we returned, so we thought we would try again & have just returned having had a much better stay. Our room was a good size & the bed very comfortable, with a Q Star room you get a few extras, alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks in the fridge, better quality tea & coffee & a free newspaper, we had to sleep with the window open as the weather was warm & there was some traffic noise from the main road. we decided not to eat in the main restaurant this time having a bar meal instead which we enjoyed. Breakfast was very good, can recommend the cooked to order omelets which were delicious. All the staff were very friendly & polite with nothing being too much trouble. Stratford town centre is 10mins away with free on street parking after 6pm if you want venture out in the evening.
