Despite asking for an early check in, we were denied a room until 3:00 on the nose. I even mentioned that I was a Starwood Preferred Guest and the manager shrugged his shoulders. Therefore, my husband and I were stuck in the lobby for approximately four hours before we were permitted to check in. Staff told me that they would not call me or open up a room until exactly 3:00 pm. Furthermore, this hotel seemed unable to provide adequate taxi service. The bellmen wouldn't help and it took about a half hour of standing in the freezing cold to get a taxi ride from the hotel. The food for the convention was overcooked and on average, substandard.

I have tried the marriott ok but tired and the best western not bad and other hotels as well but i always find myself coming back to the sheraton. yes it is the pricey hotel in town along with the embassy suites but the location and first class amenities and nice clean rooms keep me returning. it is truely in a class by itself when it comes to other chain hotels around there. It is first class all they way but the prices of the rooms can get enormous depending on the time of the year you go. so check on line before go so you want be surprised!! you could pay as much as 200 or more if something big like furniture market is in town of course asssuming you can even get a room during then. i usually pay around 130 for a room during normal convention times. i have paid as liittle as 110 or 118 during below normal busy times. you just need to check first. one secret though is to ask for a room in tower 2 or the new tower as i call it. the older tower and west wing is not nearly as opoulant as the newer tower 2. if you can get tower 2 on a high floor. it has one of the most beautiful night scenes you will ever see from the huge picure windows in the rooms. dont get a king room though in the new tower because it is much smaller rooms. but if you take my advice get a 2 bedded room in the newer tower 2 with a high floor and you will not be dissapointed or so i think. and i am pretty pickey when it comes to hotels that meet my expectations.", "title": "A great hotel but pricey sometimes", "user": "rodney1991", "date": "November 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6120861, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the bed", "disliked": "\u2014 the price"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled on business", "text": "I spent three nights at this hotel for a conference. Later in the same week I stayed at a Sheraton In Dallas and let me just say the Greensboro location looks likes the Westin in comparison. This review will appeal more to SPG awards members as I have no complaints about the hotel or the accomodations as they were more than adequate.Overall, the hotel is nice, it is very large and rooms were clean. They have upgraded their bedding and it is very plush. My issue really stems from front desk staff not acknowledging my preferred gold status. (I will say, in general every Sheraton that I have stayed at this has been a problem.). I was checked into a tiny, tiny King room and the bed was the same width of the room save 2 feet on either size. I am supposed to be upgraded if anything is available. After going down to the front desk 3 times, the manager switched my room to a very large room with two double beds.
