We found the staff quite helpful and very friendly. They helped us with cancellation of another hotel reservation and arranged a day trip to Granada for us. We did not eat at the hotel.

As other reviews have noted, it is only a 10 minute walk to the cathedral and the Alcazar. There is a taxi stand immediately outside the hotel's front door. A word of caution: some rooms in both the older section and the newer section face into an interior atrium. I would not be especially happy with these rooms and would much prefer rooms facing a street. A side note: we needed to wash clothes in Seville and did not wish to pay hotel prices, which I calculate would have been 50-100 euros for what we had. Instead, we found two lavanderias on side streets between the hotel and the cathedral where we could have our clothes washed, dried, and folded in a matter of a few hours for 5-6 euros per load (we had two loads). The first, which we checked out but did not use because the hours were not as convenient for us is Lavanderia Robledo; it is at the turn in Calle Federico Sanchez Bedoya (#18), not much more than an alley that runs off Avenida de la Constitucion opposite the cathedral. The proprietor did not speak any English and we do not speak any Spanish, but we managed to communicate that they had finished washing for the day but they would be glad to do it the next and it would take about 4 hours. Instead, we used Lavanderia y Tinto Roma, Calle Casteler, #2, which is actually just a block or so away from Lavanderia Robledo, closer to the bullring. This is an English friendly establishment; we dropped off the wash before 10:00 and it was ready at 12:30. Both are an easy walk from the hotel, even carrying your dirty laundry.
