I think it is worth the extra few dollars to stay in a hotel in the Disney Complex. The cheapest rooms are the All Star resorts (Sports, Music, Movies). The rooms are just adequate. Two double beds and a small bath, cable TV, Nothing exotic. The beds were comfortable and the bed linens were fine. The room was clean but a little dated. However, the beauty of these hotels is the transportation system that allows you to park your car when you arrive and forget about it until it's time to leave. We stayed 3 nights and never used the car once. Just outside the main entrance is a bus stop with 5 or 6 different destination lines. You can take a bus to any of the 4 major amusement parks or the two water parks. There is never a long wait and the busses are handicap accesible. A handicapped friend told me that Disney World is the most accessible place he has ever visited. Our hotel was 10 separate three story buldings with 30 rooms per building. They are no different than a Days Innor other budget hotel. They were all situated around a nice swimming pool. The main lobby had a cafeteria, gift shop and other services. You spend so little time in the hotel, I don't understand the benefit of spending $400 per night at one of the nicer hotels, when this one charged around $125 per night. Spend the money you save on park tickets which are fairly expensive (@ $90).
