We were obviously leery after reading some of the reviews, but we figured it couldn't be too bad for one night and $50. The hotel is located near the end of the hotel strip, but worked out great with our rental car. There is a Denny's restaurant right across the street, and the on site restaurant looked very nice. When we arrived, we were pleasantly suprised at the exterior and the beautiful lobby. Check in was quick and efficient, with Ennis providing great and friendly service. We asked for a renovated room, and he was happy to oblige. Our room faced the pool, so there was a short walk through an outside corridor to reach it from the parking lot, and we did notice quite a bit of noise late into the night from the pool area. I attribute this more to the Saturday night drinking crowd than to any fault of the hotel. We noticed that all the sidewalks had water pooling on them from the air conditioners, so beware of slip hazards. Our room was perfectly fine. The bedding and furnishings were new and very attractive. There were a few cosmetic issues that the picky people looking for flaws would find (the lip in the sink was full of black mold that reflected in the mirror, the bathroom had been freshly painted with new tiling, but they put the old rusty shower rod back up) but we were very pleased with the room. I do hate the dreaded double beds, though. We weren't able to choose due to our low rate, but I wish hotels would do queens instead of doubles. The courtyard area was extremely nice, with a fantastic pool area, basketball court, sand volleyball, beach front restaurant, nice decorations, and great access to the beach. We did not see any trash or debris anywhere on the property as reported in previous reviews. Frankly, we wondered if we were staying at the same hotel as in those reviews. We found this resort to be fantastic, and could have easily spent a few days just using the facilities here, and enjoying the beach. I would probably not get a pool front room again, because of the noise, but we have had the same problem in $300 a night hotels as well. I would definately stay at this hotel again, and kudos to the staff for their excellent service. We have simple tastes and don't look to go picking a place apart, and we were very pleased here.", "title": "Excellent value", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "cruiserlori", "date": "October 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 142075480}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "The First room was so moldy and a beautiful view of the trash laden parking lot... kind of scary area... front desk staff was VERY nice... so they upgraded us to ocean view.. first floor so you couldn't see the ocean really.... no the bathroom was too nasty for me...

I saw a lot of the reviews stated roach infestation. I never saw a roach in the room. My only complaints would be you hear anyone who is talking/walking by your room (Nothing can be done as this is an old exterior hotel) and the A/C did not cool the room until we turned the A/C unit to 65 degrees.

First I sat down and booked my wedding, paid the deposit required then got a call hours later stating that there was a double booking for that time and day I chose (I was ok with moving that, no problems). There is a two story bar right next to the area for the ceremony so I was naturally concerned about bands etc going on while the nuptials were taking place, I was assured by the rep that not only would there not be anything going on but also my family could stand on the second story and watch the ceremony since I had over the 100 people max attending. Now when the big day came the wedding scheduled before me started 45 minutes late due to a family emergency (most likely someone was just late, not an emergency), worst part was that NOONE let us know about it so my guests were standing around confused about what was going on while I was oblivious to the situation. That isn't even the worst part, the wedding party before me had the 2nd story of the bar booked for their reception while my ceremony was supposed to be going on, so now not only was there a full blown party going on above us but also 20 of my guest had nowhere to sit or stand, I was told both by the person incharge of the wedding bookings and the bar waitress that this would NOT happen. The bridezilla refused to ask the DJ to turn off the music for 5 minutes so we could rush through everything so we decided to us the second ceremony back up option inside, place looked like a run down room where we were told \"there's the closet, go ahead and set up the chairs\". I dropped 10K for this wedding while the other party only paid for the dune fee seeing as the bar is not owned by the resort, when I vocalized my fustration to the rep about not being told about the delay and everything else she replied \"I don't care about this right now, I have another wedding going on.\" Total crap, she continuously told me that she wasn't a wedding planner so why was she catering to this group of maybe 30 people while 120 of my guests were put to the side? wasted 1.5 hours of my DJ useage and no apologies. My package also came with chocolate covered strawberries or something in the honeymoon suite, never received that either.", "title": "Ok to stay, don't get married here though...", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Mandy J", "date": "September 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 141377520}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Dirty, smelly disgusting place, I will NEVER return!", "text": "I just returned home from staying there for 3 nights and you couldn't pay me to return.

It smelled bad from the outside and was even worse after you opened the door(like you needed a hazmat suit to breathe).

I stayed here on a Friday night with 3 of my friends for my bachelorette party. When we got there, I had booked the wrong room on the website and Mark at the front desk changed it to the family room with a king and 3 bunk beds. He was great! He got us the room with no problem, check in took about 5 minutes. We asked if he could change our check out time from 11 to 12, got it! Then when we got to the room, they called us and said they were changing it to 2! We asked him about restaurants and bars, and he gave us great suggestions! The room was awesome! Clean, smelled good, and plenty of room for 4 girls and all of our stuff! The ONLY minor issue was the tub, it drained really slow, so we couldn't take showers back to back. The food, service, and prices were great at Mambos, and the pool is huge! All the staff was very helpful. I was a little sketchy from reading the reviews on this hotel, but when we got there we were amazed! Everything was clean and nice decor, smelled great (no moldy smell)! It is huge! There is volleyball, basketball, shuffleboard AND tennis courts! Arcade room, and fitness room. My friends and I will DEFINITELY be coming back!

The room smelled old and musty, was very tiny, and just felt allover gross and dirty. The sheets felt rough and cheap, and there wasnt even a blanket, the bed was uncomfortable. I feel really ripped off - especially once I saw that the Hampton Inn down the street had rooms for less $ (I love Hampton Inns).
