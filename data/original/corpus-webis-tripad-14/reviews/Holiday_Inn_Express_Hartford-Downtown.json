Lets start with the positive - The bed was a decent sleep and the location is great. I traveled on this business trip with two other co-workers and their assessments were quite the same. The view is a choice of the park and what we guessed was the Capital Building (beautiful); one co-worker had this. Or the very expensive parking lot (more on that later) and a view of a bar in the near distance. Two of had this view and the bar was only noticeable because at about 9PM until very late the blaring and pounding music was ever present to help soothe you to sleep. As a bonus when you look out your window when the tunes first start you get a view of two very large projection screens of chicks (in one case 2 cheerleaders) dancing together late into the night. Sure I would normally look at this as a bonus, but I could not help but think of any family vacations going on and the conversations this would start. The room was clean, with a weird smell that only got worse when you walked through the very warm halls to and from your home away from home. The bathroom has NO counter space and the free toiletries were adequate except for one thing - the mouthwash. I polled my fellow travelers and 2 of 3 had this experience: The small bottle of mouthwash looked as if it had spent the night lodged in the wrong orifice for which it was intended.
