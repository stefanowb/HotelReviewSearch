Our room was large, as was the baclony.They brought in a roll away bed for our teenage daughter. The breakfast in the morning had many items to choose from, and you can walk to almost anyway in the city. We were about 2 blocks from the main shopping street which had dozens of restaurants and coffe shops on it. It was about a 15-20 min. walk to Old Town. We only used the subway once. Old Town was very interesting, like stepping back in time. We would also recommend a boat sightseeing tour. The Vasa museum was fantastic, with this complete 300+ year old ship that was put back together. All and all, Stockholm is a wonderful city with losts of museums.
