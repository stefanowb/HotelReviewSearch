The rooms and common area were spotless! The family that runs the hotel was polite, but rather reserved, not a lot of chit chat. The location in Bloomsbury is very convenient and about a 15-20 minute walk from Trafalgar Square. Lots of restaurants and pubs nearby, and the British Musuem is also close enough to walk to. Breakfast is served each morning with a choice of a traditional English breakfast (eggs, ham, beans) or cereal. The only downside to this hotel would be for an elderly or disabled person. Although we were in room 8 on the 2nd floor, this required a climb of 4 flights of rather steep stairs. Also, breakfast is served in the basement which requires additional stairs.

Being Italian, and therefore a little fussier than normal, we expected to find a little less and a little worse than what we had read but in fact it was quite the opposite. The location were great, so much so that we moved about on foot most of the time. The rooms were clean, adequately spacious and well-equipped. We asked for a room on the 2nd floor with a view of the back garden and that is exactly what we got! Our bed was very comfortable, the room had plenty of space (as B&B go) for moving about and leaving the occasional thing on the floor without blocking everyone's way. The toilet was the best part: tiled from top to bottom (even the roof was tiled!), with a great shower that had none of those electric things where you pull the cord and the water gets hot -- it was real boiler-hot water! And even the pressure from the taps, as read in the reviews, was high and nice. Service was discrete but excellent, as was the full English breakfast we had every morning.
