Wasn't sure if there are other restaurants they operate, there used to be a Chinese and middle eastern one which I believe has closed down.

The Hotel car park is full, i have to park at the next building. I try to ask it is possible to park my car in front of the lobby there as i saw some empty car park that is for valet parking and they are not being helpful at all, have to pay Rm 15 for it (per entry) When i had taken my room i found the air cont is not working at all as firstly i was thinking that maybe it is because of we just checked into the hotel so have to wait for a longer periods of time to cool of the room. My poor children's are very tired and slept it without air cont for an hours, as i start to wondering why such a expensive hotel services is so bad, no air cont and no car park option for those hotel guess that is traveling with Children's.

We demand to ask for changing rooms all of together but they tend to ignore our complain ! We are so angry as watching our kids are sweating! the Manger does not replying our request fast, as i think they are pretty busy.

I am glad I switched to the Puteri Pacific after the first night. I had a very early check in and was upgraded to a family room. The staff at the Puteri Pacific are incredibly warm and eager to please (Malaysian hospitality). I had access to a gym and pool, which were very important for me (none at the Citrus). The property itself is a bit dated, but rooms are large. Be sure to ask for a non-smoking room, as people still smoke like chimneys in this part of the world. I had breakfast every morning at the Puteri Cafe, and the spread is very good. They put out both local and Western selections (although no fresh juice or skim milk). The location can't be beat - 5 mins walk to City Square (large mall) and the train station (JB Central).

Now about the hotel room- I had a renovated 2 room suite and I think low bid won the contract. No hot water, despite repeated requests, in the tub/shower during my entire 5 night stay. i had the opportunity to change hotels but refused because of Jay's great service on the 16th floor. In fact, everyone was awesome on the 16th floor which enabled our group to tolerate the disadvantages of their personal hotel rooms. You were made to feel quite special.
