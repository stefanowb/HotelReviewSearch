We slept with open windows all week, and heard no noise other than high heels walking (echoing!) across the courtyard when someone came in, in the wee hours. We also happened to be there the night France won at rugby in the championships, when there was lots of revelling in the streets. My husband got up about 3 am to use the washroom and could faintly hear the noise in the streets while at the window by the bathroom - otherwise, we heard nothing.", "user": "pfq", "date": "November 12, 2007", "id": 10766475}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "lovely hotel", "text": "The room was quite pleasant.

A group of 12 of us booked it as it was in the Marais, with good reviews, fair prices and with a suite for socialising. The hotel reception is small and non-descript, but the rooms are stylish and clean. The duplex suite (number 56) is about the same size as many Parisienne apartments, and the standard rooms were all much more generous than other hotels in Paris I have stayed in.I loved the fact that you got proper hairdryers and irons with ironing boards in the room, and not those stupid things that are attached to the wall. The staff on reception were generally helpful and friendly, and put up with us very graciously, as there was much faffing around when we all arrived. There isn't much in the way of public areas in the hotel - bar, breakfast room etc (you can order breakfast to your room), but when you are in the Marais you don't need this. The location is excellent for bars and cafes, restaurants and most things you would want in Paris.
