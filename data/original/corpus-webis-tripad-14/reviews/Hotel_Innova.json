(its 9.50e on menu. I have to sing the praises of a restuarant only doors down from the hotel 'manger la salle' something like that, but a 3 course meal is only 19e it is wonderful and the man running the place is so nice. I cant understand why people gave out about the lift it is bright mirror lined and modern. Fab FAB fab hotel hopefully going back in the sringtime. Great location you dont realise how good it is to have a metro station across the road until you get over there, i want to take the paris metro back home to Ireland.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "HappyoutMeath", "date": "February 10, 2007", "id": 6777708}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Paris"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 43, "very good": 177, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 94}, "aka": "Innova Hotel Paris", "slim_ranking": 0.364751812605}
