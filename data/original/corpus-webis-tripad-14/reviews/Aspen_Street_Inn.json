Check-in was smooth, and though our luggage did not make it, we were assured by the manager that he would keep tabs on its arrival. We enjoyed the excellent happy hour, with nice choices of red and white wine and three kinds of micro brewed beers, with appetizers. The location of the Inn is superb; near the gondola, ski rental shop and town restaurants. The Campbird room was comfortable, a little cramped, but fine for a ski vacation. Having an area for ski and boot storage was a nice amenity. The gourmet breakfasts are excellent. Plenty of variety for all tastes, including delcious and interesting cold and hot items. The owners and managers are dedicated and engaging, which made for a positive experience. We would definitely stay here again.", "title": "A very nice stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Liz1953", "date": "March 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4601111}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "This is the second time my wife and I have stayed here in recent years, and this stay was as great as the first one.
