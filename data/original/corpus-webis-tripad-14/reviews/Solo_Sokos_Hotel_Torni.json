Location: Check. Centrally located in City Centre and within walking distance to most attractions including the ferry terminal (15 minute walk). Rooms: Check. Spacious rooms with high ceilings and plenty of natural light. Not a big fan of open showers (drain on floor) in the bathroom but that seems the norm in Europe. Service: Check. Very helpful at the front desk with any questions or requests we had. Had to catch a taxi at 4am and they had extra sandwiches waiting for us for our trip. Breakfast: Check. Quite impressed with the breakfast bar with cold and hot options. Ate big breakfasts everything morning to save on going out to lunch.", "title": "Excellant Stay", "user": "SeattleRican", "date": "August 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116576440}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011", "text": "Be sure to check out Ateljee Bar on the roof of the hotel.
