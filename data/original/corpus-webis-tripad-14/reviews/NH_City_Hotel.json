However, both hotels are very good and if either one is not available, the other will suit your needs. We stayed in the new \"tower\" part of the NH City, which is sleek and modern. The room was very well decorated, with a flatscreen TV, nice bathrobes, great toiletries, and huge windows with great views of the city. The only strange thing was that the bathroom sink was in the actual room, not the bathroom. However, other than being an odd set-up, this wasn't a big deal. The breakfast was very good, as at the NH Latino. I would stay here again.
