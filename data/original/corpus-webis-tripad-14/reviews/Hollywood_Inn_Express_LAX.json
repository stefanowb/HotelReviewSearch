I saved by getting a low rate and they have a shuttle. I would not pick this place for a longer stay. The check in clerk made me wait while he took care of other paperwork during check in, though the morning guy was much friendlier. The bed was decent and the room was big. The neighborhood is horrid. The TV shows everything with a blue tint and most channels don't come in. The juice machine for breakfast is out of order. If you want to get away ftom the aitport for a few hours and sleep, it will do the job. To stay any longer should be out of the question.

We sat outside for over an hour and took our clothes and left to Hollywood and left the door wide open. There is NO breakfast! These Indians with the red dot have coffe and toast! That is not a breAkfast! When you walk down the stairs it smells like curry! Plssss!!!!! Go elsewhere! The bed had a big dent in in the the person sleeping with me rolled all the way to my side and was literally sleeping on me!
