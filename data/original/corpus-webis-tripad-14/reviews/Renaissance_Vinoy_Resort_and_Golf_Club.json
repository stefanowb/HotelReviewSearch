The property was extensively renovated and offers to unique types of rooms. We have stayed at this property multiple times, both in the Tower Rooms and The Historic Main Hotel. The Tower rooms all offer a view of Tampa Bay and the South Facing Rooms have a view of St. Petersburg Harbor and Pier. The Tower rooms are newer and a little larger, and are convenient to parking as the garage entrance is adjacent to the elevators that lead to your room. The problem is the rooms are so convenient you could spend entire weekend never walking past the Pool and Spa Facilities to experience the Historic Main Property. We prefer the Main hotel, although the rooms are older, they are very well renovated and if you stay in the south facing of wing rooms you are guaranteed a very decent size room. Unlike most hotels I prefer the limited first floor rooms as they are well off the main public areas, but prevent you from having to deal with the very slow elevators located in the main property. The Hotel offers a lobby coffee bar, a few restaurants and a patio bar, as well as a short walk to many more dining options. The main restaurant Marcan's offers a Sunday brunch $50, hi tea, $14 and Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. The prices for dinner and drinks were decent and on Friday and Saturday Nights they offer live jazz music. I also liked the pub, but I thought the prices were high for dinner and for what you get. The pool bar breakfast is pricey, but they offered nice lunch and snack specials. The Hotel has a nice gift shop and history area, along with fitness facilities and a very 80's pool... straight out of Miami Vice. The property fronts the Bay and the area surrounding the Vinoy, even late at night is very safe. I would recommend walking to the pier or around the shops and restaurants at beachside and 3rd Ave S. As with all old hotels, with the character comes a few annoyances like slow drains and slower AC, but I think it is worth it. Now as with all my reviews I have problems, the front desk staff is always quick to offer you an attitude and if you\u2019re not quick to order a bottle of wine the service in the restaurants becomes slow quick, also the concierge the entire weekend was disinterested. On a positive side the valet and bag service staff was always friendly as well as the staff at the spa. Also if you do choose a room on the western wing be warned, though scenic, the walk from the garage is a good hike. All in all we do like the property, just be prepared to not be sensitive to the attitudes when checking in and the minor difficulties that sometimes come with history. Oh and one more thing, do not stay on a weekend when the Yankees are in town. Even as registered guests, who have no interest in baseball, our traversing through the hotel was made very uncomfortable by both the intrusive security and police and even more intrusive crazy fans and their children trying to acquire photo\u2019s and autographs in the lobby, restaurants, bars and even our room\u2026 yes in the middle of the night someone even knocked on our door.
