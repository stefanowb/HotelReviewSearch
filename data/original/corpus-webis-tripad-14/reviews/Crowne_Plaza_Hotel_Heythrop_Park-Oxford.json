The room itself was brilliant, certainly spacious enough for the 6 foot king-sized bed, a cot and space to walk around. There was a 32\" LCD on the wall - no HD channels though. The bathroom was also very spacious and clean. There was a separate walk in shower along with a bath. We were a bit worried when reading other reviews that the rooms would be on the small side but we did not see any of the standard rooms. Interestingly there was a notice in reception about upgrading for a fee to an executive room or suite.", "title": "Fantastic Stay", "user": "ElaineJ18", "date": "June 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132117121}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The Public Areas: There is indeed a two mile drive up to the hotel.

The car park is a little away from reception, which meant a bit of a slog with your luggage. You can pull up nearer to unload, but with signs saying no stopping/parking we did not bother in the end. The reception area is plush with access to bars and the restaurant.. Received a gold envelope upon checking in, thought there might have been some surprises in it, but alas merely a map of the grounds which were freely available on the reception desk.

This does not open until 18.30 to serve food, the bar there opens at 18.00. There was another pub if you head right out of the driveway entrance, but this has now closed down. So unless you are prepared for a 6-10 mile roundtrip drive to the next village food choices are limited to the hotel. We ended up having to eat in the hotel which is expensive, but actually very nice food. Mains are priced approx \u00a310-\u00a320. A bottle of the local Hook Norton beer is \u00a34.75! Breakfast is also expensive as mentioned in other reviews - we were offered a 'special deal' of \u00a315 per person when checking in, they also charge \u00a310 for under 12's. We were not prepared to pay \u00a310 for our toddler to have a couple of cornflakes and a sausage! Other IC Hotels usually have free breakfasts for kids - not this Crowne Plaza! Annoyingly checked on the hotel's website once home and it appears they do offer free kids breakfasts after all.", "title": "Nice rooms and nice area.
