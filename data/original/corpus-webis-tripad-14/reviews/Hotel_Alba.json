A local cafe had just been opened over the road and the locals don't speak to each other--they shout. Also is opposite a large refuse collection centre. 400bhp Cummins lorry engine running at max revs for nearly 1 hour from 12.45 onwards to empty huge refuse bins. A local dog managed to keep us up most of another night as it was part of a trio in a \"Who can bark the longest\" competition.This was reported to the manager who refused to go out and stop the incessant barking but said he would phone the police. By morning 6 we had had enough and demanded another room. a girl at the desk moved us along the corridor a fair bit away from the cafe area. For the last two nights the noise was a little subdued and we got some sleep.
