The room was very comfortable, clean and even though it was on the road it was pretty quiet. The staff was lovely as well. The food in the restaurant was also pretty good and again, very expensive.

Sunwapta found us a 2 bedroom cabin that, although wasn't anything special, it was very quaint and clean. Our only complaints was that there was no hairdryer and no complimentary wifi. Other than that, we were comfortable and appreciative of a last minute accommodation on a busy weekend ! We didn't walk the trail to the Falls as 1 of us was not well, but, it looked very inviting. We had breakfast there and was very impressed with the service as well as the food, both in taste and quantity.

Only the two nights were suppose to include meals (from the contest) but they added them on free for the entire trip for us and the food was excellent! That was extremely generous of Sunwapta! The staff gave us tips on what to see and do while visiting and patiently answered any questions we had. Some definite adventures to go on if your able when visiting Jasper would be the Motorcycle sidecar tour and white water rafting! We were warned that the internet was pretty much nil out there but that wasn't a problem for us, we wanted more of a technology free rest. We even used the fireplace the first night we arrived as it was a bit rainy. We had a cabin room with a king size be which we both found comfortable.

Would definately recommend mosquito spray as they are huge. The rooms were basic and quite cramped. We had two double beds, would have been better to just ave one to give more space. We tried the food in their restaurant the first night as it is a 45 minute drive into Jasper. It was supposed to be fine dining, but the food was very basic and very overpriced. I think the fact that they are the only restaurant for miles influences the high prices. The staff were excellent when we got stuck due to the mud slides, they booked us an extra night and didn't take advantage of the situation by charging higher prices.

The location was lovely, away from the traffic and activity of Jasper. The people were very friendly and accommodating. Beyond that, there was nothing special about the resort. The bed in our room was uncomfortable. The towels were scratchy. The screens on the windows didn't fit correctly and let Mosquitos in. The curtain on the door was 3\" shorter than the window allowing anyone to see in from the outside. They claim to have satellite Internet in all the rooms, but mostly it did not work.
