After a long day in the sun though, riding 2 and a half miles back to the property is pretty tiring. And worse, if you want to go back into town for dinner (since the dining options in the off-season near Cocotal are limited) you are faced with another 5 mile roundtrip ride.

Ernesto helped us set up our excursions and he always went the extra mile to book our tours. We enjoyed the use of the free kayaks and bikes. As other reviewers have written, be sure and kayak out to the reef as the snorkeling was pretty good. We biked to San Pedro (stunning) and in the opposite direction (North) and there is nowhere we would rather stay than Cocotal. We also went to the Chicken Drop at the Wahoo Lounge which was great fun! My husband won $25!

Just far enough away from town to avoid the hustle and bustle yet close enough to walk or ride bikes for meals, groceries and discovering San Pedro. We stayed in the newest of the three Cabana\u2019s on the lagoon side of the property for 8 of the 10 nights we were there.. It was absolutely perfect inside. The kitchen was all you could possibly need, the bed the most comfortable of any I\u2019ve slept in on numerous trips to Central America. Outside was hot and still, with little breeze (bring lots of bug spray) so we spent our time at the palapas by the beach, the covered pier, the pool and the honor bar. I had wanted to book our stay in the Casita right on the beach but in was only available for 2 nights in the middle of our stay. So we packed up and moved for the 2 nights. Calvin hauled our luggage back and forth. The Casita was fantastic, smaller kitchen that the Cabana but sufficient for our needs. There is a nice wicker sitting area inside and a covered porch to relax and watch the ocean and world pass by. Bikes and kayaks are provided and we made use of both many times. You can kayak out to the reef and tie up to a buoy and snorkel. Raul and Calvin were wonderful and took care of every need we had. The grounds are neat and everything was very clean. We did several snorkel trips with Yemen at White Sands Dive Shop next door, small boat and intimate service. Great Time! This review would not be complete without mentioning Mara the resort dog.

We were able to cook meals and really enjoyed sitting on the front porch enjoying the beautiful view. We used the bikes provided to ride everywhere. Our favorite place to eat was Ak'Bol. That had some outstanding food with outstanding prices. Try the stuffed fry jacks and salbutes! I may need to return just to eat there.

This is one of the best combinations of value and service I have experienced. Cocotal works with the White Sands Inn next door to help your fishing, scuba and snorkeling desires a reality as well. We stayed in one of their Cabanas and both I and my new wife enjoyed the king sized bed, the masterbathroom and kichenette that each are appointed with. Personally, I think that they are located in the best place to take advantage of Ambergris Cayes's solitude and sporting oportunities.

We were pleased that there can only be a small number of guests at any given time, so crowds are never an issue. It's far enough from the noise and crowds of San Pedro, but close enough by water taxi, bicycle, golf cart or cab to be convenient should you need to go into town. The accommodations are excellent. We stayed in a garden cabana and quickly decided that we would be able to live there permanently. The cabana is equipped with absolutely everything you could possibly need for a short or extended stay. The grounds at Cocotal are beautiful and meticulously maintained. There is a nice pool area and honor bar as well as a pier extending into the Caribbean Sea. We took advantage of the on-site kayaks and bicycles. In addition to the amenities, location and natural beauty that make Cocotal the top destination on Ambergris Caye, the staff is also top-notch. Ernesto and Adelita in the office kept everything running smooth. On several occasions we asked Ernesto to help us plan day trips and every time he went above and beyond our expectations. Raul, the resort's caretaker was busy from dawn 'till dusk, but always made time for a smile or to answer any questions we had. He always seemed glad to see us. Calvin and Ramiro work tirelessly to make sure that the buildings and grounds keep their immaculate appearance. Our cabana always looked like a model home when we returned in the evening thanks to Duny and Stephanie. And of course, since we missed our pets during our stay, Mara the resident dog volunteered to be our surrogate pet for the duration of our stay.
