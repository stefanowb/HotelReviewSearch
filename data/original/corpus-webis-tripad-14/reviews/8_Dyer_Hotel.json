We had knowingly booked the smallest (and cheapest) room, and it was very compact, but well designed. More importantly, everything about the room and the Inn was stylish and of good quality - beautiful bedding, towels, glossy magazines, and lovely touches like chilled water always available, cookies, and lemonade by the pool. Breakfast was generous and varied - bagels, croissants, delicious scones, smoked salmon, ham, cheese etc. Best of all was the amazing kindness and hospitality of the owners Frank and Tim. Not only did they insist on picking us up and returning us to the ferry in their car, but when the Inn's (free) bikes were too big for me, Frank drove me to the bike rental shop and insisted on paying for my hire of a girl's bike. He also gave helpful restaurant recommendations and made bookings for us. We had an amazing time, and loved Provincetown. We were concerned that as a straight couple, it might be too camp for us, but it's a really beautiful, classy town, with lots of good restaurants and galleries, and the fun of camp nights out if you want them.
