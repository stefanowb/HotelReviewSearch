While updated inside, the period nature has been preserved. The suites are large and have views of the gardens. As other reviews have noted, this is not a chain hotel - these rooms have a more personal feel, period style fireplaces, furniture and architecture. The gardens are extensive and a quiet evening glass of bubbles at the outside table is a real joy. The staff were excellent , and nothing was too much trouble. The Chateau is only a few minutes drive outside St Remy (I wouldn't suggest walking). The restaurant in the Chateau is classy and upmarket and we ate dinner there once. The food was superb with an excellent choice of wine. However, my taste leans to some of the restaurants in St Remy town which offered a more relaxed environment but with still very good food and wine. We didn't eat breakfast at the Chateau, preferring instead to stop in the town for a coffee/tea and some local pastries etc as we headed out for the day. Our stay at the Chateau was delightful, but if you are travelling in peak time the town would be very busy and parking more challenging, so it might be easier to stay at a hotel in town - particularly if you enjoy a glass of wine with your meal.", "title": "Grand Chateau with Picturesque Gardens", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "OzSooty", "date": "December 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 90197322}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the Chateau de Roussan for just over a week, as a family with two young children (6yrs and less than 2 yrs).

The view was fantastic, looking out the front of the chateau, back down the tree lined lane which leads you in. Free wifi is available in your room.

The bed and bathroom were very nice except that the sheets were somewhat stiff. Felt like they were brand new and had never been washed. Other than that, I highly recommend the chateau. The staff was excellent and very willing to provide whatever recommendations they could. Had a wonderful dinner outside on the front patio and a great conversation about wine with our waiter who is from Burgundy.
