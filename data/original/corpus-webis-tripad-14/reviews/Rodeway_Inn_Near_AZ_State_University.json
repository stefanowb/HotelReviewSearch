The owners were very friendly; the rooms were adequate, but the area is not particularly attractive. If I had not had a car, I don't know if there were any restaurants in reasonable waling distance. One advantage is that there is a light rail station right out front, which will take you NEAR the airport and also to many parts of the downtown area.

It was quiet and the government rate of $40 is excellent. How a year has changed. First no more breakfast there is a sign that says coffee from 7 - 11 am and the directions to IHOP. Room was clean and well maintained for the rate. Checked in late so straight to bed, woke up at 4am with 4 shots fired within a 100 yards of the hotel if not in the parking lot. It appeared the homeless people living in the empty lot across the street or the drunk people upstairs who appeared to be long term tennants were arguing. Add the small fulltime rv park next door which also appeared to be on the low end with trash every where who knows who was shooting.
