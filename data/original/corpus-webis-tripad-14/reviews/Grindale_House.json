Wasn't going to as was looking for a change but after a year of traumas couldn't be bothered to research somewhere else and returned to what we knew would be excellent. The only downside this time was that the couple in the room above us was as light on their feet as a herd of elephants and made a racket when they went to bed and several times in the night when I assume they paid a visit. Fortunately they checked out on New Years Day so we managed a good night's sleep before we left on the 2nd.

The location is peaceful but central, with everything one could need in the way of shops and amenities just a short walk away.
