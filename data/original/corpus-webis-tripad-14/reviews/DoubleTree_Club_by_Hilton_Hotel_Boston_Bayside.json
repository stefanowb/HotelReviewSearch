A LOT. I travel 50 weeks a year for business and have stayed at over 100 different Hilton brand hotels coast to coast. Typically Hampton Inns and Hilton Garden Inns, but I also stay at the occasional Doubletree or Hilton. I did something tonight that I've never done before, which is to check into a room at this hotel, then walk back to the front desk and tell them to check me out, I'm leaving. I am shocked (shocked!) that Hilton allows their name to be associated with this hotel, and have no idea how they have passed inspection (shame on the inspector -- Hilton needs to yank their brandage). It's not just that the entire room was outdated. The old, worn out carpet was stained. The one piece of upholstery was also stained. The wall vinyl seams were busting. Do not assume Hilton brand standard with this hotel. You'd be better off staying at the Hampton Inn Crosstown just a few miles away.
