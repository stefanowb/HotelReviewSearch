It is very impressive with terraces on the lawn, near the pool, a bar terrace, a breakfast terrace and a restaurant terrace. There were lots of people staying but we never felt overcrowded because of the spaciousness. The highlight of our 3 days stay was eating on the restaurant terrace, which is on a hillside overlooking the picturesque town of Rouffach. Service and food were both excellent and the setting unbelievable.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 19, 2005", "id": 3914601}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was my third and longest visit to this Chateau hotel. I still enjoy coming here. Some of the negative comments are true and it can be expensive if you don't book in advance and get a deal of some sort. This year I got a reasonable rate which included breakfast. This made good value, though the breakfast was still pricey but no more than an average hotel in England, everything was on the menu from cerials, strawberries to smoked salmon.", "title": "3rd Visit", "user": "Dexter48507", "date": "June 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7771420, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The atmoshere, service and suroundings", "disliked": "\u2014 price of restuarant"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "To eat in the restuarant is very expensive. 46, 64, 84 euros for the table d'hote.
