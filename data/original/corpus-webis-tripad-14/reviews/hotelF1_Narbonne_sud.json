Value for money is excellent. The hotel is located in a big commercial zone on a main road into Narbonne which takes around 10minutes by bus. The nearest bus stop is about a 5 minute walk. Formule 1s offer a great deal on an evening meal at a Courtepaille restaurant and there is one right next to this hotel.", "title": "Functional", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "TimPithers", "date": "March 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4595263}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Languedoc-Roussillon", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 5, "very good": 4, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 0.958333333333}
