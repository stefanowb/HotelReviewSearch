The staff were nice, breakfast ok but nothing special. The most funn thing however, was the room. The furniture, and decoration was like straight out of the 70s. So if you'd like to try a retro-weekend, a room here might be ok! Even the radio was from the 70s (but not the tv).", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Gnopps", "date": "February 27, 2005", "id": 3232951}], "location": {"country": "Austria", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 45, "average": 93, "very good": 115, "terrible": 27, "excellent": 53}, "aka": "Golden Tulip Wien City Hotel Vienna", "slim_ranking": 0.659400544959, "description": "NOW privately owned and operative as Hotel Das President Wien!
