I believe that the pool was supposed to close at 11pm and it was so loud right up until then with people screaming and just being generally obnoxious. On our second night we were actually woken up by a ton of noise around 1am and I thought it was people arguing in the hall but it was actually people who snuck into the pool area and decided to have a drunken party.

The lobby and entrance of the hotel are clean and in order but the rooms leave a lot to be desired. I stayed in Room 521 and awoke with more than a dozen bug bites on my calves, ankles and feet. I had inspected the bed the night I arrived and while the mattress looked very worn I didn't see much to be concerned about at the time. The next morning under closer inspection (with more daylight) I found the bed to be quite dirty with stains on the sides and corners...there was a mattress pad and cover but they were littered with pubic hair and I found several small, dead bugs on the mattress under the mattress pad. They did not appear to be bed bugs but I could not identify them, even upon closer inspection with a camera. There was a chaise lounge in the room that had stains all over it as well. I awoke in the middle of the night running a fever and feeling very sick, which is probably when I was being bitten, but didn't know it at the time. I also used the exercise room in the morning which I found to be quite dirty as well. I've stayed at many Renaissance hotels and generally find them to be very clean and nice places to stay but this hotel does not match up to the Renaissance standard.

The 'scambled eggs' sat in yellow water puddles at the bottom of the server.
