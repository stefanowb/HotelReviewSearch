Our group was four adults & one child, so we had two rooms (a double & a twin) and everything was adequate for a comfortable one night stay. The hotel is centrally located in Kanchanaburi, walking distance to restaurants and many (many!) bars - if that's your thing! We had our own car/driver from BKK, so we headed down to the riverfront to a very local floating restaurant away from the madding bar crowds. The staff at Sabai were pleasant but not fussy; breakfast was reasonable and everything worked smoothly. It's a pleasant oasis in a hot and dusty town, perfect for River Kwai sightseeing!", "title": "Perfect for overnight stay", "user": "TravelTarts", "date": "March 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 126805914}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for 2 nights in a ground floor 'Green' room.
