This hotel has everything to offer: comfortable beds, nice shower, quiet (! a real bonus given it's on a main street and we were there on a Saturday night!), safe, convenient to metro plus a helpful reception. The only minus - if you really mean to pick - is that the lift is tiny, and perhaps for those on business, the wifi was not too stable. We did not have breakfast so can't comment.

I was only staying in Paris for a two day trip and refused to pay the higher prices other hotels were charging. This hotel was perfect because of the safe neighborhood and 3 second walk to the Metro station. You can travel to all of the tourist and non-tourist areas by using the Metro, including CDG airport! I carried a large suitcase and had no problem getting it onto the trains and in the lift (elevator) at the hotel. Do not spend extra money to stay at a hotel closer to the heart of the city. It isn't worth it when you can stay at Terminus Orleans, pay a lot less and have quick access to transportation. The staff was VERY friendly, spoke excellent English and was helpful. My room was cozy, with a hot shower, surprisingly comfortable bed and a balcony. If you do get a balcony, then you may hear some pedestrian or vehicle noises from time-to-time, which wasn't a problem for me. Overall, I will gladly stay at Terminus Orleans the next time I'm in Paris.", "title": "Fantastic vallue!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Veebtrippin", "date": "October 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 181426618}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Excellent room at very fair price. Good beds and helpful staff added to the value. This is not the Ritz, and it is located just within the perimeters of what I consider the city. But, with a metro ticket, you can be where you want to be and have money left over for some good, Parisian food. Due to lack of AC, you may want to consider alternatives in August.

All I ever really want is to be somewhere clean, safe and with a little atmosphere! This ticked all the boxes!! When we arrived in Paris it was pouring with rain, the hotel was about 25 steps from the metro so perfect! Is is a very convenient trip into central paris via metro line 4 which was a great clean and safe line. The staff at the hotel are lovely and everything you need is close by! We used the stairs to the 6th floor each day to help work off the wonderfull french food but there is a very small lift if you need it. The wifi was included and it was excellent!! Wifi was important to us. We did not try breakfast, tries one morning but it was very busy for the one person putting it all together! It looked fine though! I would definitely stay here again!
