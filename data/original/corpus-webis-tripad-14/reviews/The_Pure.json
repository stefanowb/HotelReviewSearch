The location is great! It was less than a 5 minute walk and there are a few good restaurants around. The staff helped with any issues we had and if they didn't have it, they got it from their sister hotel or would tell us where we could get it. Great breakfast served in the spacious lobby. The decor is very modern and the maintenance of the place is impeccable! Loved the iPad in the reception/bar to order a cab. Great hotel and amazing staff!
