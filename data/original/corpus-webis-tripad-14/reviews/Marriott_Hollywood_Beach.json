We booked a Jr Suite through AAA and it was completely paid before we arrived for our 6 night stay.. Upon our arrival we were told by an extremely RUDE front desk employee that our Jr Suite with our ocean front balcony did not exist. She made us look at another room which had a view of the hotel back. We immediately called AAA and within seconds our Jr Suite appeared. We were told by this incompetet employee that this room is not offered to AAA members. We finally got the room we PREPAID for and it was wonderful. All the luxuries you could possibly want. Watch out for the cleaning staff! They totally forgot us one day and our room was serviced at 10:30 PM. She also seemed to ignore the coffee supply. We loved Stephanie (Concierge) she was most helpful and classy. She made up for the total ignorance and conceitedness of the Front Desk staff. At check out we got another employee who was equally as rude. We loved the pool, pool staff, waiters, waitresses. Stay away from the Front Desk and you will have a wonderful time. We have contacted AAA to thank them for their immediate help and we are in the process of filing an official complaint. Would we go back?
