Steve, the innkeeper, is a quiet, yet warm host, and his entire family, including the dogs, made us feel welcome. The inn consists of a beautiful great room downstairs and 8 guestrooms upstairs. From both floors you can experience breathtaking views of Frenchman's Bay and its many islands. Our rooms were simply and tastefully decorated, and were extremely clean. The continental breakfast was good, especially the blueberry muffins. We would also recommend Fisherman's Inn in Winter Harbor for an excellent dinner. Bluff House is a really good value, especially when you consider the beautiful coastal views. We will definitely be back.", "title": "Friendly Inn with Some of the Best Views on the East Coast", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Bandlady", "date": "July 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34576649}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you're looking for a quiet and breathtaking spot at Schoodic, this is it!
