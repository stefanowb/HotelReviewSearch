The place is clean and comfortable and it has all you need. They usually prefer to rent the apartments for longer periods of time, so you might not be able to book too much time in advance if you are planning to stay for just a couple of days.

We stayed in the ground floor studio, liked our \"kitchen\" facilities which allowed us the choice of dining in our private courtyard rather than going out. Only negative - it was hot and Americans tend to take lots of showers which require lots of towels.
