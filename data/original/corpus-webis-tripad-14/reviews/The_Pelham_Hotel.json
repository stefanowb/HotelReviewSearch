Our bags were whisked away immediately to our room, which was ready even though it was only morning. After a long trip, we were grateful for the kind staff\u2014and grateful that the metro was only steps away from the hotel. Our room was spacious, tastefully decorated, and it overlooked the streets of London. The bathroom was also quite large and well laid-out. Countertops, floors, mirrors and all surfaces actually shined. Since the hotel is not a cold, huge chain of hundreds of rooms, the gym in the basement (open 24 hours) was just the right size\u2014no competition from anxious tourists trying to compete for equipment. (Even if there had been such competition, Hyde Park is right nearby with plenty of hassle-free opportunities to run in a beautiful setting.) The main floor and landings on the stairs held comfortable chairs and couches for reading and relaxing. The laptop in the meeting room was just perfect for sending a quick hello or pictures to friends and family. Most of all, we were extremely impressed with the concierge. The next part of our trip included further travel by train and another hotel stay in the Lake District. We had questions about how to pick up the bus from the Penrith Train Station. The concierge looked up the bus company online and realized their offices were closed at that hour so instead, he found a McDonald\u2019s near the bus station in Penrith and called them. He really went out of his way to give us good information and to make us feel welcome. We did not eat in the restaurant, but breakfast certainly smelled tempting as I worked out in the gym, which was next to the kitchen. Fresh apples and cold water are always available and refreshing. Additionally, many good restaurants are within a short walking distance. Overall, I can say that I rested quite well. Other patrons of the hotel seemed respectful of one another and yes, I could hear the metro at night, but in a weary traveler\u2019s haze, it sounded like low rumbles of thunder lulling me to sleep.", "title": "Refreshing", "user": "ckennedyhola", "date": "May 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162270720}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed: May 7th-May10th", "title": "Small but well presented", "user": "PBW32", "date": "May 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162105234}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled solo", "text": "Probably the most genuinely friendly hotel in London and not just because they feel it is their job.

The location is perfect...easy walk to tons of great restaurants (try Cacciari's just around the corner..best Italian meal we had in London followed by gelato from Scoop), Starbucks and Pret also around the corner, along with ATM, dry cleaners and best of all underground stop where 3 lines cross. We used the underground for all our travel (buy an Oyster Card) and it was so great not having to get switch lines. The hotel lobby and library is lovely and the staff extremely kind and welcoming. You won't receive a plastic key card here...instead you are given a key on a leather fob which you hand over to them when you head out each day. A stellar staff...dinner suggestions were wonderful along with travel details. We were in room 408...top floor, very quiet, comfy king bed and really hot water! Yes, the bathroom is small, but it is completely updated and everything is very clean. Our son was in a different room and the AC malfunctioned...no worries, they immediately moved him to another room. We only ate breakfast once in the restaurant and it was really good. I loved staying here...only one downside...charging for WiFi is not a good idea at all. It's free in the lobby and library, but they have to provide the password. You pay for it in your room.
