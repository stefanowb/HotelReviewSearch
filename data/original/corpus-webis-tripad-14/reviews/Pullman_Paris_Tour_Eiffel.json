The rooms are in need of refreshing, the balcony's are unsettling, and ... the breakfast ! The staff were spending their time clearing tables - had to ask three times for two cups of tea, and when it came there were only flavoured teas (I know its a British thing, but they did bring what we'd call normal tea when asked). Nobody knew how to use the toaster, so nobody (except myself) bothered.
