The setting of the hotel is reasonable, but not attractive.

The building is fine , good 4* standard , the Rooms are comfortable but have antique air con systems that are unable to chill the room. If you are prepared to wait half an hour the pool bar will prepare you a stale burger for \u00a325.00 or sell you a flat glass of beer for \u00a38.00, the room rate is equivalent to two suites in the Peninsula HK , or Three suites in the Oriental Bangkok, and far more than a suite at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo , at 1100 euro/ night. This surely is a sick joke , the service is terrible, the food is poor - average at best, there is no beach access- if you want the spa to paint your fingernails they will do so for the reasonable price of euro 90!!!!!! am I going nuts or is this organisation taking the micky ??? an average room with three star spanish service levels at three times the price of the Bangkok Oriental (multiple winner of the worlds best hotel) no no no no no ...... don't waste your money , no matter how much you have , this place will get under your skin and will fall way below expectations , for far above expected cost.", "user": "Rachelbuckley1974", "date": "September 6, 2010", "id": 78455961}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Should be Amazing - But Isn't!", "text": "Hotel location is undoubtedly lovely and the rooms are also undoubtedly lovely and spotless - but that is about all there is. The staff are pleasant enough but service is nothing near 5 star and having sne back a baked potato due to te hfact is wasnt cooked through and a milkshake bacj as it wasn't cold; it really annoyed me to have to pay 6 Euro for a draft coke every time at the poolside and made us doubt the value of at least 80 Euro per head to eat dinner at either of the main restaurants, one of which is no less than 160 Euro per head for a menu I couldn't even have eaten from as it was so specialised and fussy. The poolside lunch menu is totally restricted and the highlight is a burger or a pizza, and the pizza didn't even appear written down anyhwere so we didn't know it was available till we saw everyone else ordering them - I guess everyone else was struggling with the menus too! If the highlight at lunch round the stunning pool at a luxury 5 star hotel is a pizza something is very wrong! Breakfast buffet is very continental in selection which is ok but pastry selection is pretty rubbish and the cooked food is a total disgrace - all frozen mass produced items deep fried to within an inch of their life. Really really disappointing and again after one day I was bored with the choice on offer. It was just a really bad standard.", "user": "Flychick747", "date": "September 1, 2010", "id": 77854943}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful Location, Wonderful Staff", "text": "This hotel should be amazing - but somehow it just isn't.

It's a place I would love to go back again and again - but I couldn't because I couldn't actually face seeing the breakfast buffet every morning and I just would not pay for the rubbish food.

We got 2 rooms, each large one-bedrooms with a balcony. Our rooms overlooked the bar, which wasn't too bad as it was good for people-watching and enjoying the night music. The rooms on the outer buildings would be quieter. This is a hotel that, like many hotels in Mallorca, has a lot of German tourists and caters to European tastes. If you want a \"true\" Spanish or Mallorcan experience this is not your place. Rooms: Large, huge bathrooms, tons of bath amenities, twice a day service, tons of storage space. TV: Not the best, but you're not supposed to be hanging in your room. Spa: Huge, lots of services, a variety of pools, very nice workout area. Many kids activities for younger kids. Nothing for teens. We had 2 meals at the hotel -- bar food while watching the World Cup (Spain v. Germany, kind of awkward); and pasta and sauce as room service. The food was very good. The room service prices were not jacked up as they are in the US, so our pasta was not outrageously priced. The food prices were higher, but the food quality was good and this is a St Regis. If you want cheap food there are plenty of restaurants nearby. The concierge staff was very helpful recommending places to eat, where to go to the beach, and coordinating tennis times. There's a Sheraton nearby on a golf course -- we don't golf so we didn't take advantage of that shuttle or services. We would go back to the St Regis should our travels take us to Mallorca another time.", "user": "SaskiaSarratt", "date": "July 22, 2010", "id": 71949903}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Excellent in all respects.
