The ornate architecture of the exterior of the building and the posh lobby interior were a welcoming site after a long flight. The staff was friendly but especially the waitress in the bar. The bar had a library type decor which was sophisticated and perfect for sipping port. The evening we arrived it was late but we were hungry as we hadn't had dinner that during the traveling that evening. We kindly asked the waitress if could at least have a small cheese plate as the kitchen had already closed. She obliged with a nice selection of cheeses and some bread. We munched on this along with some recommended Port. It was a perfect way to end our first evening in Porto. The rooms are relatively spacious, beds quite comfortable, and modern clean bathrooms. A nice extensive breakfast is offerred in their restaurant, which has a good view on one of the main squares......a relaxing place to start of planning your day!

Our concierge gave us advice as to restaurants to visit, places to avoid and seemed always to be available to make our stay enjoyable.My last visit to Oporto was as a wine student in the summer of 1967,so not only has the city changed so much for the better,but as pensioners my wife and I are so much more able to appreciate the beautiful buildings and Fado music in the numerous bars surrounding the hotel.. Our room was on the 3rd floor facing the square, and was surprisingly quiet.We dined in the hotel on one evening,and our seafood was incredible...Full marks. Breakfast was quite good,after which we were able to catch the Hop on Hop off bus just outside the door. Our bed was one of the most comfortable ever, and the view over the square in the morning from the balcony windows was stunning.
