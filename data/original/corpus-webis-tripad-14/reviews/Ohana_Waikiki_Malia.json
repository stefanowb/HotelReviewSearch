We stayed at the Ohana Waikiki Malia, and I was so impressed, that I am doing something I never do, leaving a review. This hotel was suprisingly nice, for the price we paid. It is within walking distance to the beach, and you get free transportation on the Pink Line, with your room key. The staff was unbelievably nice, and friendly. On our last day, our flight did not leave until 9:15 p.m. The staff put our bags in a secure room, after we checked out at noon, so we could go spend our last day at the beach. They even let us use their beach towels. On top of that, they let us use a room when we got back from the beach, to get cleaned up, and change clothes. Very nice. The rooms are small, but very nice. There was even a small balcony on our room. I could her a little bit of noise, later at night, probably as the bars were letting out. We were on the 15th floor, so I would try to get a room up high, or in the rear of the hotel. Even so, we slept very well, and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel is very close to many great places to eat, and shopping. We really enjoyed our stay. The staff though, in my opinion, is what makes this hotel great.

Check in was fast and we were given a high floor with partial ocean view. Fearing the noise from the busy Kuhio street, we requested a room in the back section of the hotel facing Waikiki beach. It was quiet except for one incident of noisy guests returning to their rooms. Room was small, but clean and cozy. We slept well every night with the comfortable king-size bed.
