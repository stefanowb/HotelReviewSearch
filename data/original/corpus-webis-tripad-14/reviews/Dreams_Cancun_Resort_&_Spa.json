This is not a 5 star Hotel, not even close. Its a two star hotel at best. Two pieces of Carido equipment in the workout room and 1 of the units worked. The food was not very good. Seafood night was okay , but the rest was not tasty at all. I am always amazed at some of the reviews that people write on some of these resorts. I know you cant please everyone. But this was a plain old joke. Would never stay here or recommend this Hotel to anyone at anyprice. Bad very bad, Maid service was good beach side service was good, restaraunt service was horribble most night would get drinks half way through meal. We stayed a beaches Turks and Caicos last year although the accomodations were not 5 star quality and the service was. We made the best of our Cancun vacation but feel a little cheated about the dreams Hotel. So now when I deal with some of these travel agencies, this will be the first test. I will ask them to tell me about the Dreams cancun. And then wait for the (--) to fly.

Since we had already been sharing a king sized bed for the last 2 nights, we decided to stop wasting our time. This was by far the worst part of our experience and there were no attempts by the hotel's management to right their wrong. At least the room was very clean and the view was nice (though the ocean view on the other side of the pyramid is better).
