The staff in the hotel are so friendly and helpful and provide sun chairs to take to the beach and beach towels which was great.

I booked a room at the Palmer House South Beach disregarding \"the dude's\" recommendation of The Standard Hotel. I'd never been to Miami, and with only one night's stay planned, I wanted to immerse myself in the art deco district as much as possible. The Palmer House didn't disappoint. I only wish we could've stayed longer. The room \u2014 albeit small \u2014 was beautifully decorated and appealed to my appreciation for modern decor. I will say that the lighting system is a bit tricky at first (the light switches are buttons with graphics to indicate their function). The dude and I both work in the tech industry, and we've adapted to icon use in gadgetry. So we figured the system out on our own. Alternatively, the hotel staff is happy to show you how it works. My only real gripe with the room is the lack of a towel bar by the shower. There's a metal hook on the wall opposite the shower, but it's far too small to properly accommodate a bath towel, and you can only hang one towel on it (if there are two people in a room and two damp towels, what then?).
