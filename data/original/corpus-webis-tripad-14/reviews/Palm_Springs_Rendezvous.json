Loved it and Palm Springs i just had to add it to my trip. This time we stayed in the Shake Rattle & Roll room, most of the other rooms were taken so the decision was made for me. It was close to the road, i did think it might have some road noise but i never really noticed it. Its is a lovely big room with Elvis everywhere plus a separate shower/spa room, quite spacoius with a fire place to keep it cosy. Rendezvou feels like your staying at a friends place for the weekend, every one chats and you meet such wonderful people who have come to relax or escape the cold. The staff are outstanding, its everything the other reviews say. For me the thing i love is its nice and small and the pool and spa is only a few steps away from your room. The cocktails are always a highlight of the day, everyone gets together and its lovely to chat to the staff. It really feels like home. I will be back for sure, next October here i come.!!!
