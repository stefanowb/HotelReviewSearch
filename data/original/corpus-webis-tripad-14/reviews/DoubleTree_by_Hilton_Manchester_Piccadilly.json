She was friendly and said it would be fine. I decided to go out for dinner in the meantime and when I returned, I asked one of the employees if anything had been delivered. He said he didn't know, then disappeared for 10 minutes and said nothing has arrived. I found it strange, but figured it was just late for whatever reason.

I called the airline's bagage line but it was past their hours of operation so I wasn't able to get through. I was a little annoyed but nothing I could do. The next morning, I called early in the morning and spoke to the driver that attempted to deliver my luggage. He said the hotel employee would not accept it.

I have stayed at many Doubletree properties in the US but none in Europe. Upon checking in I was impressed by the lobby area, the hotel had quite a buzz about it being 11pm and the check in was quick and the staff were very good. I asked if room service was still open and was told no, but the staff member offered me two of the signature cookies instead of the usual one. Not the healthiest option, but it was yummy! After leaving reception, the first thing I noticed were the VERY slow elevators. It felt like ages until it finally arrived and this was repeated each time I used the lift. I had requested one of the Hilton e-upgrades to a higher category King Deluxe room and was told I had been given the upgrade. Upon reaching my room I realised that while the room was bigger, in a corner, and seemed to be \"upgraded\" the bed was not a king. Given the late hour I decided to leave it and just turn in. Although the room was a deluxe, it still seemed very small. I would hate to see the size of the smaller rooms. They must be like closets. The room also had an iMac in place of a TV. While at first glance this is a great, even cool, idea, it's not very functional. The screen was a bit small even for this small room, and the Apple TV style remote enables you to turn the TV off but does not allow you to turn the TV on in the morning, as I fouind out when forced to get out of bed to turn on BBC Breakfast. I found the bed to be extremely hard. Not like the beds you get at most Hilton propoerties including the lower category Hampton Inn. This was very disappointing. I wanted to check my email before bed and while this hotel boasts \"free wifi\" it was very slow and my room has almost no connectivity. One major thing that so many hotels get wrong is access to power ports. This room had plenty so I was able to charge all my devices during the night. My end of the hall room proved to be very quiet which despite the hard bed did allow me to get a decent, but not great, night's sleep. As it was quite warm that evening, the aircon was on and it was also very good and extremely quiet. Although I was in a deluxe room, the bathroom was also quite small. It also only had a small shower, but at least it had good water pressure. The one slightly anoying thing was the door that closes on it's own with no option to keep it open. I prefer to listen to the news in the morning while getting ready and this was not an option in this room.it was also evident that this room had seen better days. It was pretty well worn. Breakfast was included in the room rate, and it was average although the breakfast area was very loud, so I wouldn't plan on meeting clients or colleagues here. Upon checkout the staff were again efficient and friendly. When I commented on the upgrade charge and the lack of a King Bed, the staff member immediately credited it back without question. These people have been trained in customer service, so job well done to the training team. I also learned that this hotel was also only recently acquired by Doubletree which may explain why it isn't quite up to standard. It definitely has potential and with good staff that will hopefully mean I have another option in Manchester once some basic upgrades have been carried out. I will watch the internet to see what happens.", "title": "Hotel with potential", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "EP05313", "date": "August 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 136815634}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The Double Tree Hotel is centrally located and is very accessible from Manchester Piccadilly railway station.
