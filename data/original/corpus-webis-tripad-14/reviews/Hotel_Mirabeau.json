The twin room we stayed in was exceptionally spacious by European standard. Beds are large and comfortable. There's no air-con but we opened the windows for air and were not the least troubled by noise outside (we were facing the main street and it was a Friday night). We didn't plan for breakfast at first but after having a quick glance the next morning we made the correct decision of taking the breakfast at the Hotel, which although limited in choices was generous and fresh and of great quality. Ladies at Reception speak excellent English and were helpful in all aspects. Under 10 min walk with suitcases from train station.
