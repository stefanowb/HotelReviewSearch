It is a little far from most tourist attractions, but the parking is onsite and free. Eva gave us excellent recommendations for activities so we felt like we got the most from our week on the island. The B&B is a few blocks from a nice beach but walkable and she has many beach toys for your use--try the boogieboards! There are many restaurants to choose from and even a grocery store not too far away. She gave us a grand tour and we were able to help ourselves to all the things we would need. I do wish that there had a been a foot bath at the front door becuase after a day at the beach, the sand coming into the suite could not be avoided.
