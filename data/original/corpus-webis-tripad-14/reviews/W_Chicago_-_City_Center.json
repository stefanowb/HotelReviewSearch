BIG MISTAKE! We booked a room with a king bed in the 'Mega' category. We received a Starwood Gold upgrade to an 'Alternative' suite (Room 1201) which had a Queen bed. When I called the welcome desk to enquire if they had any other suites with a King, I was told that they were too busy to speak with me - and they would call me back. 10 minutes later, I was told that ALL of their suites have King beds - and that their engineering dept. must have changed the bed in our room without informing them. (Which sounded a bit like a lie - the bedroom could not accommodate a king bed). We waited another 15 minutes for an 'Ambassador' to come up to our room with keys to another suite (room 601) which had a King bed - but this 'suite' was considerably smaller. (What the W calls a suite at this location is really just two small connecting hotel rooms). It was apparent that our new room hadn't been used in a while - everything was covered in a layer of dust - including the mirror in the parlour room - which someone hand written 'Clean Me' in the dust. We decided to make the best of it and unpacked. The ice machine on the 6th floor was broken, so I had to climb the stairs in search of a working machine. I know that W thinks their dark corridors are 'cool', but when I was wandering the halls looking for an ice machine, I felt unsafe - if their was a fire, how would you be able to see at all? The next morning I was awakened to sound of guest room doors being repeatedly opened and slammed shut. After counting 10 loud door 'SLAMS' - I went out to the hall to see who was doing this - SURPRISE! it was housekeeping! I asked her to to be more courteous - as some people are still sleeping - and she just stared at me - no apology. We decided that we would be happier if we moved to the W Lakeshore - and called downstairs to ask if they could make the arrangements. I was again told that they were too busy to speak with me - and they would call me back. When they did call back - I was told that our rate would not be honoured at the W Lakeshore, nor would we receive an upgrade there. If we wanted a suite at the W Lakeshore it was 750.00 per night. At that point we decided that we were moving to the Sofitel and checked out. Our bill was wrong - double charged for Internet and not billed for parking. They even tried to charge us an 'early check out fee' which they graciously waived.

The highlight for me was the bed...comfortable doesn't even begin to describe! The staff were attentive and very friendly.

I must admit that I love Starwood and the promotions they have. However, this time due to a lack in time I booked last minute and got a rate of 255$ per night, but got the fourth night free. When arriving at the hotel I was very impressed by the lobby. The hotel is very dark, which feels like a nightclub even during the morning. Its focused towards young and hip people as well as businessmen, due to its location in the finance district. But, it is very far from everything else, including shopping on Magniicient Mile. We got two rooms for four adults and a child. The rooms were so tiny you couldnt fit anything and we requested for two double beds. It took us a long negotiation to rearrange accomodation and we got a \"superior\" room instead which is much nicer and is also very trendy. I loved the room, the bed is sooo confortable. However the W lacked some basic luxury service such as cleaning of dorrway ( some people left food for a whole day wuthout it being cleaned). furthermore there was no pool which is annoying when you have kids.
