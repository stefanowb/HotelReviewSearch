It could also use some updating. Our safe didn't work the entire trip and had numerous maintenance people in to try and fix it. Bathroom door didn't shut properly either. Now we didn't complain at all because we took the attitude well it's Mexico and really we were only in the room to sleep. Daughter, Son in Law and babies' room was one floor up and they had a beautiful room. Now here is where it gets bad. My Mom & Dad had paid for an oceanfront room with the \"M\" experience and were given the wrong room on the first day. When my Mom went down and complained they said her room wouldn't be ready until 3 pm the next day. At 3 pm the next day she still wasn't in her room and had to go and demand that she be put in her room imediately that really she was losing money that she had paid out. Finally by 5 pm they were in the proper room. She got compensated with 2 free 1 hour massages (which they loved) and Champagne.

My daughter and her friend danced to the band in the Lobby Bar each nite, the 5 yr old twins had a heyday in the pool and getting icecream at the Grille. My mother had a nice double room, the teenage girls had a double, the family from California had a \"family room\" with bunk beds and we had a king size room. We would not trade our \"spring break\" for anything. The people working at The Melia are as nice as can be and they only aim to please. They deserve your tips and appreciation! The food was great...grilled fish, shrimp fajitas, and of course many Mexican specialties. Also, I'd like to say that we are seasoned travelers. This wasn't our first rodeo!

But, let me tell you, the Devil was not nearly that black! Indeed, it is not a 5 star hotel by American/Canadian standards. 3.5 stars is more like it. Melia is a good hotel for families. The Kids Club is a good option to park the kids for part of the day. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The rooms are all right. They do have a slight musty smell, but it is inevitable given the exterior humidity. The food is plenty, but the selection is not very wide. The fish and the chicken were always very tasty. Pizza, hamburgers and hot-dogs were avaliable for lunch to please the kids. The beach is small, and the ocean water tends to be rough. Beware of the strong undertow. Although the pool is not heated, the water temperature is very enjoyable, especially on the very sunny days. The variety of the drinks served in the bars althroughout the hotel premises is rather limited (beer, margaritas, pinacoladas, tequilla). There is very little alcohol in the cocktails, which in hindsight is a good thing, as one can sip drinks all day long without getting drunk (and abnoxious). Should one need more buzz in the drinks, one should tip the waiter that makes the rounds in the pool area ($1/day). Tipping is a great way to get things done for you. We spent in total about $60 in tips, but it was well worth it ($2 for the bell boy when ariving and departing, $1/day to the maid, $1/day to the pool waiter, $2 for each meal in the a la carte restaurants, $1 for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and $5 for the girl in charge at the Kids Club). Remember that the staff is Mexican, and they are rather poorly paid. A bonus was that we were never approached by time-share sales people (I can't even tell if ther were any in the hotel).

I'd have to say they do keep you active with your stay down there with a wide varitey.

The Pool and the shopping would have to be my favourite thats mostly what i did the whole vacation. All the Cruise ships that came into the marina were hugh and waking up to seeing those was awesome. If Your in Puerto Vallarta You Have to Absolouty have to take a excersion. We went on one to Los Calletas Island and you get to whale watch. If you go at the right time you can see humpback whales and dolphins. on the boat to the island we seen a mama humpback, Baby and an escort. As well with a couple of turtles. From the Beachline Boardwalk, My mom and i on a day of shopping saw dolphins jumping out of the water. That was awesome considering my favourite animal is a Dolphin.

We listened to the speech for 90 minutes and then we were done and noone from the Melia even brought up timeshares again.

Thanks to one cab driver who told us you can deflect these salespeople by telling them you are a pilot for any airline...it automatically disqualifies you for a timeshare.
