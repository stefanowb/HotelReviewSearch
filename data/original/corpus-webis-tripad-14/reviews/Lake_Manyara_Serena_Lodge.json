Serena hotels are the best places to stay when doing a safari (except for the ultra-exlusive tented lodges), however the prices they charge (around 650$/night in high season) isnt worth the money. The good things are the view from every corner of the hotel even from your terrace and the swimming pool that is looking directly into lake manyara! The food is buffet style and is good, the rooms are clean but very basic.", "title": "Best view, 4 star hotel at Palace Prices", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Samuel-D", "date": "September 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5762697, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The view"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A beautiful place", "text": "An absolutely beautiful place!
