The room was beautiful - great bed, fantastic view and plenty of space. While we didn't have any treatments in the Spa it seemed well appointed with a good pool and lounge areas. We had dinner in the Ailsa lounge which was more relaxed than the fine dining restaurant but very good. Breakfast was great and lunch in the club house lounge was very well done. If I had to point out any niggles that might bother some fusspots some of the paintwork in our room and along the corridors was a bit scuffed/grubby but the overall experience was so good and staff so helpful and friendly this didn't matter one bit.
