The staff are very friendly and helpful, and you get a sense of \"home\" there because of the accommodating staff, cozy front lounge with fireplace, small \"inn\" atmosphere and the amenities you get for the price you pay, which is well worth it. First, the hotel is fitting of the historical area it is in, as it is decked out in antique/traditional furniture. The front lounge serves tea and delicious fresh-baked cookies in the early evening and you can enjoy these sitting in a comfy sofa in front of a crackling fireplace. I saw that there was a computer with printer, board games and tables and chairs for relaxing or meeting up with friends or colleagues before hitting the town or going up to bed. The rooms were not huge, but the beds were very comfortable (not too soft or too firm, a good \"medium\"), and the bathroom was spotlessly clean. We had a room with 2 double beds, which we paid more for, but your only choices were 1 queen or 1 king in a room if traveling with friends. There were only \"wired-in\" Internet in the rooms, and wireless in the lobby which didn't work. The only fault I can find was that the Internet was REAL slow in the rooms, but as we weren't there in the rooms so long, it was enough for checking e-mail and Facebooking. Breakfast was EXCELLENT and was included in the rate, and if they have a special, they throw in hot breakfast in the buffet. They had DIY waffles with syrup (both regular and sugar-free syrups!), scrambled eggs, tasty sausages, toast, danish, cereals, jams, butter, juices, fruit and yogurt. The staff at breakfast were very thoughtful and since we came in late for breakfast (ends at 10:30, and we walked in at 10:15!), they asked if we wanted more sausages since they were out of it. We didn't feel rushed at all and so we left a nice tip for the lady there. Also, one of the ladies at the front who works nights ordered my sister a cab at 3:30am and said that they make sure that the cab is a regular and that they feel comfortable using this person for women traveling solo.
