It's a great little property, a nice change from a larger chain hotel. It's got character, and is centrally located for the most part. Be sure to check out some of the great nearby restaurants on Flinders Lane- Coda and Cumulus come to mind. It's very close to some of the city's best green spaces-parks and gardens. If you're traveling in good weather, you're sure to take advantage of it. The staff was very friendly, but seemingly not that knowledgeable on the city, overall, which tends to be the norm in Melbourne. The rooms were spacious, and the bed is VERY comfy.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LATraveler90046", "date": "August 26, 2010", "id": 76899272}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "They don't have a gym, unfortunately, but there's a Virgin gym nearby.

It is different from all the 'big' hotel chains and that's what made our stay so special here. The service was outstanding the whole visit through. Ben gave us an excellent place to have a delicious breakfast, in one of the little laneways near Flinders Station. All the staff were friendly and answered all our questions happily. The location was perfect, walking distance to many major city attractions and the free City Tram departs out the front to take you on a tour around the lovely city. I advise getting a Queen Deluxe Superior Room on the upper levels, as these are the ones with a gorgeous view of Melbourne. The other rooms seem to have no view at all (only of a carpark). It was so nice to wake up to the sight of a tram whizzing by on the streets below. The fireplace and snooker table located on the ground floor, added warmth to the hotel and the extra comfy longes with beautiful cushions were a welcome treat after a day of walking around the city streets. The bed was soft and comfortable and the bathroom had such lovely big mirrors. The wooden floorboards throughout the building add a rustic feel and charm to the hotel. The entrance door is really something else! Room service meals were scrumptious too. Don't bother coming if you want a gym, swimmming pool and all that jazz. This is more of a hotel to relax and chill out and use as a base for exploring Melbourne city. Highly recommended for a winter getaway, personal and friendly service and a cosy place to stay.
