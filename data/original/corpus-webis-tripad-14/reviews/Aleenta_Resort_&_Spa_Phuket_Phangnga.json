We managed to get an excellent last minute rate for a one bed pool residence (we decided to move to the Aleenta from the JW Marriott in Khao Lak, which we didn't like. We were upgraded to a huge 2 bed residence on arrival. It was the largest hotel space we've ever stayed in - more like an apparent than a hotel room. Very modern, stylish and rather spectacular. The beach was wonderfully empty, huge and unspoiled. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The food was very good (we ate at the main restaurant and by the beach during our stay) and the spa treatments were the best we've ever had. All in all - a very low key, elegant place away from the crowds. Not much to do in the area (or at least if there is, it's hard to find out about it) and it would be nice if there was a shared pool to provide a focal point, but all in all an excellent place to stay if you like boutique style hotels. From a family point of view, we found it to be child friendly rather than being a family focused hotel (it's more of a couples destination) - but we felt very welcome and relaxed there.
