The room was huge (very unusual in Rome) clean and contained a fridge,Tv Lcd Sat. There's free wireless. Also unusual was the availability of an elevator.The area was quiet at night and is mainly residential, which made it safe. To be in easy walking distance to the Closseum is fantastic. The breakfast in very good and it's served in your room, fantastic thing!!. Close to restaurants (I recommend RomAntica accross the road, wonderful restaurant where you get 10% discount), and coin-op laundry.Great Staff !!.Overall, there was nothing to complain about and I would definitely stay there again.

One of the apartments is used as a bed and breakfast service called B&B Trinity. The owners dont stay there but they speak English well and provide you with all the help you may need over phone.The best feature of this B&B is that the rooms are spacious. Our kids had a field's day inside. The room and the bathroom are sufficiently clean. The air-conditioner works efficiently. But the breakfast which comes with the room is just about sufficient for small eaters. It's very well-connected by metro( only two stops from Termini). The only downside of what could be a smooth stay is that the manageress in charge of B&B Trinity doesnt speak English at all.However that doesnt come in the way of her services. In fact we found her to be efficient. B& B Trinity is value for money.", "title": "Luxury of space", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mi2n", "date": "June 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 32240263}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Only a 10 minute walk from the colosseum, 2 minutes from nearest Metro.
