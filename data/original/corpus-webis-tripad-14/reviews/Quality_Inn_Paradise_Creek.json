My husband loved the indoor hot tub. My son was disappointed that the pool was outside and therefore not open. The breakfast bar had a great selection including biscuits and gravy, hard boiled eggs, fresh pastries and cereal. The first day we went to breakfast a bit late so the sausage gravy had been strained by previous guests so there wasn't much sausage in it. Being a bit earlier the next day proved that the gravy could be better. A previous guest mentioned cookies at night, but I didn't hear anything about that while we were there. The room was clean and spacious. I would stay here again... though I would also consider the Holiday Inn Express since it has an in-door pool.", "title": "Worked well for us", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "OregonResident", "date": "March 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3305347}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008", "text": "Stayed for a few nights in April, 2008.
