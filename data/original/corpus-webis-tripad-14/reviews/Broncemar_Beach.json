Apartments were nice enough. Basic and well cleaned throughout the week. We went b&b and were made to feel quite uncomfortable by staff especially the main woman on reception who was very ignorant and the twitchy man in the dining room who ran over the minute you walked in to check you were entitled to be in there. Most guests were all inclusive and wore the obligatory wristbands so you felt out of place not having one. You could upgrade once there at a cost of 28euros pp pn which for my family of four would have been extortionate. 112euros per day. I dont think so. Drinks expensive from on site bars. 4euro a beer 3euro soft drink. Pool area very nice and thomas cook team were fantastic with my boys. Especially Luke and Carrie. Breakfasts were nice with plenty of choice. Did not see a single cockroach on the complex the whole time we were there. The resort itself was very quiet and very expensive. 50-60euros a night to eat out just one cousre with a beer and three soft drinks. Dont bother with the supermarket at atlantico as the hiperdinos near apartments are pretty much the same prices. Gambrinus restaurant attatched to the hotel is decent and you get 15%discount if you ask for card at reception. Patrick who works there is fantastic with kids. Also fado rock steak house is out of this world for food. This was our first and last time on fuertaventura as lanzarote and tenerife are much better value for money.
