The huge luxurious reception promises much and, indeed, with very little changes to their operation, this could be an outstanding resort. However, their attention to detail is sadly lacking. We had so many little niggles with them, none of which they managed to sort out despite numerous requests. This place is just so frustrating. It has been designed totally for effect with very little practical consideration. The reception building is huge but there is almost nothing in it. There are no shops or concessions just open space. The rooms are the most bizarre design. On entering the room, you are faced with a washbasin looking down into the bedroom, so very little privacy while washing. Why?. The shower room and toilet are in a separate room, why not the washbasin?. We were in the garden rooms, which sound good until you realise that you are loaded into a golf cart and driven down the far side of the hill, out of the resort, across the road, into another separate resort. You are told that you can get back to the main hotel by phoning for the cart to come and collect you whenever you want. That would have been fine had the telephone worked. So we were faced with a 10 minute trudge back up the very steep hill. The rooms are quite spartan with quarry tiled floors and no rugs, so they feel quite bare. Just as well for one night after a torrential downpour, we returned from dinner to find our room flooded with water pouring down the steps into the bedroom. Rainwater had driven under the door. Talking with the staff who had to come and clear up the mess at 11:00 pm, this obviously happens frequently!. Why don't they just put more effective seals under the doors? The room safe had been left locked by the previous occupants, so we couldn't open it. Neither could they for 2 days. When I insisted that our valuables be put into their safe, the girl stuffed them into a cash box in her desk draw. The air conditioning only worked either flat out, so the room was like a fridge, or not at all which was unbearable. 3 requests but never rectified. Our bathroom supply of toilet paper dwindled away and was never replenished. 2 requests for more, nothing ( we carry an emergency supply). My wife booked an Ayur Vedic massage at the spa, which was way down by the main entrance. When she went to sign for it, she was told that our package included 2 free sessions. That was the first we had heard of it. Indeed, I went back for a session to be told the same. When were the hotel going to tell us. What else could we have had? The garden rooms are close to the private beach so that is some compensation but the sefood restaurant there is also a very strange design. Consisting of 4 cylindrical huts connected by walkways there is no cohesive atmosphere at all, even though the Chinese influenced seafood is quite good. From here, you have no feel that you are staying at the same place as the big building at the top of the hill. The whole place reminded me of the 1960's programme \"The Prisoner\" with the buggies moving about and the small villas. As though you were never quite sure what was really happening. A real shame because with very little change, this place could warrant the 5* stars it boasts.", "title": "Cliftop fablous Resort overlooking the sea..from Gods Own Country", "user": "vintafe", "date": "May 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 106314781}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Got upgraded to the club rooms so cant really comment on the other rooms.
