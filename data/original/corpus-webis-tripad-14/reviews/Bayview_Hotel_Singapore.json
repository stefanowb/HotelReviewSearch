When we first arrived, I saw the hotel lobby had 80s renovation and was quite small. However, the room was renovated and the toilet was very clean. It looked like I would enjoy my room, but however it was really a mixed bag. First off, the air conditioning was too cold and I often woke up in the middle of the night because I was freezing. I turned off the air conditioning for one night and it was better, but just by sitting in the room without air conditioning proved to be too hot. Another problem with the room is the room is not sound-proof. What I mean is I can hear any noise from neighboring rooms as well as rooms on the next floor. This woke me up twice during my stay at the hotel. It was hard for me to fall asleep again given the beds are not that comfortable. The hotel breakfast was really not that superb. There is little choice in terms of food served and the food was the same every day. However one good thing is the location of the hotel, as there is a local Singaporean canteen a minute's walk from the hotel. The food there, unlike the hotel, has many choices and the food is cheap compared to other restaurants in Singapore. The hotel is also a minute's walk away from the nearest MRT station, which proved very convenient for me as I liked to travel on the MRT to other parts of Singapore. Overall this hotel is great for budget travellers; but for travellers looking for slightly more, stay away!!!", "title": "Great location, bad nights sleep", "user": "tibetanrangertwo", "date": "December 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 88720582}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled solo", "text": "I can't speak more highly of this hotel, its good location, facilities and most helpful staff.", "title": "Good value, service and location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BlackCat2119", "date": "December 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 88715214}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Its location was the main reason for my choice.
