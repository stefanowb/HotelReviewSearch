I would definitely stay here again. I stayed with my husband and a group of friends. It was a short walk to the main area of town.

The only (very small) complaint that I have is that our shower area was open to the outside (which was lovely), but if you don't keep the door closed from the bathroom to the bedroom, a few bugs will come to visit you!
