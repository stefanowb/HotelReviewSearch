I realized quicly that I should not ask too many questions and just enjoy my stay. The hotel had a computer with internet access for free in the lobby. And interet access was free also. It was a good price and if you go to London I would recommend this hotel. I would probably stay there again. The staff needs work with their attitudes.

The Grand was just a few blocks from Embankment tube station and was quite easy for us to locate, despite the fact we hardly slept on our red-eye flight from Toronto. Check-in was quick and our room was ready upon our arrival at 12:30pm. As other reviewers have mentioned, the room key is required to access the elevator and was a little finicky each time we went upstairs to our room on the third floor. The room was very clean and a good size for London, with a queen size bed, wardrobe, desk, two chairs and a flat screen television. I think all Hotwire travelers seem to get the same room at the Grand, because our room looked exactly the same as previous Hotwire reviewers\u2019 photos and had absolutely no view from the window.

Have stayed at Club Quarters Trafalgar Square for 30+ nights in past six months and anytime I've made a request regards anything, the staff from housekeeping to front desk have been quick to help and make any arrangements. This includes a room fridge and stepping machine being bought ot my room within five minutes. When my AC was on the blink, got it fixed asap. What amazed me this past stay, is the courtesy of all front desk staff. They make checking in a breeze and hassle free and truly seem to love their job as they smile and appear genuinely interested. Highlights for me are always the cleanliness of the entire building and rooms. The bathrooms are relatively small, but shower has superb water pressure. Flat screen tv's can be angled for viewing from bed or chair seating. Room includes coffee/tea facilities. Complimentary umbrella in room. All nine hotel floors have bottled spring water available near elevator for guests along with a 'supply' closet that is a nice touch. I have used the same-day laundry service and excellent value for the convenience. Having previously stayed at the five-star Sofitel nearby in Waterloo Place, this quality hotel is a gem and truly exceptional value at WELL under half the price and you get more included. One comparison, at other hotels, rare to get complimetary internet access and Club Quaters have several options for that. Obviously, perhaps the best 'selling point' is the location as it truly can't be beat as on the doorstep of everything that is anything London. Can get to the hotel in 45 minutes from Heathrow via Heathrow Express to Paddington then Bakerloo Line to Embankment and a short 5 minute walk up Northumberland Avenue.
