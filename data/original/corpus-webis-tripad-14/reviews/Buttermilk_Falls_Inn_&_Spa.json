We overheard many inappropriate and disgusting comments made by staff members whom either didn't realize, or didn't care that guests were present. The food was ok. Our bed was extremely uncomfortable and you could hear other guests easily through the walls, doors and floors. Our gas fireplace although initially enticing almost sweated us out of the room to the point where we couldn't use it at all. The spa was nice enough although there is only one bathroom, one shower, and no space in the locker room. Our massages were very good. The pool was too cold and the sauna not hot enough.

Most recently, my fiance booked a weekend stay at the Inn for my birthday and when he told me (after he booked Rook's Nest), I was slightly bummed because I had received a coupon for 35% off by email the day before he made reservations. I told him to call back and see if the Inn would let us use the coupon and he was very skeptical (especially since the coupon specifically stated that the coupon was for \"new\" reservations only) and was amazed when they cheerily said \"no problem\" and applied the coupon. Who does that??! I recommend the hot stone facial (my favorite) at the spa. Guests at the Inn can use the pool, sauna, and steam room for free. Our room was cozy, clean, and well-stocked with organic sodas, granola bars, and treats. The shower in the bathroom was awesome (under an enormous skylight)! The staff were uniformly helpful and the breakfasts were fantastic. A wide range of items (oatmeal, toast, bagels, lox and cream cheese, cereals, granola bars, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, two hot dishes (pancakes and bacon, frittata and sausage, etc.), coffees and teas, juices, etc. are available at breakfast and there's plenty of food.
