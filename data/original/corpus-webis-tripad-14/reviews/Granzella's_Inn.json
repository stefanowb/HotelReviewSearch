It was late in the evening, so we took the blanket down to the front desk, where the clerk said, \"That's disgusting\" and handed us new bedding. Apparently, the hunters, with dogs, who stay in the hotel sometimes clean ducks on the beds! But why wouldn't the maid have noticed when she was (supposedly) putting on clean bedding for the next guest's stay? The hotel has only one clerk at night, and she did not offer to help change the bed or offer to move my friends to a different room.
