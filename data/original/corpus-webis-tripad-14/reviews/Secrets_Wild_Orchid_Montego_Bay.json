My husband and I just returned last night from a 4 night stay at Wild Orchid and had a BLAST!!!! As if the resort wasn't beautiful enough, the people were even better!

We had an early checkin (10 AM) and upon entering the Preferred Club, we were greated with cool towels, a drink and delicious snacks. Our room was ready upon arrival (I couldn't believe it!) and within 30 minutes of settling and changing, my husband and I were poolside under the gorgeous sun!!", "title": "Secrets Wild Orchid...YEAH MON!!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CurlyDee", "date": "June 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 66315112}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "I enjoyed the preferred club and would spend the extra fees when I return.

If I could do it over again, I would have gone somewhere else. While it was a nice vacation, I prefer \"amazing\" vacations. I work really hard and while I love to travel, I only get a couple of weeks away per year. I don't want to settle for nice. I wish I had gone to Secrets in Mexico to get a sense as to what Secrets Resorts are all about. I read every review and followed this resort on Facebook for weeks before our vacation, so I know how important these reviews are to those that are planning their vacations. These are my honest thoughts about this property: The staff tried VERY hard. Most provided excellent service: Terese our room attendant was great. Carl our lifeguard and pool attendant was AMAZING!! He took care of us everyday and went above and beyond to make our vacation special. The restaurants were fine and we like them in this order: (Best to worse): French, Italian, Jamaican and then Japansese. The server in the Japanese was great, but the food was awful. French--server was awful, but food was good. And therein lies the problem overall: consistency. Lunch buffet was great, but sit down restaurants were terrible (both service and food). Breakfast was great. Claudette is the best omelet maker ever. Loved her spirit, passion and dedication. Grounds need work . We love tropical and lush and it's just too new for that. Room was nicely appointed, but we lost power one night. No olives for the martinis, no lemons and limes for the drinks. Beach was nice, but it's man-made. Don't expect big palm trees and pathways lined with tropical plants. Bands at night were good. We enjoyed the piano bar and the outdoor entertainment. While we were there, there was a large conference held on property for the tourism board. The hotel staff just couldn't handle it. It was too early to do something like that at a hotel where it was a stretch to care for the guests they had. I had two spa treatments: a water lily wrap and a mini-facial. Both her awful. Rushed and not relaxing at all. Spa seemed medicinal, not welcoming and relaxing. Fitness Center is not air conditioned. So needless to say, it's disgustingly hot in there.", "title": "All inclusive, and it was!
