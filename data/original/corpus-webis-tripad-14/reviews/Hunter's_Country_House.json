There are 2 great restaurants on site so you can enjoy a drink or two with dinner and then wander back to the most comfortable bed in your life. The fire was lit in our room when we got back, and it was definatly worth the little extra money to have a slightly larger room with a fireplace. Especially in the cooler months. There are lots of places to explore both inside the main building and in the gardens. It's very romantic, very private and very beautiful. I wandered across to Tsala as that was the other option for accomadation and was very happy we made the decsion to stay at Hunters. The staff were extremely helpful and accomadating.

The staff were very attentive and there were lots of special touches, complimentary champagne for our honeymoon, personalised welcome, personalised menus for our evening meal. We were fortunate to have a beautiful and gormet meal in their private dining room next to a roaring fire, very romantic. The food was fabulous, comparible with top restaurants in the UK but at a third of the price.

Really comfy bed and a nice big bathroom. The meals at both the main restaurant and Zinzi were excellent and all the staff are genuinely attentive to all your needs. It was still off season when we stayed in early September so the hotel was rather quiet in the evening. Even with a drink or two in the lounge after your meal, 10.30pm is about as late as it gets here, so it\u2019s back to your cottage where if it\u2019s cold in the evening the staff will have lit the log fire in your room for your return and put hot water bottles in the bed at turn down service. Breakfast was a real treat each morning with plenty of cold food to start off with with before they cook your breakfast to order.
