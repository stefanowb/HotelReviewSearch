As I am a very experienced traveller who has stayed at countryside Hotels and Inns around the world, this is one of the more magnificent places that I have stayed at. The rooms are more than basic with flat TVs and good size. Our room's windows overlooked the beautiful Tuscany landscape. The owner has plants around the hotel that are looked after with perfection. The house bottled wine is extremely reasonable and light. I can go on and on. If you want to relax after driving and navigating those roads in Italy and also been mobbed in museums, galleries, and big cities, this is the place to drive to and stay a few nights and use it as a base to explore the rest of Tuscany.", "title": "Hidden Gem, one of the best countryside escapes in all of Italy", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "calmkey", "date": "October 19, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5970935, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Spectacular views and quietness"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We had a wonderful 6-day stay at Il Rosolaccio which is one of those lovely old farmhouses perched high above the road that has been lovingly restored with very modern amenities while retaining old, rustic charm. It's in a great location between San Gimignano and Certaldo, both interesting towns. Ingka and Ingrid are the perfect hosts at this truly wonderful place. Though the temperature was in the 90's during our stay, our corner room with cross-ventilation from the windows was delightful with a spectular view of the Tuscan countryside.
