It has a very at home feel to it. We were put off by the expensive rates on the actual island and wanted to stay further out. The staff were fantastic, they were really helpful with directions and provided us with great service. The owner even dropped us off at the local station to get the airport bus when we realised we'd miscalculated the time and had missed the bus.

Accomodation on venice island is very very expensive during peak season;- \u00a390 to \u00a3150 per night, so i opted to stay off the island but close enough to a short transport link to the island. I booked this hotel 2 months before i travelled & paid just \u00a324 a night for 4 nights. You probably won't find a cheaper hotel in or around venice. However the villa adele is not ''cheap''. I read the reviews before i booked & most were spot-on. The villa adele is very clean with excellent air-conditioning, the staff very helpful & a transport link to the island just around the corner. The breakfast on offer was cereal, juice, croiccants & yoghurt. The number 6 bus takes you over the motorway crossing to venice isle in 15 minutes. However if i must gripe it would be that the breakfast room is very small. Barely larger than an extended kitchen. Also the mini-bar is empty & you must ask reception if you require water, beer, juice etc.. These were hardly 'problems' as such but the concept of these reviews is to point out your likes & dislikes. This hotel comes recommended to those, like me, on a mid/moderate budget & to all who object to paying \u00a3100+ per night on the island.
