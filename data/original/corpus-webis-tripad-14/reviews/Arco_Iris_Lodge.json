We saw all types of monkeys, bugs, birds, a tarantula, bird nests with babies and even yes!!! the Resplendent Quetzal!!! yes! The guide was well educated and he was great with daughter along.

We really can't say enough great things about the place. We stayed in the Honeymoon suite which is the lodge situated on top of the hill. First our lodge was amazing. It was 3 floors, 1st floor was the kitchen which had everything you needed to eat in. The 2nd floor was the bathroom and whirlpool in which you could sit and watch the sideways rain. Also on that floor was the deck where my wife and I ate our breakfast in perfect view of what we called our morning rainbow. They make grow their own food, their breakfast is amazing and on occasion while eating breakfast you will be greeted by some Capuchin monkeys outside the window. The staff is so helpful. We had an issue with our schedule with interbus and after several calls by them totally took care of it last minute.

The shower was great and there was plenty of hot water. We walked 5 minutes into downtown Santa Elena for dinner and breakfast. One morning, we paid $7 per person for breakfast, but agree with other reviewers that the price is too high. In the reception area there is a binder with all of the menus from the local restaurants.
