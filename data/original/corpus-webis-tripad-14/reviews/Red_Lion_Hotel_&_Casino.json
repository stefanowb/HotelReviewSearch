They are clean enough, but the seats are a bit cramped and the overhead bins are pretty small. Our flight was only about 2/3 full, so my friend and I were the only two on our three seat row which made the 2 1/2 hour flight a little more bearable. The food and beverage service was limited, but about the same as coach service on any standard airline. On the return flight, the airport in Elko was shut down by fog and after several hours spent waiting at the hotel/casino, we were finally bussed out on a 2 1/2 hour ride to Twin Falls, Idaho where we waited another couple of hours for a plane to be sent to pick us up and bring us home. Although the 10 hour delay getting home caused some inconveniences, our group was given a complimentary lunch at the hotel restaurant while we waited for the bus to take us to Idaho and drinks were comped on the flight home. Given that the weather delays were beyond their control, I feel the airline handled it as best they reasonably could.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 29, 2004", "id": 2329905}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "great place to go", "text": "I live in elko the first thing you notice on the eastern elko city limits is the great big red lion inn & casino sign it glows day and night. Red lion is easy to access just folow elko tell you see a exit called ELKO EAST. The red lion is near some great food places,and some stores like albertsons. pizza barn is a good place to buy pizza from elko. gold country inn is a great place to eat to. they also have a big casino with lots of service. if the place got robbed the person would get caught real fast. the rooms are very well secure. If you wana see some statues of horses just drive through the main gate. When you exit notice how many gas stations there are. actualy the person whome owns red lion put a gas station near the inn. the aprox. 1/4 mile long building and 3 stories is a great place they got a swimming pool aswell. some balconies so you can go out and get some fresh air in your room on the 3rd floor.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 22, 2004", "id": 2107314}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Escape", "text": "I just recently returned from a 4 day trip to Elko NV with a group from our home town of Woodward OK.

The rate was good ($65/night weekend) and the rooms were average or slightly above. The rooms included a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, and balcony (!).The casino was quite unkind to me, though its quality was decent enough. Not a whole lot of brand new machines, though the money train penny machines (linked to progressive jackpots which are randomly awarded) were fun. The blackjack tables were always available. Disappointing, though, was the fact that the poker room and often the roulette wheel were not open during the day. Also, the craps table was seemingly open at all times, though almost no one played. Since craps is my favorite game, that was very disappointing, as your money goes awfully quick when you're the only one at the table. They also have a very adequate sports book, with a good number of high-quality screens, and a keno lounge.The restaurant, Coffee Garden, was above-average for food quality. The buffet is a good value and the menu items are not too shabby either. The service was hit-or-miss, sometimes great, sometimes lacking.If the Ruby Mountains are factored in, the Elko area really has a lot to offer. The Lamoille Canyon road is one of the best scenic mountain roads I have ever seen. Bighorn sheep and mountain goats are not uncommon sights. Also, I recommend the Northeastern Nevada Museum highly. They have an animal display that is second to none - showing wild animals from all over the world.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "milbucksfans", "date": "December 7, 2003", "id": 1509666}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Awesome 1st Wedding Anniversary", "text": "We wanted to go somewhere special for our 1st Wedding Anniversay and we were told about Elko.

This was our second trip to Elko with Casino Express. The only major complaint I have is that they don't do seat assignments. We almost had a fist fight on the flight back because a group traveling together thought they should have had preferential treatment and had assigned seats. It didn't help that the airport had am employee who was giving out information on the flight and didn't really know what he was talking about. First he gave instructions to take the same seat you had on the incoming flight and in the next breath was telling everyone that it was open seating on the flight. He should have stated one or the other. The staff in the hotel, casino and restaurants at Red Lion were all very friendly. The rooms are nice and well kept. I do think the food is better at Gold County, which is across the street from the Red Lion. Overall, the package offered by Casino Express is a real deal and we plan to go back.
