I was there in the early summer for my honeymoon, and for that I had a perfect time. It is important to realize that the area is quite remote and desolate, and this is very much the appeal. The hotel is the major landmark, and if you are going to a hotel in the area, I think besides one exception, this is it. Our room was clean, simple and elegant with a stunning view of the Snaefellsjokull glacier (this is room *23*) but if you have made trek to the peninsula, you will spend your best time outside. There are various hiking paths that will take you out through lava flows, past burned out volcanoes and to the amazing cliffs of Hellnar, eventually to the Snaefellsnes national park. The hotel takes its scenery seriously, and is laid out for you to enjoy the view, inside and out.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "moodshift", "date": "September 14, 2008", "id": 20078877, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location location location", "disliked": "\u2014 like any hotel in Iceland, it is quite expensive (especially after factoring in dinner) but otherwise as nice as any hotel in the country, but probably much more beautiful"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008", "text": "The staff of course is friendly and very accommodating, and the restaurant serves haute cuisine.
