If you are looking for a hotel that perfectly matches the informality and friendliness of Chamonix, then L'H\u00f4tel de L'Arve is probably going to appeal to you. It is a relatively small hotel and has a small staff (the staff that serves the breakfast is the same staff that cleans the rooms). Its location is ideal - not on the main street but only a few feet down a private drive and right on the river - a 5-minute walk to the center of town. Nearby is a complex where you have a laundromat, restaurants, shops, a grocery store, and a hotel that caters to tour groups. I would recommend that you request a room that faces Mont Blanc - not only for the view but also for the riverside location - the sound of the running river and the cool breeze from the glacial stream make sleeping just more pleasant! The breakfast is good - boil your own eggs, choose from a variety of breads and croissants, juices, cereals, cheese and cold cuts plates, yoghurt - something to please everybody.

The rooms are very small, not sure I stay here as a skiing base, on the basis that I could just about fit my wash bag and change of clothes in the very small room.
