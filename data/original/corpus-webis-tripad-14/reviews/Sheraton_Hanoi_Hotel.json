Less than 10 minutes from the Old Quarter, you could either take the hotel shuttle, the ever ready taxi, or jump on the bus! Having read that Hanoi is notorious for taxi scams we tried minimizing cab rides to the bare essentials. We only took it twice back to the hotel later in the evenings. And again, only take the CP Cab or Hanoi Cab. Both our cab rides were fine. Otherwise we took the bus. The bus stop was less than 5 minutes away at 33 Au Co - turning right after the hotel driveway. I think we took buses almost 10 times. It was never crowded and we never had to wait longer than 5 minutes. The flat rate was 5000 Dong.
