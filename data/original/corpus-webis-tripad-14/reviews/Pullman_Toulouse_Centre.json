The location was convenient, very close to city center, easily accessible from the airport by taxi (20 minutes ride). The hotel offers an excellent overall quality, spacious rooms and a remarkably good restaurant on the ground floor. The room itself is as good as I've expected, spacious enough, with a king-sized bed, comes a fairly large bathroom with shower (you can choose one with a bathtub during check-in if you need one). Well equipped, with coffee maker, two bottles of mineral water/day and some juices included in the room rate, large flat-screen TV, free WiFi internet connection. The bathroom was standard for this category, to be honest I would have also expected toothbrush / toothpaste to be available, but it is not the case, although you can request these if needed. One small disappointment for me was to learn that there is no swimming pool (for this price level I would have expected that). There is a gym which is open 24 hours (I wish all hotel managers would understand that it is not OK to close the gym before I get back from the office sometimes, so big plus for the Pullman staff for this one).", "title": "Very good business hotel", "user": "peter_kovacs", "date": "April 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 158399868}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good business hotel", "text": "The restaurant is a really good one.
