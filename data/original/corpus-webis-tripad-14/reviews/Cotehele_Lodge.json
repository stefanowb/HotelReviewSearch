My first criticism lies with the title of this room, for room is all it was and not a suite as the name suggests. However, the room is nicely decorated and the ensuite bathroom is lovely with jacuzzi bath and shower over bath. Trouble was we could not get any hot water from either bath or shower. Could not use the bath at all as water was almost cold. Had to just have very bracing shower. The owner did do his best to fix it for us but to no avail. When I decided to have warming cup of tea after shower I found that the tea bags (which were just loose on a tray) looked very old and pretty sad looking so had to have coffee instead. There is no dining room so if you want breakfast it is served to the room at a charge of \u00a35.00 per head. My husband ordered breakfast, which was standard English, it came with a jug of orange juice but no tea or coffee. At the cost of \u00a35.00 he expected at least a decent cup of coffee and not just the little pack of instant provided in the room. All day breakfasts are served in a cafe just around the corner for \u00a31.99 and come with real coffee and free refils. It was a shame these things let the place down as it has the potential to be a super B&B.", "title": "Not the best B&B I have stayed at but far from worst.", "user": "Falajoy", "date": "October 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119261169}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Having said all of the above, the bed was very comfortable and there was no street noise as the room is to the back.
