The food is excellent,well prepared,fresh and very good value. Try the venison or chateaubriand for a real treat but we didn't have one criticism about the food. Also worked my way down the desserts and recommend the Marsala cream with choc soil. The service was good and we were amazed how few people appear to have found the place as it is so good.
