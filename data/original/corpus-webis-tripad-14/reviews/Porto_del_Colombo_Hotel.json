In the beginning of the 19th Century, the building was used as a French embassy and later was inhabited by the great Greek political figure, Eleftherios Venizelos, who also used it as his political offices until his move to Athens, when he took power as Prime Minister of Greece. The Hotel has 10 beautiful rooms - the 2 of which are maisonettes - fully restored and traditionally decorated to provide our guests with an especially warm and welcome feeling. All rooms have modern conveniences (WC, telephone, TV, mini-bar, air-conditioning and Central Heating in winter) ensuring our guests have a comfortable and enjoyable stay."}
