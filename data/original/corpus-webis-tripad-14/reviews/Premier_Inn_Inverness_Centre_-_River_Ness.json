Dont think you should pay more and you will get a better service elsewhere. You wont! Like all premier inns, the rooms are done to a pro-forma but this hotel just does everything better. I have stayed in a LOT of premier inns and this is the best by far. The staff just could NOT have been more helpful or friendly. The location is superb - right in the centre overlooking the river. The restaurant is really excellent - great food, attentive service. After eating there on the first night from tiredness, we chose to eat there every night, working our way through the menu! Breakfast was wow. Fresh, crisp fruit, nicely cooked food. Any down sides? The only one we found was finding the car park. It is in a one way system so we passed it a few times before working out where to turn. It is small but we always managed to park there. Will definitely stay here again.
