Gym looked nice with new machines. Quick drive to Downtown MTL as its right near the highway. Goos place to go with friends or alone but its not extremely romantic setting. Also the breakfast which I normally am in love with was a 2 on 10. Notworth it. Hardly any selection and the pancakes I ordered I had to send back. I think they were some sort of pita bread that they dipped in oil. They tasted almost oriental.
