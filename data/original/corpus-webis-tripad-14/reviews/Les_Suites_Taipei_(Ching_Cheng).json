A cell-phone is provided to all guests in their room (all calls to the room are forwarded to the phone). Daily breakfast consisted of Western (omelettes, scrambled eggs, bacon) with some Chinese items (congee, dumplings, soy milk) available as well.

The rooms are fairly large, with free in room internet access, a free cell phone for all guests, and enough room and deskspace for any business traveler. The bathroom is quite spacious and has all the amenities you want, including separate shower and tub areas. You should definitely take advantage of the breakfast package. There are two different daily breakfasts--western style and eastern style. The congee, soy bean milk, and chinese crollers are great for those who would like to try something different. And the pastries, breads, fresh fruit, coffee, and juices are very good for those with more continental tastes. Service is very professional, prompt, and always polite. If you arrive late in the evening room service is actually quite good--the wonton soup is excellent--and very cheap compared to the large hotel chains. And the laundry service is very prompt, reliable, and quite reasonable. For those who like to shop the hotel is located just down the road from a high end mall named the Breeeze Center that has everything a fashionista may want (Gucci, Armani, Marni) with a terrific gourmet supermarket and food court on the lower floors.
