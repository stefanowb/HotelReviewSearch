It was uncrowded and the pool temperatures were perfect. Our King Room on the third floor faced the hillside golf course. Our spacious room was very comfortable and immaculate. I liked the crisp sheets. Check in and check out were smooth. We know the area so we did not spend much time at the front desk. The young gentleman who checked us in was obviously new but charming as he went through a mental checklist. I purchased a local newspaper and enjoyed reading it in the welcoming lobby next to an enormous wood fire. There were large windows that highlighted the beautiful landscaping and a water feature just off the lobby. I think it is the nicest lodging in the area. I did not know they had a restaurant until this visit and I loved their view but the food and service did not measure up to the high standard set by the hotel. We found the area crowded due to holidays in Canada so all rooms in the area were going for full price. We used AAA to bring it in line with the other local lodgings. Many tourists stay on their way to and from Canada since the Black Ball car ferry is nearby. The highway leads to the Olympic National Park and the north coast.
