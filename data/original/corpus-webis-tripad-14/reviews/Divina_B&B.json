That's what you get from Divina. Location is good, in the middle of the path from Verona's train station and the Arena. Quadruple room is pretty large and comfortable. The two shared bathrooms were clean. It was my first experience with shared bathrooms, it is a little bit different from having your own one. In this case, there are just 4 rooms and 2 bathrooms, not bad. There is a kitchen and a room for the breakfast, with everything you need to prepare a pretty good one. Prices in Verona are pretty high, making Divina a good option to stay closer, even if the price does not sound \"budget\". The only down side was the TV that was not working. As we spent just one night, I have not even asked for it. I heard that another rooms was also having the same problem.
