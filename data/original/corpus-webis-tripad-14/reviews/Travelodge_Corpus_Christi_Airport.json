Unless you're a trucker or passerby that needs something fast and convenient, this hotel is horrible; it's a dump! The entry key locks do not work, so anyone from outside can enter at any time of the day or night and the hotel is not located in what seems like the safest place in town. Any carpeted area smell like someone left a wet rag in hot room and some parts hallways smelled like someone peed and nobody cleaned it up. It's hard to breath in the indoor pool area because of strong, clorine smell which carries in to the gym, lobby, and computer room that are connected to it. The rooms are a good size and the cleaning staff does an excellent job but even the best cleaning crew could not get that musty smell out of the room. There was bugs in our room all the time because of the gap in the door frame and the mosquitos are huge in South Texas! The free breakfast should be free because the food was inadequate at best. The coffee was watered down and the waffles and bagels tasted like they were left out for days. Even though it was free we didn't go back after the first day. We stayed here because we were traveling with three teenagers and needed something affordable in order to be able to enjoy Corpus. Next time I would rather cut our trip short by a few days and stay somewhere else for a higher price. I guess hotel/health inspectors have overlooked this place because surely it's not adequate for families with children. If anyone wrote a good review from it's probably because they work there and need to give the business a boost because in July 2010 when my family and I were there it was by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed at and we always stay at the most affordable hotels but this one gave affordable hotels a bad name!", "title": "DO NOT STAY HERE", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "edi_gonz", "date": "August 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 74754836}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled solo", "text": "Airport shuttle was a necessity for me.
