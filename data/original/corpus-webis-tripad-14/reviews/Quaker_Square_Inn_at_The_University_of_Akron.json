That was part of why I stayed there - I mean, how often can you get to sleep in an old grain silo? And one that is beautifully make up? Yes, my room was beautiful. And round, of course. The lobby was very interesting, with old pictures, gears and sculptures on the walls. Really, even if you don't stay, the lobby is worth a look. My bed was comfy, the room was large, the shower had great pressure, and the towels were big and thick. That being said, the tub drained just a little slow and th tub grout could have been a little cleaner. Neither of those things made me go \"eww!\", though. Breakfast was hot and good - eggs, sausage, make-your-own waffles, various breads, and of course, oatmeal. Juice, cofffee, etc, and apples and oranges. Is the place perfect. No, but what place is? Is is cheap? Not especially, but you get a unique experience for it.

The rooms were large and clean although the AC was loud and had a hard time cooling the entire space evenly. My biggest complaint was that the lovely pool area was closed. With small children in July, we counted on the entertainment of this pool. The hotel sent us to the University of Akron leisure pool - which was amazing but very inconvenient.

It was amazing to see the interior (lobby) of this hotel. I really loved the lobby decor, the interesting pictures of the Quaker Oats guy and the 'old-time ads', etc. I wouldn't give this hotel a bad rating, but I wouldn't give it a great rating either. The front desk reception guy was lackluster, unsmiling, and seemed to want to be somewhere else. The room was clean, and served it's purpose - for sleep and showering. Every room has a balcony, but since only the first 3 floors are used by hotel guests, we ended up with a balcony that was level with the tar paper roof. It was depressing to even look out the door. The ice machine on our floor was ripped out of the wall, so I had to go to the floor below to get ice, but I had to take the slow elevator because the stairwell only leads outside. That was inconvenient. We stayed two nights and on the second day, we returned to the hotel after biking the C&O canal trail, to find that our room keys were deactivated. We were in a room that was on the third floor and waaaaay down at the end of the hall. We had to go all the way back down to the front desk and deal with the lackluster reception guy. He didn't offer an apology for the inconvenience. They offer a free continental breakfast which was ok. The syrup tasted like pure sugar in brown sticky liquid with no maple flavor at all. One of the most disappointing things for me was that none of the shops at Quaker Square are open anymore. It's like a ghost town. The only shop that is open is the General Store, but it has such limited hours (11am - 4pm), and we happened to never be around at the time the store was open. We paid about $130 for a king bed room, which I thought was a little steep for the quality that we encountered, but I'm glad we stayed here because it sounds like this hotel will be taken over completely by Univ. of Akron for their student housing. On the really positive side, the wifi is free and we had no problems connecting.", "title": "Unique place, but overpriced.", "user": "sanczar", "date": "June 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 68422366}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Being built into the old silos, these rooms are huge \u2013 and thanks to the think concrete walls and circular room, they are extremely quiet.

Also, I had stayed here 20+ years ago when it was the Quaker Hilton and wanted to stay again. We were in room 202 which is 3/4 of a circle with the bathroom cutting into part of the room. My sister-in-law stayed in rooom 104 (Smoking) which is a full circle with the bathroom off of it. Her room obviously had more space, but we had no problem with lack of space in ours. Currently the University of Akron owns it, so floors 4-8 house honor students - they need a special card to swipe to get to those floors. But it looks and feels like a hotel. The rooms were roomy and round - which our kids thought was great. The bathrooms were adequate size. The towels were soft, water pressure was great and water stayed hot. The rooms are lit by several lamps around the room - table, night stands. But there is no overhead light. There is sliding glass door that leads to a small balcony and with the curtains open there is plenty of natural light. The room was clean, the bed linens clean, and the pillows were comfy. The weather was in the 50's during our stay, but we did not have to turn on the heat at all. The breakfast in the morning was great. The kids loved using the waffle maker. They also offered oatmeal which was well made. The bacon was crispy and so good. They offer another hot item which differs each day - french toast bake, scrambled eggs or breakfast burrito. Coffee with real cream, variety of juices, bagels, cereal. All was delicious. The dining area is large and the tables vary from 2 seats to 8 seats. Great for families. We did see some students having breakfast - but everyone is polite. I have a bigger problem with adults acting obnoxious. And only the Akron shirts gave it away they might be students. The hotel staff were more than helpful and friendly. There is a Trackside Grill that opens at 11 and closes around 6-8 depending on the day. There is a general store that sells subs and snacks/drinks. There is one store that sells a variety of different items. It connects to a small museum where you can push buttons and see a train and circus move. They had a neat video about the hotel and the history of Quaker.
