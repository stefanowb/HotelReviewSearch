It was originally a Moorish Castle, enlarged and fortified after the reconquest. The setting is perfect and the village a delight to stroll around. There are a number of bars and restaurants but our favourite was Cabana de Alarcon, for the enthusiasm and humour of the patron, the ambiance, setting and food. A 5 Star experience. We enjoyed several walks around the local countryside, ranging from 2 miles to 5 miles. It is also very well placed for the Don Quixote Trail and the Camino de Santiago. The service at the parador was excellent, as was the breakfast and dinner in a vaulted Grand Hall. The courtyard cafe was ideal, having tables both in and out of the sun. My only criticism was that the rooms were a little on the small side for two people and rather cluttered. Clearly they were fashioned by a designer but not by a user.
