The location is very convenient with about a 5-10 min walk to two different metro lines. From the apt you can walk about 20 min or less and be standing in front of the Duomo. It is very well located to a number of nice restaurants and two small supermarkets. The apartment itself was very clean with more than enough room for you to spread out and relax. It has a small fridge and even a washer if you've been on a long trip or packed lightly. During our stay they even cleaned the unit and changed the linens one day which I was not expecting. It does require a bit of coordination with the company but the apt. representative was waiting for us at the unit when our cab arrived.
