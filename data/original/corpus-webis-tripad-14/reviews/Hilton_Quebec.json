It is conveniently located just outside the Old city, next to the parliament building. Its about a 10minute cab ride from the train station (we arrived via train from Montreal). Being a gold member we were upgraded to an executive room with a view of the city and had access to the lounge as well. The room was well appointed, clean with a good city view despite its slightly smaller size. The lounge on the 23rd floor was fantastic with floor to ceiling glass views of the city, The breakfast and evening snacks served there were also very good. we were also allowed a late checkout of 2pm the next day even though we requested 4pm being gold members. The location is only a 10minute walk to the Chateau Frontenac and all the great restaurants / bistros. overall a great stay and will stay there again if I return to Quebec", "title": "Great Stay in a fab City", "user": "krazy140", "date": "September 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 139426558}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Very dissappointed.

There is a main door which opens up to a little area where 3 more doors are. Our 1st night we got someone that was going in and out of their room often and it sounds literally like they are coming into your room because the door is right next to yours.

I have great view of the St Laurence river and citadel from my room which is great. The room is also pretty clean.

We were lucky enough to go to the concierge level - beautiful full size connecting rooms (we were there with our daughters) - sadly, you must be 18 in order to go into the concierge lounge. I guess this is great for people who don't want kids around but because they serve alcohol that is the rule. Amazing view of historic Quebec city from most rooms. Easy walking distance to everything you would want to do - don't forget to go the neighborhoods behind the hotel, great local restaurants and shops - away from all the tourist traps of the older part.

The room view over the Legislature was amazing! My only negative issues are that for the expensive price of the room there is no fridge in it. Even cheap motels often offer a small bar fridge so why not at this property? Also, there was evidence of mold in the shower grout and I don't think the carpets got vacuumed once in 5 days. The same debris was by the door our whole time there. Not enough to say I would not go back but I must be honest in my review.
