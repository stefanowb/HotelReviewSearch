This is true outback homestead style with an unexpected French touch via the wonderful hosts Catherine and Jacques. The whole lodge was rebuilt four years ago, so everything is new and beautifully maintained. The main lodge houses the enormous restaurant and bar, complete with a huge open fire and another wood fire and a TV/lounge area, plus lots of undercover and open decks for enjoying a late afternoon drink. The rooms are cabin style - ours had a king bed, a sitting area and a front and rear undercover deck. The perfect place to stretch out after a day of exploring Mungo National Park. We made full use of the restaurant - we had a simple but filling continental breakfast each morning, enjoyed a picnic lunch one day (quiche, salad, fruit, fruit cake) and had dinner there on both nights. The means are very hearty - and yes, Catherine's lamb shanks are melt-in-the-mouth good. But leave room for her creme brulee - it is a silken masterpiece with a perfectly cracking top. We visited in September and the weather was superb - crisp mornings, warm days, fabulous sunsets and great birdwatching. And the stars at night are amazing! If camping is not you, then this is THE perfect option for your Mungo experience. You really need two nights to get the most out of the lodge and the National Park. Loved it all! Be warned - there is no mobile phone reception at Mungo. There is wifi at Mungo Lodge but only in the main part of the lodge. To be perfectly honest, I enjoyed being out of range for a few days.", "title": "Made our Mungo experience incredibly memorable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jmlparis", "date": "September 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140140420}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "As many other reviewers have said this a really good stop in a rather remote part of Australia.

The rooms are cosy, but very clean with modern furnishings. The managers were very warm and helpful and made you feel most welcome. You get a real sense of being in the outback as the property has been built to meld into its surroundings. I have only rated the property 4 stars for 2 reasons. 1) the property is remote and there is no access to shops, so you need to be willing to pay a high price for breakfast and lunch (there should have been at least some inclusion of either in the price); and 2) the property is not absolute luxury \u2013 you get everything you want but do not get the sense of being spoilt.
