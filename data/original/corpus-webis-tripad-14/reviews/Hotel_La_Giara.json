The hotel was clean and the staff friendly and helpful. Being accustomed to Paris hotels, the rooms were more than adequate for the two of us. We were a couple of blocks from the warmest, cleanest water I've ever paddled about in and the Piazza was as pretty as it gets. We attended a party on the rooftop of the hotel. It was magical! Amazing views and cool, sea breezes made it a night to remember. We will return for a longer stay than the all too short 2 nights.", "title": "Great Location, Rooftop splendor, and Cheerful", "user": "JJtheScrivener", "date": "November 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185008227}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "So-So hotel", "text": "Room: though clean but not spacious which was a bit uncomfortable- air conditioning did not work.
