Our first issue was realized Sincas we turned on the bulky, small, and very OLD television. We had sound, but no picture. After calling the front desk, a young man brought us another very very old television that seemed to work. This was not the case. Within a few minutes, this television also lost its picture. As we'd turn the television on and off, we could get a picture back, but it would black out again within minutes. This was a great irritant. Since we had difficulty with the tv, my daughter tried your fitness center. There too, the theme seemed to be \"old.\" The running machine rattled and shook so much that my daughter worried it might fall apart! There was just one cup of caffinated coffee provided us, so the two of us had to share the one cup! We were awakened by a knock on our door at 9am. A gentleman whose English was difficult to understand spoke to me through the door. I could not understand him, and as a female with my daughter, was nervous to open my door to him. I guessed that perhaps he wanted to clean my room, so told him we'd be checking out a 11. This was a great disturbance to us as we had stayed up late sharing time together, and had planned to sleep late before embarking on our travels. This man was joined by another gentleman, and the two men conversed very louldy for several minutes as they went door to door in their attempt to clean rooms. This made me so nervous that I watch through the peep-hole. My daughter and I were unable to fall back to sleep due to the loud talking of these two employees. Lastly, the drape over the closet door rather than a door simply looks cheap. This is not what I would expect in a 3.5 star hotel.", "title": "Huge Disappointment", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Momtveler", "date": "June 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 113766041}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Animal cruelty?", "text": "Hotel was average but the breakfast area has a pool with 2 turtles and several koi fish.

Called the General Manager to follow up and he seemed very disinterested, even when I suggested who he might call for advice.

They must have a good boss to want to enjoy their job with the guests. Rooms are wonderfully comfortable and beautiful.

I cannot believe this property received most of its ratings in the \"excellent\" category. The Plaza Hotel in New York, the Savoy in London, the Ritz in Paris are \"excellent\" hotels. This is a dump, something on the lines of a mid-1970's Best Western. It does have a business center and a breakfast on par with an Embassy Suites (which by the way, is down the road and I have stayed there several times and recommend that). The hallways are cinder block, the doors are old metal ones with several layers of paint, and the dead giveaway for its age and cheapness was the 1970's pseudo plastic \"marble\" shower. My clock radio was broken and I had to rely upon a wakeup call (to their credit, they did occur on time). Even if the radio had been operational, the directions were totally for a different model (there is no \"buzzer\" button) and were useless. I couldn't get into my room upon checking in at 10:30 PM because the \"handles stick all the time\". They called maintenance and made me WAIT at that hour rather than simply give me another room. The walls despite being cinder block in the hallway are paper thin and I could hear the barn animals, oops I mean people, next door coughing , clearing their noses, throats, etc. as if they were right in front of me. The bed and pillows were comfortable and after the slobs next door finally shut up and morons stopped calling down the hallways at midnight I was able to sleep well. The restaurant staff is very friendly and efficient. Crowne Plazas in the San Francisco area at least are quite nice, like Hiltons or Sheratons, but this is like they bought a Best Western and stuck their name on it. Gross.
