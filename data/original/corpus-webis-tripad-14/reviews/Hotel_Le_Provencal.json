Luckily this time we could afford a room with a balcony overlooking the Mediterranean and the beautiful Porquerolles islands. It also gave us shelter from the chilly Mistral winds which sometimes occur in this part of France making the sea rather choppy. The park/gardens are very well kept with a tennis court, boules and a pool at the seas edge which would be lovely in warmer weather. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious and there is both a brasserie and more formal restaurant to choose from. Apart from rather tough pastry we enjoyed our meals very much. The airport at Hyeres just down the road makes access very easy nowadays and boats leave for the islands just over a mile away.", "title": "A delightful refuge from the Mistral!", "user": "Snapshot", "date": "May 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162449822}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a charming, family-run hotel with stunning sea views.
