The staff is very good but the staff at the registration desk is remarkably SLOW, I mean Bahama's SLOW. On two different occasions, I went to the front desk for something simple and both times, the staff spent at least 10 minutes explaining every detail to the guest ahead of me.

Since check-in time is 3:00, we called the hotel on Saturday to request an early check-in. We were told that this could not be guaranteed but would be noted in the reservation. When we arrived at 2:00 on Sunday, one room was ready and we were told they would put a \"rush\" on the second room, which would be ready in a few minutes. We left our luggage on a trolley with the bellman and went to the nearby town for a quick lunch. When we returned at 3:10, the second room was still not ready (and our bags remained on display in the middle of the lobby). The desk clerk said he was able to locate another room on the same floor as the first room that was ready. This was not adjacent to our first room--it was down the hall, which was acceptable to us. We requested, however, that it not be an \"adjoining\" room and were assured that it was not. (This process took approximately 20 minutes as the room had been blocked for another arriving guest and had to be unblocked by the manager). When we finally arrived in the room, it turned out to be an adjoining room after all. When we complained, the manager said to hold on for 2 or 3 minutes while he located a non-adjoining room. At 3:45 (approximately 10 minutes later), the manager called back to say it would be another 15 minutes before a non-adjoining room would become available. Since only an hour remained before the wedding was to begin and we still needed to get dressed, we told him we would keep the assigned room. It would have been very easy for the hotel to have blocked 2 adjoining rooms when we made the reservation (or when we called the day before to request early check-in), but this was obviously too difficult for them. The room was a good size but the carpet was stained and torn in places and the bathtub had not been renovated . The bed was much too soft and the linens were unpressed, Holiday Inn-quality--obviously not the upgraded type of bedding that all the better chain hotels are now providing. When we were about to leave our room for the wedding, we discovered that the room safe did not work. We were able to use the safe in our second room instead. No one seemed to care or take note of this when we mentioned it at checkout. All in all, this was a very disappointing experience. The hotel staff could use a few lessons in professional management style. We would not stay here again. The one positive note was that we thought the catering staff did a very nice job with the wedding.", "title": "Not the Ritz", "user": "DCRE", "date": "June 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 17185936, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Wedding reception", "disliked": "\u2014 Front desk staff and manager"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I recently spent 6 nights here.
