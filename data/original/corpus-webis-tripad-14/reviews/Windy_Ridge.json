We were not disappointed at all, in fact, we loved the tranquility of it. The owners, being in their 70s are still full of beans and are very friendly. Breakfast was fresh and tasty. The house has a very old, homey feel to it, but also has a newly built extention right next to the main house. We stayed in a very bright room. Anything extra you require, can be asked for with no problem. Tiny shower cubicle and a slighly softer bed than what we are used to, but these are just minor things; if you are staying for 2-3 nights it is perfect. We were a bit unlucky with the neighbours downstairs, as the walls are not soundproof and you can hear everything, but cannot blame the owners for that of course! Staying in town would have been a lot more noisier! A lot of hard work has gone into keeping up this b&b, huge garden and it also has a license to hold weddings, as we have discovered looking at some of the few certificates on the wall of the reception area. Thank you Jean and John! It was very nice meeting you and we will surely choose your place next time we are in Whitstable and recommend to our friends and family.", "title": "Tucked away from a busy whitstable, lovely simply lovely", "user": "joseph1964", "date": "April 18, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 61831204}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A real \"get away from it all\"", "text": "John and Jean are perfect, gentle and friendly hosts.
