We booked on the Internet Rate and paid $815 dollars/night plus taxes. On arrival the receptionist upgraded us from a Grand Deluxe Double room on the 40th floor (their website says these rooms are on floors 43-54 so not sure if she was downgrading us!) to a Premier Hudson River View room on the 53rd floor. Our room was amazing, exactly as the pictures depict on their website, spotlessly clean, well appointed and with fantastic views of the city and the River Hudson. The bed was super comfy. Excellent sound system, didn\u2019t really use the TV so can\u2019t comment on choice of channels. We\u2019d only been in our room 30 minutes when complimentary champagne and chocolate cake arrived, both were delicious. Housekeeping and turndown service was excellent. We ordered room service a couple of times and it was exceptional. Breakfast in our room was more than adequate but didn\u2019t think it was up to the usual Mandarin standard. We didn\u2019t have much need to use the concierge but when we did they were very helpful and efficient. The bellmen/doormen were all very friendly. We didn\u2019t have time to eat in Asiate but wish we had. We had cocktails and mini burgers (not together!) in the Lobby Lounge, the burgers were great. Hotel location was excellent for us, in a quietish area on the edge of central park but only about a 10 minute walk to Times Square. It\u2019s very much a business hotel so some people may feel it\u2019s a bit \u2018clinical\u2019, but all the staff were great and we loved it.", "title": "Perfect Honeymoon Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "City_FolkTravelBugs", "date": "January 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 23383608, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything!", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled solo", "text": "On previous trips while staying at another 5 star property in town, I kept finding myself at The Time Warner center for dinner, drinks, walks in the park etc. Therefore , I thought, why not try it out?", "title": "Tried very hard to like this place", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "JTG61", "date": "November 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 22089432}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "While there were no disasters, and nothing particularly bad about the hotel, it came across as dissapointigly average.

On the positive side, we found the staff very friendly and helpful (especially the concierge) and the room on the Central Park side was very quiet.
