We had to be in the hotel for 3 weeks during our relocation to MN while we waiting on our house closing. The hotel lobby and the rooms have a stale smoky odor to it. We booked a suite as we were staying so long which the size was pretty good. The main problem I had was the housekeeping staff. On our first day there one of them asked if the staff should only come by once a week to clean up the room. When I said no there are 4 of us living in a small space she gave me an attitude. After that there would be dust all over the furniture and they generally just did a bad job.
