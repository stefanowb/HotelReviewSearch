The Holiday Inn Express in Cathedral City is a basic vanilla hotel with absolutely nothing to distinguish it. Clean, modern and .....well, that's it. Two things have turned me into the person typing this. 1) a morning coffee arrangement with only non-dairy creamer products - the ultimate in cheap and \"we can't be bothered to make even as much effort as the 7-11.\" I mean, please, I expect that at a Motel 6, but this is a Holiday Inn and I'm paying $125 a night so that I can go to a gas station to get an actual milk product in my morning coffee? 2) my real gripe involves a noisy pool. It is 10 pm right now and there are 8 kids screaming at the top of their lungs down at the pool. I ask the front desk if they can either move me to a room on the other side of the hotel or ask the people at the pool to stop screaming. Hotel front desk response, \"we are fully booked up and the pool is open till 11 pm.\" So, fine. Stay here at your own risk and pray that there are no inconsiderate parents who don't think there is anything wrong with having their children SCREAMING at 10 pm in public.

The pool was fine, just nothing special. It was in the back of the hotel overlooking a rather ugly, empty piece of land. There is no food service onsite other than the breakfast and vending machines. The hotel is located on a commercial street nextdoor to a super market and behind a gas station. No resort feeling whatsoever.
