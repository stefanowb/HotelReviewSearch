The hotel has a very attractive outside appearance with service that does not match.

The card keys for the room took about 10-15 trys each time I tried to enter my room (which even though the hotel appeared empty my room was at the back of the hotel (about 1-2 blocks away!). The bathroom supplies minimal and mid-quality at best. The Wi-Fi was terrible and very spotty on every occasion I tried to use it (probably not helped by being sent to the back of the hotel!?). The train noise (especially at the back is extremely noisy and you better bring ear-plugs if you expect to sleep. The restaurant was an absolute insult! The cook tells you that it only opens if someone shows up at this time of year, I tried to order off the really limited menu for breakfast and they had nothing (\"too slow to keep food fresh\")! $159 + taxes ($179 total) and because I booked through Air Canada they could not give me any type of receipt so I could not submit any receipt for business use!", "title": "Over-priced", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "johncrawcarp", "date": "January 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 149959819}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Recently stayed here with a hockey team.
