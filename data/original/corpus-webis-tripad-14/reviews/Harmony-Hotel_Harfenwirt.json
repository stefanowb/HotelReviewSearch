Another button draglift on the nursery slopes in the village centre enables you to ski back to the hotel across a footpath (icy) or the adjoining fields. Ski race events take place in the evening at the base of the red run opposite, which also provides good sledging. The ski school prizegiving took place in the hotel on the friday evening, which was great fun. Make sure you wait for the instructors' cow bell ringing! The large new extension incorporates accomodation, a dining room and a swimming pool. All are of very good quality, and our room in the extension was spotless, the bathroom had wonderful heated floor and towel rails, and the generously proportioned balcony had probably the best view in Niederau! The breakfast buffet was good, with enough choice to please most people. Generally, the hotel is fairly cosy and friendly, and smokers are tightly restricted to the small bar area. However, there are some negatives. The evening meals were okay, but are basic, suffer from regularly featuring frozen veg, and the small number of waiters are run off their feet. Inevitably this leads to some long delays for main courses. Although the ski room has good fittings, it is very small and cramped, and has a grand total of one seat. A better option may be the larger (but less secure) ski room under the Irish pub by the gondola station. There are no towels provided in the swimming pool, so either bring your own or use your room's. Lastly, the legendary Herbert caused us to queue for an hour to check in. Various families in front of us were having lengthy and angst filled conversations with him due to being farmed out to various chalets. However, when we reached him, it took no more than 5 minutes to be processed, and were very happy with our allocated room. The families encountering the hassle had all appeared to have booked with Inghams, whereas we booked with Crystal (and had paid a supplement for a balcony) . Despite these relatively minor irritations, we enjoyed the hotel and the holiday. If you get a great last minute deal here then it is a good value place to stay.
