It did not start well, as first of all, we got a bit lost trying to find the restaurant and guest house. Then when we entered we were asked by a young man to wait in the lounge. We asked and were then taken to the porch overlooking the estuary where we were given menus. The chef, the wife of the couple that own it, came out and explained the menu to us. You can choose a number of courses and have a few choices within each course. What followed was a beautiful, creative, delicious meal, accompanied by recommended wines that enhanced the flavors. The couple themselves are delightful and friendly. Their beautiful home was converted to this restaurant guest house. Our only regret is that we didn't buy some of the perforated ostrich eggs that held the tea lights on each table.
