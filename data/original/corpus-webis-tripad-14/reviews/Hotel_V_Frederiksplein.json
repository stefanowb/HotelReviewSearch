The one negative for the rooms would be sound proofing isn't excellent but to be honest i didnt really notice it too much at night as the bed was too dam comfortable and sent me straight off (or that could have been the fine produce of the local cafe's).

The lounge was stylish and cosy. Tea and coffee were for free the whole day until 12 o'clock at night. There are several shortcomings, of course. My boyfriend was not so pleased with our bed as it was a bit too hard, as well as the sheets and the quilts didn't feel like cotton. The mirror in the bathroom were too high for me (but, magically, it was somehow lowered the next day without us knowing exactly when). We were absolutely unhappy with the shower as the water force was not strong enough and the shower door could not be closed causing water all over the place.

Two people could not fit in the bathroom, and I could not use the mirror at all, as it was too high to see into. The bed was incredibly comfy but there was no floor space. There was a closet, thankfully, so we were able to hang some clothes. There were two goose-neck lamps attached to the head of the bed, to read by. My husband banged his head on one, when rolling over. The only other lighting was a low wattage decorative light fixture in the middle of the room and one portable, small lamp that we moved to the desk area, and other areas we needed to SEE. When we were packing to leave the night before, we could hardly see to do so. The following morning was an early flight, so there still was not any light from our window to see to pack our things. Please, turn up the wattage on these few lights, even the bathroom! The ultra modern design is trendy, but impractical in so many ways. The location is ideal for access to everywhere via tram. Oh yeah! The elevator is 2 feet by 2 feet! When we arrived, I was able to get on with the carry-on luggage. My husband had to wait for the elevator to come back to collect him. He had to \"really suck it in\" to have room for himself and the suitcase to get up to our room.. Staff was great.
