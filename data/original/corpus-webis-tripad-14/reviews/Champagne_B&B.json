Once again, this website and the reviewers did their job! We arrived quite late, and Bill met us with a warm hello and a quick recommendation to the local restaurant - superb. From there on out, it was just the perfect place. Meredith was away, but Bill kept things ticking over with fresh bread, good conversation, and lots of helpful ideas on where to go and what to do. We decided to bring food back and eat at the B&B with Bill and, on our last night, a really nice couple from Belgium. Much more personal than a hotel restaurant. The facility itself is very clean, with comfortable rooms, plenty of hot water, and superb views from behind the farmhouse onto the valley. The house is a home - and it feels that way. Unfortunately, the pool was being redone, but the piano, guitar and champagne more than made up for it! Bill is also quite the photographer, and took plenty of snaps of us which will be nice momentos for Lauren and I. If you are going to champagne and need access to Epernay, Reims and Paris - look no further.
