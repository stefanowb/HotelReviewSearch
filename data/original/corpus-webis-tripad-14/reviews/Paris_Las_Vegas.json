They had made to order eggs, omelettes and crepes, and plenty of fruit, pastry, danish, cheese, yogurt, sausage, bacon, and anything else you can think of for breakfast. The cheese is especially good! Le Cafe was also good overall, especially the service. The only down side was the prime rib, it was a bit tough. The Steakhouse was also excellent, but for the price paid, my filet minogn was again a little dry (very tender though). The Paris seems to have a problem with either getting good quality beef, or they don't know how to prepare it.

In order for one of the family to have a king room they had to go to the 6th floor when all the rest of us were on the 30th. I wish I had made a bigger fuss about it. The rooms were very spacious and well maintained. The bathroom was lovely with tub, toilet and separate shower stall. We didn't gamble but did eat at several restaurants which were all fine. The service was fair - not great, not terrible. 2 of our rooms adjoined and they were cleaned by different members of housekeeping which was interesting. One would be cleaned before noon while the other would still be unmade at 3:30 PM. We also found that the housekeepers left different amenities. I never saw a shower cap and got a different type of shampoo from the other room. I would stay at Paris again with a good rate.

Room service and housekeeping were very attentive. The Mandara Spa I give mixed reviews. I got a massage and a facial. The massage was good- I think his name was Ovid. The facial was done by Elena who, of course, tried to sell me at least $100 dollers worth of product. As I was dressing after the facial, I noticed a slight rash on my upper chest where she had massaged in some product. When brought to her attention, she stated she didn't think it had anything to do with the facial. I disagree, but it was not very noticeable and has since gone away. The one major issue I had with the ladies spa area were the showers. Not very clean, on the dark side and I noted in more than 1 shower some grout that appeared to be moldy. Finally, there was one shower that had a faceplate about to fall off as well as the shower head was leaky and looked like it was on its last legs.

Once we arrived in Las Vegas, we were able to walk right up to Paris' embassitor checkin area and get right into our room by 11:15 am. There was no wait.

Very large and spacious bathroom with large vanity area and choice of free-standing tub or shower. Accessing the highspeed internet service from your own personal laptop computer was a breeze as well and far easier than other hotels where we have used internet service in the past. I also feel the $10 per 24-hr fee was quite reasonable for high speed access. Maid service for Paris was well above average. And the pm turndown service and spot clean, complete with chocolate left pillowside, was an additional added plus not seen in my typical hotel stay experience. The only negatives were first the bed pillows. I found them very uncomfortable. And also the keycards getting corrupted and not working (the cause is a magnetic clip on a woman's purse or key being stored near a cell phone. So make note not to have your room keycard near either during your stay). Otherwise, I absolutely loved this hotel, it's staff and the service we experienced during our stay.
