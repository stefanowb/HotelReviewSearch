Everyone was friendly and seemed to genuinely want to make our vacation terrific. The unit itself was nice and comfortable. On the second floor, looking over the 15th hole of the Blue Golf Course, with a nice view in the distance of Molokini and the ocean, this is a one bedroom unit with two smallish bathrooms (but adequate for our purposes), insuite laundry, a slightly dated but fully equipped kitchen and a large living/dining area. The Destination Resorts provides room cleaning every 3 days and our unit included free phone calls to the Continental USA and Canada which was a nice perk. The only thing that was a bit disappointing compared with other properties we've stayed at was that the communal BBQs are not propane but require you to supply your own charcoal.

Some of the buildings are very close to the main artery coming into Wailea from the Highway and would be quite loud with traffic noise.

Building #3 was about a 10-15 min walk to all the other amenities of Wailea. The closest restaurants are Matteo's Italian which was a reasonable, casual Italian place (note: you place your order at the cashier and pay before getting a seat which was a bit unusual - they also do take-away for most menu items) and Joe's Grill which is located at the Wailea Tennis Centre across the street and offers a great menu in a casual atmosphere.", "title": "Pretty and spacious condo but REALLY NOISY!!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "AJPSdundas", "date": "August 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 37687935}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We just returned from a fabulous 23 nights at unit #1507 at Ekolu Condos in Wailea.

We have stayed at the Grand Champions before and although they are are nice, Ekolu is much more spread out and the private. It is a bit higher up the hill in Wailea so the views are more spectacular in my opinion. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The pools are lovely. I read reviews of Ekolu before we left and noticed some families complained that they were told to be more quiet at the pool. We had this experience at the Grand Wailea as there seemed to be a person who's only job was to walk from pool to pool yelling at kids who were laughing and splashing. We did not have this experience at Ekolu but I have to be honest and say that I can understand to a point why they try to control the noise. It is so quiet and peaceful and I wouldn't want to hear other kids yelling and screaming at the pool so why should people want to hear mine? I think that this would be the norm at any condo unit in Wailea so if you have kids who love to yell and scream at the pool, Wailea may not be the place for you.", "title": "wonderful experience", "user": "vacati0ner61", "date": "July 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33895072}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "It is about a 10 minute walk down to the shops at Wailea and then about another 10-15 minutes to the beach.
