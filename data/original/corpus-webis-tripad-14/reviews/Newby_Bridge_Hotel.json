Generally, the standard was very poor. I complained to reception and the manager came to the room to look at the problems. She agreed with my comments and said she would reduce the room rate. It was reduced by a very small amount but as I explained, my complaint was not about money it was about the hotel being described as something that it wasn't. Dinner was reasonable but not great especially, at the price. The hot food at breakfast ran out with nobody there to replace it. We got fed up waiting and went back to our table. When it did finally arrive, a large queue had formed. Overall, the facilities were there but let down by lack of cleanliness and service. We recently stayed at Jurys Inn, Birmingham, the room was large and spotlessly clean, much more variety of food and much better value even though it had no character.

I had made the booking for two double rooms back in April via Groupon for my partner's birthday. The plan was for us and another couple to visit the hotel for two nights with dinner on the first night. We were really looking forward to our stay but were contacted (with 9 days to go) by the hotel who informed us that our rooms would not be ready for our stay due to bullding work. We were informed that we could stay at a sister hotel in Kendal. With due respect if I wanted to stay in Kendal (which for the record is very nice - I have family living in the town) I would have booked a hotel there. I was also told that other than that there was nothing else they could do. The tone of the message was very much \"couldn't care less\". I have also since found out (although I'm sure this is purely coincidental) that this would have been a very busy weekend with various events taking place including the great lake swim. As I said I'm sure that this had nothing to do with our discounted Groupon break being cancelled. I realise that sometimes things happen due to unforeseen circumstances but the way in which the hotel handled things was very unprofessional and was done with a \"its not our fault\" tone. The four of us had booked time off work far in advance for this trip and as many people will appreciate, time off from hard to come by jobs is very much appreciated in these challenging economic times, so to be treated in such an off hand way was very disappointing indeed.", "title": "Old Style English Hotel", "user": "ELLERICK", "date": "June 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 131956395}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We have stayed at the Newby Bridge hotel a couple of times, and we have had a lovely relaxing break both times.", "title": "Great weekend break", "user": "jane d", "date": "June 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 131853575}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "The main feature which drew us to the place was the fact we could enjoy a mini break away in the Lakes and bring along our 2 little amazing pugs.

In fact I heard him say to another guest that the food was definitely of 5 star standard. I (Jim) particularly liked just how friendly and helpful all the staff were with a special mention for the girls on reception. Their early morning cheerfulness always made our day.

The room was dark, cold, damp (on one of the hottest days of the year so far) smelly, unkempt, dated, dirty and the view was out of this world! Meaning it looked out on the staff caravan park. As we checked in (actually the receptionist was great) we got shown to the room which I had actually been sold at a higher rate as it was a special 4 poster bedroom with a Jacuzzi, we were horrified. Even our dog, who has stayed in some 4 star hotels in the Lakes didn\u2019t want to stay. The smell hit you as soon as you walking in the room, there was a 4 poster bed alright but it looked filthy, I pulled the top cover back and there was a blue sheet underneath that looked very dated and almost mouldy. Also there was a single bed in the room, this had a hole in the side and a very dirty looking duvet cover, no valance or anything to try and make look better! We went out for a walk to discuss what we were going to do. After a while we came back and decided that we didn\u2019t want to stay at this hotel. We asked the receptionist if she could book us into their sister hotel Damson Dene 10 mins away. She called and fortunately they had a room free, it was heaven to arrive at a nice hotel with excellent food after seeing this terrible hotel. Oh yeah, I forgot to say, during our short stay at Newby Bridge Hotel we looked around the building, the swimming pool looked uninviting and dark and oh my god! The GYM, that\u2019s not a gym, it was the entrance to the pool with unfinished floors and disgustingly filthy equipment, I didn\u2019t have my camera at the time to take a picture of just how bad it was.
