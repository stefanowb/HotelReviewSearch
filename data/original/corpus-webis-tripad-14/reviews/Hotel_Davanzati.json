The Davanzati compared well with our other choices, with a room that was a bit roomier and had the added feature of a laptop in the room. Everything was clean and well kept. The breakfast was plentiful and tasty and the coffee was very good. The hotel does a happy hour which was a nice touch. We liked the location a lot- easy walk to shopping and good restaurants. Folks at the desk were helpful when we asked for restaurant suggestions and the like. On the down side, there is a flight of stairs before you get to the hotel elevator. Our room had a stepup bathroom which amounted to a minor annoyance. Some street noise did reach our room though it did not seem excessive.

The room is nice sized with two beds and a computer with internet access. The staff gave us wonderful recommendations for lunch and dinner, even making reservations for us. Breakfast was a very nice simple Italian breakfast which offered \"American\" coffee for those that preferred it. Happy hour from 6:30 to 7:30pm is a great time to mingle and enjoy a pre-dinner drink. It was a nice touch to a wonderful stay. The hotel is located in a nice street minutes from all sites.
