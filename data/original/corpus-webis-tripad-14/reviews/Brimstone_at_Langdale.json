Park in the underground car park. Buzz the entry door and you're greeted by your 'host' (their phraseology not mine). No reception to check you in. Straight to your room (which is sumptuous) and a guided tour of facilities: reading room, boot room (with Berghaus stuff to wear should you forget your own) and leisure facilities across the way in the main hotel block. Free tea and coffee in the reading room along with wine, beer, sandwiches, cakes etc etc. it's different that's for sure. Service is good (albeit breakfast taken in our room was late and they forgot some things), but could be more polished. Location is excellent; we did two of their suggested local walks and the route descriptions were faultless and the scenery fantastic. We ate in the hotel restaurant and it was very good even for our critical pallets! So, will we return. Yes, you bet we will; just need to save up first...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Tickandbash", "date": "August 11, 2013", "id": 171761560}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We are lodge owners at Langdale and keep promising to come at a different time to our usual week", "title": "a real treat", "user": "frog40", "date": "August 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 171633953}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Brimstone opening gave us a great excuse to do just that with some indulgence", "title": "The Jewel of The Lake District", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mully1964", "date": "August 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 170545038}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "It did not let us down the room WAS fantastic the balcony also fantastic", "title": "Excellent birthday celebration", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "BambiPrincess", "date": "July 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 170095251}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The staff were attentive and friendly", "title": "A luxurious start to our honeymoon-fantastic!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "RSinclair595", "date": "July 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 169597130}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We parked under the hotel and from then on the place felt exclusive! We were greeted by a host downstairs in the waiting area with beautiful log fire as there is no reception, and she took us up the stairs past the lounge with complimentary bar and snacks to our room. We were positively surprised at just how unusual and stunning the room was. Our huge bed was at a jaunty angle which made it a real feature, but it had to compete against the huge chrome roll top bath, the 2 huge flat screen TVs, the real log fire, the comfy corner sofa and the wrap-round balcony.

I had a duet room for one night in June and I have to say it was so fantastic that I didn't actually want to leave the room! Lots of lovely hidden extras such as the ghd's hair dryer and ghd straighteners in the wardrobe and the mood lighting. Breakfast in bed is a great touch, but you can go to the main hotel for the buffet breakfast if you prefer. I've been to langdales a few times before and I can't remember what was there before they built the brimstone. It looks as if its always been there. The staff at the Brimstone need a mention. They are attentive, polite and happy! There is a reading room with snacks, drinks and comfy chairs.
