We were nervous as we drove down the dirt road that you need to take to get to the hotel, but were delighted to find this jem hiding at the end of the road. The staff were very courteous and professional. Our suite was huge and very clean..and priced very economically. We had a beautiful balcony overlooking the pool area. The pool area was also great - very comfortable lounge chairs, shady and sunny spots and very secluded from the beach. Since the hotel only has about 10 rooms, you get to know the other people staying at the hotel (especially since you all eat breakfast together in the morning) and it's a great communal atmosphere. It made us feel a little safer in Jaco, especially at night. The only thing I would caution for women traveling on their own is to be careful walking down the dirt road at night - I wouldn't walk down it by myself at night. Other than that, we were very happy with our stay at Canciones Del Mar - I will stay there again if I'm ever back to Jaco Beach!", "title": "Great place to stay in Jaco", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Amps", "date": "August 31, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5730774}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "My wife and I stayed at Canciones del Mar for 8 days in June and fell in love with the hotel and staff.

The landscaping around the grounds is absolutely enchanting, with the pool area feeling like your own private tropical paradise with lush gardens, coconut palms overhead and thatched huts surrrounding the area. The breakfast (included w/room) is excellent, with cooked to order eggs, rice and beans, tortillas or toast, salsa, fresh papaya and mango, freshly made fruit juices and coffee.

We took our two children and a babysitter (for my three year old). We decided to stay at Jaco because of its close proximity to the San Jose Airport and to various activities. We were very pleased for several reasons. First, the hotel was right on the beach with a great view. The pool and gardens were absolutely beautiful. Although Jaco itself was somewhat dirty, the staff at the hotel went to great lengths to keep the grounds clean. The managers at the hotel were very helpful, even when we waited to the last minute to schedule a tour. Marco, the manager, even shopped around for the best price for a taxi to Tarcoles for the Crocodile Safari. The housekeepers were absolutely wonderful. They even straigtened our shoes and folded our clothes. They did much more than our American housekeepers, who usually only change the towels and make the bed. The housekeepers at the C.d.M. really take pride in what they do. The breakfast, which is included in the price of the room, was absolutely delicious. It was traditional Costa Rican, and Lillianna, the cook, was wonderful. The snack bar stayed opened until two o'clock. Lillianna made hamburgers, hot dogs, fajitas, etc. We were able to charge the lunches to our rooms. They also sold sodas and beer. I needed laundry done, and for a very small fee, my clothes were washed, dried, folded and returned to me in about three hours. I highly recommend this hotel. Anyone who writes a negative review about it is probably extremely picky.

The office for the hotel is only open from 8 am to 8 pm so when the electricity went out we had no one to tell. We were told about a jet ski tour and they called on our behalf. We were told we had to pay in cash by the owner of the jet ski company. Unfortuanetly we did not have that much cash so the owner of the hotel offered to put the charge on our room so we could pay with credit card. Well when we checked out the owner had added a 15% charge for using a credit card for the jet ski tour without letting us know. The problem is that we would not have cared if he had just been honest and told us up front that there would be a service charge for using our credit card for the jet ski tour.

The biggest dissapointment about this hotel is that every unit does NOT have an ocean view as advertised on their site. They have two units with a partial ocean view and the other nine have no ocean view. The units themselves have some problems. We were overrun with ants and small insects all over the bathroom and kitchen. There was mold growing on the bathroom and living room walls. I found hair on the linen in the bed. We were hugely dissapointed about all of this and only stayed one night before moving to the Tangeri. On a positive note, this place is very quiet and has a wonderful atmosphere. The pool, gardens, and grounds are excellent. The breakfast is good and the staff are very polite. I just feel like their web site misrepresents what you really get, but oh well, lesson learned.

The sea, the surf, the beach, the palm grove, the hotel-it is just as you might imagine a small unique tropical beachfront resort should be. The \u201cSongs of the sea\u201d is a quiet and cool oasis amidst the busy Jaco town scene, with each room\u2019s small deck looking out over the ocean or on the lush gardens surrounding the pool. The hotel is built in Tropical Spanish Colonial style and the fully equipped rooms are spacious and quiet. It is the one place in Playa Jaco that combines the convenience of central location with beachfront location. Wake up to a delicious fresh fruit and buffet breakfast under the thatched roof of the beach side restaurant, then wander down to the beach for some sun and surf. If it gets too hot, retreat and cool off by the pool and Jacuzzi or catch up on your reading in the breezy elevated thatched roof tree house while you enjoy the view below. We have a small gourmet restaurant for lunch and dinner, and our Costa Rican chef serves international gourmet and or local food. Also enjoy our Tapas Bar terrace and Jacuzzi on the third floor with a spectacular view over the ocean and green mountains where you can enjoy the spectacular sunsets of the Pacific Ocean. We also do weddings and special events. We are committed with national sustainability programs and protecting the environment."}
