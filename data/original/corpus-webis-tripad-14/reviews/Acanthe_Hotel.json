It is also beside the metro stop which takes you directly to the trAIn station. I would have to comment though on the abruptness of the reception staff.

However the bathroom doors are wooden louvered shutters so don't expect a lot of privacy. Also, we were there in hot weather and the room was stifling. We asked for a fan and the indifferent desk man said it was \"impossible.\" Our traveling companion was also bothered by the temperature so it wasn't just our room. I guess if you could keep your windows open at night it would be better, but the rooms on that side of the hotel are VERY noisy, with people coming and going until very late as well as trash trucks, recycle trucks, etc. The good news is that there are very few cars there as the street is a mostly pedestrianized one. I do know that my friend stayed in one of the upper floors, which she enjoyed; those have been upgraded and have A/C and she was on the small side street and said it was quiet. They call those rooms by a different name (\"deluxe\" or something like that) so that would've helped a lot in our case.
