We booked through Priceline and got a rate of less than $100 per night. Rooms and lobby were very nice and well kept. We were upgraded to a lake view room on the 12th floor. The staff was friendly and helpful. My 2 year old daughter woke up in the middle of the night with a fever. We called the front desk and they had some Children\u2019s Motrin. Also, when I went down to get the medicine I asked if there was anywhere I could get my daughter some apple juice. Although everything in the hotel was closed, the lady at the front desk said she would get her manager to check in the restaurant. Less than 10 minutes later the manager was at our door with a bottle of apple juice. Also, we forgot our toothbrushes and toothpaste. When we were going up to our room I asked the gentleman at the front desk if they had any. He called housekeeping and before we could get up to our room they had brought us toothbrushes and toothpaste. The only downside was that the hotel was kind of noisy at night. They atrium style of the hotel is beautiful, but it allows noise to carry all the way up the building. There was some sort of function going on the Saturday night we were there and it was pretty loud. We were on a high floor, so I can only imagine how loud it must have been down on the lower levels.
