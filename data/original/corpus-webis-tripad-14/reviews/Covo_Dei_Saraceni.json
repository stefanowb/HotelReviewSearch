As soon as we arrived we were welcomed warmly by the front desk staff and shown to our beautiful room on the 5th floor. The room was beautiful, a terrace overlooking the sea with 2 comfortable sunbeds. The room was exceptionally clean, the cleaner came in TWICE a day! The bed was changed daily and towels delivered twice a day! We ate mainly in the hotel restaurant which was superb. A couple of nights we ate at the restaurant Max which had been recommended by the hotel. This restaurant was also divine but the view at the Covo was too good to miss! Salvatore in the bar, Paolo, Antoniella etc in the restaurant and Antonio on the reception were all fabulous and made our stay amazing. Our stay was topped off to perfection when we were driven back to Naples by Poppy our driver. He played us traditional Italian music and pointed out all the tourist sights, he was very entertaining. Italy, The Covo dei Saraceni and all the people we met were FABULOUS!!! Can't wait to return!!!

We spent five days here as a part of our Italian Honeymoon, and it was the hotel highlight. I would probably be repeating a lot of the other reviews if I go into depth about the breakfast, scenery and pool, so let it suffice to say this: splurge for the more expensive room if you are able, and let the staff know if you are celebrating (champagne will await you)! Though there were many obnoxious children in the pool some of the days, the staff was great at shooing them away from us, and trying to maintain the peace and tranquility that adults so enjoy at a 5L star hotel. The food is amazing at the hotel and nearby restaurants, you really can't go wrong here. Another huge boon for this hotel is its location--directly off the ferry docks, so you don't need to bother yourselves with porter services, or climbing up ridiculous heights to reach your destination.

We were pleasantly surprised to find on our balcony a gift of champagne chilling on ice in a beautiful champagne bucket with glasses including a note of best wishes for our celebration, compliments from the Saraceni family. If you want to relax and enjoy the Italian life, hang out with the locals, soak up the sun and experience all the aromas, sights, sounds and beauty of Italy this is the place to stay. Church bells, children playing, laughing or calling for their mamas, the romantic italian language, the calming Salerno Bay waves, boats, magnificent food and wine\u2014 so very relaxing and magical.
