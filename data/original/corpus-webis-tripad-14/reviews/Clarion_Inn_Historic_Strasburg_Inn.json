The room we were given was a fairly large double room facing the rear grounds of the property. There was a small play area for kids in the grassy area behind the rooms facing this side, which was a nice amenity. So, back to the room. While the hotel appears to have some sense of kid-friendliness to it based on the playgorund, the room was without a microwave or refrigerator. This seemed odd considering we saw mutliple families with small children and/or babies. The website also mentioned that there had been a recent renovation at the property, but our room had a very old style wall unit air conditioner ( that was incredibly loud ) and a toilet that flushed and gurgled by itself throughout the evening. There was some sign of a new paint job, but beyond that the furnishings and carpeting were far from new.

However, and perhaps because of the wedding party that evening, they seemed to be completely overwhelmed. I am guessing some of thier staff was working the reception, but it is just a guess. We had a good waitress and I could see that there was some frustration happening between her and the kitchen/cooking staff that evening. We waited over 45 minutes just to get our kids' orders of one hot dog and a hamburger w/fries. The entrees for my wife and I came about 15 minutes later....so now its an hour wait before eating dinner after a long day and drive. The mgmt appeared to be a 20 year old kid ( who was helping serve) and the bar tender was also pitching in taking dinner orders...and thus slacking on making the drinks orders for the wait staff. We came in just before the dinner rush and upon leaving looked into the doomed faces of the diners \"waiting to wait\" to eat after us. I suspect this was not a typical evening experience at their restaraunt, but based on the wait, it would have been prudent to offer something off the bill from someone in authority, but perhaps the problem was that there appeared to be no one in charge. I told my wife I would give the Netherlands another shot, but it is a good lesson that appearances can be deceiving and to not let a pretty website woo you into a mediocre experience.", "title": "Lovely peaceful hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "drippyD", "date": "August 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8429194, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Parklike setting, spacious suite, spa", "disliked": "\u2014 Food at the restaurant"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "This was the last stop on a six-stage tour from the UK.

I spoke to them about my concerns and they couldn't have been nicer. Mr. Ritter showed me a few rooms and I found them both pleasant and clean, he then gave me his card and asked me to call him to let him know when we were arriving.

The grounds were even prettier than I expected, lovely plantings everywhere, and very well maintained. We enjoyed sitting on the chairs outside and taking in the view of the farmland in the distance and admiring the pretty setting. I wish I could say that about the rest of the property. We had booked a King Deluxe room for two nights, which was advertised on their website as being remodeled and updated, with a separate sink area, etc. Instead, we were given a room that was totally outdated, like something from the 60's or 70's. The worst part about it was the old A/C unit. It was loud, and got even louder as the night went on, which meant we didn't get much sleep. We were given the room we should have had the next night, and it was much, much better . . . as advertised, remodeled/updated, bigger, and a quiet A/C unit, but only after much confusion about whether our new room was ready - it was after 3:00. No offer of compensation was offered, either. Another guest was complaining about the dangerously hot water which was hard to control (we had that in the original room -in both the sink and shower), and he actually burned his foot from it. He complained that they didn't adjust his bill to comensate him for it. The breakfast was good, but it was so disorganized and so loud, with dishes clanging. . . people were walking in with no one to greet them, not realizing they could go ahead and seat themselves, and waiting around, then looking to find someone in charge. The pool was small, but nice, but the spa tub was definitely not clean, (murky water) so we didn't even think about getting in. Also, they let the used pool towels pile up and overflow. It was a pleasant surprise to see two hot air balloons overhead while we were lounging at the pool. By the way, we did hear the desk clerk tell another guest that they were still in the process of updating the rooms. I would suggest that you contact the hotel directly to make reservations, and to specifically request an updated room, or I think you will be disappointed, and may lose a night's sleep. Maybe once they improve the rest of the rooms and become a little more organized, it will be the kind of place it really should be.
