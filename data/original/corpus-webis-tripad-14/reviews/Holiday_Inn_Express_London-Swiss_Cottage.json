We found the staff pleasant and helpful. This property is particularly suitable for travelers arriving in London by car or who might need a car while in the area. The negatives are primarily that the rooms are small and the furniture, while modern and of good quality, is relatively simple; shelves, cubby holes and limited open hanging space substitute for chests, drawers, and closets. For many the flaws will not be very significant; for those staying more than a night or two and who like to unpack fully, they may be more irksome.", "title": "A Good Choice in an Excellent Central London Location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Rags2006", "date": "March 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154910480}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Now to flesh out with all the details, the long version: Note: this hotel is not the former Holiday Inn Swiss Cottage, but a new purpose-built seven-story (two modern elevators) hotel up Finchly Road from Swiss Cottage. The area is a lively one with many restaurants and shops and excellent public transportation connections. The \"O-2\" center, a shopping and entertainment development that includes a large Sainsburys supermarket, a good bookshop (Waterstone's), a VUE cinema, several restaurants and fast-food spots, and a lively pub, is directly across the street.

Our view was surprisingly pleasant; behind the hotel is a steep uphill and on it is a densely planted terraced garden. We heard birds singing even during much of the unpleasant weather. We had one double bed which had a good mattress and bedding. There was a choice of firm or soft pillows, but we thought them both inferior to the pillows in U.S. Holiday Inn Expresses. As mentioned above, it will be difficult to stow more than a couple of days of clothing on the limited shelf, cubby and hanging space, a minor nuisance for those staying longer periods.

She was also really upset as we had come to London over night especially to celebrate their Birthdays! I asked to move rooms,but the Hotel was fully booked. I did ask for another Double duvet, so the children did sleep separately, but still had to share the sofa bed. The children said that the sofa bed was really uncomfortable too, It was actually broken and we propped it up with spare pillows/cushions and padded it with towels. Also try to avoid rooms overlooking the main road, the sirens and traffic didn't stop all night!
