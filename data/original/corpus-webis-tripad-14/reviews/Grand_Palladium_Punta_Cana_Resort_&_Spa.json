On arrival we were taken to our room in the 2000 block which was really nice. However, my daughter was provided with a couch pull out bed which would have been ok but the metal spings on the side of the bed were bent and so they stuck out quite danerously as they were really sharp. My little girl banged her elbow straight away and so we asked them to replace the couch bed with a normal bed which never happened. \"Jesus\" was extremely rude to me and I was not impressed by his attitude. my partner complained to the manager who dealt with the problem by offering us other rooms that were smaller so in the end we stuck with the room we had. We never got a replacement bed so I simply stuck towels around the shap parts of the pull out to make it safer for my daughter.", "title": "Wonderful Vacation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lili_m", "date": "July 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17591893}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Rooms- really nice but the shower leaks terribly as the bath is too far away form the shower and so it leaks everywhere all over the floor leading into the bedroom.

We compalined about this and was told he would be told how dangerous this was. however, this continued and so we didn't eat any fresh meat throughout our stay. i suffered a dodgy tummy the first week and suspect it was down to eating form the grill before I noticed what the chef was doing.

Our travel agent had requested a room that wasn't on the ground floor and one that was close to the beach. In fact, we were given a ground-floor room that was in the middle of the resort near the reception. When we got to the room, we were disappointed to say the least, even more so when we found out the key they had given us did not work. Back to the reception where, when we requested a room change, we were met with a scowl and told the hotel was full to capacity (this was untrue). However, if we were willing to pay an extra 15$ a night, we could stay in a Jr. suite. Needless to say we did not do this, and settled for the room they had given us.

One thing we did notice, however, is that there was very little AC in the restaurants or buffets - so sometimes mealtimes were uncomfortably warm. Staff are usually friendly but can be indifferent in the buffets and restaurants. Unfortunately, we didn't meet anyone who showed us exemplary service during the week.

As such, we didn't have much luck with the a la carte restaurants. We tried the Italian one night and the Seafood/steak another. The problem was with a persistent waiter who kept harassing my friend. At the first a la carte, we were so uncomfortable that we didn't get to finish our meal and had to leave before dessert. When we went to the second a la carte two nights later, the waiter who had given us grief from the first restaurant was there and came back again. Unfortunately, we did not get his name (no name tag) because we would have reported his unprofessionalism to management.
