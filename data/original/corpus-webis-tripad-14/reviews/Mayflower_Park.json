The hotel only advertised that they had 3 types of rooms - Standard queen, Deluxe queen (larger) and Double queen. Upon arrival were were put into a King room (the clerk explained that they only have about a half dozen king rooms) Our room was very large - could have accomodated another King with adaquate walking room remaining. The double queen rooms appeared somewhat more cramped, with limited space next to the beds.", "title": "Awesome independent hotel centrally located", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "chansy05", "date": "April 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 61959412}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "As is common in older hotels, electric outlets is a bit of a challenge.

A tub, sink and camode with room to stand is all you get. Nice shampoo and conditioner in large wall mounted pump bottles in the shower, a bar of soap and towels. No extras. My mother in law complained that there was nowhere to hang a towel - the only towel bar is in over the bathtub.", "title": "Excellent Location, Friendly Staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "badlisa3", "date": "April 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 61258397}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The only other significant complaint is that the 2 very small elevators are inadaquate to service the 10 floor hotel. 4 - 5 minute waiting times were normal during peak hours.
