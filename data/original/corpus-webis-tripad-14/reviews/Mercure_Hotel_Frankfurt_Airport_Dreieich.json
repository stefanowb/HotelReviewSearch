This review will be short due to the bout of nasty food poisoning during my stay in Dreieich so I was laid up in my room for part of my visit. Mercure is very convenient to the airport and office and is close to a local train station. I was able to get a taxi very easily to get to/from the office/airport and the front desk staff were helpful. There was a little store a short walk from the hotel. Dreieich seemed to be a very attractive town and the neighborhood around the hotel appeared to be safe. The room was clean but sparsely decorated and somewhat dated. There was not any central AC system so I had to open my door/window to a patio to get some fresh air\u2026.however it was somewhat noisy and smoky since my room faced the back of the hotel where the workers hung out and smoked and truck delivery area. Recommend you ask for a room not in the back. The room had two twin beds but I was able to push them together. There was no iron in the room however there was a hotel service if you drop off by 9am nor was there a tea/coffee maker in the room. (I prefer to make my own coffee in the morning) The minibar came in handy with ample supply of water and juice and alcohol. I was not impressed by the prepared breakfast selections\u2026eggs and meat were over cooked. The wireless internet was very expensive at 24 Euro for 24 hours and didn\u2019t work part of the time. Then I later found free internet down in the lobby. Overall, it wasn\u2019t terrible hotel but not like the typical business accommodations I\u2019m use to in the States. Also, I was female traveling alone on business and knew very little German (a few words) and it seemed to be a safe place to stay....I\u2019m hoping my next trip to Dreieich will be illness free so I can explore Frankfurt and Dreieich a little more.", "title": "Business Visit to Dreieich", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Daphne418", "date": "April 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 15386256, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location to airport/office/train station", "disliked": "\u2014 No iron/coffee/tea in room"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006", "text": "Some way out of Frankfurt, but ideal location for local companies nearby.
