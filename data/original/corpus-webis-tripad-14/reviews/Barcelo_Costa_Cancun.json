We booked through Vacation Express, and had selected the deluxe room option. This turned out to be a room with no view of the ocean at all, only the pool, and no balcony. The resort was full the first night so we had to stay in the deluxe room the first night, but we were allowed to switch the next day to a Junior Suite, which had a nice ocean view and a balcony. We were charged $20 additional per night to upgrade, but it was well worth it for the view. Our Jr. Suite was not as updated with marble floors, shower, etc as the deluxe room, but was more spacious. If booking again at this hotel, I would specify a renovated Junior Suite as it appears we just happened to be in an area of the building that didn't have some of the newer features that many rooms had.", "title": "Great Hotel, Great food..", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Vallejos", "date": "April 17, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4982698}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful Place", "text": "As for the food and drinks, we were very pleased.

The service was great with people to assist you with chairs and drinks. As many people have stated, the beach area is small and the volleyball area does take up a large portion of that space, but it worked out fine for us. The water in front of Gran Costa is very calm, but it isn't as quite the same brilliant turquoise color that it appears to be at other resorts further down into the hotel zone.
