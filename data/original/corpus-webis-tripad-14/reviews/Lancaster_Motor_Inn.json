My first impression of the lobby was that it was old and smelled \"funny\". The room was no better. It felt and smelled unclean. Even though it was in the non smoking section, it smelled smoky. We had neighbors on one side of us that smoked out in front of their room till about 10 p.m. and started up again the next morning at 6 a.m., even though we were supposedly on the no smoking side. The mattresses were uncomfortable and we were near the road, so every time a truck drove by, it woke us up. The bathroom was ridiculously tiny with the shower so small that it was difficult to lift my arms to wash my hair. The toilet was wedged between the sink and the shower wall. The restaurant was not open, due to a medical emergency and there were only two other places to eat in town. Our first morning there, we were awakened by our noisy neighbors on the other side (hunters~yuch) who started their diesel truck outside our uninsulated window and ran the engine from 5:30 ~6, while trying to hook up their trailer, frequently yelling \"Whoa, whoa\". I had to argue to get out of the third night's stay. I think the room made my asthma worse. I ended up getting a $43 refund, but had already booked another room at another motel.
