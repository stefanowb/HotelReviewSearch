To get wide awake I took the shower which resulted in a very wet wooden bathroom floor where we spotted some until now unknown fungus that apparently did love the wooden floor.

A very old building which has been gently renovated, maintaining the old charm but also modernized giving all the comfort! A wonderful entrance through a beautiful courtyard into a lovely reception area. We were warmly welcomed by the excellent staff. We had booked a Deluxe room with SLH but where upgraded to a Duplex on the third (top) floor. The room was recently refurbished (which I had requested after given such recommendation in other reviews) and it was top of the line! Downstairs a sofa (bed sofa), table, flat screen TV, bar and stereo. Several windows giving nice and light view. A smaller dressing room with plenty of clothing space. Next the modern and beautiful bathroom having 2 washbasins, bathtub and a separate shower with a rain shower. Great! Upstairs was the bedroom with small working desk, a built-in bookcase and another flat screen tv. Good size, very comfortable and lovely decorated. Since this the top floor, attic, the ceilings bended slightly and it was fitted with a skylight window. The whole Duplex was very comfortable, nice size and really cozy. Modern but yet with an older touch and charm. For instance, all lightening can be dimmed and skylight window has an electric curtain. The hotel doesn\u2019t have a restaurant (although 24 hours room service) but there are many excellent places to eat just outside the hotel. They have an \u201chonesty\u201d bar which is very charming and you get the feeling of being at home in your own living room. There is a breakfast room, a spa and a fitness room in the basement, none of which we managed to see, but no doubts in the same charming spirit as the rest of the hotel. One downside point: although accessible wireless internet in the room, it is not free of charge (must be changed!!!). Hotel offer free wireless in the \u201chonesty\u201d bar and use of stationary computer in separate room. As mentioned before, the staff is friendly, services minded and efficient. I have stayed several times at the Pavillion de la Reine on Place des Vosges which is one of my favorite places in Paris, both the hotel and the location. Relais Christine is now definitely another of my preferred hotels in Paris with a similar charm in the attractive St Germain area. Don\u2019t hesitate to go there!

It was my eighth trip to Paris and I had never stayed in a luxury hotel before. Pluses: I cannot imagine a better location, unless you are going to Paris for a very long stay. A block from the river (for sightseeing), Rue de Buci and Blvd St Germain (for eating and shopping) yet quiet--I mean pin-drop, like a tomb, quiet! I have never had a room in Paris which was so isolated from street noise. Room was tastefully outfitted, unlike some Paris rooms which seem to decorated within an inch of their lives; it had a lovely small balcony overlooking the courtyard, on the first floor. For our anniversary, the staff gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne. When we needed anything, like ice or directions, the hotel staff was obliging and speedy. The bathroom was excellent, with a long tub (I am tall, so I appreciated this.) Cons: the superior room was not huge for the money (300 E), although roomy enough for two chairs and desk. (I gather the classic rooms are smaller, and would not recommend them if that is true.) And we did not take the breakfast: 30E ($40) pp is a ridiculous price to pay when there are great cafes, boulangeries and patisseries literally around the corner on Rue de Buci (Carton is legendary), where you can get the best pastry of your life, or on St Andre des Arts where you can get juice, snacks, pizza, etc. You are paying only for convenience and fancy china.
