And I have to say, I think I'm glad that I didn't. I booked this hotel through AAA, and had no problem w/my reservation. The room was very clean. My only complaint w/the room is that the sleep timer on the tv did not work. The internet connection was excellent. I did not check out the free breakfast. The night staff who checked me in was not overly friendly, but by no means was he rude. The staff in the morning when I checked out was nice. I would stay here again if I end up back in Merrillville for business.", "title": "different experience", "user": "aunry79", "date": "April 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 15335850, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 a little pricey"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with family", "text": "First of all, BEWARE of Travelocity!
