Superb location and views. Covered walkway to metro and nearby shops. We ate out of the hotel with breakfast at a deli t the end of the walkway and dim sum and local restuarants cheap and plentiful. Nearby ex pat drinking and red light area not too seedy and local street markets next door worth the visit. Starline ferry a short walk and trams and buses nearby -its very easy to cover HK and Kowloon side. Use peak tram to get up and then walk round the corner for a bus back down to get the views and quicker exit. Stanley market not as cheap relatively (Primark t -shirts cheaper!) but plenty eating and drinking places and easy transport via No 6 bus. Allow plenty of time to get back from Aberdeen harbour via the tunnel as very busy.

Ubiquitous Filipino group sang bravely in a cavernous entrance area, which ruined any sound. Bar food was quick and fresh but tends to expensive as are drinks. Very much a business hotel (part of the HK Conference Centre) and lacks any atmosphere. Has a retro look of old style socialist hotels ie block shape, with marble but drab.
