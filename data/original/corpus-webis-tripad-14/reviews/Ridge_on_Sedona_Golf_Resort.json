Wonderful staff--we especially appreciated the help from the concierge in booking activities. Property is very nice, and the one-bedroom unit was plenty of room for three of us. Lots to do and see in the area, wonderful restaurants, and absolutely fantastic scenery. The distance from some of the most touristy stuff in town is actually nice, and except for road construction in Oak Creek it was easy to get around.

The entire \"check-in\" process and any interaction with resort personnel is focused on selling a timeshare - it's ridiculous. I can understand this kind of in-your-face sales tactics if you take one of those discount vacation packages that timeshare resorts offer specifically to sell you a timeshare - but these kinds of tactics for a couple using a timeshare week that they own is offensive. Once the personnel at the resort understood we were not interested in going on a sales tour, they completely lost interest in dealing with us as guests - questions about local area attractions and restaturants bascially went ignored. The accomodations leave something to be desired as well. While the 2 bedroom unit we had was clean, the furniture was pretty outdated and forget about trying to get extra toilet paper or tissues - we had to ask several times to get such a basic necessity. They clean units only once a week and do not change linens (I can't get too upset about that due to environmental benefits; especially using water in the desert); but in their zeal to clean our unit that one time while we were there, they igorned the do not disturb sign that my wife had put on the door and walked into the bathroom while she was showering. Despite the fact that the do not disturb sign was removed by mid to late morning, the cleaners did not come back until late evening and, even then, they did not clean the whole unit. Consistent with our experience, when we asked the front desk for someone to come back the next day to finish the job, we were told that we could pay a fee for them to come back even though they did not clean the whole unit to begin with. In sum, nice setting, nice golf course but guest interaction and service leaves a lot to be desired.", "title": "Worse Than Gnats", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "weemeeNewYork", "date": "December 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 12101515, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 setting", "disliked": "\u2014 guest interaction and services"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "My friend and I had requested a first floor room - none were available.

He lived up to his name - not saying hello but demanding that I move the car because he did not want to pull luggage that far (10 feet away). The sales pitches are intense here. Just be ready for it. We even overheard one of the manager s bragging about their policies one night as we were dining at the Oak Creek Brewery: the Sedona properties are the cash cows for Diamond Resorts and they a way to overcome any objection. This is high pressure, always be closing, sales territory.

I live in NY in a decent size apartment, with that being said...I stayed in a one bedroom at the Ridge. It was soooooo CLEAN and decorative! My favorite amenities were the fireplace, the stand up shower with great shower head, hot tub, huge closet space, dining room table, and breakfast counter top. THE VIEW from my room was of Bell Rock, and it was off the charts. The pool in front of my place was under construction, but hey if your not in Sedona to do a little walking your on the wrong vacation anyway. There was another pool by the registration desk. Yes there are people present who try to get you involved in a time share tour. Stick to your guns and keep saying \"no thank you.\" I mean arent' you are YOUR vacation, how people can actually get involved in something they don't want to do boggles my mind. There is a cleaning service that came once during my weeks stay, the place got even cleaner! Of course all the kitchen \"stuff\" was there, I could have had a sit down dinner for 12 if I wanted. There were an ample supply of towels. I called for dishwasher detergent and they brought it right away. The gym equipment was great, I brought one of their mats out by the pool to do yoga, and no one said anything. There were always front desk people there to help with room stuff. I did call the concierge to help me go on one tour, she was SO annoying. I was calling to definitely book something and she went into sales mode right away.
