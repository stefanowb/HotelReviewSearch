After a long rainy drive, we finally reached our destination hotel and were pleasantly surprised. While the Baeckeralm is a little further from the center of Mittenwald than expected, it provided a quiet escape and breathtaking views of the surrounding German Alps. Our hosts were more than accomodating and kind. They even offered extra advice on some special events for that weekend to include the annual parade of the goats from the mountains into the town of Mittenwald -- adorable! -- and a free cable car ride one evening on one of the nearby peaks in Austria. Both events were things we may have otherwised missed altogether. The breakfast was good, healthy, and plentiful - a typical German B&B spread. Our only complaint was that we couldn't stay longer in Bavaria. If you're looking for a quiet place to enjoy and explore the region without the touristy-traps of Garmisch, etc., stay here. Also -- take the owner's recommendation of a restaurant in the nearby town of Klais (if memory serves). It was very good and very popular with the locals.", "title": "a most pleasant stay", "user": "viajeritos", "date": "August 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 39128964}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "It has been a year since we had the great pleasure of meeting Inglof and Heidi in their home.
