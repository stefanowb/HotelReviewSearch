It would easily hold 6 people but could probably do more with the couches. It was large, well decorated, and very comfortable. We also tried the sauna. We are new to that so it was quite hot for us but if you are used to that it was very well laid out with a shower outside the sauna. The hosts, Mauno and Kaarina were fantastic. Very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast which had enough food to feed any army. Kaarina baked some of the bread. She also took the time to explain what everything was and what was part of a traditional Finnish breakfast. Mauno guided us at night back to the cottage since it was dark for part of the path. They also have wifi which worked faster than anywhere else on our trip. It is off the road a bit but well worth the trip. Using the GPS coordinates helped us find our way best. Would happily return here.", "title": "Cottage is great for large groups", "user": "SJNK", "date": "September 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141703227}], "location": {"country": "Finland", "region": "Southern Finland", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Huuvari"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 3}, "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "Situated just north of Porvoo, Abborsj\u00f6 B&B offers a variety of rooms in a cozy Southern Finnish countryside environment, on the shore of small lake Abborsj\u00f6."}
