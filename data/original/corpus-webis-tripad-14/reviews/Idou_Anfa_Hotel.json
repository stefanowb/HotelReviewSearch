The rooms are small and ordinary, with mine containing two single beds. I wasn't asked if I wanted a double or larger, so I'm not sure they are even available. A colleague of mine and her husband had to push the two beds together in order to sleep in any proximity to each other. My biggest complaint about the bed, notwithstanding the size, was that the mattresses on the beds are extremely hard and uncomfortable.

Unfriendly, impersonal and very, very noisy in a streetfront room. The view of the Mosque was the only redeeming feature. Within a couple of minutes of checking in, we had a visit from the Security Manager accusing us of having a fire in our room, which was in fact our water boiler! He made us unplug this, so we did so and then plugged it back in when he left. The previous 3 nights we had stayed at the Hotel Maamoura, which was a 3rd of the price and brilliant, and in a more central location. Everything previous reviewers have said about the staff is very true. The breakfast was very good, but we would rather have had a peaceful nights sleep!

The hotel itself is of a very low quality, the rooms are very shabby and old, it needs renovation. The airconditioning was only set on low and we had to chance our room to move up a few floors (where apparently the renovated rooms are) to be able to get the room with enough AC to feel comfortable in the 40 degree heat. The bar on the top floor was a highlight. There is entertainment there every night and we didn't see any tourists there, but only the locals. It was fun to sit and observe everyone and listen to a very talented singer. The location of the hotel is also not the best.
