It is indeed a great hotel and deserves its five-star ranking. However one thing I want to point out is that it should be prepared for \"rainy\" days. During two of the seven days we stayed there, rain was pouring down non stop for more than 48 hours. No one could go out to the beach or the outside pools, and the hotel was not equipped with enough indoor facilities to entertain its guests. Even though they opened a room in the lobby to let young children get engaged in activities like video games, there was just not enough. The two billard tables always had people lined up waiting for their turns. I hope this does not happen very often and the hotel will increase its indoor entertainment facilities. Another problem that we encountered was that the hotel employees were nice and friendly but very slow paced. We checked in after midnight because of our late flight arrival. We had to sit in the empty lobby with two tired kids for at least 45 minutes before the checkin process was completed. Service at the restaurants was also quite slow. I thought probably the hotel was intentionally being slow as they were trying to deliver a message: you are on vacation, what's the rush?", "title": "A nice hotel but should be prepared for rainy days", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "atwater5122", "date": "January 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 12400156, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beach", "disliked": "\u2014 Slowness"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I have to say that our experience at the Westin over New Year was very different to some of the reviews on this site.
