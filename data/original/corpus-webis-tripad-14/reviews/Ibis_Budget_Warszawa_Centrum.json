The hotel is in a residential area but only a brisk 20 minute walk into the old town and about 10 minutes walk from Lazienki Park. Around the hotel are several convenience stores and deli's where you can get supplies for your room if you need them. The hotel itself was spotlessly clean in both the bedroom and communal areas. The room although small was modern and sufficiently equipped for a city break. Linen was changed regularly and we had fresh towels every day. It was also lovey and warm after being out in the Warsaw freeze. There was an interesting and informative tv station about Warsaw with tips for sightseeing and so on which we found really useful. We didn't know until we watched it that you can be fined for jay walking in Warsaw! The only downside to the room would be that if you are not particularly close to your companion it may be a little awkward. I haven't seen a twin room but in the double the shower opens directly into the bedroom and has only a frosted glass door. This was fine for us as i travelled with my husband but may not be ideal for families or companions who prefer a bit of privacy in the shower! We didn't try breakfast in the hotel but went down one morning for a look and found the selection to be somewhat limited. That said if cereal and toast would be enough for you then it would be ok. We made use of the vending machines in the foyer for snacks and drinks. There was also a coffee machine although it was out of order on our visit.
