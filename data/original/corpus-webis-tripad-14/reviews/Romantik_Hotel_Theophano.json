The hotel itself is a beautifully renovated medieval building and its owners have managed to capture its historic flair in the tastefully decorated rooms. Our room had a four poster bed, TV, telephone and a modern bathroom. We paid Euro 120 for one night, which included a good breakfast. If you have trouble with stairs, this hotel might not be right for you. In order to retain its historic character, the hotel does not have an elevator.", "title": "Historic Hotel in City Center", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "LizzyBennett12", "date": "June 12, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3545280}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "That's \"Romantik\" for you", "text": "On our return trip to Norway (from France) we decided for at detour to the remote village of Quedlinburg in the old East Germany.
