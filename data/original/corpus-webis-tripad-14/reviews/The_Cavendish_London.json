Great views from the top floors. The hotel is contemporary, stylish and clean. My room was very comfortable and the bath was huge. Staff was great. Always able to answer questions. Breakfast was ok but only because it was included in the rate. Location is wonderful, even with nearby tube stobs shut down.

It was more money than we wanted to spend, but we loved it. Super sleek and cool. The staff was young, hip, friendly, and helpful. Small room, but very clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable and they had a great stereo in the room. Perfectly located, we walked so many places and its only 3 minutes from a Tube stop. Breakfast in the morning was very nice.

The location is great, the rooms are stylish, the staff friendly (although as is usual in London very young and inexperienced. Someone asked where the Royal Academy was and neither person on reception had any idea. It is a huge prominent building about 50 metres away!).", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 24, 2005", "id": 3299277}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "very stylish", "text": "I would certainly recommend the hotel. One minor downside, in an attempt to be trendy they have dispensed with the usual suits and ties. I like staff to be smart and prefer the traditional look but if people want something new that's fine but dressing the staff in what look like white jogging bottoms looks absolutely terrible and gives a very unprofessional image.
