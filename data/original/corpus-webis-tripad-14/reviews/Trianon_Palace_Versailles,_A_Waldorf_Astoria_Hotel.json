Put simply, this hotel was not central to anything, people were not helpful and very rude (except the concierge who was probably the sweetest lady ever!), and I found a cockroach in the lobby. It was beautiful but not worth the money. We asked for a double bed and instead they pushed two singles together. We noticed this quite often on our journey but for $900.00 a night you think they would manage to be able to have a double bed! Again the main inconvenience was the location. It was a 1 hour long trip to Paris by train and although Versailles was nice I would recommend for no one to bother doing a over night trip there. There is not much to see besides the Palace.Also the food was very far away and everything closes very early. We found ourselves wishing we had stayed in Paris at Hotel innova which was much cheaper (this is where we stayed the previous two nights we had been there).Overall this hotel was just not worth the money especially for the long trip into Paris.

The location can't be beat, right next to the gate of the Palace grounds. We went in winter which was nice because it was not crowded and strolling around the palace and gardens was easy. The hotel is quite historic in its own right, as the Treaty of Versailles was negotiated there. The meal we had at Gordon Ramsay au Trianon was better than Le Jules Verne in the Eiffel Tower (Alain Ducasse) or Michael Mina's in the Bellagio - a treat from start to finish!
