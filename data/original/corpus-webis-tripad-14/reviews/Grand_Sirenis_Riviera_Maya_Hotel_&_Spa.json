Well, first of all, the shuttle took over 2 and a half hours to get to our resort which was too long for us. Especially for us who arrived in Cancun at 9pm, we didn't end up arriving at the resort till after 1130! The check-in was not too bad. We all received a welcome drink which was a nice gesture. The first night we arrived, it was pretty chilly so make sure you bring a light sweater. We wanted to go back to the room to freshen up before we went to the buffet to eat something but they told us that the bags wouldn't arrive in our room for at least another half an hour so we decided to go up to check out the food selection. When we arrived at the buffet, there wasn't a huge selection of food. We had to wait for the chef to make some pasta and some pizza for us. Overall, the food is quite salty so be prepared to drink lots of water or alcoholic beverages.", "title": "hmmmm", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "aycecalgary", "date": "December 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 89392441}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Rooms:", "title": "The best trip I have ever taken", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "fonda1818", "date": "December 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 89372726}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The rooms were amazing big.

The beach was amazing. As were the iguanas. The pools were great and the mixed drinks were awesome. Not watered down at all like I read in another review. Maybe the staff felt those people had already had enough? Ours were a little strong on occasion. We had a good time walking the grounds and on the lazy river. The view from our balcony was spectacular! We got upgraded to an ocean view upon arrival. Sweet. The whole $100 gift certificate thing seems like a scam though. It's for couples and they want you to attend a presentation about their travel club. They have hotels in different areas and with their club you save slightly and get a few perks. Assuming you only go to their resorts. All in all, I would go back. It's very clean and it's a great family oriented resort.

When we complained they did nothing to fix the problem...Instead someone came to wipe down the walls at 9pm in the evening when we were trying to sleep. Then we were told we could only eat at 1 of the restaurants because we were only there for 3 days, this seemed a little dumb. The food was not that good for the rating it was given by apple vacation, who we book the trip. Then the night before we leave we get a letter, most likely because we complained about the room, that we need to schedule our bag pick up time at the concierge desk and we would receive $100 towards our bill. When we go to schedule our bag pick up, they said $100 was for couples only. Yet if they would have noticed we were all girls and check in under different names in the same room. They didn't seem to care about that mistake either. Now the positives....the general staff and bar staff were very nice and friendly. The spa was very clean and worth the time. The beach was very close, clean and nice. So if you are on a budget and dont care about food, or sleeping in a musty room then its ok.

When we went for our resort briefing with Transat just after booking with Best Day they discouraged and alluded to possible problems and scams with signing with Best Day ... this made us worried seeing we already paid to go and could nto get our money back. Our only complaint with Best Day was before we went to Tulum we got taken to Lapis (a jewelery store) and this was not on the agenda nor of any interest to us. We wanted to see Tulum and not buy jewelery. Our second day trip we booked with Transat .... not impressed with them at all! 1st complaint was that they did not have enough cash to give us back our change and said they would give it to us later .... we never saw it. 2nd complaint was once we arrived to Xcaret we had to wait at least an hour and a half before we could go into the park because we had to wait for another bus to arrive and then the guide tried selling us camera's and suncreen then wait for him to go pick up the wristbands, coming home we had to go to several other resorts to do drop offs.
