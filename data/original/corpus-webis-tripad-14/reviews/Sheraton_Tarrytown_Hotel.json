It is a beautiful hotel, very well run, very well kept, and incredibly well priced. The rooms and baths were very spacious and well appointed. We also asked for a small refrigerator which was delivered within 10 minutes of check-in, and no additional charges were made for its use. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning, and had dinner in the dining room one evening, as well. The service and food were both excellent. We also appreciated the friendly, helpful staff and the free use of computers in the lobby. Their evening coffee and sweet treats table were also enjoyed by the guests. We cannot think of a better place to stay in this area of New York.

The staff is untrained there is absolutely no communication between management and staff. We stayed over for New Years and booked the club level. I called in the a.m. to request a frigate and asked if they were available on the club floor (which is what we booked) and were told very non-chalet that the club floor was closed. I asked why and was told they were renovating the club floor this is a new property so that didn't make sense. I called to speak with the manger Tony Trusty who was not in .The inexperienced clerk said there was no manager on staff till later that day I called the Sheraton 800# to ask why we booked a room with amenities on the club lounge and the hotel was not honoring it? I eventually spoke with the general Manager Tony Trusty and was told he made the decision to close the club floor for lack of staff and basically not enough business in the hotel to warrant it. I guess the 6 rooms we booked and my family was not special enough to put him through the trouble. I told him how displeased I was and he eventually lowered our rate by $10 WOW! My initial rate was $159 on the club floor with champagne hors-deuvers continental breakfast and access to the club lounge to meet for our gathering. Tony Trusty said he would offer us a small space near the restaurant where we could gather. I was told by several desk clerks that the amenities would be the same. Tony trusty said he wanted our stay to be a nice experience and I trusted his word. Upon check in our rooms reservations confused the staff; there was no champagne no hors-deuvers ok so we let it slide. We did use the room to gather we were served food from the restaurant and all four of us (4 families) were overcharged on the bill. I had two martinis but I wasn't drunk enough to pay $49 for my $16 salad all four bills were padded which is a shame and I hope they were honest mistakes. The next day on my sister\u2019s hotel charge they added gratuity to her bill and she had given a very generous cash tip being it was New Years. The Hotel also overcharged her on her room rate. Fast forward to the next morning I was asleep when I was awoke by my sister who said the Hotel was charging her for breakfast I called down and Jaimie was helpful she said things were confusing and we were suppose to get vouchers but our rate didn't reflect it ect. ect. 5 more people from our party went down to eat and the hotel would not honor the complimentary continental breakfast. I tried to speak with a manager (no one on site again) Chade a staff member basically told me no. I told her to call Tony Trusty who would honor this obvious mistake on the hotels part. Tony called me and basically said there was nothing he could do as the manager and we conversed (argued) for 15 minutes. He said he gets these calls all the time.....I said maybe you are not up par with so many complaints. With no resolve I told him he was not honoring the amenities we were due....no continental breakfast was prepared for our party and they were not offering us an alternative. What a shame such a new hotel is run so poorly and no communication between the staff and management (when there around). I told Tony Trusty I would let the Sheraton headquarters know he was running the hotel less than Sheraton standards and he said it was a waste of my time to complain because he makes the ultimate decision. I hope the Sheraton corporate headquarters will take my complaint seriously. I plan to call first thing tomorrow and let them know there hotel is being run by an incompetent. Tony trusty did have his staff member Jamie call later and say she was giving me Sheraton points and a late check out. I believe he threw this in so he could tell headquarters he took care of me, this is a failed attempt. To start off the New Year with an argument with a hotel manager is bad business for the Sheraton; obviously Tony Trusts never heard the expression the customer is always right.", "title": "Poorly trained staff.

The rooms are quite nice but we have noticed each time that the hotel suffers from a lack of professional management and staff. We checked in at 11 PM on a Saturday and had obtained a $119 non-refundable rate on the Starwood website. Our reservation was for a club-floor room, which we know provides no benefit when staying over the weekend since the club lounge is closed. (In fact, there is a detriment since the club floor has no public ice machine). The elevator requires a room key to be swiped for access to the club floor. (We knew this from previous stays; the desk clerk did not mention it). Our key did not work and so we returned to the front desk for the keys to be re-programmed. The key failed to work after re-programming so we returned to the front desk again. The desk clerk consulted with another staff member in re-programming the key and it worked the third time. We requested a non-adjoining room and were assured that the assigned room (614) was not adjoining. In fact, it was. When I called the front desk from the room to report this fact, the second desk clerk insisted that the room was not an adjoining room (even though I told her there was a door to the adjacent room).
