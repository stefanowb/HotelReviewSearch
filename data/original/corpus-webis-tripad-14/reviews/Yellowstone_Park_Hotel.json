We were not disappointed, the hotel put us on the top floor at the very end of the property in room 327 and indeed the room was very quiet. Our room is in good repair with relatively new clean carpet and two very comfortable queen beds. The room has a thermostat connected to a wall unit that provides both heating and AC. We only used the AC and it works fine. The bathroom has a standard tub/shower. No frills here, it is a molded plastic unit for both tub and shower \u2013 but completely functional with reasonable water pressure and hot water. The bathroom has a vent that goes on with the light so steam is easily cleared from the bathroom.

Not a lot of amenities but clean place to rest up. Be sure to watch IMAX film on Yellowstone b4 going in, $4 Matinee for 1st two A.M. shows & $6 for other shows. Buy gifts inside Yellowstone because price is same but 100% of proceeds goes to the park when bought inside. Be sure to pick up Y.Stone park paper at area stores to see times of Ranger guided tours & talks,very good. If Horseback riding is your thing, ride 28 miles south on hwy 20 to Herriman State Park. www.dryridge.com 1/2 day was $55 and trails are fantastic! Forest, streams, mountains, & lush valley with Elk viewing. Diamond P is closer to w.Yellowstone but a little more money and 45 min. flat ride to get to mountain scenery. Nice people too, but worth the trip to Herriman State Park. Just south of the park off hwy 20 is a scenic route thru mountains called Mesa Falls, many lookout photo opps. worth the trip! If Trout fishing is your thing, there is a historical inn called Macs on hwy 20 on the way to Herrimans, where people rented hotel syle rooms & small cabins right on the river. I went in to look, rooms started about $70 a nt. cabins $100, but you could walk out of your door and see the trout swimming in the river! You can keep the trout you catch just buy a license. By Herrimans Park the river there is catch & release. The Anlers Lodge there is Beautiful but a little pricey...our anniversary meal we had there at the restaurant was good and very romantic by the river. We also visited Teton Ntnl Park as $25 Park admission is good for 7 days at both. Super 8 in Driggs is good value $60 but tough going over the mountains to Jackson Hole...The hotels in Jackson Hole are too pricey $130+ for rooms you get in West Y.S. for 1/2 the price. In Alpine, just about 40 miles south of J.H., Flying Saddle Resort is about $70 a nt. and have nice rooms and ranch style atmosphere, worth the drive if going back a 2nd day to Teton Ntnl Park or heading out the next morning after a long day in the park. In Jackson Hole there is a Dollar store which has all the yellowstone suveneirs for $1 each rather than $4 each in the parks.
