We paid $130 per night. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Seine river on the 29th floor after informing the staff that we don't want to stay on the 31st floor. The room was very clean,modern and good size (bigger than your average parisian hotel room). The staff were very helpful and speaks english. The only let down was the iron & board which you have to hire. Eiffel tower was only 15 minutes walk from the hotel and there's a supermarket & few brasseries closeby.The concierge named Domonique recommended to us an elegant & historic french restaurant called La Procope founded in 1686 & where Chopin, Bonaparte etc.. dined! The food was wonderful & the place is surrounded by historical facts & items!", "title": "A definite 4 star hotel - clean & modern hotel and good customer service", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "christy74", "date": "December 1, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 2857446}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "This hotel is in sort of an ugly neighborhood in a 1970's building. In addition, the room that was provided to us was substandard. I booked this through priceline and it seems as if they maintain a different and worse inventory of rooms for pricline customers. The room smelled and the carpet had nasty stains on it. In addition, the bathroom was some odd japanese deal from the early 1970's This hotel used to be the NIkko Hotel in Paris. The Novotel has not redone some of its rooms. Be very cautious when booking this hotel.
