Most historic towns that I have visited have at least a few old houses, etc. As far as I could tell, Medora exists almost entirely for tourism, and a large majority of the tourist accommodations (motels, restaurants, shows, campgrounds) are run by a single entitty. True it was an historic town with a long history, but it appears to have been totally, completely reinvented without any of the old time residents around. Many of the folks who work there are summer employees (college students, senior volunteers, young folks from abroad), rather than town residents. It was so odd I looked it up in the Census, and Medora truly only has 51 households and about 100 total residents. I guess that's what explains the lack of grocery stores or other non-touristy stores. The Badlands Motel is the largest accommodation in town (and owned by the same organization), and it almost seems like the motel theme park for the town of Medora.", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "coolmoan", "date": "September 27, 2005", "id": 3944269}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2004", "text": "This lack of residents was a little disconcerting, but it also makes for a lovely vacation. From the Badlands Motel, situated right next to the Badlands themselves, you can walk the entire 3 or 4 blocks of town at virtually any time of the night.

It is a refreshing change from almost every other small town in the USA, to not see McDonalds and DQ.. We went to the pizza joint, and ate breakfast at one of the 3 coffee shops (both owned by the nonprofit). The restaurants were not cheap, but not outreageous either.

I highly recommend that but the Pitch Fork Fondue was only so so. Biggest problem is after the fondue there is an hour and a half wait before the musical starts - hard with little kids.

We were on our way from Yellowstone to Mpls. It was a good experience; they have a nice outdoor pool and a wonderful miniature golf course. The kids LOVED the place. The motel room was old but well kept. It had cable TV, and plenty of hot water for all of us. The motel stands at the base of the Badlands, which provides an impressive backdrop. The entire town of Medora was extremely friendly and made us feel comfortable even though we were just passing through. The only negatives I encountered were as follows: 1) They placed us in a room at the motel that was away from the center area so we had more privacy & less traffic - BUT we were right next to some train tracks. And there seemed to be about 1 train per hour that screamed through there, blasting its whistle. I slept very poorly, due to that, & if I'd been planning on staying more than one night I would've insisted on a different room (closer to the pool & the office, and away from the train tracks).2) It's a little bit tough to find a place to eat after 8 pm on a weeknight. There are no fast food places in Medora, which is OK, I just wish I'd realized it ahead of time. All in all, however, it was a great experience and I would definately recommend the Badlands Motel to anyone looking for a friendly, comfortable place to stay in this attractive area of ND.", "helpfulness": 34, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 16, 2003", "id": 857905}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Medora"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 28, "very good": 21, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 14}, "aka": "Badlands Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.75}
