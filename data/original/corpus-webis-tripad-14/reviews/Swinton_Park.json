I am pleased to say that Swinton Park has not lost its magic.Such a beautiful place that gives you the feeling that you have stepped straight into a fairy-tale. Prior to lunch we relaxed in the grand surroundings of the drawing room until we were ushered through to Samuels\u2019s restaurant for our three course Sunday lunch. We had our wedding breakfast in this stunning room and it fetched back lots of lovely memories. Just like we remembered, the food was exceptional and the service from the staff at Swinton Park has to be one of the best we have ever come across. After our lunch we went for a walk around the beautiful grounds. We borrowed some boots and a raincoat that are kept in the cloakroom for guests. If you want to feel like royalty for a day/weekend then this is the place to come. Having taken the castle exclusively for our wedding back in 2011, I can also vouch for the quality of the rooms - AMAZING. If you are after a bit of something special then stay in the Turret Suite which is across three floors.A three course Sunday lunch costs \u00a328 per person and in my opinion is definitely worth the money as the food is of the highest quality.We will definitely be returning on a more regular basis.", "user": "Wilson689", "date": "September 14, 2013", "id": 177152123}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A fairytale retreat", "text": "This was our first night away since having our son in May and was a special treat for our 6th wedding anniversary. I had always wanted to try this hotel since seeing it on The Syndicate last year and it didn't disappoint. From the moment you drive through the gates and see the red-ivory clad tower you know you are in a very special place. We loved every minute of our (too-brief) overnight stay here. With 31 bedrooms this is a reasonably sizeable hotel but you wouldn't know it as you are treated as though you are a VIP - when we arrived in our room there was a hand-written card and box of chocolates on the bed to say Happy Anniversary. It is small touches like this that really make you want to return - the service really is superlative. The room we had was beautifully decorated with views over the parkland...we could see swans gliding down the river. Again lovely little touches like homemade shortbread and complimentary gin and whiskey just make the place extra-special. The food in the restaurant is gorgeous and the atmosphere whilst formal is not stuffy. Drinks before and after in the drawing room are the icing on the cake. A walk in the extensive grounds around the lakes is the perfect cure to blow away the cobwebs from dinner the night before. Given the extent of the grounds, the Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom and the ginormous, comfy beds, there is little need to watch TV but if you were planning on a TV session this is the only time you may be disappointed as the choice of channels is limited and reception not brilliant. This truly is a wonderful place to stay - we loved every minute and felt more like invited guests at a country house rather than paying guests in a commercial hotel.

It's grand and homely at the same time - beautifully stylish, but never pretentious. The grounds are magnificent and frankly I would have been happy never to leave them - although with the splendour of the Yorkshire Dales all around, that would have been a shame. It's possible to walk for hours, whether it's around the lakes - the one nearest to the hotel is truly idyllic, and inhabited by a number of ducks, moorhens and a pair of swans with four cygnets - and the deer park, or in the marvellously wild and magical walled garden - or just find a sunny spot and read a book whilst contemplating the superb views. We enjoyed a fantastic owl experience with the resident falconry expert Sophie, and our children were able to go pony trekking round the Swinton estate. The bedrooms were without doubt some of the best we have ever enjoyed in an hotel - real five-star luxury, with no detail overlooked. The Semerwater family suite is beautiful and appears to have been newly refurbished - the bathroom was exceptional, especially the bath for two which was more like a plunge pool! I tried hard to think if anything had been forgotten but everything is here - even an iron and ironing board, and cafetieres to make proper coffee. Even the teabags were Yorkshire Tea! Housekeeping standards are excellent. Our children even received super (and very high quality) age-appropriate activity packs on their arrival - this is one luxury hotel which genuinely welcomes children. The food: well, it's equally wonderful. A great choice of items at breakfast - a good selection of dishes at lunchtime, should you choose to lunch there - and in the evening both the Classic menu and the signature Tasting menu are proof of the chef's delicious creative skills. Perhaps the bar is the only slight disappointment; although it's in a handsome room it is somehow a little lacking in atmosphere and when my husband turned up one evening just before six it was unstaffed. Unusually for an hotel of this calibre there isn't a comprehensive cocktail list, just a rather sparse and slightly dull list of 'pre-dinner' aperitifs and 'after-dinner' drinks. The barman did make me a great mojito when asked and I'm sure they would be more than capable of rustling up a wide variety of interesting cocktails - I do wonder if the apparent lack of choice puts some residents off using the bar, as most people seemed to prefer to use the drawing room for drinks both before and after dinner. I feel there is potential there which isn't being explored. Anyway: that is a very, very minor quibble; overall this is an amazing hotel, relaxed and friendly yet offering the highest standard of service.

Add on the fact that you are staying in a castle in Yorkshire and the grounds/ambiance of a working estate, and you really cannot beat it. Also highly recommend the falconry.

The staff are a credit to the hotel. Everyone from the cleaners to restaurant manager and staff made us feel truly welcome and at home. They always had a smile on their faces.
