From the moment Fanes picked us up at the airport we were made to feel very welcome. The hotel is in a great location, 3 minutes walk to the main bus stop, close to a supermarket, right at the start of the Caldera walk. Fanes recommended a few restaurants, the best ones being Naoussa in thira and katrina taverna in Ammoydi. Watch the sunset in Oia then go down to the delightful harbour and enjoy some great seafood. The beaches in santorini arent particularly good, we spent most of our time at Perissa which didnt have any rocks. Prices vary a lot on the island - \u20ac2 for a gyros was cheap i thought, through to \u20ac7 for a pint of beer! and i though London was expensive! Beware the 2 for 1 cocktail deals - they are a rip off, worst cocktails I have ever had. Nikolas was also worth a meal, quite cheap but tasty food, you will have to queue in peak times though. Only complaint about aroma suites was we though the bed wasnt particularly comfortable and 1 thin pillow each is not enough. The suites are cute and quaint, but not 5 star luxury by any means. You do get your own balcony with amazing views though, and the price compares favourably to other properties.

I can't say anything bad about this hotel or Fanes. He really did a good job on welcoming us and teaching us where to go or where to eat.
