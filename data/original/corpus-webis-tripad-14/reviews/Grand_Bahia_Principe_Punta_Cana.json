We even had a map and would show them where we wanted to go and it took us 1and a half hours to find our room and in the meantime we tried to laugh it off and they were quite ignorant. After a week and a half on our vacation we met up with some people who had been to a bahia principe resort before so they were telling us about the rewards of being a repeat customer.This was also our second year in a row at bahia principe resort. anyway these people were given a beautiful fruit basket, upgraded to a different room closer to the beach, a bottle of rum in their room and t-shirts, as well as late checkout, free internet use as well as being able to go to pretty much any restaurant and pool on the resort with a certain bracelet.. Once we found this out we went to customer service to inquire as we had already paid 45.00 on internet at the internet cafe(which we hoped we could get reimbursed for as they were supposed to have asked us when we checked in if we had ever been to their resorts before), and we figured we should get what we were entitled to . They did agree that we should get this stuff but it took the whole four days that we had left to get what we were supposed to and it was a fight to get it. We got a 125 ml bottle of rum(which is cheaper than water there), 2 t-shirts that were stretched out of shape and would not have fit a 5 year old yet they were supposedly an extra large,(garbage t-shirts for a high end resort like this) , our fruit basket was a plate with 2 brown bananas, an apple, a lime as hard as a baseball, and an orange that had no juice in it at all,(disgusting, we did not even touch any of it) We had some other problems with our keys and being locked out of our room ,someone in our room when they should not have been, trouble with our excursion people on the resort,(our signature reps ,who are supposedly there to help you when you have problems.) Any time they saw us coming they would give us dirty looks and not be helpful or friendly at all and would make us feel as though we were wasting their time to the point of being very uncomfortable around them. After all these problems we were promised (as some kind of retribution or favor)that on our day of departure ; we could have a late checkout.Even though we were promised that about 4 times at least from different people that we talked to ; on the day we were to leave we got locked out of our room and had to run around trying to get back in at the last minute to round up our things. All these hassles put a bad taste in our mouths. We spent alot of money to go there and this was how we got treated. I have since tried to write to them and contact them and they take no responsibility. We had stayed in the same resort in the Mayan Riviera and were very happy with the staff and how friendly they were.

On past trips to Punta Cana we did the Outback Safari, the Saona Island catamaran tour, Marinarium tour, and their zipline tour. I would highly recommend all of these to those who have not done them. If you are looking for good Larimar jewelry for a decent price, look for Alexes on the beach. He works with the GBP resort, will have their beige property shirt on, with his name on it. He will have a tray, with the items on it, and they are nice, and he does not pressure you to buy.", "title": "Breathtaking", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Terralovely", "date": "April 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 128430468}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We enjoyed this resort very much.
