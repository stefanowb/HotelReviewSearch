A nice buffet breakfast was included too. The rooms were very large, the A/C worked great and mine had a hammock and hot tub on the deck.

We were delighted with our stay and highly recommend it as the ideal place to stay in Manuel Antonio for beauty and relaxation. We spent far more time at the hotel than we'd expected to, since it was so pleasant there. Leisurely breakfasts followed by poolside lounging and afternoons at the beach became our routine.

It's situated at the top of a hill and looks directly out to the crescent-shaped Manuel Antonio park and beach. The staff there seem to bank on this view alone as the service is attentive but very impersonal. The check-in desk failed to even give us a brief overview of the property and we didn't learn until the last day that they offered a free shuttle. The map that they give you of the area is deceiving as it seems that the beach is just a short walk, but in actuality it's a solid 20 minutes and is strenuous as it is on a road that is rocky and at least a 60 degree incline at times. The best and most economical way of getting back and forth to the beach is taking the public bus which stops just a short walk in front of the hotel. The fee is only 250 colones and runs rather frequently. The breakfast at the hotel is okay, pretty run of the mill, but it's free so you really can't complain. Overall there are parts of the hotel that seem pretty dated and other areas that seem like they have recently been updated. The juxtaposition of the two do give off a sense of tackiness at times. The rooms are big and most have a balcony, the mattresses are a little flimsy and could definately use a renovation to modernize the rooms.

Then took me into the kitchen and showed it to me. Lobsters, huge prawns, mahi, tuna. Table was all decorated, and right at the edge of the terrace. It looks like you are hanging over the ocean. Lester was a great waiter and bartender. We ate at a few other nearby places while we were there but always ended up saying we should have eaten at our own place.
