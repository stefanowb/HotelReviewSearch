Booked on line and thought the rate very reasonable. Upon check in were shown to a rather small room but when we queried this the duty manager upgraded us to a spacious family room for no extra charge. As others have noted the style of the decor is a little dated, but our room and all the communal areas were spotlessly clean. In our room the shower was fine, though it was sited over the bath. They include a couple of complimentary bottles of water along with the usual tea and coffee which was a nice touch. Parking on site is free and the staff throughout were really friendly. Buffet breakfast was lovely, too. We used the bus (\u00a31.40) to get into town, though the hotel is situated maybe 10 mins wak from bars and shops at Morningside. We dined at the next door pub/bistro one evening which was very reasonably priced. We will definitely stay again when we are in Edinburgh.", "title": "Lovely hotel, great staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mark5001", "date": "September 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 139237516}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Booked 6 nights B&B in April here as we wanted to go to the Fringe(first time) .The receptionist was great and we we were given a family room (asked for a double) that had plenty of room, nice bathroom and great view.
