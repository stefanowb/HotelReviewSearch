My wife wanted to see the resort, so we walked up to the front desk and told them we would like to see the room and the beach because we heard that Tripadvisor reviewers had given this place not so good reviews. She had heard that and she called Ignacio to give us a tour. Ignacio, along with the front desk lady, were super helpful and very friendly. Ignacio showed us our room, a third floor room overlooking the gulf. This was an awesome view looking over the trees and out to the blue water and islands. If you want a good view, definitely request a third or fourth floor room. Otherwise, you will be looking onto the jungle on the first and second floor. We decided to take the room. The cost was 200 dollars but no parking or resort fees, so that was not a bad deal, given the view and the large room. Yes, the hotel is quite dated, but it has great ambiance. With the keys jungle surrounding it, we felt like we were more in Costa Rica or Panama than in the US. The room was clean for the most part and the beds were very comfortable.

It's a typical Beach hotel need I say more. With that said the rest we love. We love the BEACH and yes it actually HAS a Beach it's Key Largo. We get beach chairs and towels whenever we stay, we like that you can get Kayaks and SeaDos right off the Beach. A PingPong table under the trees, typical kids games Hilton Style, little Bar at the beach. Also the kids love the Pool with the waterfalls and it was a shame that we didn't see all the Iguanas walking around the pool area that we did last time. Also, you are close to all the restaurants in the area. It would be great if you always received one of the top floors when you checked in to have those great sunsets. Sometimes we luck out and get them other times we don't and even my husbands Hilton Honor Gold status can't move you when all those rooms are occupied. This last time we had a big Hedge as our view. Bummer, but the year before the sunsets were GORGEOUS. Overall it's a great Beach Hotel if you are prepared for what it is. Yes it would be lovely if it was renovated but I don't see that coming soon. We do go to the restaurant for the FREE breakfast (again b/c of his Hilton Status) we don't go to their restaurants otherwise. We like to go to all the local restaurants while traveling anyway.
