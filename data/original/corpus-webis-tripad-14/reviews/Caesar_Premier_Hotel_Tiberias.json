It would have been my last choice. The service in the dining room was non-existent. Want coffee? Find the coffee pot and pour it yourself because the wait staff will ignore you. Expect a clean dining room? Forget it because you will find dead cockroaches on the floor, which begs the question: what is the kitchen/food prep area like? Concerned about avian flu? Too bad because you get to sit in the dining hall and watch the swallows fly all over the room and land right on the breakfast rolls and start pecking away for their own meal. Oh, and be sure to watch where the birds sit on the curtain rods above the windows because they like to use it as a poop spot, and if they are over your head.....Not only that, they like to land on the rim of the coffee creamers and stick their beaks in the cream! Want a quiet night's rest? Forget it because the roar of the vacuum cleaner is going to waft out the open windows of the dining room at midnight for an hour and make sleep impossible!

The room was hot and stuff. The carpet in the room was worn out. You have to go to the bar to use the internet at $18.00 a day. The pool closes at 5 p.m. This is when the tour groups get back and are hot and tired. The elevators are packed and slow. You are not allowed to wear you bathing suit in the lobby. This is hard when the elevators are packed and you can't get out of the bottom floor where the pool is located. The last night that we were there our tour guide and bus driver were told that they had to stay elsewhere. As the needed the room for other guests. There room had been paid for in advance. I would have rather slept on the sidewalk than in this hotel. It is rated at a 4 star. What a joke, I have stayed at motel 6 that was in better shape than this place. Stay way from here. Oh one more thing everytime you take a shower it leaks all over the floor.
