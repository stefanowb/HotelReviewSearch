It is centrally located, a few minutes walk from various restaurants, touristic attractions, and best of all, the tram stopped right in front of it. It is 10 minutes away from Central Station, and river boat trips, a definite asset. The hotel has style, and the staff are friendly, informative and very helpful. My only comment is that we booked a Classic room and that was a bit small for 2 people. However the beds were wonderfully comfortable, and the room very clean. We didn't eat there as we thought breakfast was a bit steep. But pancake places and sandwich shops are all around, so no problem.

Very short walk from central station. We arrived before midday and check in wasn't till 2 but man on front desk said wasn't a problem so signed a couple of forms then gave us our room key. He was very nice and helpful as were all the hotel staff. Room was very nice. View wasn't great but very tidy and plenty big enough for 2 people. Bed was huge and could have slept in it all day. Wish my own bed was as nice. As u walk out hotel and to the left your only a 5 minute walk 2 dam square and town centre. Didn't have breakfast as was very expensive (\u00a320 per person per day) but there r plenty of cafes or fresh bakerys nearby. Also found a lovely restaurant nearby ( turn right out hotel and walk about 5 mins) called humphreys which had excellent food and good value.
