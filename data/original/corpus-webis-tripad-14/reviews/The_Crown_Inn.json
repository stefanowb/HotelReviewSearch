It's very foodie with only a small public bar but the whole place is full of character. And the food was excellent and well above average for pub grub. Try the slow cooked pork belly or shoulder of lamb and you'll see what I mean. It was also good to see that much of the food & drink was sourced from local quality suppliers.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "norabatty", "date": "April 9, 2009", "id": 27702966}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The other big plus for us was the quality of the staff. Without exception they were efficient, friendly and knowledgable despite being extremely busy for most of the time. I'm not sure the previous reviewer from Birmingham was reviewing the right place! So would we stay here again? On initial impressions I would have said no, but this place grew on us and we will probably be back.
