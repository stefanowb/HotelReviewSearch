Smoke troubles my allergies so I went to check the room to make sure it was suitable and did not smell like smoke and to my surprise it did not so I happily changed rooms. The hallway had a heavy smell of smoke though. The room was average and clean. There was some mold around the grout of the bathtub which was kind of gross.

There is no insulation to guard against noise. Didn't get a good nights sleep at all. The heating unit is one of those in the wall units that only heats the immediate area which wouldn't be a problem if Texas was not having an ice storm that day so it was freezing!
