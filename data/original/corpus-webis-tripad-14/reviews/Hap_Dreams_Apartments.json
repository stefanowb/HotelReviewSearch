Perched in the old part of Girona, We had an apartment overlooking the street. It was very quiet at night. The apartment was large with combined kitchen/dining/living area. Bedroom with a wonderful stone feature wall. Enough kitchen equipment to rustle up a decent breakfast or lunch. With tea/coffee, biscuits/croissant upon arrival. There is a nice garden area at the back which you can sit out in. There is also a wash-room downstairs where you can wash/dry your clothes if needed. The apartment has a hair-dryer, toiletries, free safe in bedroom. The towels are changed daily if required.
