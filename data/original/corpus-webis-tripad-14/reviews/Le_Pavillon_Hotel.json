It's an older hotel that has spent untold dollars to ensure luxury at an affordable price. The rooms are somewhat small, but not uncomfortable. The decor is beautiful and the shower was the best I've ever experienced. The shower head dumps loads of water that feels similar to standing under a waterfall. (not stinging; pouring). The bath area is all marble and the swinging glass shower door is very unusual. The concierge is extremely helpful and gives tourist advice, brochures, and good directions. The breakfast buffet is high priced, but well worth it. (about $17). The restaurant (The Crystal Room) is beautiful, but expensive. I would highly recommend at least one meal during your stay. They serve excellent food. The rooftop pool and hot tub are nice, but small. The workout area is very nice. They even have a small fridge full of water and sports drinks, and a basket of fresh fruit (all free) for hotel guests who use the facility. The tradition of serving free peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, hot chocolate, fruit, and milk in the lobby every night is great! We really enjoyed our stay. Parking costs $28 per night (typical in New Orleans), and the valet parking service is ccontracted out by the hotel. The first night we were there, the valet parked our rental car by a wall and put a huge scratch on it. I would recommend parking your car yourself.", "user": "GinaDRacine", "date": "August 5, 2005", "id": 3740033}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "More a preview than a review", "text": "Not arriving till late August - Halloween week, and the service here has already been outstanding.", "user": "Solobay", "date": "August 2, 2005", "id": 3729137}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful, relaxing stay", "text": "My husband and I stayed at Le Pavillon in October 93 upon user recommendations, and we were very happy with our room.

We travel quite a bit, at different types of lodging and I use tripadvisor EVERY time. I don't know what happened while we were at Le Pavillon 2/17-2/20, but EVERYTHING went wrong! We ordered room service and didn't get the right beverages, TWICE! Our wakeup calls were 10 minutes late, and it took FOREVER to get our car out of parking, and it's only just a lot on the opposite corner. We put a \"TURN DOWN SERVICE\" sign in our door when we went out, and when we got back, someone had been in the room, put the \"TURN DOWN SERVICE\" sign back in the room, but hadn't done anything. Why were they in the room then? We called the Front Desk, once, to say, very nicely, that we had had a few problems, they didn't inquire any further and they didn't do anything to make it up to us. I have never complained at a hotel and we didn't push this any further. If you stay there, I hope you have better luck.P.S. Le Pavillon IS very lovely to look at and I didn't think the location was too bad, it's away from the French Quarter, but well within walking distance, just a few blocks. Although, I won't ever stay there again because of the service. I booked this room through AAA and I wonder if we got discount service because of it.

We spent three wonderful but rainy days in New Orleans and besides eating at Emeril's (best restaurant aside from the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas) the hotel made our trip the best we've taken in years. Justin, the concierge, was marvelous. I sent him a very lengthy email prior to the trip and he responded in a prompt manner with great ideas! Upon arrival, the hotel sent up a basket of fruit for our anniversary (which I'm still not sure how they found out that's why we were there). The room was spacious and had a very new and crisp feel to it. If you do go to this hotel, make sure you request the \"Turn down service\" at night. Not only was the bed perfectly turned down the hotel staff left shortbread peanut butter and jelly cookies on our nightstand with the recipe to go along. I'M STILL BLOWN AWAY!

When we arrived we were greeted by very polite and professional staff, and we are amazed by their luxurious decoration in the looby and throughout the building. We took a lot of pictures with their well-decorated Christmas trees and fireplaces. They provided wireless internet access, a very convenient feature for the guest. My wife particularly like the late night snack, which include milk, peanut butter bread, cookies, juice, etc. The location is near downtown. We could walk to French quarter no problem, around 15-20 minutes. Of course you might not want to walk during the night. Safer to take a cab, not too expensive. Room are not huge, but furniture are nice. Room size is about average. Swimming pool and exercise room on the roof, too bad it was too cold to swim when we were there. Their restaurant was luxury too and they have table side cooking.
