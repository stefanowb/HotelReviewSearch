I had planned and researched each hotel stop on the way and upon arrival at the Ramada Santa Barbara I can tell you that we were soooo happy and chilled out after the hustle and bustle of LA. We got the room for a very good price and so were very pleased. The rooms were comfortable and small and the breakfast minimal but perfectly adequate, but it was the landscaping and flora that really made it for us, it was so beautiful with the lagoons and bridges and the pool and spa were so refreshing. The ambience of the place was just mesmerising. We had only booked 2 days there but asked if we could stay another night as we felt so relaxed there. It probably was a little dated compared to other hotels at the time, but we loved that 1970's sort of a vibe and from the look of the website now, they have refurbished the inside. We actually got engaged there so this hotel holds a special place in our hearts!", "title": "Beautiful Calm Oasis - Unmissable!", "user": "London-Gal08", "date": "March 31, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 27151791}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled with family", "text": "My family stayed at the Ramada Limited in Santa Barbara and couldn't believe it was a Ramada - it seemed like a higher end hotel. We had a great room with a balcony overlooking the pool, which was surrounded by nice plants and even a little pond - really nice landscaping. The room had a high vaulted ceiling, which made it feel more roomy. The breakfast was higher quality than expected - there were even croissants. The hotel was in a good central location. Our only complaint is that there was no exercise room in the hotel - they have a gym you can go to a couple miles away, but we didn't have time to go offsite for exercise. The hotel wasn't cheap, but for Santa Barbara it was very reasonable. I would definitely go to this hotel again.", "title": "Can't believe it's a Ramada", "user": "blairp", "date": "March 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 26900246}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We went to SB for a hockey camp on campus of UCSB. We decided to go for a suite as we had three hockey players and all the gear that goes along with each individual. We found the hotel very easily and pulled right in. There was one couple in line, two clerks so we walked right in and checked in. The clerks were very friendly and helpful, offered maps and assistance with our bags. The room was easily found and huge! The boy loved the balconies. The decided that they were going to eat breakfast on the balcony. The view was of the hotel grounds including a small pond with ducks. The bathroom was large enough and had an additional sink outside the bathroom with a small vanity. The shower head was very nice and did not rip my skin off. Plenty of hot water and towels. There was a nice touch for the kids that came in the form of a rubber duck. We asked for a second duck and it was given without hesitation. There was a small refrigerator and microwave that were sufficient for our needs. The beds were wonderful. Finally enough pillows for me! Two televisions were nice, but we were never there for very long so we did not really use them for too long. I come from a family of pest control employees and the first thing I do is look for evidence of bugs. I can say that I did not detect any signs of bugs at the Ramada. There were some areas of minor wear of the paint and some splashes of dirty water in the bathroom. Nothing that was worth getting worked up over. As for the noise, I did not notice any and I am a very light sleeper. We were on the freeway side but I heard the ducks in the morning, not the freeway noise.", "title": "Santa Barbara Ramada-Nice for families.", "user": "Jettavroom", "date": "March 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 26712794}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The grounds staff was very pleasant and friendly as was the breakfast staff.
