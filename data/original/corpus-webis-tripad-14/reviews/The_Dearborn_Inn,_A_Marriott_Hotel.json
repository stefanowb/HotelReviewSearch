Moving to California gave me the opportunity to stay in the hotel. The hotel is beautiful but you have to enjoy history to appreciate the charm of this hotel. We stayed in a basic double room with our daughters as we knew we wouldn't be there often and it was bigger than expected. One phone call gets you additional towels, pillows, and room service. They are dedicated to their customers here. They even allowed us to check in almost 5 hours early for free (we were willing to pay). The bathroom is a little small but they use the space very well.

The room was nice although VERY small - the king size bed pretty much took up all the space.

It was surprisingly quiet and we had a great night of sleep. The room was very clean. My only complaint is that the employee at the front desk continually only addressed my husband and only spoke to him, even though the reservation was in my name, I was the one talking to him, and I was the one paying.
