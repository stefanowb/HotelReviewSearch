We had no hot water for the entire time of our stay so were unable to shower! Later I sent an email advising of our disappointment and now they are trying to tell us that there was nothing wrong with the hot water, it's not instantaneous.

The resort is a franchise. Breakfast..(if you can call it that) has to be the poorest I have experienced in living memory from any hotel or resort. The poor old staff are woefully overwhelmed but credit to them they manage to retain a smile whilst they attempt to find a table to actually seat you! The food is basic and avoid the so called Italian restaurant....crazily over priced and bland and when you examine the surrounds would only just pass off as a cafe. Pizza was undercooked and certainly nothing that fresh about it. Pasta had no taste what so ever. Run down place...and not surprisingly we weren't even asked on checking out whether we had enjoyed the stay.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Carlton W", "date": "June 12, 2012", "id": 131803315}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed for two days and overall I thought it was overpriced considering what you are getting in terms of the terrace house and facilities. Although, that\u2019s not the issue; some of the staff have an attitude problem. I was willing to overlook the first time my wife tried to access the wifi and got absolutely no help from the reception staff how to set it up so we just gave up. My second encounter with the rude reception staff was when I tried to check-out. It was about 8:40 am on a Monday and I stood in front of the counter for 15 min while this woman with medium length blonde hair was checking in another guest. She must have asked for the booking name 6 times while they both were looking on the computer for the booking. I found it hard to believe that so close to the 10am check-out time that it was going to take every guest 15 min to get checked out. When there was a break in their conversation I politely said \u201cexcuse me how do I get checked out\u201d? This woman proceeded to raise her voice and took an angry tone and told me to \u201cwait my turn while she finished with the other guest\u201d. I think in that case a simple \u201cI will be with you in a moment\u201d would have sufficed. The way in which I was spoken to with the raised voice and the angry tone I know that at many good hotels she would have been fired on the spot. I strongly suggest that this resort needs to teach their staff some better manors and just some common sense of how to speak to paying guests. In addition, the three restaurants on site were very average but the Thai food was terrible; I have nothing good to say about it. This place is a lake side resort and you would think that for what they are charging they would make a little more effort.

The pools are amazing, my kids spent 6 hours playing with other kids. We had a voucher for the onsite Italian Restaurant which we used the first night. The food was nothing short of amazing. It was so good we went back the second night and paid for it !!!! The resort is right on the lake with spectacular sunsets.

We stayed on a scoopon vouchure which was great value for money and we had been upgraded to delux accommodation without even asking. Our two bedroom terrace had just been renovated and was very comfortable. However, I did notice that some of the other villas were in desperate need of updating so I can see what some of the other reviewers were talking about. The facilities were great and well maintained and the dinners and breakfasts were faultless. Dont go in school holidays though if you dont like screaming children as that did become a bit much but not the fault of the resort as it is marketed at families. I would however suggest to the resort manager that some security would be beneficial as there was a brake in on sunday morning and there were a couple of rowdy groups in that went late into the night with no one to complain to.

After a 2 hour plus wait as computers were down we got moved but then had to move again as the room had not been serviced. the terrace we got was an upgrade (other 2 cottages were outdated ) was furnished well and clean but as noted in previous reviews the beds are truly woeful....the first night i got 2 hours sleep as the mattress is like concrete, truly one of the worst beds i've slept on and this is the reason i couldn't stay there again actually. i literally cant sleep on it and yes not a single spare blanket so couldn't sleep on the huge lounge downstairs either. they really need new beds as its obvious these are bargain basement mattresses currently. the pool area was nice with a good view of the lake and we utilised this a lot with our young child however there is duck poo everywhere unfortunately and cracks in the concrete surrounding the pool. also my husband noted the service was poor, no one coming to collect empty glasses and a large group resorted to pulling over an otto bin to throw their empties away...service whilst friendly was lacking. TV reception in the rooms was bad and \"foxtel\" amounted to a couple of channels. we ate in the Italian restaurant one night and it was ok. the new caves beach hotel 5 minutes drive away is much better with and has a large children play area which is good for people with kids too. its a shame that rooms and beds arent better quality as this is a good location and easy drive from sydney. could do with some TLC.", "title": "okay...but a couple of big negatives", "user": "rainlover2727", "date": "November 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144629930}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "The resort is very very nice with lovely staff.
