Secure, nice views and we enjoyed our stay. I am glad we only stayed a few nights and so dont even think about staying for a whole week. In addtion, if you are thinking to go down on 4th of July - there is no peace and quiet to be had. Fireworks all going off at all hours day and nightt. Just a word of warning, I would check to see if you have air conditioning in your unit as ours did not have it. I was shocked! It was pretty hot there so we tried to keep the windows open. No choice if you dont have AC. Because of the noise, and no AC, I did not get much sleep. I just assumed that it would have air conditioning/heating - word of advice never assume. Overall the resort is nice but its not spectacular. You can walk to the Rosarito Beach hotel from La Paloma and then walk around town from there. At night, I would advise taking a cab and leaving your car in the safe and secure parking lot.", "title": "4th of July Weekend - KABOOM", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "ROSEOC", "date": "July 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 5434901}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Never again!

I must say that things have improved over the years but it is still pretty dirty and rather unsafe driving. Rosarito is a very small place so I would recommend only staying 2 or 3 nights maximum, as you can see the whole town in 2 days. The first night we dined at El Nido restaurant in Rosarito, this is a must. The food and atmosphere were great. The second night we ventured to Puerto Nuevo for lobster, it is about a 15 minute drive south. I was not too impressed with the Lobster as it was not that cheap ($25 a plate) and it was not fresh from Mexico - they are frozen. The village of Puerto Nuevo is very small and it takes 1 hour to walk around and shop. Note the restaurants in Puerto Nuevo close early at 9pm and the car park closes at 10pm - you wont be partying there all night.", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 20, 2006", "id": 5183657}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "La Paloma is a good, safe place to stay in Rosarito.", "title": "An ideal place!!", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "Martin A", "date": "April 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4896215}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006", "text": "Never again I myself have a large family 5 and had problems from the very beginning with this place is definitely not accommodating to your needs all.

I asked about this policy and do speak fluent Spanish and was giving no reason other than they are not guest here? After giving it half a day it just got worst. Left this hell hole went down the street and checked into Rosario Beach Hotel and proceeded to have an excellent week from their far better resort.

Although this is a time-share owned by World Mark, I believe there are units that can be privately rented. We stayed in a 2 bedroom/2 bath unit with \"turn key\" amenities. Two T.V.'s with cable and a lovely balcony looking out onto the grounds. We were third floor. Although they advised we bring towels, which we did, they were not needed. Our unit was cleaned once a day, towels changed, and we even had our own washer and dryer and laundry detergent was provided!! A full size refrigerator with ice maker, dishwasher & all of the basic utensils for cooking were there. Alhthough our cooking was \"limited\" there is a convection oven if one chooses to cook (along with 4 burner stove top). There are tennis courts, pool, spa, exercise room on the grounds. The little \"Italian Restaurant\" on site is cute and of course, Mexican dishes are offered!! The staff was very pleasant at the Resort and the Restaurant. The only \"draw back\", if you can call this one, is you have to drive into down. La Paloma is located just south of Renee's (a local place for American's that now reside in Baja). Also, the road traffic is loud in the front bedroom, if you left the window opened. However, with the ocean breeze coming through that was not necessary! We are going to Puerta Vallarta in May, usig the same timeshare comapny. Hopefully, it will be as nice as this one!! There is another bar in town, beyond Rosarito Hotel, that is owned by two American's, who moved to Baja from RIVERSIDE, CA, it is called \"NO BAD DAYS BAR\". It's upstairs next to a bakery. The people are friendly and they can let you know all the good eating places in town. There's a restaurant, on a side road, noted for lobster, lamb and other wonderful dishes (near Wally's) this restaurant is owned by two cooks that used to work for El Nido's Steak and Seafood Restaurant -- but I can't remmeber the name of it -- but AT NO BAD DAYS BAR -- I'm certain they can tell you.
