However the rooms are very large and contain a small kitchen with microwave, oven and all the essentials you need if you decide to cook in the room. The king size bed was comfortable. The bathroom had separate doors between the sinks and showers. All functions worked well in the room. The hotel was extremely busy taking calls and booking rooms since Hurricane Ike was arriving the next day. The breakfast was above average with eggs, sausage and a wide selection of fresh, not canned, fruit which was a change. The kitchen staff were extra courteous and helpful as well. There is also a small free business center in the hotel. Overall a great hotel and cheaper than a comparable Residence Inn.", "title": "Best HOtel EVER", "user": "txsaran", "date": "August 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19483826, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 overall comfort from the size of the room to the size of the towels", "disliked": "\u2014 I can't say there was anything that I didn't like."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled on business", "text": "This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in!!
