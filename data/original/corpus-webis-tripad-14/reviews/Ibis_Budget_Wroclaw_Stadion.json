A bit outside of the Wroclaw centre. Perfect if You have a car but taxi shouldn't be expensive - otherwise it is not easy with buses. Basic, clean hotel with one of the smallest rooms I've ever seen - with a sink in the room, shower doors directly from the room and not very big but much too soft bed. Everything spotless. Breakfast ok, very nice and helpful staff. Go for it with no doubts if You are on budget or if it is just Your transit accomodation.", "user": "LukaszWarsaw", "date": "April 3, 2010", "id": 60231581}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled solo", "text": "Very friendly staff with good English.
