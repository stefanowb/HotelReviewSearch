The cafe across the road was cheaper and offered more. It seemed a real shame as the hotel was great and I'd have stayed again quite happily, however I think that by the time you add the price of breakfast to the room charge it works out expensive in comparison to other places.

My boyfriend and I found it very easy to get to from the #2 tram (a short walk from Emmastraat stop). We loved the location at the edge of Vondelpark, away from the noise of the city. The room was very clean with bright windows overlooking the street. On our last day at the hotel, we were supposed to catch an early flight and ww overslept that morning, thus missing our flight. The nice woman working at the desk really helped me out and let me use the phone and internet to arrange my new flight schedule. We had to stay in Amsterdam another night, but their hotel was fully booked that evening, so she called around to other hotels and found us a place a block away at a reasonable rate. I really appreciated all their patience and help during that stressful time. I highly recommend this hotel...truly a gem in Amsterdam!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 20, 2005", "id": 4038090}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Hidden Hotel Gem of Amsterdam", "text": "Borgmann Villa Hotel is a small, moderately-priced, charming, owner-operated/managed hotel in a quiet residential neighborhood bordering the southside of beautiful VondelPark in Amsterdam and is extremely convenient to the city's major entertainment and cultural areas.

I know the hotels in Amsterdam pretty well, since I go there for work every month and I challenge you to find such a treat elsewhere: a cozzy hotel located in one of the nicest areas of Amsterdam, 20 minutes walk from the center, with such a thoughtful and nice staff, with a very reasonable rate. I felt like I was staying with relatives! The only caveat is the breakfast, which costs too much for what you get, even thought the view of the park may compensate for the difference. My wife caught a strong cold during our stay and the staff did everything they could to help us out: find a physician on a Saturday night, give us directions to the only pharmacy open and boil water for us every day, twice a day.
