This was our 2nd stop of a 21 day trip throughout Eastern Europe. We rented 2 rooms at this hotel. The hotel was pleasant, and the rooms were large. One room had carpeting, but the other did not. Thankfully, we were on a non-smoking floor. The staff couldn't have been any nicer or more helpful. They were eager to please and to make our 4-night stay wonderful. The breakfast was lovely although the breakfast room is in the basement. That said, the room was bright and cheery. The room was spacious but bare-bones. Nothing was of high quality and I must say that the towels were extremely thin and very rough. The bedding was comfortable but the linens have seen better days. There is one elevator in the hotel and it is rather small. The location was definitely off the beaten path. We quickly learned the subway system and took it everywhere. There is a subway station 1/2 block from the hotel which made it extremely convenient to travel via the subway. I would probably stay here again, given that the hospitality of the staff was so outstanding.", "title": "Nice Hotel", "user": "EmmaShultz", "date": "August 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 38091758}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed over the Easter break with the main aim of visiting lots of museums.

The Johann Strauss is a smallish hotel (about 60 rooms) very well located on a relatively quiet street near the Technical University, about 1km south of the Stephansdom. It is practically on top of a U-Bahn station, and the trams run along a parallel street about a hundred metres away, so connections are excellent. A typical continental breakfast with a good range of quality produce (including smoked salmon and sparkling wine) is served in a well-decorated basement room. There is a small bar, but no evening restaurant service.
