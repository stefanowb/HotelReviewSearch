We've stayed twice now, one night each time, on the drive through the Mont Blanc tunnel to Italy. Its rooms are small and not particularly beautiful, yes, but very clean. The beds are comfortable, and most importantly after a long drive, the position of the place is very quiet! The staff were perfectly friendly and helpful. The restaurant is a little pretentious, but food is good and the lakeside view great. The price, while not rock-bottom cheap, was fair for cordon bleu cuisine, with menus starting at 29 euros. You could always eat in town. The breakfast, likewise, is a bit pricey at 9.50 euros, but there's a wide choice of cereals, croissants etc and again, you don't have to eat there, there's a nice bar on the main street in town. I wouldn't choose this place for a long holiday stay, but at 73 euro for a family room with lake view, we will definitely stay here again.", "title": "A simple, good value hotel.

We crossed the road and dived into thh lake... Fantastic. Such an idylic location/spot. wonderful scenery. That's were the good bits stop. The rooms however are awful... small and just look dirty... They are obviously cleaned but maintenance is so poor... batch with wrong plugs for teh holes etc etc They were however cheap (circa Euro60 per night). We had however booked the restaurant. What a mistake... Euro 300 bill for 5!! and it was not that great in terms of value... sure some of the dishes were delicious but no starter can be worth Euro20+... If there are 2 of you then perhaps and you want a great view of the lake then great but families.. AVOID! Breakfast was simply awful.. they show you to the ground level (which feels like basement in the hotel... cold cheese, ham and stale bread...
