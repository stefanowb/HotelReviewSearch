Our most recent reservation was October 12th mid day. The best way to describe the drawing room is cozy yet elegant and the service, food and presentation are top notch! When we want to treat a family member or friend to a special meal, this is top of our list. It is just that, a lovely treat that needs to be experienced. If you're in Niagara on the Lake on a date, anniversary trip or simply walking the the shops for an afternoon...consider tea at the Drawing Room and watch the world go by. If you do make your reservation, request the Solarium and also ask if Grace will be there because she is an incredible Server.

After the trashy appearance of Niagara Falls establishments, Niagara on the Lake is such a treasure and only a 30 minute drive away. The heritage listed buildings in the town are a delight and the Prince of Wales is no exception, being reminiscent of stately homes and hotels in England. As we were there in the off season, there were only two other tables occupied for afternoon tea and we were asked whether we would like to sit in the cosy room with the open fire or in the glass encased conservatory. We chose the latter and it was such a delightful setting in which to partake of the delicious sandwiches and cakes, plus giant scones with jam and cream which arrived on a three tiered plate stand. There were eleven different teas on offer and my husband and I chose different blends so we received a large pot each. The crockery is Wedgewood and the napery thick starched linen, adding to the English feel of the place. Our waitress was friendly and attentive without being intrusive and when we couldn't finish all our food, offered to put the rest in a box to take away with us. We did that and were able to enjoy the rest of our tasty morsels later in the evening. We definitely didn't need any dinner that night so at $33 each, it proved to be value for money. Also available for afternoon tea is a selection of wines and cheeses so that would make for an even more substantial meal.", "user": "mombd", "date": "March 14, 2013", "id": 154585407}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderul Victorian Tea!", "text": "What a delight!
