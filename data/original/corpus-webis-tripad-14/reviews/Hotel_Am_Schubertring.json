It was the manner in which the staff and eventually the manager handled this which leads me to this review. Firstly, when we discovered our loss the one person on desk duty was extremely unhelpful in advising us. He did call the police but when we told him we had the dilemma that if we were to have to wait for them for long we would have the additional loss of missing our concert that night, he refused to call the police to find out if we could arrange a time or if they could let us know what we could do in the situation. (Nothing maybe, but the courtesy was missing). Throughout, he showed no sympathy for what had happened, or surprise \u2013 he seemed only defensive and wishing he didn\u2019t have the responsibility to deal with the situation.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 15, 2005", "id": 3905708}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "The following day not one of the hotel staff acknowledged us in the morning and seemed very uncomfortable when we addressed them, and we received no contact from the management to discuss what had happened, neither simply to reassure us that they would do everything they could to help, nor to show their concern at the serious breach of security.

Loved this hotel, superb location (so near Statsoper and the Hotel Imperial) as well as helpful staff and yummy breakfast. My friend and I spent the last week of Jan 05 at the Hotel Am Schubertring and were delighted with our proximity to all things interesting to visitors to Vienna -- from cathedrals to museums to palaces and more. Also lovely that the tram stops were literally outside our front door as it was very (read: blowing) snowy a day or two during our week. The room (very in the back, charming, quiet except for the 71 tram which we came to love as it took us to both Belvedere Palace and to the Rennweg S7 station for the cheap ride back to the Vienna Airport) couldn't have been more lovely. Small sitting area, very spacious, Zimmer 26. We got a great air/land package so don't know how reasonable this hotel might be in the warmer season...Can't recommend this hotel enough, however. Staff helpful, helped us with our German and pointed us in the right direction (tram number wise, etc.) more than once. We were on our own, however, making dinner and tour reservations. Salzburg via West Bahnhof easy day-trip. Make sure to look into standing room only tickets to Statsoper performances (3.5 Euros day of perf.) . We got to see the Marriage of Figaro and it was outstanding, truly a highlight. Please please don't bother with the Albertina Museum, total waste of time and money due to horribly boring rotation of material, don't miss Schonnbrunn, Lipazzaners (if only a stable tour, like ours), tour of Imperial Treasury and whatever you can fit it otherwise. Drink lots of good coffee and reisling, as well!
