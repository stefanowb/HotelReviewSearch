This place seems more geared for families with children. My husband and I planned a getaway here without the kids and were diappointed to see children and double strollers everywhere, not to mention the fact that we had a family staying above our room, and had to be awakened to the opening and closing of sliding glass doors in late evening and early morning(6:00a.m). This defeated our purpose of getting away for some peace and quiet and being able to sleep in. I even told the guy, with whom I made reservations with weeks in advance, that we would be getting away from the kids. In my trip to the spa for a massage appointment, there were even children throughout the changing area/ showers/ steam rooms. I do not recommend this place if you want a quiet relaxing get away from children.", "title": "Not the place for a romantic getaway!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "vbn8tive", "date": "April 27, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5013506}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "My wife and I spent the past weekend at Kingsmill.

My kids are 7 (girl) &14 (boy) years old. Very concerned about my stay pretrip due to TripAdvisor reviews, but I could not make other accomodations for the dates we were traveling. Arrived to find a property that is configured very similar to a time share. The suite was 1st rate in all ways except noise insulation. That is a problem, but never truly interfered with our stay. I found the people at the resort and the surrounding town to be typical for the area. They are not extra friendly like you might expect in the South, but they are not rude and are actually quite efficient in delivering service. Kingsmill is more of a country club community with upscale suites and not a \"true resort.\" Also the resort ammenities are scattered around the Kingsmill property and not within walking distance. The area is beautiful well laid out community with efficient transportation to the parks and very enjoyable. As for breakfast - there was always a wait, but they did take names and get people seated as soon as a table comes available with adequate seating for the party - regardless of paying by voucher or cash. Also the food at the resort including breakfast was excellent. The breakfast buffet included made to order omlets daily. The view from the dining areas to the James River and across the golf course are relaxing. All in all the trip was a bit costly - but we had an exceptional time both at the resort and in the Williamsburg area.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "ob1moses", "date": "July 4, 2006", "id": 5425409}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Poor Customer Service, Paper Thin Walls", "text": "My husband and I and another couple stayed at the Kingsmill Resort & Spa over Memorial Day Weekend.
