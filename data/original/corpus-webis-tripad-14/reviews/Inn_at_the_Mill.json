The inn was one of my favorite Arkansas destination hotels, nearly on the level of the Capital Hotel in Little Rock. Alas, that is no longer the case. Rooms could stand a fresh coat of paint, missing pulls on scuffed armoires could be replaced, carpets could handle a good cleaning. No longer are there fish in the mill's pond; no longer is there a leisurely wine and cheese reception in the comfortable lobby area. In fact, IATM is now a step below a standard room in a new Comfort Inn. Hopefully, the owners will spend necessary time and money to return the inn to its glory-days condition.
