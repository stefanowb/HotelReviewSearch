The bathroom decor was a bit dated but the shower was hot with great water pressure! The bed was not comfortable for my taste but that's a me problem. Not one time in our three-night stay did we get awakened by loud voices, doors slamming, etc. The breakfast offerings were very basic but DIFFERENT every morning. That was nice. We were less than half a mile from the entrance to Assateague National Seashore. Shops, restaurants were all close-by. There was a bicycle rental on the premises which we took advantage of one day. Weather was too cool for the pool but we looked it over and it seemed like your typical pool. I cannot say enough about the cleaning staff. They bent over backwards to make sure we had what we needed. We were on the first floor and our room, being at ground level, had a dehumidifier in the corner that ran constantly. There was a sign on it saying not to mess with it, so we didn't. I assume all other ground floor rooms had one as well as this is an older hotel.
