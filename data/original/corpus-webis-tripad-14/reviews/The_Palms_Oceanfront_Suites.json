It was very clean and comfortable and spacious. They give you complimentary 5 gallons of bottled water and the kitchen was well equipped. We had an incredible ocean view and the hotel is right on the ocean. The pool is a little small and tucked in the back, but it's good for just dipping in. The staff keeps the grounds up meticulously. They also sent someone over to pick us up from the airport in a golf cart, which was really handy, because even though it's only a half block away, the streets are cobbled and it would have been a little harder to walk it with luggage. We were a little worried about the proximity to the airport, but although you can hear some planes (they are small), noise was never a problem.", "title": "Terrific place to stay", "user": "extraextra", "date": "December 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188414334}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "The hotel doesn't have a bar or restaurant, but it's super close to a ton of bars and restaurants on the beach and in town.

The only thing you need to be careful about is asking if prices are in Belizean dollars or USD if it isn't clear. My friend got a massage at a spa in the hotel next door, and the price written down was $80. She assumed that since we were in Belize, that the prices were in Belizean dollars. However, after the massage, the masseuse told her the price was USD, which seems pretty disingenuous. However, just ask if you're not clear about it. Everywhere else, people were very nice and honest.", "title": "Great stay at The Palms", "user": "Debbie F", "date": "December 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188163624}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We would definitely stay there again.
