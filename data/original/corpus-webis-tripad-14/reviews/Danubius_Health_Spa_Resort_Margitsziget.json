The setting is perfect - you will feel sorry for those staying in city centre hotels - and we had a room overlooking the river. Our room was clearly not one of the biggest they had, but as we spent little time there it didn`t matter. It was, however, nice and quiet up on the third floor and the air conditioning was a boon during the warm nights. We only once used the facilities in the neighbouring Thermal Hotel but I can say that a 7am swim followed by a dip in the thermal pool does set you up nicely for breakfast. Take some flip-flop type slippers and also a swimming cap if you have long hair. The staff are generally very helpful and friendly. particularly at reception and the bar, while the cleaners make a point of greeting you in the corridor. The waiting staff are, however, another matter. Sometimes slow, mainly indifferent and almost exclusively middle aged men, we got the impression that their lives would be much easier without customers! Hence, only four stars from me. If you must take dinner at the hotel (or elsewhere for that matter), don`t take risks if you`re not sure of the local cuisine; as we discovered, Hungary is not the place to start being adventurous!", "title": "A perfect location", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "Teithiwr", "date": "June 5, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3530241}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "Just returned from a fantastic 4 night stay at the very appropriately named Grand Hotel, and have nothing but praise for this Hotel. Our room, which I think was only a basic room, was extremely spacious and clean, and had a balcony overlooking the park. The Hotel staff were very helpful, all spoke good English and included a travel agent who was able to give us all the info(and sell tickets) we needed about transport, restuarants, shows, etc. We were able to use the superb spa facilities in the adjoining Thermal Hotel, which you reach via an underground passage. Our tab at the end of the 4 days, which included 2 evening meals a few beers and cocktails, coffee and cakes and a half hour internet access came to \u00a360 !!!, which included, for some reason we weren't quite able to establish a 25% discount. To cap it all the Hotel is set in a great location on Margarit Island, which is very quiet spot in the centre of Budapest, within 100m or so of both bus and boat links to the City. We booked with Easy Hotels, and for 2 adults, paid around \u00a3300 B&B in total for 4 nights.", "title": "Great Hotel superb location.", "helpfulness": 25, "user": "WelshGas", "date": "May 31, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3512728}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A really excellent hotel", "text": "If you're looking for cheap relaxing City break, this is the place for you.", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "Cath456", "date": "January 6, 2005", "id": 2984678}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic hotel", "text": "I've stayed at this hotel twice in the past year and I can definitely recommend it. The spa here is absolutely excellent, really clean and modern, and the whole atmosphere of the hotel is friendly and helpful. If you want treatments there are all sorts of things on offer here. The hotel is really quiet as it's on the lovely car-free Margaret Island in the middle of the Danube. I've eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel on different occasions and the buffet-style restaurant is good. It is a fair walk to the shops, restaurants and nightlife of central Budapest and in the evening you really need to get a cab or a bus, but if you want a relaxing spa break away from it all with a bit of sightseeing in the fabulous city of Budpest this really is an ideal place to stay. I'm just figuring out when I can go back next...", "helpfulness": 61, "user": "AndrewandJenny", "date": "June 23, 2004", "id": 2217647}], "location": {"country": "Hungary", "region": "Central Hungary", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Budapest"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 18, "average": 50, "very good": 115, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 90}, "aka": "Danubius Health Spa Resort Margitsziget Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.308383233533, "description": "The Danubius Health Spa Resort Margitsziget is the city\u2019s leading spa hotel, making use of a natural thermal spring on tranquil Margaret Island.
