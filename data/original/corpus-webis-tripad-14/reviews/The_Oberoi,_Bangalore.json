The software boom and the population explosion put paid to that. But the sanctuary of the Oberoi garden is still something special. All the bedrooms look out over the magnificent trees and there are flowers around all the balconies encouraging butterflies to come and linger. Sadly they can't shut out modern Bangalore completely. High rise blocks increasingly intrude on the skyline and they have had to glass in the open air corridors to cut down the traffic noise. But no doubt this is an oasis. They have also modernised the rooms since my last visit - without losing the colonial ambiance. The rooms have been a bit over teched. Everything is now controlled via an iPad. Quite why you want to control your air conditioning form an iPad that is actually sitting next to the control switch on the wall I don't know. The food is great here and the staff are fabulous.
