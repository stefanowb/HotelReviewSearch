The outside of the hotel was attractive on a little lane in Bouin. Once inside it was clear the old hotel had undergone recent refurbishment- the rooms were big and comfortable- big enough for three (although I was one) and a nice bathroom with a walk-in shower. The restaurant is next door in a 17century barn - not that cheap but seriously good food. Overall great value in an undiscovered part of the French coast.", "title": "Very comfortable hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lalanche", "date": "July 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 115731233}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Looking for a hotel at the coast of Nantes/Poitou I had two important demands: it had to be child friendly (ak swimming pool) and had to be charming as we didn't want to end up in a prefab, concrete tourist trap. Le Martinet met both demands. The room was very basic, but what else do you need when travelling with children. At first we got a room near the restaurant whose ventilation kept us awake all night, but the management changed our room immidiately after complaning. The whole setting of the hotel was really wonderful and charming and service were absolutely excellent! The small town of Bouin might be very quiet to some people but more vivid towns are only a few minutes away by car.
