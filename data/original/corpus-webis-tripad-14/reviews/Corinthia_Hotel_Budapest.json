The hotel is well located and has a good range of restaurants , although we only used the bar. Budapest is a fairly compact city so getting around either on foot or using the superb trasnport network was simple. Liked the Royal spa although found the pool a little chilly for my personal taste. In terms of areas to improve there is very little - like others we found the room far too hot and stuffy and did have to open the big main window all day to keep in cooler. Also the shower pressure and temp did fluctuate annoyingly ( the ones in the spa were fine ) but these are minor niggles - its a great hotel and superb value for money .

While the gracious frontage, marble floors, sweeping staircase and breathtaking, six-story Atrium preserved from the original building offer glorious hints of a bygone age, the levels of comfort and convenience are all reassuringly up to date.A particular feature is the hotel\u2019s original Royal Spa centre, with 15-metre pool, now extensively refurbished by the current owners to reflect the very best in 21st-century spa luxury while retaining the grandeur of the past. Without doubt the finest hotel in Budapest. Built in classic French Renaissance style, the Grand Royal became a beacon of luxury in the days of Emperor Franz Joseph 1. Designed as a centrepiece of Hungary\u2019s celebrations to mark its first thousand years, the hotel\u2019s grand-style architecture and unrivaled guest facilities were seen as state-of the art for the times. Much of the building was destroyed in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and despite re-opening in more modest form in the 1960\u2019s, the Grand Royal remained a shadow of its former self until the 1990\u2019s; when new owners Corinthia Hotels gave the green light for an extensive restoration project that would retain the best of the old, while sensitively adding the new. Once restored to its original splendour, the newly named Corinthia Hotel Budapest re-opened its doors, as a five-star luxury property, in 2003."}
