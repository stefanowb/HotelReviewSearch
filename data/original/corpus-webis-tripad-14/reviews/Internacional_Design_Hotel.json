We were not disappointed with our choice. The hotel is in the historic part of the city and even though the building is old, the inside of the hotel is not. Matter of fact the hotel is quite trendy. Our room was extremely modern, comfortable and quiet. Our room had a balcony that overlooked the square and walking street. The staff was very friendly and helpful with helping us enjoy the sites. We suggest to take Tram # 28 to get a great view of all the different areas of the city. The location of the hotel also made it easy to walk the city. It is a 10-15 minute walk to the water. The metro is a block away and it is easy to get to other parts of the city. One day there was music and dancers in the square near our hotel which we enjoyed. The breakfast was delicious. You can order a hot breakfast and still enjoy all the bread, meat, cheeses, cereal, yogurt and desserts. No need for lunch after this breakfast.

They made sure I had everything I needed and really made my short stay completely hassle free as well as offering good advice on places to eat etc. The rooms themselves are themed, and I ended up in a Tribal room. I was initially a bit sceptical, as theme rooms can be badly done, but actually it was subtly decorated. Although not huge, the room was well designed and very comfortable. It had decent storage, a desk area, well equipped bathroom with powerful shower, comfy bed and free wifi. I thought minibar and room service prices looked reasonable too, compared to other hotels I've stayed in in Europe. The breakfast room was really beautiful - light, spacious and very sleek design. Breakfast was included in my room rate (which was just over 80 Euros, a good deal!) and had a great selection of savoury food, pastries, juices, fruit, yoghurt etc. It was very pleasant to look out over the square while enjoying breakfast.", "title": "Love love love!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WLondon77", "date": "May 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 64210724}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have just returned from 5 nights at the Internacional Design hotel which i booked soley on the positive reviews on trip Advisor.

We were on the Zen floor and our room, although hsmall, was perfectly adequate and had everything we needed. My only complaint was that there was no shelving in the bathroom and we ended up putting our things on the floor. our room faced the square at the front of teh hotel and after the first night we changed to a quiter room at the side of the building because I found the traffic noise kept me awake. There was no problem with us changing rooms, in fact, the hotel staff were always friendly and polite and spoke perfect English. Breakfast was included in our price and was excellent - plenty of choice, really good coffee (something many hotels can't seem to do well) and we really loved the mini custard tarts.
