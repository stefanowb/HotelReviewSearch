I was escorted to the day spa room; after about 10 minutes I commented to the masseuse on the volume of noise and clatter going on around the room, she agreed but offered no solution. After a further 10 minutes or so I said to her that it was difficult to relax with so much noise and would she please go and ask the people chatting, calling out to one another and clattering pots and pans around to quieten down. She did so and I heard her speaking to the people concerned however it made no difference whatsoever the noise continued unabaited.
