Our family of four stayed at Loch Lein just one night on our trip through Ireland. We arrived later than expected and were warmly greeted by Annette and quickly checked in to our rooms. We were tired from a long journey of driving through the beautiful Irish countryside and needed a quiet, restful night. The hospitality at Loch Lein could not have been better -- not only did they keep the restaurant open for us so that we could have a delicious dinner, Annette offered to get our laundry started and finished it before we turned in for the night. Amazing service with a smile. Beyond the warm hospitality the accommodations were immaculate and beautiful. Our entire family agreed that we would return to Ireland just to have another stay at Loch Lein.

We stayed solely on the trip advisor reviews, and it paid off. When we pulled up to the hotel, we arrived late after a drive from Waterford through the mountains of Macroom (which was also amazing) and Paul greeted us with open arms. He was genuinely interested in our trip and us. We were in Room 11, which was right over the entrance and was so picture perfect it is hard to describe. It was very large with a large bed, sitting area, and plenty of room for your luggage. The bathroom had a seperate tub and shower, which I loved. The room was spotless and really comfy and homey. Breakfast was also fantastic. You had a cold buffett and then could choose from a menu with eggs, waffles, etc. Everything was perfect. We hit the pubs in town, so cannot comment on dinner, but the dining room was also full, so it must be wonderful like everything else. We explored the Ring of Kerry on our second day and when we came back late again and the young gentlemen who meet us was also interested in our day and always offered tea or coffee upon arrival. Our room had 2 over sized dormer windows that overlooked a beautiful pasture and moutain range. It was so quiet and peaceful, we slept better than we ever have in any hotel ever before!

We arrived in Dublin and rented a car to drive the country! I did my research and booked two nights at Loch Lein. The reviews on TripAdvisor had been very good, but I wanted to see for myself. After driving all day, we found the house fairly easily. When we drove up, we were immediately greeted! We checked in and were extremely happy with the house itself, our room, and the staff. Everything was very clean and attended to. The room was spacious, clean, and cozy. The bathroom was nice and big with nice soap and lotion. On our first night, we were given a wonderful recommendation on where to go in Killarney. Paul recommended Murphy's, and we had a great time, and ended up staying a lot longer than we had planned! The next day, he helped us chart our course for the Ring of Kerry. He had wonderful tips, and it was a great drive (be sure to visit the Island....he can give you the details!) We decided to have drinks and dinner at the Loch Lein when we got home...and were SO glad we did! The food was absolutely amazing. From the salad, to the main course, to the dessert. One of the best meals I had in Ireland, and we had a lot of good ones. We had breakfast both mornings, and the food was equally amazing and Annette was a gracious, wonderful host. There is also a younger gentleman who works there and he was extremely helpful as well. We also stayed in Cork, Dublin, and Co Mayo (at the Ashford Castle), and my husband and I both agree that Loch Lein was by far our best experience!
