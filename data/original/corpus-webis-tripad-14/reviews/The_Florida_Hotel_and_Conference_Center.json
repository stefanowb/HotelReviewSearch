Considering the cold, windy weather, the parking was not very convenient; however, we were able to have free valet with our Priceline deal. The room, especially the bathroom, was clean. The bed was very comfortable. My only complaints are that the hallways seemed to not be heated and there was colder air blowing out the vents (this was a 30\u25cb weekend) and that there was no way to get extra bottles of water, sodas, or other snacks after 11pm. (No vending machines!) We ended up having to leave and find convenience store to tide us over until morning.

The lobby and public areas were extremely clean, the conference rooms were very nice and great service EVERY where in the hotel. We were given the option of foregoing room cleaning and get a $5.00 coupon to use a any of the restaurants or food shops in the hotel. For a 2 night stay, not getting the bed made was no big deal. The room had over 4 clean towels and staying in the room by myself was not a big deal. I make my bed anyway. The beds were great, what I had a major problem with were the pillows. They were firm and BIG. After the conference finished we went for happy hour at Crickets inside the hotel. The house wine was good and at 2 for 1 for $8.00 was not a bad deal. We had the taco chips and they were colorful and good. We were offered complimentary breakfast but it was rolls and danishes. We didn't care for it so the next morning we went to Marcelo's for breakfast. It was convenient and although it was $15, it was worth it. The lunches were complimentary to those of us participating the conference and the food offered was good and again the service and customer assistance was OUTSTANDING! Another good thing with the hotel is that it was connected to the Florida Mall, so there was a lot to do at night after the conference without the need of a car. The only downside is the temptation to shop although it's important to note: this is NOT an outlet mall. For the Premium Outlet Mall you need a car, but there was not time, so the mall was just a fine alternative. There is also a Starbucks inside the hotel and it was nice for the breaks. I don't know what type of deal the State got but I truly enjoyed the time there to the point that it felt like a mini-vacation although I was without my spouse. But it was good, I had fun with co-workers and was missed at home.
