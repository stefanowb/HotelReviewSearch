All rooms have ocean views and some have balconies and/or fireplaces. The hotel is 'green' and very serious about the environment. The 804 Trail goes right in front of the building; to the right is a long beach to walk on and to the left the trail goes all the way into Yachats, passing by the Adobe (where we often have dinner or drinks). We park our car and just walk everywhere. The Overleaf does not have a restaurant, but does include the best breakfast I have had anywhere--Bob's Red Mill hot cereal, delicious granola, yogurt, fruit, breads, and always two hot dishes. All of this is served on burl wood tables. The coffee is very good (unusual for many places). The staff are welcoming and the lobby comfortable. The hot tub on the third floor has the most wonderful view, and though located in the spa, is free.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Pamele_12", "date": "October 18, 2012", "id": 143125380}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing!", "text": "This place is amazing! The room is gorgeous, clean and the best bed I have ever slept on. The amenities in the room are top notch. The pantry has gourmet foods and Trader Joe's products.

One of the registration clerks was down right rude. The other registration clerk was very nice and helpful. The carpet was filthy, especially in the hallways. The edges of the carpet in the room was filthy. I would expect paying that price that attention to detail in cleaning would be of utmost importance. For a high end hotel and spa the bed was hard. I expected to have nice linens. What we did get was linens equal to a lower end chain hotel. We only stayed the one night. Both of our backs and necks were so sore from the uncomfortable bed that we cancelled the remainder of our weekend there.

My sister had stayed at this place in the past, and really wanted to return. I certainly intend to come back. My only criticisms: the mattresses were too soft, especially for a handicapped room. My sister had great difficulty transferring from her bed to the wheelchair and back. Also, I asked for some extra time at check-out on a Monday morning, because it takes longer for my sister to get ready, and the front desk staff readily agreed.
