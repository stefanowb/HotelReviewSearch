I found out later that its not the best area, but we never felt unsafe. In fact, we walked around qauite a bit. There was a lot of shopping and food choices within a short walk. I thought the rooms were very pretty. They beds were comfy, and the sheets felt crisp and clean. The bathroom was pretty standard, but clean and all the amenities we needed. Staff was helpful and friendly. We asked for more towels and they were brought to us within 10 minutes of asking. The pool area was nice, we didnt go in, but walked by and people seemed to be enjoying it. There seemed to be plenty of chairs by the pool, too. We liekd the gym. Felt up-to-date. it was clean, and cool inside.

For an extra $20/night we got an over-sized queen, which had a lot of extra space, but nothing useful in it (i.e., a huge entryway, but no furniture or a closet or anything else to do with it; a standard sized bathroom; a lot of empty space by the corner). Everything is nice and new. This is just two doors over from the Grand Hyatt (the Paramount Hotel is in between), two blocks from the Seattle Convention Center. Very nice 24h fitness center. A sort of mini-Starbucks for morning coffee & snacks. My only complaints: first, the LEED certification evidently left the hotel wanting to only include low-wattage lighting, and only desk or floor fixtures (no overhead lighting in the rooms). Overall, there was just not enough light in the room. Brighter (CFL) bulbs would help, so would some overhead lighting. My other complaint, which applies overall to Hyatt: please, get some better toiletries. In the world of business travel and TSA grope-fests, I try to travel without bringing my own shampoo etc. The Hyatt Portico brand is consistent with 2.5 star hotels, and they should do better. Enough whining for one review. This really is a very nice hotel, with some nice touches for their LEED certification.

We were supposed to stay two nights leading up to our Alaskan cruise honeymoon. Delta screwed up our whole flight arrangement (never had a good experience with Delta) and we ended up running from gate to gate at our transfers and arriving in Seattle after midnight. Since we did not call to tell them we were going to make it they cancelled our room for the night. HOWEVER, when I called they were already on it. They put my wife and I up at the Hyatt regency around the corner in a big suite at no charge! They asked us to come back to Hyatt at olive 8 the next day with an upgrade over the standard king room we reserved. When we showed up they put us in one of their largest suites at no extra charge! Also, they left us a bottle of champagne on ice, some chocolates, and vouchers for free room service breakfast the next morning (it was delicious)! We were floored. Everything was fantastic. The room was the largest suite we had ever been in, and it was beautiful. Very modern and hi tech! Every person we dealt with at the hotel seemed to know who we were and all about our earlier cancellation. They were all so friendly. To top it off, being the cheap guy I am I noticed they charged me at the non AAA rate I reserved. Being the cheap guy I am I brought it up and hey knocked off an extra 100 bucks instead of the 25 I was expecting. I have never experienced such fantastic service at a hotel! I'm not sure if the hotel reads these reviews, but if they do I'm so sorry for taking so long to write this up. You guys helped our honeymoon be an extremely memorable experience. Thank you so much!
